If like that they will split Hougang and Aljunied.,btohqsg
Those who want oppo  just want us to turn into like HK  and other many party country. Everyday fight in parliament. In the end who suffers.,btohqsg
then scrape the democratic portion in the national pledge,btohqsg
Keep believe many party is good  China is another example  Malaysia is another example. Seen like all love Malaysia politics.,btohqsg
I was told that the serial numbers are used post election to find out which blocks voted for which party. This is used to re-draw the electoral boundaries in the following elections.,btohqsg
Only Punggol  Hougang been opposition party for many year  why they don't split it as well.,btohqsg
Quick tell me why Hougang not split like Punggol.,btohqsg
Ya Ya  the name of the official  any proof?,btohqsg
It's possible that that is how they gerrymander  as we have no way to determine that is not the case. However  the traditional method of deciding which blocks to include based on demographics like average family size  property value  family income  age of family members  and potentially race is perfectly fine.,btohqsg
You can say that we are lying  but personally my conscience is clear,btohqsg
Who know your conscience is clear  only yourself.,btohqsg
Yes this is what they do   they wanna see how many voted for each Blk to segregate,btohqsg
Just like we cannot comfirm if yours is clear  along with the gerrymanders,btohqsg
Do what u know  we know what is going on can le,btohqsg
You thought I support Govt. So easy to lie.,btohqsg
The other opposition party are liars.,btohqsg
Does not matter   do u even think the g people don lie  is a fact that no matter who will still lie      Is human,btohqsg
At least we are still taken care of. Will other party care about us  or just for salary  or oppose for the sake of opposing.,btohqsg
I don't have to go hungry like other poor countries.,btohqsg
I did not say  mine is clear.,btohqsg
You are the one say your is clear. No one is clear staying behind a keyboard.,btohqsg
This is my real name. I don't say anything in public using my real name that I cannot stand behind.,btohqsg
Like to correct this statement. Serial number is ONLY used to account the number of vote slips printed and issued. Other than that serial number serves no other purpose.,btohqsg
Show IC with your name  then we believe.,btohqsg
So you implying all you just say are lying also. You are also human. Why Hougang not split?,btohqsg
No answer mean you are lying.,btohqsg
Ok. Lets say they are tracing and all. Anything happen to anyone cause they vote oppie or anyone win toto by voting for incumbent ?I tried both and life still went all fine. My appeals and applications to do with gov agencies and all still went thru. I am not under any investigation. My G50 clearance for those who know about it also was also successful.So whats the issue here?Why make a big hoo haa.If you like how life is go ahead vote   vote incumbent.If you want changes  go ahead vote opp. Your vote is your RIGHT.Do what you wish to do with it but just remember Singapore is not where it was back when we got independence.You cant expect different results without trying new methods.Change is the only constant.Also  Its not like aljunied dissappeared.Good day to all,btohqsg
Lying also know what going on.,btohqsg
Don ask people to show ic  is under pdpa  u should know better then that,btohqsg
Ya  change and we got AHTC saga.,btohqsg

You say so  mean you just say are not true.,btohqsg
Ya  change to PSP and SDP  we will have those saga as well.,btohqsg

Lie for what fuck  then why u dare to answer my question .  . You dare to say them lie about certain things. How I know whether they wana split anot as if I know.,btohqsg
I hope not...If not it will be so dull. I'm very curious to see how it pans out. Especially with regards to PSP.I don't really can't really tell where they are standing at besides having that mission statement and goal.IMHO  WP is more clear in where they stand in the left to right political spectrumBy yes  agree. LHL have not shown his best cards yet. Wondering what is under his sleeves. So far only announced 5 years upgrading plans for selected neighborhoods.By the way  you guys should go see PAP and WP websites man... Both designs are sooooo similar to each other. So confusing,btohqsg
Oh ya  hahaha why they look the same,btohqsg

Just got this from a Friend. Written by an 89 year old Pioneer Citizen  addressed to the Present PAP Cadres.Long Read  by Worth every Bit of timeChang Jiang Low:人民行動黨已經迷失了方向。。。。SG Must readKindly share it out to all andThanks to this 89 year old mother/citizen who took pains to summarise all these critical points as a letter to PAP Cadres and it may awaken the rest of the people of True facts and extremely The Online Citizen 2019-02-28 Lettersby Diana SharmaThis is an open letter to all People’s Action Party (PAP) cadres:  Please  please  please rethink why you enter politics and look at the direction that the current PAP is going.I sincerely believe that most Singaporeans who enter politics  regardless if they join the PAP or the opposition parties  do so with a pure heart to serve Singapore and her people.In fact  that was the reason why PAP was very popular in the 1960’s.  The pioneer batch of PAP politicians served Singapore with all their hearts and souls. They commanded the trust and respect of most Singaporeans.Today  all Singaporeans  especially the older generation  are grateful to PAP for leading and transforming Singapore from a third-world country in the 1960’s to a modern city-state in the 1990’s.Undeniably  PAP was not perfect and Lee Kuan Yew could be an absolute autocrat who inflicted extreme cruelty to any dissenting voices and political opponents.  However  no matter how one looked at it  we have to agree that PAP had indeed done an excellent job in bringing Singapore to where it is today.  We only need to look at our neighbouring countries:  Malaysia  Indonesia  Philippines  Vietnam  Thailand  etc  and compare the progress made over the same timeframe from 1960s to 1990s.Indeed  one of the reasons for the continued support for PAP during General Elections is the perception that they worked very hard to the interests of Singaporeans at the foremost and they are competent to bring about positive changes to lead the country forward.Unfortunately  the same can no longer be said over the past 20 over years from 1990s to today.  I personally feel that the hearts and souls of PAP are no longer with the common people to bring Singapore to new heights.PAP MPs are so far detached from the average Singaporean that they live in a separate world by themselves.The Current State of Affairs:Take  for example  of PAP ministers telling Singaporeans to buy into the Asset Enhancement Scheme for Housing Development Board (HDB) flats and promising that the value of HDB flats will never go down.After tens of thousands of Singaporeans used up all their life savings and Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies to buy HDB flats  they announced that all HDB flats will be returned to the government at zero costs at the end of the 99-year leases.In fact  some readers even commented that this is nothing more than an elaborate scheme to buy votes  since PAP had also openly stated that the HDB upgrading were prioritised by the PAP vote share.Interestingly  most  if not all  PAP MPs do not live in HDB flats and they do not need to return their HDB flats to the government at the end of the 99-year leases.PAP ministers pay themselves in excesses of $1 million while the entire economy is mis-managed with PMET unemployment hitting new highs.Instead of standing together with Singaporeans and giving them solid support to tide over the difficult times  PAP made life even more difficult by increasing GST  electricity prices  water prices  town council fees  transportation costs  ERPs  airport taxes  university fees  property taxes  parking charges  carbon taxes  sugar taxes  etc.,btohqsg
As if to add insults to injury  PAP MPs pay $365 for one whole year of parking  while demanding our teachers to pay for school parking. CPF monies pay-outs are automatically deferred to 70 years of age  even though it was supposed to help provide financial support for the retired.  And to top it off  they put the blame of economic mismanagement onto the common people and told them to pay more money to nurture skills in order to upgrade their skills so that graduates can become cooks and cab drivers.Education has become an elitism breeding ground for the PAP families.While PAP ministers openly claimed that “All schools are good schools”  it is a doubt as to whether anyone of them ever sent their children to neighbourhood schools.Finally  top school students are guaranteed places in Junior Colleges via the Integrated Programmes and Through-Trains Programmes  as well as concession points to enter affiliated Junior Colleges  whereas neighbourhood students are denied such opportunities.Basically  children from PAP families no longer compete with children from the average Singaporean families on the level-playing fields. Our education system serves more to separate the elitist family children from the common Singaporean children  rather than to provide basic education for all Singapore children.Accountabilities and transparencies are not even low – they are non-existent.  PAP MP spouses and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) paper generals are parachuted into high positions in governmental agencies whereby they will just move on to other high positions when they perform poorly.The list of failures and wastage includes Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) being sold to a foreign entity  Keppel corruption scandal  multiple MRT breakdowns  building the non-functioning National Stadium  multiple confidential data breaches in SingHealth  numerous deaths in SAF  near collapse of SPH  paying millions to Uber for a system when Uber intending to sell the business to Grab  overspending millions for the Youth Olympics and building a non-existent High-Speed Railway  and overspending billions to build Airport Terminal 5 (and increasing airport taxes so much so that airlines divert to other airports)  Tuas Mega-Port (with China building an even larger port in Malaysia).The only exception to moving on for poor performance is Ho Ching in Temasek Holdings. Ho Ching continued to draw high pay package (estimated to be more than $100 million annually) even when Temasek Holdings lost billions from multiple investments  including Bayer shares  Hyflux shares  toxic credit-related products during the Lehman Brother crisis  Thaksin’s Shin Cooperation shares and the Suzhou Industrial Project  etc.In fact  some readers speculated that this is the primary reason why CPF monies was withheld while taxes and utility fees rocketed sky high.  The President is supposed to serve as a check on the National Reserves and  in order to ensure no independent candidate can ever be elected as a President  the entry bar is now set so high that even the remaining handful of qualified independent candidates will rather enjoy their personal wealth than to risk getting into potential fallout with the government.In the meantime  an Indian is selected to be a Malay President in order to maintain racial harmony  whereas the issue of a Malay or Indian Prime Minister is conveniently brushed aside even though voiced by many Singaporeans.  Look at our National Budget!  There is no directionality or leadership to lead Singapore forward.  Instead  it is almost like a bribery whereby tax monies are dispersed to Singaporeans once every four years  just prior to the General Elections.Serve Singapore with Moral IntegrityAs a true-blue daughter of Singapore  I now call upon all PAP cadres to do self-reflection.  Search deep within yourself and ask yourself these questions. Is this how you want to serve Singapore? Is this the proper way to govern and lead the country?,btohqsg
Stand back and take a hard look at the current state of affairs. Is PAP really acting for the good of Singapore?  What has PAP done for Singapore over the past 10 years that has benefited Singapore as a whole?I think the answer is very obvious if you search within your heart. I beseech you to uphold your integrity and exercise moral courage.Stop being part of the PAP system. Leave the PAP system and start anew.  Join another political party. Or form a new political party to serve Singapore if you feel that all the opposition parties are not good enough to serve Singapore.  Remember that history will eventually reflect the current state of affairs.Do you seriously think that the Singapore Archives can be locked away forever?  If the PAP is so above board as it tries to portray itself  then it should declare to the public how much exactly are the PAP ministers and Ho Ching are being paid and open the Singapore Archives.  What is there to hide?You do not want to be identified as part of the PAP system when that happens and you do not want your own descendants to scorn at you in contempt.So leave this system now while you still can. Start afresh and really work to serve Singaporeans. Goh Chock Tong and Heng Swee Keat can take the lead. They can have some self-dignity and self-respect and they should stop working as seat warmers.If you choose to stay behind because of the huge pay checks  then stop lying to Singaporeans that you are stepping forward to serve the people. You are nothing more than a selfish elitist!VOTE THE ALTERNATE PARTIES FOR YOUR OWN FUTURE AND YOUR FAMILY,btohqsg

The talk show 黃世聰 say HO Ching is from China immigrate to Singapore  first lie. But wiki write born 27 March 1953 (age 67) Colony of Singapore  黃世聰 talking about it  This person is a liar and never do homework.2019年8月，台湾电视“财经名嘴”黄世聪在节目中声称“大陆人吃不起榨菜”，黄世聪是这么说的：大陆有只股票叫“涪陵榨菜”，品牌旗下的榨菜在大陆人心目中堪称“泡面搭档”。但黄世聪错把“涪陵”的“涪（fú）”读成了“péi”。 [1]  他表示：“大家如果知道的话，榨菜是他们中国大陆吃泡面的时候一定要加的。那这个业绩好的时候，表示中国大陆一般中下阶层他们是过着不错的日子，因为他们都吃泡面配榨菜，但是你知道吗？这个涪陵榨菜在最近一段时间股价大跌、业绩大坏！为什么业绩大坏？他们连榨菜都吃不起，所以这就是个非常大的警讯。” [1]  引发两岸网友群嘲。吃榨菜也被推向了继茶叶蛋之后的新的“炫富高度”。随后，A股上市公司涪陵榨菜寄送了榨菜给黄世聪，也有网友表示要给他邮寄。黄世聪2019年8月16日 [1-2]  发文表示已经收到了两箱榨菜，并说“想到如此贵重的礼物到手，心情无限激动”。他还说希望大家别像他一样念错字，多多了解中国大陆的风俗民情。 [2]  8月底，黄世聪因在节目里提到北斗卫星导航系统而再次登上热搜 [3]  ，吹捧大陆的北斗卫星系统范围大又精准，超越GPS成为霸主。You can see the comment in the video say all are lying.These clowns bring shame to Taiwan那么喜欢挖别人家来做炒作人生攻击，说的那么厉害，那去挖下你们国家的政治人物来炒作下记得再去炒作你们的契爷你们口缺德The talk show got people lying not the first time.

Could not find the video.PSP just released their manifesto and I find it very compelling. Less reliance on low wage foreign workers and more on for local business.My thoughts is that many local businesses and construction companies have become addicted to low wage foreign workers. This reduces the incentive to innovate their businesses. In the short term low wage workers will help defray much costs. But it is not good for the long run.Looking at China  you can see how much more way advance their businesses have become. The workers that stay in China are equipped with the skills and knowledge to use advance tools and equipment. While in Singapore  we are still so backwards. I have to,btohqsg
I have to admit  though the current government has tried to promote innovation  their is no real drive if we can just rely on low wage foreigners.Hence  I find the PSP's manifesto a step up and suited to my ideals for this country.,btohqsg
If they unite  will be more formidable. Now a bit...,btohqsg
Ruling party seems like a copy and paste from previous election with edit for Covid 19With regards to WP's manifesto  I don't like the idea of minimum wage. When the reliance of low wage foreign workers is removed  and business starts to rely more on innovation  the income of the local population will naturally increase. I believe if we have a artificial minimum wage  it will discourage businesses from hiring students for part time work. Part time work is good for the young as it teaches them the value of working hard for their money.,btohqsg
Just my 几毛钱 worth of thought,btohqsg
Dunno if minimum wage can also apply to part time work. But I feel if need implement  minimum wage should be based on biz scale among other factors.,btohqsg
It shouldn't be flat rate across all biz,btohqsg
And it also depends on the skill set the work requires.,btohqsg
So it's not easy to implement minimum wage,btohqsg
U need consider all factors affecting the implementation of minimum wage and the table of amounts.,btohqsg
The numbers have to be derived,btohqsg
I would propose wage system with more emphasis on low wages workers such as construction  janitors  etc. How do we increase value in their work? Is it just increasing the money formula or there can be other tangible benefits?,btohqsg
Then what do you think of this party that dont allow minimum wage to protect low wage workers  yet implement a system for themselves by pegging to the highest earners from the private sectors  isn't this a form of minimum wage that ensures one of the highest pay?,btohqsg
SDP requires Yuhua residents to help be assentors for Nomination day today.http://www.tremeritus.net/2020/06/29/sdp-urgent-calling-yuhua-for-assentors/,btohqsg
Then what’s the solution ? Do we want to pay more for the houses that we stay in??? I think hand to heart  if the cost of local ppleBuilt house is ten to 15 percent more  we will want to buy the foreign workers built house,btohqsg
Anyone from construction industry can comment? How much more will the end product cost if use local labour? Can technology eventually overcome this?,btohqsg
It is short term vs long term. Many case studies in the different industries have shown it is better to automate.Lesser human error as well.One example is the Chinese factory in USA  which is featured in American factory. If you watch till the end  you can see how the factory was gradually shifting from men to automation. It is better in terms of cost. In the end  it will help the consumer (assuming that it is not a monopoly business).Look at how tesla is making their cars as well. Upskill current workers  and automate mundane work. It will be more efficient.Just take a look at stock broking. How has automation helped the industry. It reduced the brokage fees for the normal folks out there.Of cause It will always be good to get a person's perspective from the construction industry that has innovated quite a bit.,btohqsg
I am opposed to minimum wage.I believe that wages have been artificially suppressed due to the availability of low wage foreign workers.When the demand is high and supply is low  the pay will naturally increase.Just look at how the pay for the Covid19 care takers went up to >$3000 overnight.Demand was high for them and supply was low. It was not like they needed a four year degree to get that type of pay.,btohqsg
As far as housing  I believe a very large part of the current cost is land cost  the labour cost is lesser,btohqsg
In Singapore this must be true:)),btohqsg
So I would think even if we use local labour for housing  it is not necessarily means a much higher housing cost,btohqsg
Yes true.Example a boss paying indian worker asalary with around 2.5k included levy.Compare to local 2.5k excluded cpf.Local take back around 2k+ under the hot sun and hard labour yet 2k+ not enough to survive in singapore.,btohqsg
incoming PM might lead team east coast,btohqsg
"Workers accommodation  transportation and medical all under employers also.Workers getting few hundreds to 1k plus per month can survive and send back to hometown to buy land  house etc.Locals have to pay and pay for everything and paying a 99lease HDB box for years.And after CPF deduction  ""which u can only see the amount on paper only""   left how much?How to compare.",btohqsg
Workers don't get 2.5k. Workers get few hundreds to 1k plus depends on OT.Levy doesn't goes to workers also.Levy  insurance  medical  dormitory  transportation paid by employers.,btohqsg
What do you expect from simple minded people. Like JKing.,btohqsg

Haha.. Very good observation.Their way of trying to tell others how they connect to the farmers. Next is to take photo while carrying a baby.PAP's SOP. No change at all. Sticking to old formula. Just like their just released manifesto. No change but just a tweak for Covid19.No mention of low wage foreign workers; hence I assume that they have not change their direction and will continue to increase Singapore's population by allowing more low wage foreign talents to come in. In evidently  boosting the supply of workers and lowering the wages of workers.,btohqsg

Opposition parties  have assumed that we are business as usual  politics as usual. Instead of coming up with concrete plans to help Singapore see through and to emerge stronger from this COVID-19 crisis -https://rojaknation.wordpress.com/2020/06/30/psp-we-deserve-better-but-not-you/,btohqsg
"""I never tease. If the voters feel teased  it's their own problem "" he said  adding that Mr Lee Hsien Yang  who is the brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong  will be involved in campaigning with the PSP.Tan Cheng Bock",btohqsg
Very biased  hit and run kind of article. Critizing others for lack of details when itself lacks details as well.The worse is labeling the party. Labeling is not objective.Article could have done better if it did a cross comparison between the parties' manifesto. That would had been much more beneficial to many.,btohqsg
By the way  you guys should watch the debate earlier this evening.I'm very surprised at how well WP and PAP did in the debate  especially the 2nd part. Both did their homework and were very very impressive.,btohqsg

Everyone can say anything and fake it.... end of day what is important is that Govt continue to be more vigilant on the kind of FTs  I think we want those very cheap ones cos Singaporeans can’t survive on that kind of wages ( a certain quota) and some very Tak Kong ones whose leadership really can take Singapore forward,btohqsg
We hve many of the normal ones   whose England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not very good  skills normal and hogging those 10k-25k positions,btohqsg
I think we should reduce those,btohqsg
As for the part about gg to Vietnam 🇻🇳  Myanmar  Philippines 🇵🇭.... then just go lor....if they feel pain there then maybe they willCome back,btohqsg
Anyway no Matter what  they must look at Singaporeans first and make sure that the Singaporean with comparable skills should not lose to an FT in terms of pay.... end of day  sporeans are here to stay,btohqsg
That time you go and disturb people before 7 am I don't want to reply.,btohqsg
What does this mean? Are they saying that certain people get the results before hand?,btohqsg
The people who count at the counting site will get the data from the counting site so they can report for the total to be calculated. The parties have at least 1 rep at each. Each counting site gets ballots from a group of polling sites  which is from a area of blocks and other housing. So parties will know how they did across a few dozen blocks  but nothing narrower than that,btohqsg
So far nobody from any party knocked on my door yet... 😂 maybe they feel the result already obvious.,btohqsg

Don't know it is true or not  cannot prove or confirm what he say.,btohqsg
To prevent a supermajority where they can change the constitution. And I thought you previously said you support WP?,btohqsg
I support them   but you say they lies.,btohqsg
Yes they have no target  but it's great that the test balloons got shot down,btohqsg
They did not say anything  it is the past Ex-HDB chief say one.,btohqsg
If u cite someone  u are considering the credibility or possibility,btohqsg
Not just ex hdb chief but also existing hdb chief dr cheong koon hean. That's why its understandable people themselves are confused,btohqsg
Then they should come out and say those are only the personal views and not the national views,btohqsg
But it was mentioned that the clarification already said in parliament earlier this year,btohqsg
They said those things not in private but in offical roles with the media reporting them saying as such,btohqsg
And ho ching herself shared those views by Liu thai kher,btohqsg
Ho ching is not even a politician.,btohqsg
She even share Taiwan and US.,btohqsg
Are you suffering with no food?,btohqsg
Real suffering is no food  no job and home.,btohqsg
Don't let people find out  you suffering  still can travel overseas.,btohqsg
You go india and other poor countries  you will know true suffering.,btohqsg
You vote in people like Trump  Mahathir and western politician. you will really let your future children suffer.,btohqsg
Their own government is because they vote in the wrong government  you want to follow their footstep.,btohqsg
At least way better than Trump and Mahathir.,btohqsg
We got no other resources to exploit other than manpower,btohqsg
Until you lose the good government  it will be too late. Like US,btohqsg
Another way of saying is if we don't exploit people  we cannot survive??,btohqsg
No one is expecting to change government completely. That's fear mongering tactics the PAP is making citizens afraid of saying that.Instead opposition is needed to keep PAP in check,btohqsg
Morning guys  anyone has friends with big dogs at least 20kg and below age of 6? Earl Grey suddenly has an unknown condition and needs to do blood transfusion.

It's very difficult to let people understand how gov works until one has lived in other countries,btohqsg

Like I say  it differs from one to another on the definition of care,btohqsg

Did I say I am sad?,btohqsg
Without our Govt  you think our currency can be so strong.,btohqsg
Lol again shows how dumb you are. Everyone knows pap will retain majority and power. Civil service and the government per se will not change. Having a stronger opposition will prevent a blank cheque,btohqsg
My view is this. PAP represents complete control  extreme power  ownself check ownself  full authoritarianism  minimum welfare  no compassion. Alternative parties represent check and balance  voice of the people  transparency and accountability  singaporeans first. Its up to the people what they want and which is better for the country,btohqsg
Every year audit report same same without any consequences,btohqsg
PAP will retain their supermajority this election. They are trying to scare us so that they don't have to fight so hard for their supermajority next election,btohqsg
Not only retain their supermajority  there is high possibility of a total wipeout with zero opposition  due to the flight to safety factor,btohqsg
PAP confirm win big lorThat’s why WP didn’t want to send best candidates to East Coast GRCSend all the best to defend aljunied. Just hold on for nowSupport them for thinking in the Long term for sinfapore,btohqsg
Where is the best place to rent honda jazz?,btohqsg
This is what I think everyone ought to be worried about. They could win all seats and wipeout.,btohqsg
We need to have a sheep farm,btohqsg

I actually think Opposition has a good of winning Sengkang  West Coast and Bukit Batok.In addition to retaining Hougang and Aljunied.,btohqsg
Very tough.... covid a lot of unemployment and job uncertainty. People will flock to safety,btohqsg

"There have been a lot of compliments abt JJLim from Worker’s Party.  He’s for LBGT/Gay rights & same sex marriage. This is not what we want in S’pore  right ?FYI on this new kid in the block politician -WP candidate Jamus Jerome Lim is an ordained minister of   Universal Life Church. He can solemnize marriage. The church advocates social justice  such as  same sex marriage.Please googled the church for the worrying facts!https://www.themonastery.org/aboutUs""We have made it our mission to actualize these tenets in the world by empowering millions of ministers  whether they come to us from a *Christian  Buddhist  Muslim  Jewish  Catholic  Shinto  Agnostic  Atheist  Pagan  Wiccan  or Druid tradition  to speak their own truth to power.* We work tirelessly to ensure that anyone can get ordained online at the ULC Monastery and we seek to fulfill the spiritual needs of as many different groups as we can by offering plenty of information  a wide variety of services  and networking opportunities. The communication and fellowship of our scattered millions of ministers  we believe  is just as valid a form of worship as the weekly services held in some of the world’s more segregated and elitist religious institutions.""His team member Raeesah Khan is also questionable.She regard herself as intersectional feminist.both Raeesah and Jamus are using words that pander to the mainstreaming of gender-ideology.He was an Ordained Minister at Universal Life Church from 2011.Universal Life Church:https://www.themonastery.org/aboutUs. The website says that they are ""proud of the work we’ve done and the victories we’ve won in areas like religious freedom and the legalization of same-sex marriage.""Universal Life Church provides online ordination of Muslims  Christians  Atheists and even Wiccan",btohqsg
Just got this from church friends not sure if true 😒,btohqsg
I thought PAP has LGBT rights advocate,btohqsg

Opposition is this time around endorsed by LKY son or whatever genes of his left behind,btohqsg
I think everyone should appreciate the risks those who sign up for the opposition endure. Cos you will forever have a target on your back. So anyone running for opposition has balls and put themselves at risk,btohqsg
Seems like someone maybe coming out to cry soon.,btohqsg
Every election is like thatEveryone one KPKB online and at CoffeeshopThen results is pap winHaihTotally give up LiaoAll the older generation pple keep voting pap,btohqsg
Yes. The one best trick for Singaporeans,btohqsg
Yes..election say our vote is secret ..in fact is disclose to them who we vote for,btohqsg
No lah  it’s really secretPap only knows the district of percentage of votes  not the individual votes.,btohqsg
Ya it's true they expecting a wipeout. After that can disband eld and elections altogether. Better for all sinkies since they don't like elections  voting or democracy,btohqsg
Older generation is loyalty. Younger ones is see who can meet their expectations.,btohqsg
Let just imagine if in/after the 10 July  PAP didn't get 51% or more votes! Will she still able to hold multi millions positions in ..... 🤨,btohqsg
This lady is so unlikeable and childish Facebooking all day!,btohqsg
This is not gd period  defend is the best choice of WP.  Pap also understand n let go the aljunied.,btohqsg

Met with Liu Thai Kher. Hmm why did they meet and what did they discuss. Deny 10 million population now only!!,btohqsg
Wah 4.30 am also post. You scroll up see got one post at 4.36 am,btohqsg
Now 7.30 am. What country you from?,btohqsg
How can you compare opposition voters to Leave voters? Trump etc comparisons are also inappropriate. Want to compare negatively also compare with Taiwan or Hong Kong democracy voters,btohqsg
Taiwan and Hong Kong are the Worst,btohqsg
Does anyone have part time nanny to recommend?,btohqsg
Singapore doesn't have amazingly affordable public healthcare either. The Taiwanese system has a slightly higher spending as a percentage of GDP  but they have a lower GDP per capita too.https://international.thenewslens.com/article/108032,btohqsg
This one I never want to see. You love it so much. You can move there and stay there and watch them do that all the time.,btohqsg
You can accept that other places have different ways of doing things while producing incredible results  like high quality and highly affordable healthcare.,btohqsg
Are you from Singapore or Singaporean?,btohqsg
What is the purpose of this question?,btohqsg
Hello what is the answer. Are you from Singapore or Singaporean?,btohqsg
Just because you ask a question doesn't mean I have to reply. You have no real name and seem to be a fake WP supporter. I should ask you this question,btohqsg
Can see that you are not from Singapore or Singaporean,btohqsg
Just because I don't type like someone on EDMW doesn't mean I'm not Singaporean  and just because you do doesn't mean you are. Having different political views from you doesn't make someone Singaporean or not either.,btohqsg
lol there's no debate. debate involves talking about issues at hand.,btohqsg
this is just one sore bum who can't discuss issues and engages in personal attacks,btohqsg
Singaporean or not make a great difference. Because there is foreign interference. If you are Singaporean  good  but not Singaporeans mean you are here to destroy us.,btohqsg
The Critical Spectator is also not Singaporean. Do you think he is here to destroy us?,btohqsg
He never say bad thing or denoucing about Singapore,btohqsg
Am I saying bad things about Singapore? Maybe I said that healthcare isn't very affordable. But for low income  don't you think even polyclinic isn't very affordable? 13.20 consultation isn't cheap,btohqsg
it's very worrying when even the slightest critcism against the government or policies at hand is skewed as treason,btohqsg
At the end of the day  choose someone who can represent your voices and walks the talk. It depends on who is contesting in your estate as well.Some really good candidates that I personally feel they walk the talk and should be given the votes in the constituency they are running for.Not promoting them but I have seen and heard what they have done for commoners.Jose Raymond - SPPNicole Seah - WPIswaran - PAPTan Cheng Bock - PSPIndranee - PAPIf you are in the constituency when DPM Heng swee keat is contesting up against Nicole Seah's party. There is no dilemma at all about electing a future PM in the making. Honestly speaking  do you even think he has the calibre to be a PM looking at his performance when he debate against the opposition? Someone who had stroke in the midst of a parliament meeting before - is he in the right health condition to be serving the nation and the people?,btohqsg
a vote for opposition gets you a free highly qualified PAP Grassroots advisor also !,btohqsg
Parliament Gridlock!Imagine the COVID-19 Bills couldn’t be passed for months!Those who need to receive help such as:$9000 (Self Employed who lost income)$1200 (for the needy)$100 (Top-up for elderly)$500 (Temporary Rescue Aid)$500 (Skills Future Top-up)$1400 (Skills upgrade Fund)$1000 (Courage Fund)And many more will not be able to receive help!The lower income earners will not be able to receive proper assistance because the politicians are enjoying debating and having fun in blocking one another while many globally are enjoying popcorns.If you are working hard and someone just come along and asked your manager to freeze you just to make you work harder  do you like it? Do you want Singapore to be in such an environment?Is this the country you want Singapore to be? A country where jokers are being elected ? Just because you want freedom? It is not about you and I  it about the whole community!Vote for those who are really helping!Vote for those who are walking the grounds!Vote for those who can see the bigger picture!,btohqsg
Not all oppositions are clowns though. There are really good calibre oppositions that needs to be voted in to really keep PAP in check. PSP is formed for that reason that Tan Cheng Bock feels that he needs to be there to counter some of PAP's decision although that was his former party.A man who came close from behind losing at the Presidential election to Tony. Someone who has his own views in running a country compared to most president who are just puppets to the parliament listening to PAP without having their own opinions.,btohqsg
PAP will undoubtedly form majority in government  this is pretty much certain,btohqsg
so there will be no stonewalling of bills or proposals,btohqsg
but with a stronger oppositions several issues and blind spots can be better discussed,btohqsg
Yes. We are not saying opposition is gonna win majority. But i am expecting PAP to still hold 51% votes or more and opposition parties may win more seats this time round compared to 2011 GE,btohqsg
If you work very hard and did very well  your manager because want you to do better  dont reward you and send people to monitor you to do even better  do you like it.  If your client or business partners dont appreciate your hard work  and grumble at you to make you do better  will you do better?  Karma goes around,btohqsg
DOnt be sway by the loped sided logic,btohqsg
the flaw in your logic and analogy here  is PAP will be rewarded no matter what. it's question of keeping in power in check,btohqsg
In this election the most risky thing is the high possibility of a total wipeout of alternative voices  a parliament with only pap  no other voice  no debates  only all yes men  this will be really bad for our country. The only way to prevent this from happening is to vote for alternative parties.,btohqsg
What a joke. Then ask them how they spend our money... we need opp in to check the way they force their 1 way ideas like gst n cpf n stuff. Not when everyone is standing together during covid. During covid got opp say dnt wear mask or object gov safely measures? Pls think.,btohqsg
Hahaha. The money belongs to taxpayers so is only rightful they use the reserves to help singaporeans.,btohqsg
Their pay comes from taxpayers as well. They should be getting a big paycut to help rebuild our reserves and not raising gst to build reserves.,btohqsg
The payouts this years is not sufficient to even cover the gst 9% in years to come..,btohqsg
Bullshit. Even if all the contesting opposition wins  Pap will still be able to push thru as the number of seat won by opposition will not be enough to block. Stop fearmongering la.,btohqsg
Other countries can have collaboration between political parties and come out fine  but it seems we are so scared of that. WP doesn't vote against the PAP 100% of the time hor.Our unemployment scheme isn't world leading by any means  and there's a still a lot of means testing. Some countries also have unemployment insurance  so it's an adjustment to the policy versus inventing new ones in a rush  which the civil service had to do.https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/how-the-uk-furlough-scheme-compares-with-other-countries,btohqsg
If all opposition win doesn’t it mean that pap totally out?,btohqsg
Since opposition contesting in all grc?,btohqsg
Actually the big three contesting in 56 seats. More than enough to form government.I agree that a change in govt is unlikely  but freak events do happen.,btohqsg
PAP will retain their supermajority to change the constitution as they wise even in the best case scenario for the opposition.If the vote share where you live is no longer so overwhelmingly PAP  the backbenchers will be pressured to quit their day job and become full time MPs  and cover for the ministers in their GRC so MPS doesn't take hours to meet an MP.,btohqsg
so many years never see freak events before. don't fear mongering.,btohqsg
Assuming the opposition wins in all seats  must they form a colliation among themselves? The smallest party can align with PAP right?,btohqsg
Then the parties should come out and make their stand clear. Will they form coalition with Pappy or not?,btohqsg
So many years also dont have something as serious as COVID.,btohqsg
I think just vote WP. The rest of the opposition dont bother la,btohqsg
Then at least we will have some quality opposition in parliament.,btohqsg
What's the point of asking a question that can only happen at least 5 years later? We have less than 4 days before cooling off day on Thursday  and there's still a lot of uncovered ground to talk about. Reserved presidency and AHTC ruling are just two things that come to mind.We'll have to see in the future whether PAP is willing to work in a coalition in the first place!,btohqsg
I dunno if any of the oppo will form coalition with pap lor. They spend so long whacking pap then suddenly friends?,btohqsg
If like that then their party might as well go bang wall now lol. No principle,btohqsg
Let Dr Ye explain what is quantum anion energy and how it can help your life naturally healthy!https://www.facebook.com/gekho.sg/videos/305489627241424/?vh=e&d=n,btohqsg
They dun even want to take part in the Chinese debate,btohqsg
Bad  but PAP can still bring it up in the next few days what,btohqsg
would it be better to send a candidate who can't even match OYKs borderline Chinese standard and embarrass themselves on the primetime viewing hour like the other parties? SDP said they were notified of debates only at 2.08pm the day before the debate. When do you think WP and PAP would have been informed?Being able to deliver speeches in mandarin in Parliament and being able to respond on demand in a TV studio is two different things after all.,btohqsg
Dare not try is dare not try lor,btohqsg
And want to be workers party ah??? Want to wear blue to represent blue collar??? And dun want yo accept a challenge??,btohqsg
Anyway it’s not a universal debate... it’s just about some policies,btohqsg
If it’s some new small party I can understand but this is the WP that we are talking about,btohqsg

Leadership renewal is hard lah. LTK was second gen  rising from the ashes after JBJ. Pritam's age can tank at least another 20 years  and so can the new candidates. The 2020 WP slate is like 2011 to me. But I understand how the Chinese ed might feel,btohqsg

It's easy to understand now why Lim Tean was a highly renowned Cambridge educated lawyer,btohqsg
anyone went through a muslim divorce before? can share the procedures?,btohqsg
Wow... That is not a good look for them,btohqsg
Next election should have even odd system. Even number serial number pap  odd serial number lamp post opposition,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarification.As much I think WP has many good candidates  mud slinging from any sides is degrading to the person who threw the mud.How can anyone expect to change someone's mind through mud slinging? It only reveals one's true character.Just hope the person who cut that video will be apprehended for trying to instill unrest through deception.,btohqsg
Lim Tean wants to make a lot of money when PV is successful.His friend n supporter will be at the centre of it.,btohqsg
Please explain how he can make a lot of money from this? Sounds like a ridiculous accusation,btohqsg
What video? Care to quote the exact lines which backs up what you say - on how he's going to make money from this?,btohqsg
If you are unable to quote and back up your ridiculous assertion then you're just a lying liar,btohqsg
Haha another complicit lying liar who is unable to back up falsehoods resorting to asking people to shut up,btohqsg
"For the record it should be made clear under a correction order that this is a falsehood said by ""Seetoh Yew"" 😅",btohqsg
hahahahahahaha shut up lah u JAHAHAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I have seen a number of LimTean videos and he come across as one of the more caring and credible alternative members. So I dont believe this accusation.,btohqsg
Lol the author of the article doesn't even reveal her name or face like in most credible blogs or sources. The author has only 3 articles and 7 followers. And you sharing this garbage?,btohqsg
Exactly he has more to lose actually. Lim tean is a Cambridge educated lawyer who did well in his profession. If he wanted to make money he could have just continued doing that,btohqsg
SHUT UP and Vote for JOTUN!,btohqsg
I sense a few heart attacks coming up. U pple need to chill lolz,btohqsg
JOTUN apologize. It’s time to move on,btohqsg
Thot he was sued for 100 odd thousand?,btohqsg
In 1985 after National Service  Lim went to England to study Law at theUniversity of Reading. He was conferred aLLBin 1988 and resided in London as a qualified barrister at the Middle Temple.[13]He was called to theBar of England and Walesin 1989. He further studied a Master of Law (LLM) degree at theUniversity of Cambridge Gonville and Cauis College. Lim remained in Cambridge from1989-1990.After being conferred his LLM  Lim returned to Singapore and was recruited by the noted law firmDrew & NapierLLC in 1990. He was admitted to the Singapore Bar in June 1991. At Drew and Napier  Lim became the pupil ofSteven Chong  who became the SingaporeanAttorney-Generalfrom2012-2014. Lim joinedRajah & Tann SingaporeLLP on 2 January 1998 and became its Head of the Admiralty & Shipping department in 2000. In 2007  Lim rose to an equity partner in Rajah and Tann  joining the ranks of such noted alumni asVK Rajah  Steven Chong andSundaresh Menon.,btohqsg
Okie.... impressive indeed.... and sorry btw the case was last year and seems like it’s a misunderstanding,btohqsg
just say three time I divorce you,btohqsg
I heard is it true ?,btohqsg
Anyway did u ever seen a Dr in Singapore who is poor! 😂😂,btohqsg
Dunno if I one day become Dr I tell u lor,btohqsg
got la  there's one kena bankrupt last time no?,btohqsg
Dr  lawyer  accountant who is under bankruptcy is not a professional anymore and I don't think they can renew their practicing licenses! So what are u talking about any person who is under bankruptcy still can call themselves a Dr? 😂,btohqsg
I don't think u know the Singapore professional practicing regulations  else can u name any doctor is still practicing while still undischarged from bankruptcy!,btohqsg
I don't think you mentioned anything about practicing here,btohqsg
We mention Dr and not those who are bankruptcy and not a Dr anymore... Even GE 2020 candidates also can't be a undischarged bankruptcy person in sg !,btohqsg
Hey guys   how are you? 😊👋,btohqsg
If she did things like Jolovan Wham of course she won't kena deep deep like him. She is well connected enough and can afford to hire Senior Counsel  or team of SC  or request Queens Counsel from UK to come in.  She's being humble in acknowledging hard truths,btohqsg

They will not let him delay forever. 70 must take liao  no matter what.,btohqsg

How come our government dont wanna clarify this misunderstanding earlier? Even Ho Ching is under the wrong impression lor.,btohqsg
If government really reduce them  then lesser tax collected. This is the hard truth.,btohqsg
My view  I dont think is misunderstanding  I think they intentionally leave it grey  after all they have the track record of keeping many things grey and secret from the citizens  we no need to know and no need to think.,btohqsg
I do not have the stats how much tax is contributed by foreigners so....,btohqsg

So guys I'm not sure if it's true. But I heard like foreign workers who work in companies w medical benefits get full coverage to private hospital facilities. Even my NTUCincome preferred income shield also don't cover that much 🥺,btohqsg
This is why i dun understand why pple wan to be mp...got money cannot spend...got power need to be humble..walk on the street let pple scold. And still they continue,btohqsg
They want to be the MP for the ridiculous high salary while pretending to care about people,btohqsg
It's true what. Why when the hospital they go to is reported in the news it's always Raffles Hospital? But then the problem is send to private doctor get short MC  go govt doctor then get proper  long MChttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/doctors-seek-clearer-rules-mcs-foreign-workers,btohqsg
Ok liddat I also want become foreign worker ah HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA second class citizens so sad 🥺,btohqsg
If all go govt hospital wouldnt the queue be even longer? Why need to overwhelm the public hospital just to prove a point?,btohqsg
Because the bosses got agreement with the private doctors to avoid giving long MC to affect the incident KPI. Work injury resulting in hopitalisation of more than 24 hours or more than 3 days MC  consecutive or not  must report to MOM. Give light duty instead of MC is the easiest way to siamThis doctor working at Raffles Hospital gave 2 day MC and 1 month light duty when the standard is 2 week MC. One week later worker got pain  go CGH get 2 weeks. Doctor at Raffles followup after that give 2 months. Total after CGH is 9 weekshttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/landmark-ruling-against-doctor-ngos-say-inadequate-mcs-migrant-workers-still-problem,btohqsg
Lolz u one year sick how many times sia...hospital ur 2nd home?,btohqsg
Oh ya hor....it will affect their billboard right? Those displayin how many days without incident thing,btohqsg
So ur saying the bosses worked with pte hospital docs to give light duty as much as possible?,btohqsg
I think best is dun be so sick lah,btohqsg
Sick too long your boss sure ask u to walk home one,btohqsg
Haha so opposition not aiming for the money? Or u say they will donate all?,btohqsg
Not sure bout the $$$$ but I do noe that when I watch the parliaments live debates at least they r active not like a lot of pap ministers where they just agree with constituents,btohqsg
Being of the “Y” gen I hope that at least our 4G ministers choose to make a difference since they have been running for elections but it seems like all they do is sit back n shake LEg n collect $$$ from our tax,btohqsg
I know of a lot of ppl that say things like Tan Cheng bock is alrdy so old n y does he still wanna run for office? Is it coz of $$$$ ? At his age he should b enjoying his golden years ...... I think the more impt qn to me is WHY did the parliament change the rules for the presidency election  when they noe that he wanna contest for it? Is there sth they wanna hide?,btohqsg
Oh yea. That remind me. Did we ask Dr Tan why he wan to run for presidency in the first place?,btohqsg
I think he must have felt that the Govt have some short comings so after 26 years with then decided to quit and set up his own shop,btohqsg
Then the question is does he need 26 years to find out?,btohqsg
I thought would be easier to ask him compare to the gov. Gov got standard answers liao,btohqsg
Or maybe he was asked to step down due to party renewal so good chance to set upOwn shop,btohqsg
One of the things he said when he open psp is that pap lost it way along the time,btohqsg
I think he mentioned it many times on YouTube.Personally  I think  at his age  from his residence  and him being a previous pap mp  he would had had earned quite a modest sum of money. Hence  I think it is not for the money and more of his passion,btohqsg
But i think he didnt say that when he ran presidency,btohqsg
I think most pap mp will give that description.,btohqsg
U guys not tired abt the salary part ah? Lolz,btohqsg
Cos few tens of thousands is common to them,btohqsg
Its also getting bit boring le,btohqsg
Dude.. Go watch the videos. Google youtube PSP. I think it is best if you do your own research. That is the best way to learn.,btohqsg
It’s teh opposition always say this one mah,btohqsg
Actually no leh...opposition dun harp on this le,btohqsg
They harp more on...should mp be full time or part time,btohqsg
Always is CPF  HDB expensive  no pension for old pple   minister make a lot  !7 makeSo little,btohqsg
Depends on which party.Different party focus on different things.,btohqsg
Yah but always this few issues lor,btohqsg
To be fair   PAP is not perfect and opposition quality really getting better,btohqsg
Lolz. I dun see a fair in ur sentence,btohqsg
If they do.  They need to be ready to form gov leh,btohqsg
They should form a division regardless of which oppies to collect people's feedback and then organize them to voice out in parliament,btohqsg
Document those feedback from people. Help those in need in the process,btohqsg
Can collect feedback via social media too.,btohqsg
Can call it people's channel and resources,btohqsg
My “fair”Is that If opposition win more wards  not surprising,btohqsg
And of course they are not,btohqsg
This year like lightning thanks to PAP  jump here jump there. Earlier got attack Murali for being part-time MP never take care of estate  now y'all seem to have forgotten too!,btohqsg
You guys know any reliable workshop can repair this dent? Just knock a bit can le,btohqsg
He already said he will put residents interests first in today news.,btohqsg
He's senior counsel and partner at Rajah and Tann. How to put residents first? At least take a sabbatical for Covid-19 lah!,btohqsg

No wonder this lady go around and hope amk grc don't lose  so no one can go Parliament to object and audit their ac....,btohqsg
Who is she??? She is not HC if this is what it’s suggesting,btohqsg
Go Google to search for temasek holding chair person photo!!,btohqsg
I think this is not her,btohqsg
I thought there was a police report filed against him for making such a remark about non Chinese pm recently?,btohqsg
I don't think OPPO should unite. Each party has their own ways of doing things.. Most are for sg good but methods differ from party to party,btohqsg
HC did go on a walkabout a few days ago  not sure if same location and date. Saw this video beforehttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-age-no-issue-pap-youngest-new-candidate-nadia-samdin-12900810,btohqsg
TCB already starting to unite already. Visit Pasir Ris Desmond Lim yesterday visit Paul Tambyah today,btohqsg

Wa Lao it’s really her??? I thot only party members?,btohqsg
Haiz I have always thot she was not a party member...:: or in this case “volunteer “?,btohqsg
When u happen to see her in amk pls ask her where is our usd24b,btohqsg
Yes and not yours! LOL hahaha... U must be non Singaporean that is why not yours!,btohqsg
Dun want lah... I nit shareholder Nor director Nor creditor,btohqsg
Never forget. Make no mistake  its an implicit stamp of approval from Ho Ching,btohqsg
And u are also not Singaporean... Hahaha LOL,btohqsg
Non SG feel not funny . Strongly agreed with u!,btohqsg
Hmmm. Personally  I think it is an uphill task. Some of the parties are way to left. Some are more central. There needs to be quite a huge compromise. Even if there is a compromise  I wonder if the parties can stay united if there is more than one head.,btohqsg
The shareholder is Min of Finance  I not on theBoard and they owe me money,btohqsg
Want to talk CockOk but dun say I not Sporean lah ok:)),btohqsg
Personally I don't see no wrong in her distributing the flyers. She is supporting her husband and she shows she is willing to do the ground work.It is good publicity.Personally  it also shows that the incumbent is not taking things lightly this time round as well.,btohqsg
I never quote it wrong... Just wonder LOL! Maybe to u usd24b is peanuts!,btohqsg
It’s peanuts wat. You worry so much for wat?,btohqsg
Non Singaporean eat a lot of peanuts esp.... in the z......,btohqsg
That would be my dream... I don't mind if to me it is just a plate chicken rice. Haha..,btohqsg
Wah ur chicken rice one plate cost USD24b...😂 Must be one of her favorite pets...,btohqsg
Actually....if u guys ask taman jurong residents. The DPM wife has been conducting house visit n doin grassroots stuff for dunno how many years liao.,btohqsg
Past liao. Its was live on facebook,btohqsg
Anyone got corsair water cooler  can spare me AM4-AMD bracket?,btohqsg

ELD is under PM Lee also fyi. So decide for yourself after PAP's gutter politics the last week!,btohqsg
Guys is this real or fake news? Any info?,btohqsg
All Members of ParliamentIncludes the WP MPsGet $16K per month,btohqsg
Ministers with portfolio gets moreBecause they have to pay for their own food when they go overseas,btohqsg
If they want better seats and rooms  they have to pay for themselves,btohqsg
Banks CEO gets millions per year,btohqsg
In addition  George Yeo got around $xxk as a ministerWhen he got voted out  he earn Millions in private,btohqsg
Yes as in fake? Or yes as in real news?,btohqsg
Thats only true for some Ministers. Was talking about TPL here.Also not accurate to say because AFTER they left government they earned more hence justifying their current salary.Simply because they gain value in their profile being a minister establishing social network amd standing among elites.Most ex SAF officers for example those that get parachuted in  its really difficult to justify say their knowledge in SAF into banking or transport,btohqsg
I want to know too  can someone reply to this?,btohqsg
TPL was earning alot before she entered politics.  She was working in MNC and in a high position.,btohqsg
Oh I saw StateTimesThe author is Alex TanHe is staying in Australia nowSending half-truthsHe thinks Australia is much better than Singapore.Maybe should show the link and can try to verify the link,btohqsg
dont trust anyone.  check the facts for yourself.  some websites are fake.  Have you been maligned by others before?  Have anyone said any fake news about you before?,btohqsg
Which mnc and how much? Was it more than 15k?,btohqsg
She is a psychology graduate who was working as a senior associate in Ernst and Young.Why in the world would Ernst need a psych grad?Anyways its nowhere near 15k and you know it. Stop spreading falsehoods here,btohqsg
you meant WP candidates are all earning $16k per month before they enter the parliament?,btohqsg
Lol who's taking about WP candidates here. We were talking about TPL right?Got caught in a lie much?,btohqsg
Fyi WP manifesto and members have been against high MP salaries from way before,btohqsg
End of the day get more opposition inside parliament is enough.,btohqsg
Heard rumours that Singapore could go back to Phase 1 of the post-circuit breaker period after#GE2020? There are no active plans to do so  MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak says. ➡️https://cna.asia/2ACHsSN,btohqsg

I don't understand PAP hardcore supporters especially those who are not doing well to begin with,btohqsg
Siao pap has been kind to me,btohqsg
A stepping stone to join GLC. One can possibly earn more than 16k a month.,btohqsg
U doned GRC to earn money,btohqsg
U tink our basic salary is our income???,btohqsg
The main reason they give is:we have to be thankful to PAP becos of they made Singapore to what is today.But those were different people and now's a different time.Everything has changed.Its barely a country and more like a global hub,btohqsg
Vote PAP ah! Give us so much money le. Opposition neber give me a single cent wor!,btohqsg
I am so righteousOhh look at me im so wise,btohqsg
"""look at me I stand for righteousness fight pap!!!""",btohqsg

Really honestWhy fight papJust vote themWill opposition be any better???,btohqsg
If the opposition winI jus jump suit,btohqsg
Pap is ur lord n saviour,btohqsg
If u lik to accept pap into ur lifeI shall lead u to a prayer:Pap forgive me for my trespasses and lead me not into oppositionDeliver me from other politic and worship u forever in pap name we prayAPAP,btohqsg
Come say the prayer with me,btohqsg
