Esso 20% only ah? Caltex 22% wor,btohqsg
What's the rationale behind this? Just pure harassment to the debtor?,btohqsg
Not correct by llm and other platforms too,btohqsg

Base on this. Might as well not opt. Scam,btohqsg

Hello sifus  this still legit ? Cause I see remarks must deliverImmediatelyPooling - pick up in 2 hours  deliver within 4 hrsRegular - pick up ASAP  deliver within  50 mins.,btohqsg
If can tell  teach me how to identify pls,btohqsg
All this ah long Chao ah quah one... Trick ppl to harass for them...,btohqsg
Act tough but all chao sissies,btohqsg
Ya I m curious too..cos I always see ppl comment here about ah long jobs....I hv taken a few cash jobs but thankfully are genuine jobs.. I guess it's really at our own risk....,btohqsg
I just stick to LLM posters recommendations.. especially if it's those pooling jobs who requested for immediate delivery  just show them the poster,btohqsg
"Very hard to tell. The first sign is only communicate thru whatsapp call (typically +60). But that is if you swipe to take  then you call to see.I almost kena. From Boat Quay at 11pm. Say take documents. Makes me wonder what docs are there to take from a pub at 11pm. The number also +60. Then I asked ""Take docs at 11pm from a pub?. Are u sure??"" Then he put down the phone.Then the style they speak also very Ah Beng kind. Im not saying all Ah Beng cash order is Ah long arh ü§£ü§£. But this is the tell tale signs",btohqsg
This kind dun use SG no. I think scared police will track if make report,btohqsg
See +60 xxxccccxxxxx or other then +65  straight cancel. Dun waste time,btohqsg
Now cancel also problem. Must wait for half and hour before resume order. I think best to avoid cash order.,btohqsg
Or take another order first before you cancel,btohqsg
This Ah Long really give so much problem. Not only LLM. People order from carousell also kena üòë,btohqsg
If Confirmed u want to cancel then just wait till u get new other then cancel. Let scammer wait loh. Rmbr to screenshot new order.,btohqsg
I really pity those ppl who kena scam by this Ah Long. Got 1 LLM rider kena. Instructions was to go to sender house and take all the black shoes. Once done. They block,btohqsg
And police not doing anything about it?,btohqsg
I really want to report police but someone here mentioned before police cannot do anything also,btohqsg
At most police come to the house and take statement üëÆ. Too many on the loose already,btohqsg
I got one legit case. Previous Tenant borrow ah long. Then Landlord of that previous Tenant sold the house. Unfortunately Tenant never change add. Ah long come and haunt the house with the new owner. Die lah like tat,btohqsg
For me  usually after 9pm. I don‚Äôt take cash orders. To avoid all this troublesome issues. Since it‚Äôs is truly very difficult to tell which is legitimate and which are scam orders. üòÖ,btohqsg
LLM should just follow GE  no cash payment allowed,btohqsg
What to do... LLM treat customer no 1. That's why our order now also $0.50 per 1KM üòÅ,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I stick to G or Tada. But Tada not taking in any more new drivers. I only open LLM during festive periods or whole day heavy rain  just to stack. ü§≠,btohqsg
Yeah gotta admit LLM rates are good during festive esp CNY. The last 2 weeks of pre CNY also I never do other platform. Only LLM ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Nxt one will prob be mothers day,btohqsg
Still a long way to go,btohqsg
Did someone do the charity ?,btohqsg
didn‚Äôt notice   but if someone dare to book like this most likely someone did charity for him before,btohqsg
I bet there will be people who accept,btohqsg
Anyone know what this surcharge is about? Didn't see it listed in the price breakdown of the job,btohqsg
Don't know la... Not listed in the order... How to tell if the surcharge goes to LLM or to drivers,btohqsg
