im q curious abt the pure phy moderation tho,btohqsg
Amath distinction rate is quite high,btohqsg

My friend left 25% of the paper blank,btohqsg
70 got b3  90 a2  94 a1,btohqsg
but of course  since its estimated scores  it may not be 100% accurate,btohqsg
lmao my friend left like 50% of the pure geog ppr to ans the other 50% accurately,btohqsg
But did this year do better or worse than last? Anyone know?,btohqsg
The people who commented there disagree,btohqsg

No one said anyth so I just repost here Haha,btohqsg
That what i am trying to say. If u know how it works then good. But dk how its works better with drawing of graph.,btohqsg
This year passing rate increase but average L1R5 decrease right? That's what I heard,btohqsg
Then also no desmos. How to do sia?,btohqsg
No one calculates the avg L1R5,btohqsg
Most people said their school average L1R5 increase,btohqsg
My paper 1 went to hell,btohqsg
if students say that u wont know,btohqsg
cos when they go for o lvl meeting,btohqsg
they will flash the L1R5 of every single secondary school,btohqsg

Part (iii) scare me the most.,btohqsg
supposedly when i saw their l1r5 last yr  its still quite high,btohqsg
We all know the equation of the line is y=mx+c,btohqsg
