Our stars was 4 days after our finals lmao,btohqsg
I love being a soloist when it comes to experiments/presentations,btohqsg
The position is always hard to find,btohqsg
wait do yall know the experiments you have for y3 alr,btohqsg
Also walao he go overseas bojio,btohqsg
Compuslroy exp i know is 3d prpinting uh,btohqsg
idk if thereâ€™s compulsory ones anymore,btohqsg
All i heard is do not take digital holography,btohqsg
like itâ€™s a lot of laser alignment,btohqsg
but the results are p sick,btohqsg
As dumb as it sounds I dont mind doing that eh hahhaha,btohqsg
E9 which is the one iâ€™m trying to TA for,btohqsg
if they didnâ€™t change it you can literally just download the software on your computer and do the entire experiment at home,btohqsg
E3 maybe can do at home too but not sure,btohqsg
E2 is p cool bc you use like the laser cutter i think,btohqsg
Idk why i excited for lab,btohqsg
Im excited to never do lab anymore,btohqsg
E1 is cool if you dk how to do 3D modelling and wanna learn,btohqsg
Biophysics mod component not lab meh?,btohqsg
On the schedule its only a 50 mins block,btohqsg
What can you do in 50 mins,btohqsg
I think e1 was last sem compuslroy one,btohqsg
AIYA SHLD HAVE ASK XIUYING OMG,btohqsg
btw only thing about the monte carlo one E9 right,btohqsg
is the software fr looks like itâ€™s from windows xp era,btohqsg
Cus she was in spms jn,btohqsg
means you no do offerings to bell curve gods.,btohqsg
it was compulsory for me too,btohqsg
I dont mind having 90s nostalgia,btohqsg
I need to feel young again,btohqsg
why this sounds like PVT Simulation for Semiconductor modelling lol,btohqsg
I just got back pain from a 15 mins car ride,btohqsg
Short doesn't mean he not young,btohqsg
Short means he is less affected by gravity,btohqsg
Reasons why i CANNOT take driving license,btohqsg
Reasons why i had to get my license when i was younger,btohqsg
this is a screenshot of the software,btohqsg
Same like the xray compton scattering machine hahaha,btohqsg
but it's a p braindead experiment la,btohqsg
I feel like monte carlo is interesting tho,btohqsg
damn pSpice. what course requires you to run PSpice lol,btohqsg
I mean. I am taking stats mod after all lmak,btohqsg
year 3 lab just tries to introduce these different software to them,btohqsg
should have gave an option to disable background. RIP,btohqsg
it is open for all Engineering courses or Science related courses?,btohqsg
Tbh i kinda wished yr 3 phy lab was sem 1 and sem 2,btohqsg
nah it's a physics major course,btohqsg
ohhh  I can comment and mention pSpice is definitely useless ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
i think the most useful thing from that mod for me was learning how to 3D model,btohqsg
I rather do y3s1 twice than do 2 labs in y3,btohqsg
