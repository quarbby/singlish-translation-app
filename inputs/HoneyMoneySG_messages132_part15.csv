Earliest is on late evening on 30 September or 01 Oct around midnight time.  With interest rate drop  don‚Äôt hope too much this round. TBill n FD are all drop. üìâ,btohqsg
Can prob park money in those saving account doesn't require salary first like Maribank or gxs. Then wait for a few months to get UOB cc.,btohqsg
for a non-excel method: just transfer out 2x your salary amount on the next day  then transfer in your salary amount on the following day. This will maintain your MAB as per before your salary came in.,btohqsg
Hi  I have received this sms without any other email notification. Does this mean that my giro for HSBC EGA to pay CC bill is successfully setup?,btohqsg
"Yes but check ur dbs statement always. It only takes effect when ur dbs statement has a line ""amount will be paid via giro.""",btohqsg
Sometimes giro setup was done but it was after the system capturing giro status.,btohqsg
So to be safe this month's dbs Cc bill should be paid manually since there's no such line for now?,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for the information ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
hey guys just to hop on this.. for CC bills  i get that we need to go to the CC's bank to get a GIRO form (hardcopy?) and submit it to HSBC?for insurance premiums  may i ask how does that work? does the insurer give a form for us to submit to HSBC too?intend to sign up for EGA once i settle my insurance plans..!,btohqsg
For cc bank  can download online  print  fill in then submit.,btohqsg
You will receive this even if fail. So check the letter when it comes.,btohqsg
For Insurance it depends on the insurance company.  For Prudential and Great eastern  you can do it at their respective portalPrudential -https://ipay.prudential.com.sg/Great Eastern -https://uip.greateasternlife.com/econnect-new/#/loginYou may ask your insurance agent or email them for instructions.,btohqsg
I received this message 3-4 days but all failed.,btohqsg
regarding HSBC Live+  for the mechanic spending $600 per month  per quarter.is there any benefit spending $800 to $1000 range for 1/3 of a quarter?for example in this current quarter.$650 in July$630 in August$800+ in September,btohqsg
you get more cashback up to the quarter cap,btohqsg
For basic needs it ok to prepay but dun overspend for the cashback.,btohqsg
i see  cos it's kinda difficult to juggle both UOB One Visa/Account and HSBC Live+ 3/3 month spendingi thought of just target the July to Sept quarter for HSBC Live+  then go back to UOB One Visa and HSBC Revolution for eligible online spending.,btohqsg
wil you be able to hit both 600 on hsbc live + and uob one 500  consistently for a quarter?,btohqsg
i could  but $1100 per month  consistently until end of year abit challenging,btohqsg
then i suggest u stick to either uob one or hsbc live+ depending on ur spending. HSBC revo can absorb ur online spend,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany inside news what the conversion ratio for this is,btohqsg
UserD.‚Äãhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:prioritize Chris own content first,btohqsg
DBS yuu conversion is not out yet. We gotta wait and see,btohqsg
sorry never see Chris post on yuu and miles so I forward that,btohqsg
what is the quarter cap for HSBC Live+? $1800 or $3125?,btohqsg
If I know  I cannot tell you. If I don't know  then I cannot answer you. The thing is  I didn't even post it  you have to go to the right person,btohqsg
$3125 is the max for the quarter till 31 Dec 2024 when 3% bonus cash back is on.$600 x3 is min spend to get the cash back for the quarter.,btohqsg
250$ max cash back for a quarter. It is equivalent of 3 125$ spend at promo rate 8% or 5 000$ spend at ususal 5%.,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone used the UOB KF credit card? How long did thru credit to your KF account in your experience?,btohqsg
Miles in a month will get credited early next month. Ranging 3rd-6th.,btohqsg
Read online it can also be as long as a year?!,btohqsg
1.2mpd will get the following month?,btohqsg
I got 1 more trick to hit minimum spend require target credit cardJust go trip  Agoda or any travel booking websiteBook hotel 1 year later with free cancellationAfter you get your welcome gift usually  within 6 month  then go cancel your booking,btohqsg
The gift won‚Äôt be forfeited ?,btohqsg
If you get physical item  how come bank ask you to return back?,btohqsg
If you use Mastercard on Agoda  bank will makan you DCC both ways. And sgd is strong right night. One year later you may get less due to exchange rate.,btohqsg
They can charge you the usual price onto your card or take from your bank account. They can terminate their relationship with you.,btohqsg
Not just terminate  but ban üôÖ,btohqsg
When they terminate relationship it's a ban. It's the same thing.,btohqsg
SingTel and Netflix recurring put CRMC auto deduction can right?,btohqsg
Morning all..Any idea for uob signature card . The capped is refresh on calendar or statement month,btohqsg
UOB visa signature refreshes on statement month.,btohqsg
sadly or fortunately see how u view it..there is no guarantee HSBC will extend the 8% cashback beyond 31st December 2024.,btohqsg
Hey guys the new dbs altitude give 5 mpd  does it make sense to apply that card to buy tickets instead of using uob ladies?,btohqsg
pretty good esp if you are new to dbs. 5mpd is better than 4mpd and 2k cap vs 1k cap. Unless you have UOB lady sol  dbs Altitude is an easy choice imo,btohqsg
5mpd better and can stack with the cashback promo on DBS paylah app,btohqsg
Btw is there any difference of American express and signature version of it?,btohqsg
AMEX one can‚Äôt use at 7-11,btohqsg
7-11 can use yuu card lol,btohqsg
You go try using AMEX at 7-11? ü§≠,btohqsg
