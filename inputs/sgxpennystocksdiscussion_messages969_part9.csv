Hmm actually stocks only <20% of my networth  I don't dare put too much money in the market. I mostly in property and traded endowment policies 😂,btohqsg
So I'm definitely not the master anyone is looking for,btohqsg

I'll be brutally honest  most of these stocks will probably never recover unless a pandemic like covid19 strike again  but whether it gonna be covid 29 or 59 nobody knows. Cut some if u need to cash for other purpose else medtec  Sri thang are still decent business generating profits no point in cutting at it's lowest. The rest I'm not too sure though I took a small cut loss on vicplas as well,btohqsg
