They’ll probably tell u some information that can easily be googled  and try to upsell u a more expensive course towards the end of the lesson,btohqsg
Ever been to one of those free talks just to see what’s actually happening. Surprised that some people actually believe them and put up $500++ for such a course,btohqsg
Or perhaps they are part of the same team  and they act like they are buying into the course so more people would folloe suit,btohqsg
Can’t believe anyone paying money to attend itEven if it free I won’t bother to attend too,btohqsg

I’ll disagree with this. Courses are not magical get-rich-quick but the information and schedule helps a lot. I spent $2k on a course and I started a small biz which got incorporated after 1 year and revenue is now $2m in my 3rd yearThe course fee is well worth it,btohqsg
Perhaps who the speaker is also matters. The course i attended was from syakir hussein  when i googled him  it seemed really sketchy,btohqsg
$500 is damn cheap. What’s $500 when u can do so much afterwards. Not only did I spent $2.8k on online courses and started my biz  I sponsored my bro abt $6k worth of courses....His biz is now doing $5m last quarter,btohqsg
But then again  to find a good speaker is really hard,btohqsg
No matter how good a person is  sure got haters ba.I won’t reveal who I learnt from (I spent both on local and American courses) but I know for sure got plenty of bad reviews on them,btohqsg
Nowadays even my friends ask me to teach them  I’ll share basic but told them if they want to be serious just pay for a proper one and get started.They asked me are the courses good  I’ll just show them my amazon or qoo10 screenshot,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter which guru as Long as u joined and take action after learning.Course is easy to learn but taking action afterward is hard,btohqsg
Agreed  If people don't put in effort in learning  and have a mindset   keep complaining  this lecturer no good  waste time and money. No matter how good the course  it is useless.,btohqsg

im susprised that more than half of participants who paid good money to attend courses  don't do anything afterwards...singaporeans love to attend courses! lol,btohqsg
vote pap out and you wont have such issues,btohqsg
Someone will then invite you to drink kopi.,btohqsg
Lol. Can also lim tea. Lol.,btohqsg
Post lockdown phase 2 will have. Lol.,btohqsg
The last time i saw a vid on fb. The Minister said theres no halal food on board ships. Tats y cant have muslim sailors,btohqsg
Haha. We better change this topic. The walls have ears. Lol.,btohqsg
Minister said smtg along higher operating costs,btohqsg
Nope. Maybe there are. Idk of any thou.,btohqsg
Maybe u shld write in to hong lim park organisers where they do free speech. Then req to do online free speech perhaps? Idk.,btohqsg
Racism in sg.  Hmmm personally i dont tink its tat big of an issue. Maybe theres subtle tension. But noting major. As compared to other countries. But i tink most malays here are too chilled out to tink about racism haha.,btohqsg
want to run the last lap of another 10years working somewhere  different everything.  now like no life.,btohqsg
excuses  all the food onboard are already done onshore  not as if they keep live animals on ship to slaughter,btohqsg
so the excuses of not allowing malays to join navy is bullshit,btohqsg
Look so convincing. Its Amazon. Thinking of getting some passive income,btohqsg
2 guys from different company kind of have same speech n format of presentation.,btohqsg
Can try  selling at amazon not bad  but just be mindful if u aim for US buyers with their current situation.,btohqsg
This is a very funny post.... who would know??,btohqsg
USA amazon market currently damn big volume,btohqsg
On 16 Feb 2015  straits timesPublished an interview with Dr Ng E H  among other things  he said the navy does employ sailors as saf found a way to go round the halal food issue,btohqsg
everyone knows chinese if never eat pork in their entire life willdie one,btohqsg
Does not make sense if there are non Chinese sailors.,btohqsg
I am saying SAF does hire MuslimSailors according to Dr Ng,btohqsg
he can say anything he wants  and there are no way to prove it,btohqsg
He needs to prove it meh??,btohqsg
just because he said so? nice,btohqsg
He is Singapore 🇸🇬 defence minister lei.... need to lie about having Muslim sailors???,btohqsg
Defence Minister: There is no Muslim officer in Navy because I cannot please all requests,btohqsg
When queried by Opposition MP Faisal Manap why there is not a single Muslim officer in the Navy  Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said that he cannot please all requests. The Defence Minister side-stepped the question and said he is not able to accommodate all requests.,btohqsg
