"Wow  I just looked at the old English O level syllabus from 2013 and I prefer the compo topics from then than the new syllabus topics""News.""""How can people live healthier lives?""verus""Parents often believe that it is better to be safe than sorry. Do you consider young people to be too protected?""""Describe some of your experiences in food courts and hawker centres. How important are these places in your life as a teenager in Singapore?""""The way we dress reveals who we are."" What are your views?""The new syllabus topics are so specific and I find it so hard to write essays on them because of that",btohqsg
idk i took na eng and i always write personal recount lol,btohqsg
Yeah that's what my teacher says too  but I struggle with personal recount because I have to come up with something fake,btohqsg
i only write discursive if it's easy,btohqsg
At least for argumentative I can write facts and get marks,btohqsg

how did you guys plan out your essays? I'm seeing here mind maps or bullet points  bullet points seem to take a lot of time for little benefit,btohqsg
also how long do you guys plan/write for Os (~1 hour exam),btohqsg
for me its just finding important pointers then arranging before writing,btohqsg
40 mins to plan? But the exam is 1 hour 50 lol,btohqsg
I'm told I have the language command but lack the confidence  it'd really suck if I can clearly write but can't show it during the exam,btohqsg
and make sure it made sense,btohqsg
I tried just winging it but I really didn't like what came out and neither did my teachers,btohqsg
I wrote about 250 words in 20 mins,btohqsg
Maybe because I'm not used to writing with pen and paper? I think I'm really eloquent when I'm typing,btohqsg
I did that once and after writing i realised it made no sense,btohqsg
i will slap them virtually if they try to be funny,btohqsg
