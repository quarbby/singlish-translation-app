üéâPika World Daily Review ‚Äì 5 Jan 2023üéâüìäFOMC Minutes On the Goüí∏The Fed is determined to raise interest rates further to fight inflation despite signs that prices are moderating in the economy. The FOMC members are also aware that loosening any financial condition in the market would derail their goal towards a 2% inflation target.There is a unanimous stance of no rate cut in 2023 despite investors hoping for some reprieve in rate hike to support the equity market. It dashed away any hopes of a pre-mature easing  and economic data has to show more evidence of sustained improvement in the downward trajectory of prices.In this view  Pika World remains cautious about long positions but accumulates for long-term ones.üìÆWhat are the dishes for the day?üìñIt will be a critical day for the market. Pika World believes today's data may help to finally provide the market with more direction after ranging for weeks.At 9.15 pm  we will have the ADP Nonfarm Employment change. Again  we expect 150K  up from 127K in the prior period.Initial Jobless Claims will arrive at 9.30 pm and should remain stable at 225K.Many related data  such as the S&P Global Composite PMI data for Dec and Service PMI data for Dec  will also arrive. They should point to sustained contraction  a reflection of an economy in a recession.We will have FOMC member Bostic speaking at 10.20 pm  and he could again provide consistent hawkish comments  and markets will keenly zoom into the details of various FOMC members' speeches.It is 5 Jan  Thursday  at 8.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 pm in New York. While the US market is on a downward trajectory  the Chinese and Hong Kong markets are on a red bull sentiment  and Pika World is accumulating and  at times  trading the sector given a more robust showing. China could once again help become the world's growth engine in a dull economic environment.Stay tuned for our next update!,btohqsg

Lee Keng Weng Levin  Who?Did some digging and he is director ofAce Peak Capital Group Pte Ltd.Ace Peak Capital Pte Ltd  is a Singapore incorporated company  which is principally a private equity investment company  advising on strategic investments and operational activities.Mr Lee was previously the fund manager of Sino Pacific Capital Limited  a Hong Kong registered company  managing a private equity fund with assets under management of US$100 million  investing mainly in equities in Malaysia  Singapore  Thailand and Hong Kong.Seems like they roped in an investor with Private equity links and fund raising expertise to buy into Acrometa through this rights issues. Anyways  with him in  raising more funds for future growth will not be an issue. Hence  quite a nice fit actually.Source:https://acepeak.com.sg/about-us/,btohqsg

Since Medicals in play this period  just zoomed in onto IX BioPharma recent target üéØ price $0.25 report (re-rated from $0.355)Here‚Äôs catch  the deal with Seelos. Refer below üëá1 Wafermine: treatment of CRPS‚Ä¢ In the licensing agreement with Seelos in November 2021  iX Biopharma received US$4.7mn in cash and 2.57mn in Seelos shares. Around 0.3mn Seelos shares were paid as fees.‚Ä¢ The company was granted US FDA orphan designation for CRPS  a rare disorder. Following the out-licensing to Seelos  Seelos is planning to begin Phase 2 trials for CRPS in 2QFY23. Seelos has designated the drug as SLS-003. It is expected that Seelos will have market exclusivity of seven years from regulatory approval of the drug.‚Ä¢ Seelos will make payments up to US$239mn upon the achievement of certain development and sales milestones together with royalties on future sales. All costs including development and registration of the product will be borne by Seelos.Source:https://sgx.i3investor.com/servlets/ptres/15789.jsp,btohqsg
"Past 2021 news on Seelos-IX BioPharma deal for easy reference.This will be the deal to totally change IX BioPharma situation as the pharmaceutical company will also be eligible for up to US$239 million in development and sales milestone payments.Moreover  iX Biopharma will receive ""double-digit"" percentage royalties on future net sales of any products which incorporate the R- and S- enantiomers of ketamine using its WaferiX technology.About time to watch this one closely since the trials are said to be 2nd Quarter 2023. If all comes to plan  IX price will start its recovery and it‚Äôs could be fast.Now I understand why POEMS rate it $0.355 initially and then $0.25 now.Investors who can hold can really consider this one .DYODDSource:https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/ix-biopharma-hands-seelos-exclusive-rights-lead-drug-wafermine",btohqsg

üéâPika World Daily Review ‚Äì 6 Jan 2023üéâüìäRosy job data sparked fear againüí∏The robust job data we received on Thursday spooked intense fear among investors as the Fed is probably prepared to continue its rate hike to cool the labour market. Market participants predict a 0.25% to 0.5% rate hike in the next FOMC in February. Investors must see if hiring is slowing quickly enough for the Fed to feel comfortable.ü•ÉAll eyes on today‚Äôs job reportüéØThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will be reporting the employment condition. At 9.30 pm  we will have the Nonfarm Payrolls. We are expecting it to cool drastically to 200K from 263K.  The unemployment rate should remain around 3.7%  similar to the prior period.It is crucial for us to get a weak labour report so that the Fed can slow down its rate hike to dampen the labour market. But  on the other hand  any rosy readings will spark the animal spirit of the markets to collapse  as fear is always around the corner.üìÆWhat are the dishes for the day?üìñBeyond the job report  the Factory order for MoM comparison for Nov will be released  and we expect a decline of 0.8% compared to a growth of 1.0% in prior periods. We expect it to release at 11 pm.ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI is also expected to be released at 11 pm  and we can see a slower expansion at 55.0 compared to 56.5.It is 6 Jan  Friday  at 8.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 pm in New York. Some of our old stonks counter as BBBY had collapsed after possible bankruptcy news. However  the general Chinese and Hong Kong market is holding well  and today‚Äôs economic data might be the catalyst for the equity market to break out of its ranging mode.Let‚Äôs hope for a splendid first week of trading.,btohqsg
