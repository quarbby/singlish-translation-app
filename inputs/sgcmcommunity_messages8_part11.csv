Old VW beetles generally are over-engineered while remaining simple. Can't say the same for modern cars (all modern cars actually),btohqsg
i have been in a beetle before. sitting in the rear seat. it is hot. not comfotable at all.,btohqsg
it is becaise engine is located at the back. and the rear seat is close to the engine. thatis why,btohqsg
Early Porsche 911 would face the same issue  with worst seat behind. hahah.But the actual reason why they switched from 993 air cooled   to watercooled 996 is due to emissions.,btohqsg
Not sure about the standard beetles  but I am happy with mine with front MacPherson struts springs :D,btohqsg
