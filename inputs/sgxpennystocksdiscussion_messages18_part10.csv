Can‚Äôt understand the euphoria in VicplasClearly majority who boughtSee Pm to be posted on Instagram and prixe start to move. Don‚Äôt care what  just the next COVID theme and chase. Made good money along the wayWorse if late to the party now carrying baby and asking why and howIn search of reasons to hold because is too painful to cutOr rather the fear of cutting At low is the key reason for not cutting. Cannot stomach so much loss because is never prepared for it.All the talks about take care of downside and let the upside take care of itself. People do oppositeLook at upside and let downside take care of u instead,btohqsg
Biolidics is a better bet than Vicplas. At least they own the rights and productVicplas is manufacturer who has no IP and minimal bargaining powerThe hype about arrow. Loss making and in distress if not at times like this people will sell dirt cheap? Sellers also not dumbNot expected to contribute to results this year. They got 3 months factored into results but to no availTurnaround is not guaranteed as well tooAnd piping is a cash burn just how much.,btohqsg
Any idea will VP go up 0.42,btohqsg
Prehaps if we think with a clear head. -VP is a high risk ‚Äú investment‚Äù in the first place. A few cents penny stocks which was speculated to as high as 0.74 without a great earnings report. If it drop to 0.2X  it‚Äôs a possibility bcoz it‚Äôs still triple the price of pre-pandemic. So insisting on your faith of holding it out is consider a higher risk gamble. If it goes your way should BB decide to reverse their plan to up the price again  it‚Äôs purely bcoz of wat they wan & not wat the company result is worth.,btohqsg
Go there u won‚Äôt cut la u prob buy somemore since it so called hit support 345 and rebound. Going back 70!!!,btohqsg
MT is also a penny stocks starting as low as 0.03 pre-pandemic. But 100X profit in its last report does add significant value to its shares. If we feel the company has established itself greatly & the cmin 1-2 years results will be as good  investing your faith in it is more worth the ‚Äúgamble.,btohqsg
