WTI crude futures were trading above the $87 per barrel mark on Thursday as prospects of tight global supplies continued to lendoptimism to bulls. OPEC and its allies  including Russia  agreed to cut production by 2 million barrels per day in November  the most significant curb since the start of the pandemic  while speculation grows that the oil cartel will further intervene in markets to shore up prices. A looming European Union ban on Russian crude also exacerbated concerns about tight supplies. On top of that  official data showed that US crude inventories unexpectedly fell by 1.7 million barrels last week. Keeping a lid on prices in the short term was the US decision to sell 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Still  SPR levels in the US also dropped by 3.6 million barrels to just over 405 million  the lowest since May 1984.,btohqsg
