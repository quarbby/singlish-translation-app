Woa. Yours? Why u no censor number plate?,btohqsg
I saw a nice car I took photo,btohqsg
If he meets his gf let his wife knows how?,btohqsg
Or tell his wife he goes somewhere else,btohqsg
Or that picture maybe taken long ago how?,btohqsg
If he never tell his wife he gg JB how ??? He sure ‚ÄúÂì≠‚Äù no tears,btohqsg
aiyo dont fight luh haha next time will be nice to cover people plate when take photo bah üôÇ,btohqsg
Sgcarmart encourages covering plate when posting car for sale also!,btohqsg
And he is a winner of SGCM award,btohqsg
nice car. who is selling this,btohqsg
i think it's your car. you can come up with such story so well... ü§≠,btohqsg
or maybe its just basic courtesy to cover ppl plate up so that they can have their privacyüòäüòä,btohqsg
Any opinion on what is considered high mileage?,btohqsg
depends on the car as well,btohqsg
but for a regular average car 16 to 18k+ getting into the higher territory already,btohqsg
but what matters is total mileage and number of owners as the per year mileage is probably not constant,btohqsg
I did 320k in 5 years on my first car. Now doing about 35k each year but friends tell me my mileage is high,btohqsg
uhh its okay  i 1 year 40k. what matters most is you keep up with your maint,btohqsg
what car are you driving? intrigued to know what's lasted you 320k,btohqsg
It's like half of what I was driving,btohqsg
depends on how you maintain and drive honestly and what is the reputation of the car's engine. I would consider anything above 20k a year to be high in Singapore but I know people who consider 12k+ to be high also,btohqsg
Yeah.. Was young and enjoyed driving. Drove to phuket twice,btohqsg
good  means car is serving you wellüëçüëç,btohqsg
and if it has lasted this long without any major issues  just expected part replacements and maintenance  that means you take care of it well too!,btohqsg
I remember once my wife was telling me about pasar malam in cck. Then I told her sg pasar malam not good to Jalan. We drove to petaling one hr later,btohqsg
I changed a lot of parts.,btohqsg
most modern cars  if well maintained the engine can last a long time,btohqsg
Now cannot. Drive 1.5 hr buay tahan,btohqsg
Toyota derived engines usually highest rated in this case,btohqsg
Actually chery I think is very underrated for the brand. The engine is very rugged. Rough but tough,btohqsg
Toyota engines have lasted well over 400k kms in many cases! good engines,btohqsg
Biggest part I changed was the oil tank  leaking. Otherwise all wearable parts,btohqsg
Quite a few of the Chery engines are based on toyota engines as well,btohqsg
The one I had I think was Austria engine  not Toyota,btohqsg
Nice! Still have the car or moved onto something different already?,btohqsg
Moved on  that was 15 years ago,btohqsg
So back to original question  35k is acceptable right?,btohqsg
just depends on your own view honestly,btohqsg
for resale purposes  it might not look the best but if the car is well maintained and you find the right buyer  why not,btohqsg
I personally hit around 19 to 22k only,btohqsg
I mean some buy cars to keep mileage low for resale but personally I feel if I do it this way  I'm not doing my car justiceüòÇ,btohqsg
I mean I don't buy for the purpose of selling. Not sure if i make sense,btohqsg
I bought my current coe car at 70k  now at 240k,btohqsg
Anyway coe car has no value so I just enjoy driving it,btohqsg
driving is a pleasure for me,btohqsg
35k a year is considered high. but it is well worth the use. high mileague aint matter if car is well maintained and parts are changed when due.,btohqsg
for my 1990 car which i purchased in 2004  i am still using original exhaust. old stuff lasts along time. no leaks no rusts. amazing long lasting old bmw,btohqsg
let's drive to chiangmai and tibet,btohqsg
Very unsure whether this is spam or not. What do you all think?,btohqsg
totally. i buy a car to drive to enjoy. i dont care much about resale or popular opinion.,btohqsg
