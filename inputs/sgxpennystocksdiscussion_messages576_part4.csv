Interestingly IX BioPharma had a decent volume play up right before the halt.This are Likely insiders buying on probably leaked news.Anyways  I have lost many rounds playing this counter  but perhaps a strong run could bring some good sentiments to other same tier counters  most notably Asian Healthcare and Hyphens Pharma  which are bottomed out now and in illiquid stage.I guess the above depends on whether IX can continue the run 🏃‍♂️.Perhaps  watchlist the others and wait for the volume to pour in first.DYODD,btohqsg
