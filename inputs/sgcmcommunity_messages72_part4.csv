Just need to scroll a bit,btohqsg
only if u do it repeatedly,btohqsg
a 1 time braking  stock brakes will be the same,btohqsg
either way u will lock up w shitty tyres,btohqsg
the thing tht matter is tyres,btohqsg
tyres is what touches the road,btohqsg
Ecu very unlikely but cant be ruled out. Wheel speed sensors are not expensive and can breakdown due to age,btohqsg
Wheel hubs can sometimes be damaged due to pot holes or whatever  but still relatively cheap fix,btohqsg
Vw cars have a bad rep for the abs module,btohqsg
i am suspect abs module too,btohqsg
But a deep scan at a workshop should be able to give better overview,btohqsg
Parts if want cheaper can buy from stockists but not everywhere allows bring your own parts.,btohqsg
only one way to find out,btohqsg
the brake is already strong enough to grip the caliper,btohqsg
True but the tyre maybe could take more brake pressure without locking?,btohqsg
when u experience brake fade the brake and caliper will slip,btohqsg
it is helpful tht bbk improve brake modulation,btohqsg
I on stock brakes but not something im willing to try lol,btohqsg
but if we are speaking without driver error or human error side  theoratically its the same,btohqsg
4pot usually still 2 equal pistons,btohqsg
If 4 and single large piston maybe no effect braking distance,btohqsg
Most bbks don't improve braking outright bur at high temps will be better with lesser brake fade,btohqsg
But yes many people put in a bbk and feel the difference  usually placebo,btohqsg
Need a jack and a few tools,btohqsg
^ because after changing need to check functionality too,btohqsg
U can also get a obd reader yourself,btohqsg
For that  normal obd reader won't do it I think  need the VAG specific full software,btohqsg
Get a bluetooth obd2 adapter and a reader app for vw,btohqsg
Yupp  will be useful to diagnose faults and clear codes,btohqsg
Can also unlock features at times,btohqsg
Im out of vw scene for a long time  i dont know what apps anymore,btohqsg
But not sure what to get,btohqsg
I think car scanner is pretty inclusive,btohqsg
unless u got tools to reset the ecu etc,btohqsg
Shopee  ebay have. Cheap one maybe $10 or less. But may not be compatible with the app. Expensvie one maybe 60 to 80,btohqsg
Elm327 obd2 reader. With bluetooth or wifi.,btohqsg
Preferably Bluetooth  more apps using Bluetooth now,btohqsg
Find a free one that u like or able to scan. Then purchase if necessary,btohqsg
"Check out ""Car Scanner ELM OBD2""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ovz.carscanner",btohqsg
This is a good free one,btohqsg
I use this! Very good stuff,btohqsg
Sounds like you had the same issue before on your m3 sir? Yeah my guess would be the same too. Does sound like speed sensing related.  Iâ€™m guessing speed sensor troubleshoot (for godâ€™s sake donâ€™t let the workshop tell you troubleshoot means change ALL FOUR immediately but really find out which one failed. Switch sides to test). If still have  then I suspect wheel bearing le.,btohqsg
Early morning already come out one paragraph,btohqsg
Tell you donâ€™t party so much already,btohqsg
Yesterday someone open their car door and hit my car,btohqsg
Not horrible lah but got abit dent and paint chip,btohqsg
Then what did you say to the person?,btohqsg
I scheduled for coating already sia cries,btohqsg
Can still cost mah. Rest of car still benefits,btohqsg
I think maybe I was in a great mood so i forgive but never forget ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–,btohqsg
