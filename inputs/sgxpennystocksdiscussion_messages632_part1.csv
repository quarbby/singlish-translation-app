I lazy follow liao... Will wait one month first,btohqsg
I fried no one want to eat  maybe no standard. Only steam and boil water they eat,btohqsg
Some vege I blend it to make soup or juice,btohqsg
This one I ok. I also no choice type. Health previously got problem.,btohqsg
Not really  I have a friend who was diagnosed with serious diabetes a mth ago. He followed my diet. Think he is very happy these few days  his taste buds came back to life,btohqsg
What healthy diet? Suitable for everyone? Can share?,btohqsg
If u see me now  u won't believe I am a diabetic. Just that now I reversed my diabetes. It has no cure but if u detect it early and want to change lifestyle  u can become like normal person without medication. I am a good example. So now all the friends who have diabetes will come to me.,btohqsg
I only take carbs whenever I need. If I run marathon or half marathon  I will then load carbo. If run only 10km  I will only eat a bit carb. If I decided to stay in the gym for 2hrs doing weight  I will also eat se carb.,btohqsg
I did OMAD when I need to as well. One meal a day,btohqsg
You still running marathon  must be rather young,btohqsg
The problem is  human storage for carbs  at max is abt 100g. But the storage for fat is actually limitless. But carbs  is a fuel that once you take  you need to take smart  either u take it in the morning or u take it before or after exercise. Normal time I won't. If take in morning  take those low GI stuffs,btohqsg
I 45 years old already. I picked up running when I was having diabetes. Now I no symptom at all but doctor still classified me as a diabetic.,btohqsg
Last time in financial market  picked up a lot of bad habits and lifestyle. Every week sure got KTV and drinking sessions. Go dinner and anyhow eat. So body literally broke down,btohqsg
Did we know exercise is important but here's the flip side tat ppls don consider. It's one of e reason why antioxidants r so important - to help keep a healthy balance in our bodies.,btohqsg
Why all the people in financial markets pick up drinking and late nights,btohqsg
Made money go where to spend? Go SPCA huh? Of course we go KTV to party. 😁,btohqsg
My young son still studying also pick up drinking,btohqsg
If Ur son is already working and making his own money  then he has the freedom to spend however he likes,btohqsg
Now they do internship  at night and weekend go drink  very bad,btohqsg
He got some savings from NS,btohqsg
Young time  sacrificed health for wealth. Old already is the other way,btohqsg
Correct  tell them also no use. Must own self experience,btohqsg
But he also don't take carbo and do regular exercise,btohqsg
Nowadays  I usually get invitation from listed companies to go eat and go drink. But they know that I don't drink and they won't force me to drink. What is 敬酒不吃吃罚酒，if I hear this  I will leave the table straight away. Nowadays I don't give face to listed companies as well.,btohqsg
You must have moved to a certain status to do this. Junior staff cannot like this,btohqsg
Oh.. ah boy to man liao..early your comment I 💭 your kid still a student below 18,btohqsg
Usually listed companies will look for me when they are in trouble. They will not look for me if they are doing well. That is why  some said I am the undertaker for listed companies.,btohqsg
Drink 🍻🥂 more.. so more girlfriends for u to choose😬..🙊,btohqsg
Corporate planning and restructuring. IPO fellows are the doctors that help to deliver babies.,btohqsg
Too many  later all big tummy at the same time then siao liao,btohqsg
Nope. Investment Banking is too textbook,btohqsg
For me  I usually look at shareholders  corporate structure  assets  liabilities  potential new assets  listing shell healthiness.,btohqsg
Which is why when listed companies are in trouble  they won't dare to big head with me,btohqsg
Not chim  just that companies is dirty or in trouble  I see how to minimise their pain.,btohqsg
The company my son doing internship also got drinking sessions 🙈,btohqsg
U ask anyone  if I am lying in hospital  will I dare to be funny with the doctors or nurses? When I am dead  do I want the undertaker to do a good job? That is why usually listed companies will not be KL,btohqsg
In fact  some of the companies that u all discussed here  I met some of their mgmt as well. Just that I am not suppose to comment.,btohqsg
haha.. depend tmr wake up price 😅,btohqsg
If breakout successful  we maybe looking at 140-150 level,btohqsg
Correct or not? Based on triangle target price.,btohqsg
If we are looking solely from TA angle  usually a good breakout have to take place around the 3/4 area,btohqsg
agreed.. everything is possible..there's always potential to BO or might break-dn.. just relax 🧖🏻‍♂🧖🏻‍♀,btohqsg
Odds are  triangle is a continuation pattern.,btohqsg
Wonder if China's COVID strategy is going down the drain.,btohqsg
Usually descending triangle occurs as a pause in uptrend and ascending triangle as a pause in a downtrend.,btohqsg
Yup👍.. there's e difference btw先知先觉者 vs. 后知后觉者,btohqsg
Just like HDD if got error  needs to backup big files and do fragmenting everytime.  Damn time consuming.,btohqsg
As for rising wedge which looks a bit similar to an ascending triangle  usually marks the end of an uptrend,btohqsg
The last time I saw oil was when it was US$150. All the cooking oil  biofuel  coal  natural gas  hit rooftops,btohqsg
Johnleeyou have a good time ?,btohqsg
