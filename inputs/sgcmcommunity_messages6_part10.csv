LTA Jamie says:You can swap the registration numbers of your existing vehicles of the same category (i.e. car to car  motorcycle to motorcycle  etc.). Go to our OneMotoring website > Digital Services > Swap Vehicle Number and login using your Singpass 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).The prescribed fee for each vehicle registration number retention and replacement is $1 300. Hence  the total fee payable to swap the registration numbers of your two vehicles would be $2 600 ($1 300 x 2 counts of number retention and replacement).,btohqsg
