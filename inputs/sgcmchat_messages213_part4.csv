Anyone have the black w124 500e picture,btohqsg
Saw one just now... Malaysia plate,btohqsg
alot alot or just enough to stop alot of cars,btohqsg
Stopped to check my dad car,btohqsg
Got one sirroco damn loud just now I think come here to catch,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt come out if car illegal haha,btohqsg
The real W124 500E was only available in LHD,btohqsg
well yes  but not entirely true,btohqsg
there were a very small handful of rhd units,btohqsg
And it has wider wheel arches,btohqsg
i believe colour matched trim pieces too.,btohqsg
For your info there were rhd e500 and 500e that has been converted which require complex change in converting left-hand drive W124 to right-hand drive would involve major changes to the steering column  dashboard  pedals  wiring loom  and potentially even the body panels  making it a very costly and complex. There were few units in Malaysia bought from uk...,btohqsg
Anyway that example just now didn't look like a real 500E,btohqsg
They look like normal W124 wheel arches,btohqsg
300e m103 ((the hammer) 500e  (the wolf) and e420 and e36 - 24v will have wider front(build by daimler mercedes)E500 by porsche will have wider front and rear.,btohqsg
It's a base model with a kit and poorly sized badges,btohqsg
how expensive is the fine ah,btohqsg
3 stacks of diamond ahh photo,btohqsg
I once rented one of these when my ride was in the workshop for repairs.The power and grip was awesome. The fuel consumption was also awesome lol,btohqsg
Focus ST not a lot in SG,btohqsg
