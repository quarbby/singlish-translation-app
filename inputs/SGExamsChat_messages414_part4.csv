and this is only in recent years,btohqsg
The Nobel Prize thing is also a bad argument considering people get awarded them decades after their defining work,btohqsg
i mean i write my own notes so,btohqsg
and it's only seen as defining much later,btohqsg
Singapore's research hasn't even matured to the point where we have findings like that yet,btohqsg
like the most recent 2022 prize was based on experiments from the 1980s,btohqsg
and yet SG's quantum tech scene quality wise is seen as one of the top in the world  alongside places like UC berkeley  oxford and harvard. obviously we aren't super crazy good  but there's a lot more to how good the research is outside of budget and nobel prizes,btohqsg
isnt this cos of... intl students,btohqsg
tbh it's more about the faculty they attract because sg pays professors and postdocs quite well compared to many other countries,btohqsg
and what that does is boost big collaborations,btohqsg
it's also a weird thing NUS and NTU have where they hardly ever hire faculty that don't have overseas experience  so you have to work overseas before you can be hired,btohqsg
One of the profs for NTU chem took his PhD under NTU as well but he's sent to Stanford for training,btohqsg
one of the few exceptions i've seen is the prof alr having an insane publication record,btohqsg
high h-index after just a few years,btohqsg
the iupac pres h-index is 64 or sth ðŸ’€ god tier,btohqsg
20 is good  40 is already fantastic   anything above 50 is just...,btohqsg
I think NTU recently started a plasma physics group,btohqsg
and the head they brought in has like 70+,btohqsg
h-index. just a measure of how good of a researcher you are,btohqsg
I stopped reading at '... I have started making out..' I'm sorry aryhur plz don't whack me,btohqsg
Lol ok I will rephrase it I sounds weird,btohqsg
In simpler terms I have started creating a pdf file which will contain the cop for all the pfp courses (for Na peeps only )*Cop are Estimated only*,btohqsg
This is because the polys don't produce cops for the polytechnic foundation programme so this would help ppl better gauge which course they can get into,btohqsg
Hope y'all get into your desired poly course and don't react with any emogi TQ!,btohqsg
I want to show my love and support,btohqsg
I react to show my love to dajie,btohqsg
NTU and NUS striving to be SMU while SMU striving to be NUS,btohqsg
More rigour or smth last i heard,btohqsg
And yep it shld be done before the results are being released .,btohqsg
as in born and raised in sg nobel laurette,btohqsg
This year's physics nobel prize was good research but wasn't groundbreaking,btohqsg
2 years ago lazer tweezing was ground breaking,btohqsg
Do you know what's good research but isn't Nobel Laureate material? Explaining away the hairless blackhole paradox,btohqsg
y am i experiencing double vision,btohqsg
shld i be concerned abt this,btohqsg
I mean thereâ€™s many possible reasons,btohqsg
ok mr physics do ur biology,btohqsg
Do we look like opticians to u,btohqsg
Ok but like DOES ANYBODY KNOW THI,btohqsg
do u currently have any internal bleeding or,btohqsg
I dont rlly wanna hear frm google,btohqsg
or ur retina has officially died on u,btohqsg
it cld be the fovea  where the image is clearest  but since u experience double vision it cld be combination of damaged nerves along ur retina and damage to lens,btohqsg
this is based on whatever 50 iq brain I have,btohqsg
but srsly note get it check tmr if it persist.. I might be due to migraines whatsoever,btohqsg
get some rest don't look at ur phone requires u to squint and all not good,btohqsg
lai pm me your address ðŸ˜ˆ,btohqsg
tbf still one of a number of buildings,btohqsg
true  but you know where exactly ðŸ’€,btohqsg
hey I didnâ€™t even ask you for it,btohqsg
