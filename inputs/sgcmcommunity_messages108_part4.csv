MG Singapore teases launch of MG4 alongside another new EV 😍A series of posts on the firm's Instagram page has teased the arrival of a duo of new EVs  with the latest one all but confirming that the MG4 is on its way.👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you can't wait to know what MG Singapore has in store for us!➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
but mg4 looks small in terms of space,btohqsg
In this present age of mindless anti China  sentiment  MG is British heritage  China built. So pro West propagandists should not buy. Hee hee,btohqsg
Aiya china or not china  a car most impt attributes : price  suits your needs  worryless  easy to drive easy to use. And most importantly  fuel consumption light,btohqsg
Good to be in America to buy EV. America Government literally subsidised folks buying EVs made in USA.,btohqsg
I mean SG the pathway is such that only the rich and upper middle income can buy car for now,btohqsg
Tbh if everyone got car sg sure jam like mad,btohqsg
Every one has 1 car still ok. 🫢,btohqsg
If 1 has many cars  he/she is using quota meant for other ppl. So 2nd car onwards  is same person  COE must be x% higher. Haha,btohqsg
Many Governments envy Singapore Government able to push through this COE ideal. They do not dare to push it in their parliamentary legislative process as there might be repercussions of been voted out of office. Hee hee. If you’ve been to Bangkok and Manila or Jakarta  their peak hour traffic is horrific and exhausting!,btohqsg
I mean in the states 100k can get u a conti alr😂,btohqsg
In states 100k can buy supercar,btohqsg
COE is LTA golden boy. Will never be scrap by Government. However  there is a need to tweak the current system as it favours the rich and wealthy at the expense of people who need vehicles to work or run businesses!,btohqsg
I cannot imagine Singapore with no COE,btohqsg
Then I will sell my car and buy copen liao,btohqsg
