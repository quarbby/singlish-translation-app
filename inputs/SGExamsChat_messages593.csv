Oh I just realized bedok is chemcer,btohqsg
BRUHAHAHAHAH I GOT BANNED FROM THE OTHER CHAT,btohqsg
i think cuz the other chat for studying,btohqsg
hi yall can i ask what is honours degree and what is masters degree,btohqsg
Degree is just your normal degree  with honor means u do exceptionally good,btohqsg
blud said stfu to my comment so i did a lil trolling,btohqsg
there‚Äôs this bachelor of science and it said honours available,btohqsg
bc masters is 4 yearsbachelors + honours is like 5 years ish,btohqsg
I used to have a ans for this  but in short degree teaches different generic topics like physics  chemistry all that while masters is going more niche and in-depth of what u learn in your degree,btohqsg
Masters is if u continue studies after uni,btohqsg
wait so is sg all masters or,btohqsg
HUH i thought uni we take masters,btohqsg
wtf are we taking in uni,btohqsg
üò≠üò≠ wait sorry im rlly v uneducated on this,btohqsg
In uni we are taking this thing called bachelor degree. Depending in your major either its a bachelor in arts science or engineering degree,btohqsg
So the route is roughly like bachelor-masters-doctorate (phd),btohqsg
Like the type of degree u getting. Tbh just naming different,btohqsg
Some degree is like B.A or B.S,btohqsg
and then i want to do engineering,btohqsg
i‚Äôll do masters of that specific engineering after the bachelor?? or honours,btohqsg
cos on the site it only says honours after bachelors,btohqsg
oh so i think its bachelors then honours then masters,btohqsg
damn how many years do we have to study for üò≠,btohqsg
actually can bachelors get good job,btohqsg
u can if ur standard is low enough,btohqsg
there this tiktok guy fking funny say how he quit a 4 figure job to do FA or smth,btohqsg
den everyone shitting on him what four figure job,btohqsg
bachelors degree is the base. honours typically means you take extra honours level classes. in sg it‚Äôs diff bc ntu nus have direct honours so it‚Äôs built into our program but for overseas there‚Äôs extra requirements,btohqsg
masters degree is 1-2 years of postgrad,btohqsg
phd is another 4 years min but depends on the uni and field,btohqsg
masters is not compulsory for phd,btohqsg
but they do v diff things,btohqsg
if i have a full time job rn w govt sector before uni,btohqsg
masters basically makes you an expert in what‚Äôs alr been done  may or may not help in career,btohqsg
isit considered the determining job for my future employers,btohqsg
phd makes you an expert in finding new things in the field,btohqsg
or isit only the job after uni,btohqsg
almost surely doesn‚Äôt help in career unless what you wanna do requires it,btohqsg
i had this lecturer that did phd after his postgrad coz he thinks why waste money jus go for the highest achievement,btohqsg
mad lad work and getting doctorate at the same time,btohqsg
no thx ü•≤ü•≤ why is life so hard bruh,btohqsg
alot of us stop at degreee,btohqsg
in the US it‚Äôs common to not have masters,btohqsg
unless u wanna be like my uni prof chiong all the way from undergrad to phd,btohqsg
wait yall after bachelors i can find a job right,btohqsg
phd means you wanna do research,btohqsg
and then if i want to take masters can do part time??,btohqsg
no other reason you‚Äôd do it,btohqsg
then my job fire me how,btohqsg
some jobs will let u take coz its pre-requisite to get higher management or smth,btohqsg
a lot of people plan to take masters after working for a few years but end up not,btohqsg
yall are way better than my ecg counsellors,btohqsg
take it if you need it,btohqsg
3 weeks of talking i‚Äôm still confused,btohqsg
but w yall i instantly got it lol,btohqsg
eh speaking of which isit very different class environment after undergrad,btohqsg
coz all grownups wanting that cert,btohqsg
like beyond a bachelors degree it‚Äôs all about taking what you need for what you wanna do,btohqsg
yeah maybe their job good enough alr,btohqsg
not like undergrad everyone just fk around to find out,btohqsg
in my experience it‚Äôs very different,btohqsg
currently for australia there‚Äôs a bachelors of science but like if i want to go for a specific engineering do i do it after the bachelors?,btohqsg
and less people being shit lol,btohqsg
cos sg is like js straight bachelors for the specific engineering right,btohqsg
in sg i js select that course,btohqsg
but in Australia i think i hv to do bachelors of science first,btohqsg
but just imo ah  dont take anything related to aerospace,btohqsg
then after that how tf do i go into that specific engineering,btohqsg
in US right  you don't even declare your major at all until you get admitted into the uni,btohqsg
u wont like it when u go in...,btohqsg
the modules are set to kill,btohqsg
but ya can you link the Australia thing you saw first,btohqsg
u just think h3 maths plus physics,btohqsg
