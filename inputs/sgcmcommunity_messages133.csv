Then you have heat to worry about later  and handling…,btohqsg
Aiya worse come to worse your car kaboom,btohqsg
You mean rs4 conversion? Because rs5 dimensions are different. Also there's nowhere to mount your electronic spoiler on an A4 unless you awkwardly stick it on the boot because those spoilers are meant to be integrated into the boot lines like in the a7 which would require cutting into the boot or using the sweeping line on the A5 SB and integrating it,btohqsg
When you go tune and don't do any hardware mods  you don't really get the full potential of the tune because the stock hardware is usually limiting and not meant for those figures,btohqsg
