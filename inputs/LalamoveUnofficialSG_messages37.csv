CS is not helpful most of the time unless u know your rights. If over weight I will show CS proof of the weight.,btohqsg
But if u driving hybrid still can say,btohqsg
Some pple order enough to last 1 week war,btohqsg
Carry 10 heavy bags of coconuts and watermelon and milk cartons,btohqsg
For car need to add in maintenance  fuel  gantry  erp cost....,btohqsg
So when do llm most things are light AF to me,btohqsg
Cash job it’s ok . The CS will contact the client and let client know of the additional fees . Don’t contact customer to tell them to pay. Ask the CS to do that so you don’t have to take the customers shit,btohqsg
Food panda  deliveroo and grab more lighter,btohqsg
CS live chat will take.min 15mins to connect and get ur msg across,btohqsg
Sometimes i really sio contact CS will smoking ciggie.....smoke until filter still connecting,btohqsg
No choice if want to be compensated must talk to CS,btohqsg
The worst CS is afi lol 😂,btohqsg
Some drivers really wait till dulan give up,btohqsg
The worst thing we cannot exit the chat to refer to pics or main app,btohqsg
Ya. I that time kb them about this.,btohqsg
They sometimes ask u things like order number or timing etc,btohqsg
They will have records even when u exit,btohqsg
I always Screenshot my order so I don’t have to exit chat,btohqsg
But they should know what is the order. They ask me what my order number. I tell them my order for now. They will know one. They act stupid,btohqsg
I cant even check SS without leaving the chat,btohqsg
I dont understand why they cant have CS via phone,btohqsg
Always as before talking to Cas,btohqsg
Oh well till today. They are still as shitting as last time,btohqsg
I press this only chat is gone,btohqsg
I agree they are shitty. So u need try to be patient and talk to them as though they are kids .,btohqsg
Yup i kenna d/c everytime i give them a sarcastic reply,btohqsg
Hahaha but I don't do llm liao. I gave up on llm.,btohqsg
"Got one too long waiting time i went to CS and went....""So  here we are again""",btohqsg
I am 99% sure it is managed overseas,btohqsg
They have their command centre at ubi where they take calls,btohqsg
Like once I did a Jurong port job and they say cilent say “no need to go to port“ and the CS don’t want to give me the 15sgd . So I took a picture of my van at the guard house and say “wow security asking me to change pass”. CS straight away amend the order give me secured zone,btohqsg
Their way of doing not good also. They should protect drivers more.,btohqsg
They shld.have surcharge to Tuas and ulu camps also,btohqsg
So must work Smart Cover backside and make CS look stupid,btohqsg
Or every place change pass will have add on?,btohqsg
MBFC tower jobs all need to reg at front desk,btohqsg
And parking is chor bee hoon,btohqsg
It depends lol 😂 I got secured zone for going to ntuc warehouse at Tuas,btohqsg
Got 1 place in tuas ask me to wear vest go in also,btohqsg
Take picture of pass change office and try,btohqsg

I always park nearby hdb. At least if exceed 10mins will be cheaper,btohqsg
Now beer delivery is cheapo use bike n always use bike,btohqsg
Buy bicycle. Do grabfood. At least no erp/gantry or fuel wasted,btohqsg
After getting holland v fine 2x   as long as hdb rates or by mins charge i dun care liao lol,btohqsg
When they have these type of demands do we need to follow? Or follow LLM SOP?,btohqsg
I usually bo chap one if can stack i sure stack,btohqsg
Don't care them la. Can stack just stack. They just think of themself nia.,btohqsg
Durian  alcohol and food all want asap asap,btohqsg
Food I understand. But durian and alcohol later send will die meh.,btohqsg
Stack just make sure deliver within time slot lo,btohqsg

Bukit panjang can go pasir panjang one,btohqsg

The alcohol delivery at Sims Ln sells to customers that they can get their alcohol within an hour  so this is their business branding. We may not always know the reason behind llm customer requests  but doesnt mean they dont have a valid reason. As the couriers we try our best to help customers achieve their business goals and maintain reputationThis alcohol place usually puts only 2-3 locations that are properly clustered by area  so it's reasonably achievable,btohqsg
The boon keng alcohol jus copycat the 1hr thing only i thinkBut dont take your time la lol,btohqsg
Wah sehJoel CYappear only i wake up to 500 unread msges 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Mai spoil market leh 😝You dont always have to go thru cs  usually when i tell customer its way overweight they quite willing to payCos most of them alrdy pai seh  they know its overweightSome may try to say it can fit - of cos can fit in my car but i tell them its not jus abt fittingI need extra time and effort to transport  and the weight/size limits are clearly stated and that's llm's regulation,btohqsg
Just like how its not right to book a justgrab when u have 6 pax or have baby 😆,btohqsg
Everyone must use their own discretion laIf someone share surely means in that person's exp it is something safe/beneficialIt may benefit another person or it may not  but everyone's own experience is always valid,btohqsg
Or if you know for sure its the wrong advice then say mah  so it can benefit everyone,btohqsg
Lets see how I survive this lol,btohqsg
good luck. hopefully no delay at shop. 🙏,btohqsg
let see this week can make how much.... 🏎💨💨,btohqsg
Noted will try to talk to customer nxt time,btohqsg
Gd morning sister. So gd no work nite u must hv Huat ah,btohqsg
Dun go thru CS la. Just ask n u may receive extra lor. But I show hand say pls cancel I’m not taking. Works unless they are kuai lan like waa cow,btohqsg
Most ppl are reasonable. Those not reasonable then leave them to their karma.,btohqsg
I nvr take novena bryani so long. My blood pressure really gd.,btohqsg
So stylo talk to the hand lol,btohqsg
Can tell customer to cancel meh??,btohqsg
Erm is not like we will take 2 to 3 hrs to deliver what. If we take their job cannot stack is it fair for delivery guys? They are just making their convenience causing others difficulties nia.,btohqsg
We also have reason to stack. Cannot only say they have their reason. If we can stack and send in time  I don't see any issue,btohqsg
They just saying sim lane tt shop one their company motto promises one hour delivery,btohqsg
Tts why always the order will request one hour delivery,btohqsg
We take we just take note of it lo,btohqsg
I taken their orders 3 times so far no issue... but some orders damn heavy knn cartons of beer,btohqsg
I stack them before too 🤣😂🤣😂,btohqsg
But to be honest if they want to keep their motto of 2 hr delivery  they should employ own delivery drivers. Llm is sub con. Driver will stack when they can ma. We can take note of them but we don't work directly under them.,btohqsg
On a side note: i also delivered wreath before to a funeral wake lol,btohqsg
I send food to funeral wake too,btohqsg

Better check your wallet for orders with tips,btohqsg
For those that need to wait for restaurant to pay the tips affected probably. Cause on Easter day I took nandos also same. Other jobs that comes with tips but no need to wait for the user to pay tips not affected,btohqsg

It is cling wrapped and smelly proof anyway  so it is pretty much as fresh as it gets,btohqsg
Too bad I cash out alrdy. Or else sure go look for cheap D13. $12 one pc at JW 492. Sure got cheaper n better,btohqsg
No jobs to go home lol,btohqsg
Car job for big order....i kenna 2 carton box delivery for macs to sungei gadong camp,btohqsg
Need to work harder lol last month only 5.5k,btohqsg
Shit i took this  am i in danger? Cash jobbbbb,btohqsg
Call both sides to confirm order,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter insist that it’s camp,btohqsg
Inside or outside it’s still camp,btohqsg
When I do crown plaza at airport I always insist . And I got 15sgd everytime. Camps I also get,btohqsg
If lalamove don’t upgrade let me teach  you. Tell the customer that delivering to camp is listed in the secured Zone and show customer the list of secured zone and ask for 15sgd cash. I always do that,btohqsg
Also it’s better cause lalamove won’t take com if you take cash from customer,btohqsg
And cilent won’t call llm to verify as it’s already written on their website,btohqsg
Not bad :) ! Bike lower cost .,btohqsg
Van higher cost and free gym membership 😂,btohqsg
Secured zones fees are not always reflected in fees . If you know it’s secured please contact support and get paid what you actually deserve. Don’t work for free guys!,btohqsg
And for those doing van jobs I don’t know if you know this but if there’s no lift excess and it’s a helper job. Even if it’s 3 steps you can charge the customer accordingly. I just did a job last week. Apparently the apartment got 3 steps.,btohqsg
This is I get paid and not pissed the customer off,btohqsg
Sad to say no. I did one at the same area I did try to claim but apparently cilent say got other drivers do the job before and it’s outside Jurong port not inside so cannot claim . That is one of my unsuccessful attempts. It’s abit misleading because the location was Jurong port. Ultimately I believe it’s easier when the cilent is an individual rather than a business.,btohqsg
When we see where other ppl are coming from and try to understand their reasons  life is a lot easier and a lot more pleasant 🙂,btohqsg
So checkpoint is secure zone ah? Shit. Did one that time. No extra fee,btohqsg
Spoil market u nv ask lol,btohqsg
Now they will use u as example,btohqsg
I stuck in woodlands no jobs to go home,btohqsg
Honestly i didnt know  all the online tutorial i CBF to watch  i just skipped all and took the test,btohqsg
The questions mostly common sense so obv scored 100 and they allow me to drive liaoz,btohqsg
I dont know where to watch those tutorials online now also,btohqsg
I did a crown plaza job also......go there on stack and just drop item outside the hotel i happy AF liaoz...didnt even think of secure zone fee,btohqsg
Doubt so because CS will ask you why never say that time,btohqsg
If the same day still got chance,btohqsg
The biggest tip I gotten was 50sgd :),btohqsg
Ask them for this fee they rather activate their own guys,btohqsg
This is a credit job. No need to ask them . Contact CS and they will award you with the secured zone,btohqsg
Wait is this cash or credit ?,btohqsg
It’s like decathlon that order a 2.4 van by mistake to transport a small dumbbell. Lol 😂 I just take the job. Ayio. You all shouldn’t be afraid that customer will cancel if they order to airport and you already pick it up   you shd be entitled to the secured zone 15sgd. If client not happy then pay 50% to cancel Lor.,btohqsg
It seems like too many drivers closing one eye cause they don’t want to deal with the CS or afraid to lose the job. Come on la ! You all have rights too   as long as you follow what lalamove policy states you shouldn’t be afraid.,btohqsg
@adminpls pin this as well lol,btohqsg
Noted....will try to do as advised....thks for the tips,btohqsg
Tips for lalamoveIf wrong location- you will be compensated with extra stop fees. Do not be afraid to let customer know that wong location is chargeable as one extra stop + mileage.If secured zone not reflected- you have to contact CS and let them confirm it’s a secured zone. If CS say it’s not .try justifying to them on their secured zone guide lines. Do note that even though it’s secured zone customers sometimes refuse to pay so you will need CS to help. However sometimes CS will say it’s not secured   if that happens you can try getting paid from the client directly by showing them the lalamove secured zone list of places. This is the best way to get paid. Base on experience credit jobs are easier to get the extra fees.For items that exceed dimensions- always have proof via pictures. Carrying a portable luggage scale and measuring tape helps. Getting upgraded only works if you take lower tier vehicle job. If you ride a bike and the weight exceed you will not get an upgrade. However there’s a method I’ll recommend if you ride a bike and the weight exceed and it’s supposed to be a car job you could also let the client know and manually calculate the car fees and tell the customer if he/she is okay to pay extra as it’s suppose to be a car job. Most of them would not mind paying. You could also let them know if they cancel they will have to pay you 50% .If there’s anything wrong with your order  always screenshot so you won’t have to exit chat to refer to order number . Also try studying the pricing so you can manually calculate if your too lazy to contact CS and want to take matters to your own hands.,btohqsg
If CS don’t stand up for your rights. You have to stand up for your own rights! 😂,btohqsg
Oh also I forgot to mention if client Is slow for pickup. Example: When pickup suppose to be at 12pm and at 12pm its not ready. Let CS know that customer is not ready .Do not wait until after 10mins to contact CS .if the pick up is not ready when i arrive  I always assume that customer will be late. So my message to CS will be . “ hi for my order  #1234-1234 just want to inform that I’m already at the location and the item is still not ready for pick up in case there’s a charge for waiting time“,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice n knowledge sean... i learnt today,btohqsg
Anyone who get this pls go ask for the $15 dun spoil market,btohqsg
Oh they didnt cancel lol thank you@btcseannykor kor,btohqsg
In case you all don’t know supply base (non military) like logistics hub that require pass change is also considered a secured zone. Take picture of the pass office and inform CS that it’s a supply base logistics hub. I requested for secured zone fee atNTUC Warehouse @ Joo Koon before andI got it after taking pictures of the pass office because they require pass change .,btohqsg
The secure zone it for pick up and drop off right?,btohqsg
Because I saw food order delivery to them too,btohqsg
Secured zone is for drop off. If pick up at airport is not considered a secured zone .,btohqsg
Hi all  may i ask the procedure for additional waiting time at pick up point,btohqsg
When pickup suppose to be at 12pm and at 12pm its not ready. Let CS know that customer is not ready .Do not wait until after 10mins to contact CS .if the pick up is not ready when i arrive  I always assume that customer will be late. So my message to CS will be . “ hi for my order  #1234-1234 just want to inform that I’m already at the location and the item is still not ready for pick up in case there’s a charge for waiting time“. After pick up contact CS again and let them know the time you waited they’ll add accordingly. You can also let customer know and ask them to pay. If they don’t want to pay you and contact CS for help again,btohqsg
Hi Sean  thanks for sharing. So when i reached the location do i swipe arrival? Waiting time starts from the scheduled timing or drivers arrival time? When livechat do i have to wait for an agent or i can start to write in before they ask me to speak to an agent? Sorry so many questions  newbie here 😅,btohqsg
Nth to stack on this mon bluesssss,btohqsg
Thanks alot JaCe  noted on the procedure. But do i have to swipe arrival when i reached but will go to upload photo page  and i back again so lala have my arrival time? And also the waiting time will starts after 10 mins of the scheduled time or driver’s arrival time?,btohqsg

Nope I don’t think that’s secured zone. However no harm trying to smoke your way.,btohqsg
For waiting time I like to charge the customer directly so I don’t have to pay coms😂😂😂,btohqsg
Longest I ever waited was 1hr minus 10mins so I told customer there’s a waiting charge of 50mins . And I ask them to pay me cash. They seem pretty cool about it since they made me wait so long.,btohqsg

I ever accepted an order to changi prison.. And its not considered secured zone. Trapped there for 2 plus hours. Changi prison guard forced my arm rest up  causing spring to be damaged. Not able to claim for that.Called customer and lalamove about the secure zone on changi prison  and they were in disbelief that its so tight.End of day  amount earned is not worth the troubles of everything out from car for x Ray  full search  change pass  whatever u can think of.. And the repair of my arm rest,btohqsg
