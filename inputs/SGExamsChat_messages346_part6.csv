Do I believe in equality of outcome? No,btohqsg
But I do believe in equality of opportunities,btohqsg
well said. and yet sg scrapped estate tax a few years back,btohqsg
Personally I believe that move was self serving,btohqsg
other things sg tries (does it work?)- everyone in sch wears sch uni- everyone mixes in NS regardless of class,btohqsg
The majority of MPs are very wealthy,btohqsg
They literally scrapped it to benefit themselves,btohqsg
ns only proved that everyone is equal  but some people are equaler than other people,btohqsg
Every school is a good school type beat,btohqsg
Every school is a good school but some schools are obviously better,btohqsg
"""better"" for who? ""better"" for you may not be ""better"" for me :)",btohqsg
that is technically arguable if one wants to  but NS literally states without a diploma or JC cert equivilant you are barred from OCS and lowered chance for SCS,btohqsg
Got Diploma and JC also hard,btohqsg
good point re: OCSeven in civil service today  your academics affects your highest job level,btohqsg
nah i dont recall that  at least to my memory  they usually just want approx 75 rp and above etc,btohqsg
is that bad? (another popular essay qn),btohqsg
Are all MPs out of touch people looking down from their ivory towers?,btohqsg
is this for like some GP thing lmao,btohqsg
But they also in the vast majority of cases don't really understand the struggle of every day singaporeans,btohqsg
no  this is just a chat cos midautumn is lame :),btohqsg
Do I think every rich kid had every success spoonfed to them?,btohqsg
They probably worked hard to get to the school's they are in,btohqsg
But also they probably had more resources,btohqsg
i mean  if you have a can opener with you  you wouldnt use your bare hands to open a can isnt it,btohqsg
Did you still work to open the can? Yes,btohqsg
what makes u say so? need to justify saying this if u bring up the point,btohqsg
But you had a easier time,btohqsg
countries like china  aus  US straight up give you extra points for being of a different culture or even fucken being gay,btohqsg
But also I don't have to worry about my finances,btohqsg
Or if my parents have enough money to send me to school,btohqsg
Or if I have to work part time while studying,btohqsg
We are well to do enough that I own 2 laptops one for home one for school,btohqsg
yeah. there may be a class divide  but if u can show everyone in the country has some minimum standard of living better than in many other countries  arguably that's good enough?,btohqsg
Is it good enough? I don't think so.,btohqsg
Is it better than other countries?,btohqsg
do u believe it is better to have zero class divide?,btohqsg
I believe it's better to have no class divide,btohqsg
countries that have zero class divide include north korea,btohqsg
think carefully. do u believe it is better to remove all incentive to compete?,btohqsg
what exactly is the change you are trying to drive here?,btohqsg
No  I just think it's better if everyone competes on the same playing field,btohqsg
And some people aren't given a headstart,btohqsg
i argue that there is an optimal level of class divide,btohqsg
just like there is an optimal level of crime,btohqsg
Is it communism to believe everyone should be given the same chance to succeed?,btohqsg
If so then I suppose yeah,btohqsg
no  Joshua has a good point. Joshua's solution is quite ingenious. use inheritance tax to wipe the slate clean every generation and start afresh. why not?,btohqsg
if u are born in a less fortunate background  yea life will be harder for you. and? so ?? whats so bad about that? just work harder/? why adopt an entitled mindset that u must be given the same opportunities as everyone?,btohqsg
I believe 20% is a good number,btohqsg
and 20% is supposed to create zero class divide? are u listening to urself?,btohqsg
