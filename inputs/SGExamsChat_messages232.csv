Okok  seems like you aren't interested in the refined arts  i would then recommend binge watching adam sandler movies,btohqsg
Actually Queens Gambit is really good,btohqsg
The movies themselves arent very funny but seeing his career go from mediocre to bad is pretty hilarious,btohqsg
there were no k dramas so far,btohqsg
Does The Interview count as a K drama?,btohqsg
A true work of art if I do say so myself,btohqsg

Can I ask you guys something?,btohqsg
How you know what you want to do in life,btohqsg
Amm maybe seeing where your strengths are,btohqsg
And baser on that making a decision,btohqsg
But for me passion is the most impt ig,btohqsg
job security  smth that u think u won't mind doing even if ur passion changes,btohqsg
Well I think its jus the passion and of we are willing to work in that field that matters,btohqsg
I mean then we can earn also,btohqsg
there's no one right answer la,btohqsg
But thats what I believe only,btohqsg
your beliefs which influence your values and vice versa,btohqsg
and your knowledge and experiences influence your beliefs,btohqsg
and social factors that influence how you perceive the knowledge and experience u have,btohqsg
I appreciate everyone here for sharing their thoughts with me,btohqsg
eh I mean tbh for me I'm passionate in a lot of different things LOL,btohqsg
doesn't necessarily mean I'm good at any of them,btohqsg
if you're talking about career and what job to choose  I think a balance between passion & job security is essential lor,btohqsg
I think it's impt to be doing smth u enjoy  but at the same time it needs to be something that can tide u through rainy days,btohqsg
so you need to find a job that's a balance between the two,btohqsg
i will always advice one to really calculate down to the last dollar the most basic kind of lifestyle that they can accept,btohqsg
find out the costs of everything  housing  insurance  transport  food  activities  luxuries,btohqsg
then also find out your tahan level,btohqsg
might as well just go into accounting,btohqsg
tahan level is like  even if the job is shit  how much pay would you need to receive to be willing to endure,btohqsg
so you will have your lower limits (the amount of money you need to earn)  and the upper limits (how much shit can u endure),btohqsg
then just work within those limits lor,btohqsg
if your lower limit happens to be higher than your upper limit  then u need to do some deep introspection,btohqsg
if you happen to be the lucky few who enjoy every single part of your job scope  then you not considered working liao...,btohqsg
same here. i guess i can be very fickle because as soon as i find something i'm good at  i wanna turn it into a hustle. so what i've done is to focus on one thing to be my 'main' goal/career  and make my other interests into something from which i can profit or do on the daily  like a business,btohqsg
"Passion and pragmatism must come hand in hand. Every passion  if you willing to be open-minded  can be lucrative. As long as you don't stay egoistic about how your passion is defined.Also  passions will change  and it's ok. because what passion brings  is a high level of energy and persistence. Using that  you can develop skills and experience at much faster rate. It's possible to achieve standards in 6 months  at a level that an unpassionate person would achieve in 4 years. That helps you accumulate ""power"" to thrive in long run.",btohqsg
I think I'm lucky to be able to find smth that happens to be the best of both worlds  and I know that regardless of what side interests  what degree I take eventually  it'll all lead to the same route  but perhaps just diff pay or job position?¬ø,btohqsg
But I will still prioritize practicality esp since my family isn't well to do and I need to focus on supporting my parents and grandma first,btohqsg
Very real and important. I generally try to urge people who are more well off to realize that EVERYONE wants to support their family. But if you're more well-off  you actually have the privilege to explore more meaningful pursuits beyond money.A world where everyone just wants to earn most money possible for themselves  leads to increasing inequality and those below the bell curve of privilege to be doomed to poverty and whims of the powerful,btohqsg
Agree   unless their parents force them to inherit their family business or smth ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥,btohqsg
There are studies on how family businesses rarely survive beyond 3 generations because the younger ones live in too much luxury to bring the business forward to remain competitive. Statistically  family businesses that groom passionate individuals have higher rate of survival. But asian families like to only take care of their own family and leave others to their own fates (my own opinion).,btohqsg
Sounds like the case for hawker stalls too HAHA but wow I didn't know that,btohqsg
what is meaningful is different for everyone though  maybe their definition for meaningful is further wealth accumulation,btohqsg
Agree that it's different for each person. And its worth a deeper conversation why further wealth accumulation is a worthwhile pursuit for someone who is already well to do.,btohqsg
Can you link me some of these studies,btohqsg
I‚Äôm interested in reading up on them,btohqsg
anyone knows of live chat websites?,btohqsg
Mother and daughter charged with murdering Myanmar domestic workerhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/mother-and-daughter-charged-with-murdering-myanmar-domestic-worker-0,btohqsg
a lot of terrible stuff happening one,btohqsg
I remember that is a documentary I watch on YouTube before it‚Äôs about a maid being abused in Hong Kong. Her employer use hot water and pour onto her face,btohqsg
IF YALL DM can yall pm me your school's music band posters  etc,btohqsg
is it true that you have to do daily RJ's at RP?,btohqsg
Hey to add on to the other comments  I think there‚Äôs no need to fret over such hypothetical situation which may not even materialise. At the current moment  we really have no clues if our passion will change in the future‚Ä¶. and actually not very productive to keep thinking about it.Also  maybe yall won‚Äôt agree with me  it is a case of ‚Äúwhatever happens  happens‚Äù ‚Ä¶ sometimes it‚Äôs out of your control  if one day you lan lan bo bian have to pivot  then you really have to pivot  just go with the flow  no use fighting against it.Case in point  I took a grab hitch last month  the 30~yo driver damn passionate about hospitality industry  hospitality diploma + scholarship to do hospitality degree oversea  come back sg spent 5 years work in 5* hotel  climb up the corporate ladder to become Guest Relations Manager. Then tio rekt sibei jialat by covid19 + upcoming family commitments  decided to just drop his passion & pivoted to HR instead.What‚Äôs more important now is to learn as much soft skills & transferrable skills as possible while obtaining mastery of whatever you are doing now so that:(a) you become more well-rounded (which is what employers are looking for nowadays)  then your boss will see you damn zai & promote you faster(hopefully with salary incrementüòÖ) so you climb the corporate ladder a lot faster(b) if one day  unfortunately you lan lan suck thumb have to pivot  the soft skills/transferrable will make the pivot less tough/painful,btohqsg
Thank you. I appreciate this whole paragraph.,btohqsg
also should i go business if i am bad at math,btohqsg
business doesn't require h2 maths  so is ok even if you didn't do that well,btohqsg
wtf is this new nus application page LOL,btohqsg

Can u take Econs as a minor win college of u took H1 econs,btohqsg
the button to go to the application is on the right side  the website cut it off cause you on mobile lol,btohqsg
https://bba.nus.edu.sg/admissions-scholarships/entry-requirements/business in the big 3 unis never required h2 maths at all,btohqsg
hmm yes but they probably did well in their stats component right?,btohqsg
+ it's just a couple of modules,btohqsg
are there lots of essays or reading?,btohqsg
can do well for stats stuff doesn't mean they're good in business,btohqsg
i would prefer this to math lol,btohqsg
which specialisation  has the least math?,btohqsg
which uni? how did you do for a levels,btohqsg
should i apply for nus business if i only have 75 rp?,btohqsg
there'll be maths wherever u go,btohqsg
i rather u start to embrace maths than try to run away from it,btohqsg
probably will have maths occasionally here and there too,btohqsg
like it or not  maths is fundamental in life  no running away,btohqsg
i don't like maths too i find it a pain,btohqsg
everywhere is just made of maths,btohqsg
If you know what u want to do w it,btohqsg
not the best idea but if u have ABA you can try,btohqsg
ntu biz 75rp shld be fine,btohqsg
I aiming for smu biz wahahahahahaha,btohqsg
what if i put other courses below,btohqsg
i did biz and acc for a levels  both got maths in my essays huhu,btohqsg
ppl say ntu and smu are rejects,btohqsg
then they'll look at those if ntu biz dw u,btohqsg
so smu confirm not for me,btohqsg
I think I thrive better in that environment,btohqsg
nus aso going to be seminar,btohqsg
is it weird that i put ntu business above ntu PPGA that has a higher rp,btohqsg
And also those tutorial style kind,btohqsg

Suddenly you sound like my year 3 math teacher,btohqsg
isit time to become a maths teacher,btohqsg
has anyone gone for an interview,btohqsg
but the interview nvr ask questions to let u present yourself to the best of your ability?,btohqsg
like I prepared so much stuff to share  but they keep cutting my answer short,btohqsg
cause they got no time for u,btohqsg
means you're not standing out from the rest,btohqsg
but the interview made a remark at the end  like saying I almost confirm gonna get into the course,btohqsg
means the interview is just for formalities lor,btohqsg
sian but I want my scholarship,btohqsg
or they alr saw what they need to see to accept u,btohqsg
my course no mid term scholarship hahahaha,btohqsg
different from uni admissions liao hahaha,btohqsg
is interview for scholarships and course together,btohqsg
still a lot of ppl applying  but even lesser slots,btohqsg
means they think u ok for course but don't stand out for scholarship lor,btohqsg
but if you keep trying to force the stuff u prepared into the interview,btohqsg
for my 4 uni interviews  the only time i got cut off was when i was talking about the stuff i prepared beforehand,btohqsg
other time i go with the flow  talk off the top of my head  laugh w the interviewers  all went v well,btohqsg
like 2-3 minutes short or 5-10 minutes short,btohqsg
idk la maybe I just like talking abt what I'm passionate abt,btohqsg
them asking too many qns not a good sign aso,btohqsg
but at the end of the day,btohqsg
no matter how well or shit you think your interview went,btohqsg
there'll always be someone better than you,btohqsg
and that person is 'the future you' üòâ,btohqsg
but yea is true la lol,btohqsg

clearly not meant to study that particular Subject,btohqsg
Eyy story of my A level results,btohqsg
