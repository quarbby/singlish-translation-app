yup  got it! will do that!thank you both  i understand. just want to be sure,btohqsg
could i confirm another thing ‚Äî hypothetically  how should i pay if chan bros asks to make payment online? i.e.  via our own devices. how can i pay with Kris+ then? else if it's at their office  may i ask how does that work?and to confirm  i checked but it doesnt really state explicitly. theres no min spend with UOBKF?,btohqsg
Hi all  understand that HealthHub codes as online transactions.Can anybody confirm that Citi rewards gives 4 miles per dollar for such transactions (max spend $1K monthly) ? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi im new to miles game  does crmc + amaze still gets 4mpd for shopee?,btohqsg
im actually rethinking this... for UOBKF the min spend of 800 under SIA  i dont think i'd hit that honestly. but does it affect the 3mpd? though mentioned that 3mpd is credit next month into KF accountalso  for annual fee  do you guys pay for it? if waiver is declined  because of bonus miles being held back,btohqsg
paying via kris+ does not need to spend 800 on SIA group. 3mpd will get credited next month  not delayed like some categories.,btohqsg
ill go for UOBKF for now then as have to make payment later. thank you so much anthony  MH and queenie!,btohqsg
Apologies in advance that i may tag the wrong person  is it@qqplaceswho mentioned citibank will deduct full amount as per statement even if paid in advance  how about if its just annual fee  if it's waived will the giro trigger?@mttelegrammti have SCB annual fees which is waived one week after statement date  will giro still trigger for this annual fee? By right won't but SCB also works in weird ways,btohqsg
Citibank af waiver will still trigger giro based on my experiencr,btohqsg
This is special for citibank  and maybe SCB too? Thanks,btohqsg
I only know citibank so scb u need to ask other,btohqsg
Won‚Äôt trigger giro if waived at least 10 days before due date.,btohqsg
Does Citi rewards also earn 4 miles per dollar while we use kris + app?,btohqsg
May i check if i buy electronics like phones through shopee and lazada  does it qualify under uob lady card fashion?,btohqsg
what about amaze instraem on kris +?,btohqsg
amaze+citi rewards does earn 10x points on kris+ provided the MCC is not excluded,btohqsg
For BOC smartsaver  If I pay 3x $30 to one of my bank credit card  can I still get the 0.9% bonus interest?,btohqsg
thanks. i use it for paying petrol (ESSO),btohqsg
just a question  if my giro application to credit card bill payable is approved. does it mean i dont need to do any action then for my next credit card payment will automatic deduct from my designed account?,btohqsg
Yes but make sure ur statement said it will be paid by giro,btohqsg
ya. i will notice it when i receive my next statement.,btohqsg
but just a quick check for other bank giro setting. is it take around 2-3 weeks to complete? cos i recently set my uob  citibank  ocbc giro application at same time to my uob bank account and just uob and citibank is completed.,btohqsg
hi all  i just applied for UOB KF. is it ever possible that the application will be accepted within a few hours? i already have UOB lady's  i thought it'd be immediate ü´†edit: nvm it just got approved 3 mins later!will there be a digital card though?,btohqsg
Why to UOB instead of HSBC EGA? üòÖ,btohqsg
cos i havent open account with hsbc. üòÇ,btohqsg
Your current statement needs to be manually paid as long as it does not indicate GIRO payment.,btohqsg
Time to do it physically now! ü§£ü§£,btohqsg

hey guys  for UOBKF  i still have some questions1. i own UOB lady's. do i qualify for the 5k bonus KF miles underWelcome Miles for first-time applicantsin their t&cs?2. for the 800 min spend on SIA-relatedHowever  the caveat is that the 3 mpd on everyday spend is only eligible if you spend a minimum of S$800 on the SIA-related categories annually  the SIA related are only these -- 'Singapore Airlines  Scoot  KrisShop  Kris+ purchases'? for Kris+ purchases  it's basically just entering the merchant name and paying with the QR code via google pay / apple pay?for #2  if i hit the 800 annual min spend  i get 3mpd on the other categories e.g.  online shopping  online travel txns i.e.  using UOBKF directly to pay in tripdotcom/agoda/etc  dining  etc?,btohqsg
The $800 min spend does not include Kris+,btohqsg
