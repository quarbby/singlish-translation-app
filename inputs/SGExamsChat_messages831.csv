While the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme is a way for students to use their talents to get into their school of choice  critics say the scheme benefits the rich.20 years on  the DSA is super competitive.

n levels day 1 was on skills and qualities based on people cycling a unicycle,btohqsg
why do I feel like o level day 1 is easier than n levels 1 day,btohqsg
Because you were unprepared for n levels,btohqsg
i meant if i got the o levels one I would‚Äôve done better,btohqsg
+ questions were easy to predict ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
With the knowledge you had at n levels?,btohqsg
you do know that n level topics can be harder than o‚Äôs right?,btohqsg
but the standards might be different,btohqsg
whatever i probably am not in the right mind to even talk rn lmao,btohqsg

At least some don't leave you on read,btohqsg
Sometimes I just forget like legit lmao,btohqsg

not just USA but businesses supported/invested/back by Israel & it's citizens,btohqsg
Tbh even if we dont buy starbucks its not gonna make a difference,btohqsg
no one really cares in a country like singapore,btohqsg
i think a LOT of people gave up on boycotting companies in general,btohqsg
iirc last i heard as to boycott the three main companies that are pro-Isrealstarbucksdisneymcdonalds,btohqsg
i never bought starbucks drinks anyways,btohqsg
anyone knows a place where i can practice sci practical at a reasonable cost,btohqsg
actl a lot of people boycott starbucks under the belief that the boycott was for palestine,btohqsg
in actual fact the boycott was started because they felt injustice over the starbucks worker union leader being fired for sharing their stance on being pro-palestine,btohqsg
I managed to score well for sci practical even without prior practice during a school exam,btohqsg
Hmm didnt know you were here as well,btohqsg
been consolidating notes for past topics lately,btohqsg
i think the last time i drank Starbucks was on 2022,btohqsg
I am always here Mayushii kor kor,btohqsg
i knew this was part of the few reasons why they eventually got heavily boycotted by members of the public,btohqsg
isn't sci practical just follow instructions,btohqsg

Asking about NUSI am an Egyptian student who is currently in high school I will finish after 1 year  I really want to apply to this University because I know it is the suitable university for meI want to apply for a scholarship for a double degree in BBA(bachelor in Business administration) and BSC(bachelor in Computer science)I have already searched a lot about this university but all the data I found is that it is v v hard to join I don't know If my skills fit their requirements and I also found that it has a 5% acceptance rate onlyIf anyone here got accepted into it can help me and tell me what they requireMy knowledge I started learning German and Python since 2020 and stopped in 2023 I have a B1 in German and good knowledge of Python and in 2023 started learning solidity and knew the fundamentals My prediction for my final high school year is a 4.0 GPA and my IELTS score 6.5 this is my expectations based on my ability and free tests,btohqsg
Minimum admission requirement for IELTS is 7.0 average.4.0 out of ?. GPA is not exactly a standardised measure.I recommend you take SAT and/or ACTs to supplement your GPA.,btohqsg
Ok np I will retake IeltsI didn't take a exam I just converted my expectations in last high school year to GPA which is a grading systemBut should I take Act or Sat ?,btohqsg
Applicants with international qualification will be considered for admission based on one of the following:a) At least 5 AP courses; orb) ACT with Writing  and at least 3 AP courses; orc) SAT  and at least 3 AP courses,btohqsg
Advanced Placement Test also admistered by the College Board,btohqsg
So I should look at college board website,btohqsg
Yes. For registration and administration of the tests.,btohqsg
So if I made Sat and took 5 Ap courses I will have a big advantage or what,btohqsg
Cuz I want to have an opportunity,btohqsg
No. Uqualifyyou are already automatically at a disadvantage because u are a foreigner.,btohqsg
Ah sh so how to have an advantage,btohqsg
I already have 1 year that I can sort things for myself,btohqsg
Sir do you know a method so I can see my acceptance rate,btohqsg
you have a very low chance of getting accepted at NUS honestly speaking,btohqsg
maybe at other universities  it's possible,btohqsg
I still have 1 year I can do anything in it and I can take 1 year gap,btohqsg
But I want to know what to do to have high acceptance rate,btohqsg
but need years of experience or volunteering job,btohqsg
If u don't hit the minimum entry requirements don't bother lmao,btohqsg
U have to at least qualify lmao,btohqsg
minimum to enter nus is 3.2,btohqsg
but i heard poly nursing students dn gpa to enter nus nursing,btohqsg
That's for Singaporeans using POLY GPA,btohqsg
Ah yes Egypt High School and a Poly Accredited Diploma is totally the same,btohqsg
u need multi years including serving national service here,btohqsg
U teach in the afternoon one rite?,btohqsg
Yeah after finishing bachelor I need to work for 3 years in Singapore based company,btohqsg
Ok and what to do to make my acceptance rate high,btohqsg
Cuz I want to enroll in this university so badly I will do anything so please help me,btohqsg
Tell me what to do to get enrolled,btohqsg
i assume is alr hard for local students to get spot in nus  for foreigners is even harder,btohqsg
there are smu  sim  suss  ntu too,btohqsg
ntu gpa is also quite high to enter,btohqsg
get a diploma in any local poly in sg then apply uni w a good gpa,btohqsg
but there is also entry and educational requirements to enter local poly in sg,btohqsg
So it is impossible for international students,btohqsg
Not impossible. As u said yourself 5% is about right,btohqsg
not impossible  but very low chance,btohqsg
Ah but still there is hope so how to use it,btohqsg
sg students enter nus alr very difficult plus nus give sgporeans priority,btohqsg
I am sure that in the last year of high school I will get minimum 4.0 gdp,btohqsg
i also don‚Äôt know. i still in sg local poly studying. sgporean here struggling to enter nus w a 3.6 gpa.,btohqsg
4.0/? What is the total maximum aggregate attainable?,btohqsg
according to my own projections i am falling far behind,btohqsg
I mean for Ap or GT 5.8,btohqsg
I am talking about my last high school year,btohqsg
especially if you want those popular niche courses,btohqsg
^ how would u project your rebasement,btohqsg
even then  NUS damn hard to get enrolled,btohqsg
Oh ffs. How did u project a 4.0? Because that entails perfect grades,btohqsg
I know my abilities and based on the year when I studied hard I got very good grades so I will study very very hard to get this score,btohqsg
you are saying that you scored the FULL amount of gpa points but according to the information you've provided us  you've only scored NEAR the full sum,btohqsg
I said I fucked up I scored 95%,btohqsg
When I searched on Google I found a miss information so I was wrong,btohqsg
But in percentage i got 95%,btohqsg
i know but E120 was asking how would you project a 4.0 perfect gpa,btohqsg
E120 I didn't mean perfect score I meant 95%,btohqsg
That's a projected 3.8 u don't just assume u can do it. Don't count your chickens before they hatch,btohqsg
why's everyone waking up on the wrong side of bed today üòûüòû,btohqsg
hello  how's the day going like for you,btohqsg

search on other high school qualifications,btohqsg
Because u never wake me up,btohqsg
My education is not any from the provided so I am in other high school qualifications,btohqsg
why do you keep replying to the sgexams portal message,btohqsg
i wait for that one day to see E120 acting cute / coquettish once again,btohqsg
Ok sorry now I am in the group,btohqsg
she meant why didn‚Äôt you reply to our messages directly instead of replying to the sg exams portal portfolio msg,btohqsg
Cuz I wasn't in the group and I didn't notice that I was doing that,btohqsg
?? if you're not in the group then how are you replying or texting here,btohqsg
From the comment section on the sg exams,btohqsg
I was in that channel so the only way I can access the chat was from there,btohqsg
But now I joined the group,btohqsg
This is a comment on sg exam,btohqsg
And this is a normal message in the group,btohqsg
lmao  no wonder the person keep on replying to that pinned message,btohqsg
Found this and would like to share,btohqsg

Taking the EL oral tmr as a private candidate  anyone knows where to report for oral ? Is it the specific school Hall or classroom? Tq,btohqsg

or go to the school general office,btohqsg

The oral is usually in the hall?,btohqsg
not sure coz some school hall not enough space,btohqsg
A private candidate will usually take the school candidate right ?,btohqsg
u gg which school to take your private candidate exams?,btohqsg
private candidates are just pretty much a homeschooled or home study student that comes down to the assigned school for their exams only,btohqsg
i don't recall private candidates needing to do anything extra,btohqsg
just bring your materials  ezlink or nric + entry proof can le,btohqsg
RI student disciplined for dressing up as dark-skinned delivery rider on Racial Harmony DayRI‚Äôs principal Aaron Loh said the student who was ‚Äúdressed inappropriately‚Äù had taken the photo ‚Äúas part of current trends around social media memes involving a basketballer‚Äù.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://tdy.sg/3YmjMun,btohqsg
"why they(RI and schools in general) aren't taking action against bullying cultures but taking action against these ""racism"" actions?",btohqsg
RI got alot of bullying culture meh,btohqsg
unless im living under a rock,btohqsg
me joining 2 ccas isn't as heavy loaded as the shit you go through in teee peeee,btohqsg
i nearly joined the singing one,btohqsg
Bullying isn't very obvious to external observers without real video to prove it,btohqsg
So they can sweep the incidents under the rug,btohqsg
actually this applies with a lot of toxic situations as well,btohqsg
so long as no evidence/proof/witnesses standing up in short,btohqsg
Its always the incidents that get circulated online,btohqsg
Only then will reactive action take place to prevent it from tarnishing their reputation,btohqsg
So if you're bullied  don't just tell a teacher,btohqsg
record audio  video  whatever it is,btohqsg
anyone experienced being the passenger to reckless/speed driving because i feel so disoriented from the way my dad drove over 100kmph and nearly hit other drivers as well,btohqsg

sometimes teacher js dont care even if u tell,btohqsg
lads does attendance matter for gsm in poly üò≠,btohqsg
im assuming gsm is some module or class,btohqsg
but tbh it depends on the poly you attend,btohqsg
ya you need to at least have decent attendance,btohqsg
pass/fail modules cannot go wrong de,btohqsg
unless u fucked up somewhere else,btohqsg
A basketball coach is being investigated for allegedly charging parents fees to get their children into top schools through the Direct Admissions Scheme.https://str.sg/yd6j,btohqsg
once reach 70%  grade cap D or fail,btohqsg
but gsm got grade cap ah,btohqsg
yall different poly so should be different procedures,btohqsg
in ite  it's run on baa(behaviour and attendance) aka 2 in 1 instant mix,btohqsg
once your attendance rate hits below 80%  you'll get debarred from taking any module examinations or being graded for it,btohqsg
u need fill up appeal form if u kena debar,btohqsg
if your appeal form is not satisfactory or decent enough to be appealed successfully  it's game over,btohqsg
Yeah  it's the Âä†Ë≥ÄÂ∏Ç Kaga  not the IJN one,btohqsg
I thought the battleship was sunk,btohqsg
attendance fall below 80% cannot take exan and have to retain,btohqsg
imagine you turn up for exam with 0% preparations due to whatever reasons like playing truant or personal matters,btohqsg
technically you cld be more efficient studying by yourself taking half the time tho,btohqsg
might as well go private or go jc instead,btohqsg
but for those who lack the options  it's a longer route but it does work most of the time,btohqsg
im pretty sure one if my classmates did that lol  idk how he advance to the next sem,btohqsg
can advance to next sem one,btohqsg
i know someone who scored 1+ points for gpa,btohqsg
1.1 might as well drop out,btohqsg
he comes to school most of the time,btohqsg
is linked to chen engi in poly,btohqsg
like tht cant graduate step out to work with only o level?,btohqsg
but the cert from sch is more recognised that's why?,btohqsg
or that it's easier to get into higher educational pathways or careers as compared to totally without a post secondary cert,btohqsg
but with working experience i guessed?,btohqsg
ya but companies prefers education or working experience  if not both most of the time,btohqsg
i think bcoz of the elite education system?,btohqsg
is that accounting for majority of singpaorean students?,btohqsg
it's just regulations placed by the educational system,btohqsg
i think you're missing the issue here,btohqsg
are you currently studying in a sg poly or ite?,btohqsg
it's a yes or no question but ok,btohqsg
then i can use that very same logic and say whatever opinions you're dumping here is useless,btohqsg
might as well go complain to school management or MOE,btohqsg
you do realize that you're talking about very little situations that people may be accounted for? sure  that works for primary and secondary levels but polys and ites usually have different types of exams but still graded for an estimation of their gpawhat you're saying is more so for THEORY work  what aboutpracticalwork stuff? group projects  presentations  industry attachments(internships) etc? THESE literally account how you behave/act/study in school which acts as a baseline before students were to officially step into the workforce IF they haven't alreadyi never denied you of your opinion so why are you persistent on getting answers from me when im not even some encyclopedia,btohqsg
gpa is graded on a few things herebaa ( behaviour  attitude & attendance ) PLUS your classwork/exam graded work,btohqsg
if ur so concerned about the role of attendance in ur grades then why didnt u go to jc(ofc attendance still matters) but ofc u didnt cuz u couldnt ah,btohqsg
the fact that he sounded like some jc kid with an elitist mindset is crystal clear from his responses,btohqsg
how many times must i tell you,btohqsg
you come here to tell us this opinion of yours  damn useless one,btohqsg
you're the one that asked for it,btohqsg
i just said you seemed like some elitist student to me,btohqsg
"LOL says the person that said ""where im studying at is irrelevant""",btohqsg
i just asked a simple question you could've answered,btohqsg
lol this guy's playing the ÁôΩËé≤Ëä±Êù°Ë∑Ø@furina_0413,btohqsg

Go to any biz sch and might be way worse cuz u be playing chess not checkers and dealing with simple name calling alr,btohqsg

idk but just wanna cfm general sentiments that ppl know abt recycling,btohqsg
but there being an intention behavioural gap which requires behavioural intervention?,btohqsg
But would people be willing to recycle even when incentives are provided?,btohqsg
bcuz in sg  sticks appear to be more effective in behavioural intervention  as compared to carrots,btohqsg
how did u gather that conclusion,btohqsg
cus tray return with fine was more effective than free kopitiam coffee for tray returns,btohqsg
Unless you telling me there is a garbage truck for plastic metal and paper individually..what is the point of separating out the recyclable materials,btohqsg
They all gonna end up in one large bin inside the trucks,btohqsg
That is something I realise very early on about recycling in Singapore,btohqsg
Omg how did you know that? Technically I saw the cleaners pour everything into the same bin last year so I felt it didn't matter.But I just have to do some research on how students recycle cus it's for a marketing project. It's not on the recycling process and facilities to sort and stuff like that,btohqsg
I mean if you are talking about actions of students regarding recycling...Most will try to do it if there is a recycling bin infront of them...but we ain't gonna go out of our way to find one of those bins,btohqsg
You do realise that all your recycled material gets dumped into a garbage truck that does not separate anything whatsoever,btohqsg
Haha most peeps don't know this fact,btohqsg
there used to be 2 trucks last time right?,btohqsg
It don't matter those trucks those seperate the products,btohqsg
What happens  the trash bags inside each get tied then thrown into the garbage truck,btohqsg
Hey but still they end up here üò≠,btohqsg
Why is water spilling out of the truck?,btohqsg
people who throw plastic with liquids inside,btohqsg

private diploma doesn't mean private poly  right??,btohqsg
I think he just means that,btohqsg
that's like saying someone's taking national exams despite being older than a typical student's agewithout saying they're a private candidate,btohqsg
ik ah but it sounds weird,btohqsg
idk  seems like it's the same logical process behind someone saying they're taking private poly instead of saying they're taking private diploma to me,btohqsg
ya but when someone says they're taking national exams  would you think they're a private candidate or ordinary schooling student?,btohqsg
if he says private A Level   it is pretty clear,btohqsg
i meant if they say it without the word private in their messages or wtv,btohqsg
i like thinking of what if scenarios,btohqsg

pc gamers are hardly a rare sight as compared to arcaders,btohqsg
like when you compare the frequency between the two,btohqsg
pc gamers probably more than that of regulars at arcades,btohqsg
Arcade games are a scam bruh price gouging be crazy,btohqsg
