I usually only reset ocbc balance if there's other promotion around... For example  I hopped onto HSBC EGA LNY promo which gives up to 4.6% (for 1st mth on incremental ABD)  while taking the opportunity to reset my ocbc balance. If no promo  I don't mind the additional $500/mth accumulating inside.,btohqsg
for spending minimum and credit salary + giro tax = which bank is best? still UOB?,btohqsg
But if your MAB hits above 100k which it only earn min interest 0.05%  wont be that time to do the reset?,btohqsg
If I can empty out my UOB One account in April or May  will I be able to get the promo cash credit?,btohqsg
cannot.. the reference month is fixed..IT IS MARCH 2024 MONTHLY AVERAGE BALANCE,btohqsg
Looks like almost every year interest rate will cutting,btohqsg

the bank rates have been moving in the same direction as US Fed rates. see from 2019 to 2020 covid when fed brought rates to zero  then 2021 onwards when rates spiked  and now cooling off in 2024,btohqsg
Are u going show hand $150k into MooMoo? 😂,btohqsg
You can try 🤡 I'm sure I was quite clear with what I typed.,btohqsg
totally 2 separate products.. not comparable.,btohqsg
is $1K the minimum amount for UOB1?,btohqsg
yes.. to avoid $5 fall below fee,btohqsg
No  thanks. Will leave my funds there for now. 😂,btohqsg
I think we shouldnt rush to think where to move the funds to. Everything is interconnected. Bank lower interest -> FD/SSB lower interest -> MMF lower interest. I think we need to give time for the changes to be completed and dust to settle down before we think of our next step. On silver lining  for those who waiting for S-REITS  it may be a good time soon to invest.,btohqsg
not a single person has achieved this..this time snook us .. play MAB..haiz,btohqsg
got someone PM that he is NTB UOB.. SHOCKING...so that is at least a single person,btohqsg

Where should I invest during a recession ?,btohqsg
"I have reached out to Endowus clarifying on dividend withholding taxes on Amundi Prime USA Fund and BlackRock iShares US Index fund and here is the response.""For the Amundi Prime USA Fund  as a UCITS unit trust fund  it is subject to a 30% DWT. These taxes are handled on the fund level which means that we do not incur any additional taxes as an investor in Singapore. We have an article that covers this topic in more detail here:https://endowus.com/insights/an-inconvenient-truth-tax-on-us-listed-etfs-04c7532c5dFor the BlackRock iShares US Index Fund  as it uses E-mini futures to replicate the S&P 500 index  it is thus not subject to any dividend-withholding tax  because there are no dividends to be had (the dividend 'value' is booked in the NAV). This means that the index fund using synthetic replication will benefit from an additional 15% of dividend values compared to UCITS ETFs  and an additional 30% when compared to UCITS unit trusts (like the Amundi fund) and US-domiciled ETFs.""",btohqsg

Hi all experts  I noticed that I don’t have money bull feature on my Webull.. is it worth to activate this money bull and deposit money in?,btohqsg
Bcos of opportunity cost... I've maxed out on other higher saving accounts so my next best option is only 3.6% esaver / isavvy promotion. For each $500 @ 4.1%  I only lose $1.6x per mth. But if I switch my 100k from ocbc 360 into a 3.6% account  I'll be losing 0.4% on 100k  which is about $41.x... Therefore  I rather not do the reset every alternate month  unless I have another account which can get me at least 4%.,btohqsg
Try set up alipay or wechat pay and see if can use card link to pay the agency qr,btohqsg
What has this got to do with webull,btohqsg
