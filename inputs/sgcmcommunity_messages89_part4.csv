But diesel leh. Not sure how it will work out after 2025,btohqsg
The engineering behind it is fascinating,btohqsg
such a good engine also no use in sg,btohqsg
You probably never use the 3rd turbo,btohqsg
But I wonder wgats the torque like at higher revs,btohqsg
Will still work out. Only new ones no more selling,btohqsg
yes i know  what i meant was the value of the diesel cars  will demand be more or less,btohqsg
and whether the gov will revise the road tax structure to be less in favor for diesel,btohqsg
i think this is a possibility,btohqsg
760nm stock and great fc what’s not to like,btohqsg
if they really want to flush out or phase out all the consumer diesels  they could increase the road tax by a lot,btohqsg
im a aural guy  the glb diesel just didnt cut it. torque was good  but that rattle,btohqsg
discourages me to go fast lol,btohqsg
i wonder if they have akra for it i’ve actually never dived into diesel exhausts,btohqsg
