Whr was this information even sourced from sia hahha,btohqsg
Idw keep my hopes too high. Just gonna set my mind to receive around Christmas ü•≤,btohqsg
I suspect 13th Dec  because it'll be 51 days since the application close.And it'll be quite late relative to all the launches from 2022 onwards.Likely not after Christmas as it'll be the longest waiting time already,btohqsg
Yess but its one of the biggest launch tho 14 projects HAHA A,btohqsg
sure  I got the data from the general discussion channel of this group haha,btohqsg
So far anyone got missing profile?,btohqsg
No. I can still see the JW application in my profile,btohqsg
Then like abit hard to be tmr :(,btohqsg
As much as I want it to be tmr haha,btohqsg
I know we can only wait for it to be out but,btohqsg
Idk possible for result to launch with no missing profiles?,btohqsg
I dunno. Previously I only see when hdb send me msg,btohqsg
Hi ballot results is what date,btohqsg
From an applicant who wrote in to HDB regarding results release,btohqsg
Hi all  it's 3rd or 4th week of Dec.,btohqsg

Hi all  know there‚Äôs some stress about HFE deadline and how the re-application of HFE works. Pls see below for the letter that was sent to an applicant1 month before expiry of HFE- you canrenewrather than reapply and redo everything,btohqsg

For my HFE  I don't have to submit any docs. Just enter the payslip information for the past 12 months. Approval usually quite fast,btohqsg
Just don't cancel ur existing HFE as it will still be validWhen ur new HFE application is in process,btohqsg
anyone know how many maintenance prior to this? ü§£ my friend told me when he BTO few launches back it was 3-4 maintenance before getting the results,btohqsg
I am expecting the BTO results to be out by 20th December 2024,btohqsg
are you getting fixed salary?cos mine isnt. and previously i was asked alot of documents for my first hfe. and im resubmitting to get new hfe in case i dont get decent q for this ballot.,btohqsg
ah thanks. hope mine get renew fast enough. or even better my oct ballot is within supply then no need apply for feb. lol,btohqsg
Anyone notice changes to buyer‚Äôs profile?,btohqsg
Pasir Ris BTO got reports of missing profile,btohqsg
I guess taman jurong not overly subscribe so everyone gets a queue number,btohqsg
This is considered missing profile right,btohqsg
Bro good luck.. just take this indicator with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
How to get to this page?,btohqsg
How should a normal profile look like?,btohqsg
"There should be the project name there. Instead of ""you have not created a search profile yet""",btohqsg
Thanks! So without the project name = no q no isit?,btohqsg
Apparently it's highly correlated with not getting a q no. But a few ppl didn't did get a q no.,btohqsg
Even if under your flat applications they show the project you applied for?,btohqsg
apparently if ur profile goes missing it means u wont get a q number at all    some people who have balloted a few times before say this is a common thing that happens 1-2 weeks before the q numbers r released   ,btohqsg
May I know how it got debunked?,btohqsg
Taman Jurong 2 room flats oversubscribed,btohqsg
Just checked  no updates at all,btohqsg
Wait & see how accurate this prediction is ü§£,btohqsg
Shall be any day next week,btohqsg
As after next week is christmas,btohqsg
Any Canberra vista here got your key ready?,btohqsg
