Last year my classmates all study wrong topic,btohqsg
We all thot korean war gonna come out,btohqsg
wait last year what was it ah,btohqsg
what was the trend for SEQ the past few years,btohqsg
Last year they havent test korean war in almost a decade and it was the 70th anniversary of korean war,btohqsg
so to celebrate it they want to test the korean war qns,btohqsg
Our teacher thot it was  korean war,btohqsg
why would they want to celebrate...,btohqsg
Here's what they said after I msg them,btohqsg
Idw send in other chat cos I scared bot ban me for promo,btohqsg
the korean war was to reunite the two koreas  and they failed to do so 70 years ago so it's not something to celebrate abouta better would be 'commemorate',btohqsg
sorry for being so serious but yeah it's still a sensitive topic,btohqsg
ooo I think i might get 10/10,btohqsg
Anyone here using legion 5 pro,btohqsg
Wtf I circled ‚Äúwith‚Äù and change to ‚Äúwhen‚Äù,btohqsg
Was the same as 2019 p1 section B,btohqsg
the same exact passage or from the same book,btohqsg
I checked and it's similar but not the same,btohqsg
its okay guys no more english alr,btohqsg
Ahh lucky I don't take hist,btohqsg
Guys rmbr when we predicted speech for today,btohqsg
everybody in my class also sia,btohqsg
us O level psychics fail again : ),btohqsg
i mean act we cldve predicted email also,btohqsg
i thought kw is very rare,btohqsg

omg i was gna put malala,btohqsg
a lot of ppl put greta manüò≠üò≠,btohqsg

tbh i think i messed up paper 1 ü•≤,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA wat did u write abt tiktok,btohqsg
I SAY PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND LIKE help ppl w ed and stuff,btohqsg
IDK WHAT I DID MAN üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
bro‚Ä¶ tbh that‚Äôs quite a good idea HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
i think it‚Äôs a solid example ngl,btohqsg
RLLY MEH i heard a lot of ppl put that,btohqsg
just stressing out abt hist now tbh ü•≤,btohqsg
ya bro greta and tiktok was smt a lot of ppl talk abt üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
I smack u with my potato,btohqsg
Then shove it in your mouth to make mashed potato,btohqsg
i think the whole sg got psychic üò™,btohqsg
i also put the same thing lol rip,btohqsg
yeah a lot of ppl put that,btohqsg
i only put greta and malala in intro,btohqsg
and only use malala as an example,btohqsg
i explained about her story in quite a lot of detail,btohqsg
bc i don't rmb anything about greta lol,btohqsg
imagine greta finding out the whole country wrote about her on the same day at the same time,btohqsg
ok i mean she is famous so,btohqsg
no some put only greta and some put only malala,btohqsg
aint she like our age or sumtin,btohqsg
i just put in intro oni,btohqsg
all my friends put greta lmao,btohqsg
yeah that's why it's fitting because the qn referred to young people,btohqsg
the only thing i rmb about greta was 'bla bla bla' and that she went to the climate summit by paddling on her boat,btohqsg
thus i only could use malala as example bc her story i could rmb,btohqsg
no ? i dont think u need to explain her origin story or smn lol i just wrote how she has an impact on today's youth since she is a role model and a voice for young people and somemore bs,btohqsg
omg lol she took the boat instead of the plane even tho she was sea sick or smn right,btohqsg
yep! but I explained the hardship malala went through to help,btohqsg
lets focus on humans tmr wheee,btohqsg
i talk about her spreading more awareness and her advocating and going around the world for ted talks,btohqsg
yall need seq notes for those taking e geogg,btohqsg
a lot of my friends didn't choose qn5 tho,btohqsg
there is a bellcurve 4 english right‚Ä¶?,btohqsg
any of yall take core geog?,btohqsg
r u like good at plate tec,btohqsg
wait is qn 5 supposed to argumentative or what,btohqsg
I'm average at every topic üò≠,btohqsg
omgggg i wrote it as argumentative lol bc they ask what's your opinion so i thought it was what's your stand,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry i never explained any of the points i said,btohqsg
Nah it's fine  you gave your opinion,btohqsg
I was being way too general,btohqsg
If u answer the qn still  can still get a B,btohqsg
Time to go do other things,btohqsg
I mean i did but i forgot,btohqsg
The only subject we can‚Äôt share ans is,btohqsg
1st point: young people have newer ideas and different perspectives to solve issues (eg. malala)2nd point: young people can use social media etc. to influence others (my eg. was the oxygen donation to India on Instagram)counter-argument(bc i thought it was argumentative): idk what was it but my eg. was school shooting(most of the aggressors are students/youth)rebuttal: young people can educate older generation,btohqsg
is this okay? i v scared lol,btohqsg
Lord if only there‚Äôs a way,btohqsg
do a quick read thru all the notes,btohqsg
History have sbq so if u good at it I think can,btohqsg
You burn the notes then put into water,btohqsg

then use touchscreenn comppp with styluss,btohqsg
Nvm I use pen and paper,btohqsg
Theres apps on pc which can help do this,btohqsg
okok one last thing  I think greta didn't change much climate-related issues. so maybe that's why i didn't use her as example,btohqsg
i mean she only raise awareness,btohqsg
She tried to change the world,btohqsg
yeah but no actual change happening. but i appreciate her for that,btohqsg
Good thst u didnt referenced her,btohqsg
yeah if only we were like her üò≠,btohqsg
I mean if the marker close eye say she change things then sure,btohqsg
but the thing is so many ppl put greta,btohqsg
yeah but if you go into details then,btohqsg

If you become a doctor in the future    you can prove to others that doctors don‚Äôt necessarily have ugly handwriting.,btohqsg
I think Chiropractor no need Chemistry.,btohqsg
Need to see where to crack,btohqsg
Wait lmao guys just checking for the el essay q6 was discursive ah I wrote as argu bruh,btohqsg
anybody got like cmc or kw e hist notes ü•≤,btohqsg
wah i opposite with u I write q5 as argumentative,btohqsg
cause they say how far u agree right,btohqsg
Cause q6 said what r u views isn't that discursive die liao,btohqsg
yea but actually if u wrote 2v1 ure fine,btohqsg
i hv! but its summarised version tho if udm,btohqsg
qn6 was how far u agree,btohqsg
qn5 is what r ur views,btohqsg
So for like q6 I wrote 2 point 1counter then rebut,btohqsg
Wait isnt it what is your opinion,btohqsg
argu is usually opinion and disc is usually a facf,btohqsg
qn 6 is a opinion so its argu,btohqsg
that's what I thought.... wait isn't qn 5,btohqsg
Oh ok thank God tks tks,btohqsg
yea qn 5 was like young ppl r changing the world for better wht r ur views,btohqsg
they asked for your views but tbh expository and argumentative,btohqsg
2v1 is fine as ling as u have strong points,btohqsg
I wish i could unsee the messages,btohqsg
ik qn6 was how far u agree,btohqsg
that means qn5 is argu and qn5 is disc if you say it like that,btohqsg
5 is what is your opinion,btohqsg
6 is what are your views,btohqsg
wait wasnt it like how far u agree?,btohqsg
yea but generally its askin for YOUR opi or like ur stand,btohqsg
no qn 5 is young people r changing the world for the better so its an opinion because its not a fact,btohqsg
that's why u say qn 5 is opinion  and u also said opinion is argu,btohqsg
okay thank you for the reassurance!,btohqsg
np ngl ive been doung that forever regardless whether its expository or argu,btohqsg
as long as thr is a contrast between ur stand and ur like ‚Äúrebuttal‚Äù,btohqsg
so if u write all 3 positive then gg to uü§°,btohqsg
nope mine is stand 1  stand 2  counter-argument  rebuttal  conclusion,btohqsg
But can also be 3 positive,btohqsg
if its argu like qn6 and u write 2v2 then might b some prob,btohqsg
You need counter argument then rebuttal,btohqsg
yea but to that u oso have to counter,btohqsg
like u say so positive right thr has to be like,btohqsg
its ur opin but has to be at least one negative to back it up,btohqsg
it's up to the Cambridge markers then,btohqsg
So my only mistake on 5 is i made a thesis statement instead of making a stand for intro,btohqsg
qn5 is discursive so if u write 2v2 or 2v1 u good,btohqsg
Mine is 3 PEEL positive + conclusion,btohqsg
yea but most of the time they discourage cuz it makes ur compo super boring,btohqsg
cambridge markers have gotten bored and,btohqsg
I did that for prleims also,btohqsg
HUH I WROTE ALL 3 AGREE EH,btohqsg
they draw a line then just write,btohqsg
Guys yall still talking abt it üíÄ,btohqsg
why u send AFTER the paper finish üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Damn it's over alr but thank you so much still,btohqsg
like the point of of a counter argu is to keep the marker interested,btohqsg
Oh man i just realised that was bad timing sorry yall,btohqsg
'many students brought up greta thunberg and malala',btohqsg
bro i brought up tiktok sm,btohqsg
Cus i see nobody talking about eng in chat that‚Äôs why i never send,btohqsg

And he really got A2 for English O's,btohqsg
So I guess last year was just a normal one,btohqsg
why some ppl say got Bell curve some say no have,btohqsg
There is bell curve but one shouldn‚Äôt like rely too much on it.,btohqsg
moderation ‚â† bellcurve  bellcurve means fixed no. of ppl get whatever grade  moderation is just regulation based on difficulty of paper/how well candidates do ect,btohqsg
