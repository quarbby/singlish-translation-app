And yes the system of having to pay for the COE first‚Ä¶.. actually this is not a problem ‚Ä¶. The bank will lend cos its fully secured‚Ä¶.. u dun pay  I surrender ur paper to LTA,btohqsg
this is a chicken an egg problem. buyers have asked ADs to package COE with the car for decades. Their entire pricing system works on a package. So they are reluctant to decouple car and COE but they will do it if you are buying a car from them worth the trouble. But if you are just buying a corolla why should they bother when they can just sell another 853 to someone else who wants a simpler package deal,btohqsg
And that's where policies are a little weird. On one hand advocating financial prudence and serviceable debt ratios. On the other hand  allow loans for a non-tangible-asset i.e. COE - where is a license to own a vehicle. I don't recall any other license or certificates that are recognized and can obtain a bank loan to repay the license fees. Only our dearest COE.,btohqsg
Exactly!!!! It‚Äôs the ADs and not the buyers,btohqsg
No   self bid coe also can be loan   my car loan also includes coe and I bid +15% to gurantee the coe,btohqsg
yes fair point  COE loans do exist. The interest rates are not on par with car loan prices though. And this still begs the question  if its so easy to get a COE  then why dont buyers buy them? I dont think potential rejection by AD is a good enough reason. I still think buyers are lazy or uninformed,btohqsg
This is the no 1 brainchild of dun which 3 great scholars ( Â§ß‰∏âÂÖÉÔºâ,btohqsg
No paper‚Ä¶.Every 2 weeks collect cash flow,btohqsg
btw i am not an AD. not trying to defend them. just trying to take a balanced view. ADs are in business to make money so they give customers what they want. I dont think its correct or fair to blame ADs for our system,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok lah   either u have done it or u have not asked around before‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
If u are buying   ironically   the super cars  yes u can bid yourself and they will sell to u,btohqsg
But will leak some news say u Bo liao  bid your own   so silly,btohqsg
Premium for COEs cannot be financed by bank loan. All must be fully paid before you can purchase a vehicle from a dealer. That will be the day!,btohqsg
ADs want to make money. Walk into any premium dealer with COE in hand and i guarantee you they will sell you a car with little or no financial penalty,btohqsg
Be careful what you wish for  cos if this happens  90% of current car buying public will probably never be able to afford a car lol,btohqsg
Maybe = No loan  less demand. Less demand  less costly COEs.,btohqsg
Sorry ah‚Ä¶. So if I want to renew a COE and I want a loan   I have to sell it to a dealer and buy back from dealer is it? Thanks,btohqsg
yes also possible. But always remember you are competing against people with a lot of money. In a situation where loans are not possible for COEs  you might see a very small % of people with cash to burn buying tons of 'cheap' COE/cars and squeezing out everyone else,btohqsg
at least loans will help to level the playing field a bit,btohqsg
Already many banks exit the car loans biz Liao,btohqsg
Valid points. But at the end of the day  loans inflate the affordability which results in higher prices. That's only good for the person collecting the premiums.,btohqsg
you will probably borrow from finance company and chop you nicely on interest rates,btohqsg
Blame it on the vanity lah of Sporeans :),btohqsg
Now is it max Loan 90? Or 70? Maybe can do like property  lower the LTV‚Ä¶. Might make it more balanced or reduce LTV for Cat B,btohqsg
it might be. But i think the only way to know for sure is to see what happens when they stop COE loans which probably wont happen. I am in the camp that COE loans will mean more equitable ownership distribution of cars (meaning not only very rich people get to own cars) but yes it might come at the expense of higher COE prices,btohqsg
Now is 40% down for bigger car   buy a lot of ppl go piDo 100% loan to pay high interest,btohqsg
"Car loans are 60 or 70% max. But there are ""loopholes""",btohqsg
Okie like the XX years old trick of over trade,btohqsg
Your views registered and I think they are valid. But abolishing COE loans are not in the interest of the controlling party - hence it is unlikely to ever see its day in light.,btohqsg
Actually is not loopholes   just a scheme   last time when I started work and loan 10 years with overtrade   when car is 9 years old I scrap it and got to pay 32 k,btohqsg
It‚Äôs silly to pay so much for most of us‚Ä¶. So it‚Äôs up to us to change our lifestyles:),btohqsg
Ya overtrade to reduce the down payment but u loan for 10 years with 3% intreast is pay until heart pain   even u scrap car still have to top up 32 k . Imagine car is total lost   sure lose money like crazy,btohqsg
That why they like u to sign 10 years loan   can milk u 10 years high interest,btohqsg
They will get u to trf the vehicle to them 1st. They will renew the coe and also the loan then they trf the vehicle back to u. Maybe u can check out platinum motoring,btohqsg
Thanks‚Ä¶ no wonder sometimes they will say one owner but 01 transfer due to COE loan,btohqsg
Then that‚Äôs where you are absolutely wrong. Bank will give loan based on collateral. And are you aware that if there is unused coe  you are able to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the coe back and get refunds? That is where the collateral is,btohqsg
It is because the coe has a guaranteed value (the remaining unused value) in a case of default by the debtor.Same as some insurance policies  with guaranteed 1st day value at 80% of the insurance policy. You are able to get a bank loan (premium financing) on it as well.Perhaps you should look into why coe is an asset that banks accept.,btohqsg
Sell Japanese car no future sia,btohqsg
Today you pay  say 100k for a 10yr coe. You take a bank loan and service for 2 years and you go into default. The bank is able to repossess your remaining 8 years coe  and it is guaranteed to be at 80k.Which other licenses have a guaranteed cash value?,btohqsg
When u default thet can sue you for bankruptcy,btohqsg
LoL for now is petrol vouchersüòÇ,btohqsg
Actually u can try that  u see if they charge u any lesser money.. they end up charging u admin charge or something. What's the point?,btohqsg
i have asked once or twice for price without COE. both times they discounted roughly whatever was the COE price at the time. it was not the exact COE price  they earned a few bucks  a very low 4 figure sum. i did not think it was unreasonable,btohqsg
this was many years ago btw,btohqsg
But is it worth the effort then? Since u are paying for a high priced item  what difference does it make then? I need to standby myself for a couple Wednesday to make sure I get my coe.. ü§®,btohqsg
worth the effort there and then? probably not. but it would work very well for a guy who maybe already bidded and secured his coe a few months back  at a lower price,btohqsg
AD discounts the coe price giving you a net lower price if you use your own COE. dealer wins  you win. makes sense to me,btohqsg
Cannot give you all perishable items leh,btohqsg
No lah‚Ä¶ I mean can claim free coconut drink from safra,btohqsg
I want one year free petrol supply,btohqsg
