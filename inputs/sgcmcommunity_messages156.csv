Everyone  please bear with the long message. Just a reminder to check your debit/credit card statements for unknown transactions. Just now I checked my wife's uob debit card statement and noticed a 1USD transaction charge. When I checked her bank account  uob refunded it but due to exchange rate  she was shortchanged 10cts. I called uob fraud hotline to report the unknown transaction and had the card blocked and cancelled.If you have a debit card  it's better to cancel and change to atm or credit card  because if encounter fraud on the debit card  your savings account tagged to the card would be emptied and likely unable to recover. Credit card is safer since you can call to report and bank would cancel the transaction. Use bank's notification to alert on even 1 cent transaction. Online shopping anyway now offer paynow etc so not having a debit card is not an issue  in fact having it now poses more risks compared to in the past.,btohqsg
It's my personal encounter  not spam 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Just double check if the $1 charge is it from some merchants or service provider will do $1 hold to verify your card,btohqsg
I encountered once  but its maybank. so its not only uob that has this problem. My advice is convenience may compromise security,btohqsg
But they will refund it after verification,btohqsg
the best is cancel the old card and reissue a new one,btohqsg
yes bro. my advice is cancel and issue nw one,btohqsg
Yeah  but usually the $1 charge refund is usually very fast. I read in straits times the scammers generated many credit card numbers and uses them like tikam tikam to see which are active  combined with the 3 digit numbers. Tokong.,btohqsg
Why your foot can drink things one.,btohqsg
Any1 using this in the car?,btohqsg
You can call up the bank to ask them to send sms to you if your card is used or transaction from your bank account,btohqsg
I use something like this  but different brand,btohqsg
Nope  it's not heating up or anything,btohqsg

Commercial vehicles cannot change sport rim，unless it like original from factory like Fiat's van.Because of the Goods they carries  can shatters replica sport rims and it can be road hazard,btohqsg
jokes aside you see way more commercial vehicles speeding than private,btohqsg
But sian car enthu will kena the most,btohqsg
no reason to put other road users at risk,btohqsg
They canChange to personal 🚗 lo.Can drive above 70km/hCan change bodywork kit rims etc.,btohqsg
Everyone rushing for time😅 commercial vehicles are not build to drive fast  their tyre and brake are not suitable.Especially if they are fully loaded with goods.Speed+weight = killer force.,btohqsg
There was a summon upload by a van driver for his rims and bodykits  he was fine around $800. Trying to find that photo😅,btohqsg
oh the irony. have to rush for time  but loweing the van make them have to drive slower in places with humps,btohqsg

Well it's almost the same because the premiums on the 520i much higher,btohqsg
And they've got stock of 530is leftover that they want to clear,btohqsg
But if you are planning to get 520i and get 530i at the same price,btohqsg
Do look into spec options though  sometimes AD 530i got less creature comforts and options than the 520i,btohqsg
Even though they are m sport so they have the better wheels and bodykit,btohqsg
530i luxury has more of the tech options,btohqsg

Local spec. Then know we won’t change tyres and will call for tow 🤣,btohqsg
IMO  calling for tow is less hassle than changing tyres 🛞,btohqsg
If the car comes with one  I will keep it there,btohqsg
Or else put in a can of tyre sealant and an air compressor,btohqsg
Keep it there for extra cushion incase kena rear ended 🙈 but some will remove for weight reduction .,btohqsg
i don’t know how to replace tyre. tbh I put there no use,btohqsg
the fuel saved from not keeping the spare tyre throughout the years could be more than the cost of towing to replace tyre  if it even happens?,btohqsg
Just pray you wont break down in the middle of nshw,btohqsg
