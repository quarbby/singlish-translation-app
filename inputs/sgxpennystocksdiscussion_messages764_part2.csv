🎉Pika World Daily Review – 21 Feb 2023🎉🧮Equity futures were flat🗽As investors look towards a data-heavy week  the equity market still feels the heat of interest rate hikes. In recent weeks  robust economic data and a relatively hawkish tone from Fed officials had paused the risk-on sentiment as traders re-assessed the terminal interest rate.📮What are our dishes today?📖At 10.45 pm  we will have the Manufacturing PMI  which we expect a modest improvement from 46.9 to 47.1. Service PMI should also see a climb from 46.8 to 47.1.The existing Home Sales figure for January will arrive at 11 pm and is expected to still see a slight tick up to 4.10M from 4.02M.It is Tuesday  21 Feb  at 9.02 am in Singapore and 8.02 pm in New York. So we can expect a swinging week again and hope for a splendid trading week!From your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg
