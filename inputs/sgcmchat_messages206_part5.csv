Could be Air suspension burst. Once that happens all 4 wheels falls to the ground. Can't move,btohqsg
actually thats plausible  he might have lost pressure on his system and deflated all 4 corners. Which would explain why he is driving his car around fully slammed trying to limp home,btohqsg
given the age/value of his car i am guessing he bought a pretty cheap air suspension system,btohqsg
