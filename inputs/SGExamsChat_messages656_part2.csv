U take over me then u will know the pain,btohqsg
I also dunno why I nothing better to do help out with questions sometimes in the homework chat,btohqsg
ik the lore but@chemceris it okay if i say or you rather not,btohqsg
"long story short the lore is that this guy who used to be active here called josh is also active in the sge discord (he is a key character) another key character is ntu cs student tatabusaever since young  i have always wanted to be a teacher  so that day we were discussing about it (cant rmb) and then tatabusa asked if i saw 5k as a fresh grad as a high pay. I said that I didnt think it was a very high pay and tatabusa then encouraged me to explore career options that yielded more than 5k.  Then josh  who thought 5k was a high pay  started to argue with tatabusa and it was quite messy.  the reason being josh is idealistic and more of a ""chase your dreams"" person while tatabusa is more money minded and places emphasis on financial gains. However  josh is quite unrealistic and fails to consider practicality at times when making certain comments.Josh also said some stuff to me that I felt was very ... So I shared what he said in Sge server in this chat since he is quite well known here  as I wanted to hear opinions of my friends such as kuro  rand and ytSome users here incl yt and@juicecogenswere unhappy with his remarks as they felt that he was too idealistic. I can't clearly remember what exactly happened but i think yt went to talk to tatabusa and josh on discord.  rand also joined the discord and made some comments to josh  which resulted in josh getting angry and posted the comment ""juicecogens can (perform sexual act )"" which has since been made into a sticker here. rand got banned from the discord for calling josh a circus animal.after that incident  the sge discord was in a mess so the admin decided to mute tatabusa and yt. If im not wrong  this led to yt losing his admin perms because of some stuff he said (which im not too sure of)Shortly after that incident  I had left the Sgexam discord and so did josh (he strongly dislikes Tatabusa and yt  and uses derogatory terms to refer to yt quite often  which makes me quite uncomfortable since i am friends with yt).I think the reason why Yt was banned in the sge discord was because of some remarks he made but im not too sure cause i was not in the discord server when he was banned",btohqsg
Bruh  why can’t some people act like adults,btohqsg
Want to make a mountain out of a molehill,btohqsg
you're expecting too much from a group of people that are quite literally kids,btohqsg
like it's not even an exaggeration,btohqsg
the general demographic of the discord is a lot younger,btohqsg
I can volunteer but just to ban bots that’s it,btohqsg
I don’t want to be responsible for anything else,btohqsg
most of them are my age,btohqsg
I didn’t even know sge had a discord until recently,btohqsg
yea i can add that. thanks for letting me know,btohqsg
But I guess I’m not joining it,btohqsg
Yeah esp after what yall said,btohqsg
I should just stick to helping ppl with Econs in the other chat and if I’m bored see what yall are discussing here,btohqsg
At least I would think the ppl here are more civilised than discord? I hope,btohqsg
i joined to try and see what's up,btohqsg
i am right no matter what,btohqsg
and actually tried to interact with them like normal people,btohqsg
i was gonna leave then i stayed because of you,btohqsg
majority of the chat is copypasta spamming,btohqsg
If rand likes drama he probably would’ve wanted to see the whole thing unfold lol,btohqsg
That’s the most dramatic thing I’ve heard of here,btohqsg
that drama is too stupid for even him,btohqsg
he can't control himself to just be an observer,btohqsg
I mean if U ignore general the server is pretty dead otherwise,btohqsg
it was the most ok when i was chatting in the channel about uni stuff lol,btohqsg
Well yeah sometimes it’s better to see less,btohqsg
at least i have direct contact with yomo now instead of him coming here to find me,btohqsg
Adults but still act like kids,btohqsg
Wtf u mean bro he is a boomer,btohqsg
@chemcer  at first he was a fledgling but ever since he said that,btohqsg
