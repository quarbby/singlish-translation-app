Hi all. If you're looking to invest in property purely for return. I have a income generating product that is much more liquid  no agent fee  no listing fee  no stamp duties. Purely monetary appreciation WITH CAPITAL GUATANTEED.Product is Avivas MyLifeIncome.Premium term can be single/3/5/10/15/20 years with accumulation period of minimum 2 years for 3 years premium term  5 years for single premium. Capital is guaranteed after accumulation period. Returns up to 3.88% after accumulation period of up to 99 years old.,btohqsg
It is usually compared to property investment because there are no fees to buy MyLifeIncome. While property income is taxable  insurance returns are not taxable. Generally higher than fixed deposit.Ultimately it is a short term investment  that is relatively much safer.,btohqsg
Be careful with the ‚Äúno fees‚Äù.,btohqsg
There are no fees except distrubtion expenses.,btohqsg
Which are also included in you premium.,btohqsg
If there is a brand new  freehold 2BR unit that‚Äôs $300k cheaper than a 99 years leasehold in the same vicinity  would this interest you?,btohqsg
Lol no fee u earn what comm from ur agency? Who will compare property investment to insurance? Not apple to apple,btohqsg
They've been in talks to enbloc for the longest time,btohqsg
Personally I think hard to get rental as well as to successfully enbloc (the most recent time they collected much less than the required 80%),btohqsg
Sure  I will PM u üòä,btohqsg
I was just pointing out to him regarding that. There are distribution expenses listed in the illustration  which goes into our commission. There are in fact some who would compare property investment to an endowment plan  although I agree it is not apple to apple.,btohqsg
My relative needs storage space to just store goods.any good property to recommend?She is looking for price appreciation or chances of enbloc in the future.,btohqsg
