And you are here assuming that someone chasing could add more safety than danger to this particular scenario,btohqsg
Going to be afternoon soon wonder what I should eat for lunch,btohqsg
Yes that could be a reason but all I'm saying is if the cop had not chased...then the only person that was most likely to get hurt was the crim himself,btohqsg
I never once mentioned others will never get hurt  I just said that he himself is the most likely to get hurt,btohqsg
A tp officer literally outlines it,btohqsg
The officer literally knew that authority was a reason which could result in someone running faster and harder,btohqsg
I don't understand why you facepalming tbh  all I basically said was.Sg should have a no pursuit policy because pursuits in general puts everyone around them in more danger for benefits that is negligible at best.Idk why y'all have to accuse me of assumptions  throw random facts at me etc. I don't understand in which part of my sentence requires me to know law or any part of crimes or how criminals think,btohqsg
every situation is different  blanket policies does nobody good,btohqsg
not everything in the world is linear and simple,btohqsg
Every situation is different but what other outcomes can you expect from a pursuit in sg,btohqsg
It's either the pursuit person dies  innocent person dies or criminal dies,btohqsg
have u ever thought of a situation whrnobodydies?,btohqsg
Yes but only a minority end up that way. Minority also end up with deaths. Most end up with injuries,btohqsg
it's like saying one firefighter die = we shldnt fight fires anymore,btohqsg
Na bro it's like saying a firefighter should never die because they can just avoid the bad fires.,btohqsg
aiya tldr let the professional make decisions,btohqsg
if you're not a professional then you're just a sinkie with a probably rubbish opinion,btohqsg
Exactly lmao I trust the officer to make a good faith decision based on the situation,btohqsg
Yes  tbh sg alr has a no pursuit policy. It's at the discretion of authority if they want to chase someone,btohqsg
Whatever I say I will never based it on opinion  it's based on facts and past records.If facts and past records prove me wrong then I will say I'm wrong. Idk why y'all keep thinking what I say are opinions,btohqsg
I literally told y'all so many times but y'all keep assuming what I say is opinions,btohqsg
so whr is your fact saying that no pursuit is an official TP policy?,btohqsg
ok ya so that's your opinion right,btohqsg
Yes that was a opinion but this was the statement that y'all keep thinking is a opinion and Harper on it,btohqsg
double underscore on both side of wtv u wna italics,btohqsg
When in fact that was a fact,btohqsg
and what's your source that this is a fact,btohqsg
I literally outlines it in the first para,btohqsg
So you want a source where it says that one of the outcomes of someone being chased is crashing,btohqsg
"a source that says ppl that police chase ""does not want to not only stop but choose to go above and beyond in order to get away""",btohqsg
because LTA's own telegram channels show ppl stopping when TP ask them to stop,btohqsg
In fact I asking my friend rn,btohqsg
"I literally said ""the point of chasing someone who""... I said that because I know y'all gonna spin it like I meant everybody getting chase by cops",btohqsg
ya then that's an opinion what,btohqsg
so what facts are you talking about,btohqsg
u say your first para outlines the source that it is a fact,btohqsg
The outcome of a scenario that is highlighted is literally crashing,btohqsg
please explain from where did you source that fact,btohqsg
can u show me a dataset that says that,btohqsg
So you telling me that someone that goes above and beyond does not increase their chance of crashing?,btohqsg
Do I need a fact to support that statement?,btohqsg
no I'm asking u for a fact that ppl who kena chase will want to escape,btohqsg
ppl whom tp chase also alw stop what,btohqsg
Iknowthat the ppl TP chase alw stop,btohqsg
So they want to be captured ah  cause what E120 is telling me that people who kena chase according to law just do it because of nothing the law can definitively define,btohqsg
I am saying that they want to be captured,btohqsg
What I said in your context is basically people who not only get chased...but go above and beyond,btohqsg
The fact they get chase does not make any difference  it's what they do in the chase that dictates the fact they will crash,btohqsg
Or dictates what they will do in a chase,btohqsg
ya so is that an opinion or a fact,btohqsg
