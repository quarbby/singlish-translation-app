you need to hit minimum 1k spending on foreign currency or contactless to get 4pmd. other wise is 0.4mpd,btohqsg
yes  i have a payment for 2k  can be made via favepay QR  but visa signature only accepts contactless and not online  so verifying if favepay QR considers online or contactless 😅,btohqsg
not too sure  maybe u want to wait for other to confirm.,btohqsg
Can ichange debit card be use to withdraw cash from overseas ATM? Thanks,btohqsg
Sadly you're not the first to mention that to him,btohqsg
If it is education mcc it will stay as it even if u use amaze and now amaze charge u 1 percent for education mcc. End result is u dont get any rebate from sc simply cash and u get charge 1 percent by amaze.,btohqsg
Will UoB lady exclude amaze from 6mpd? Mcc fit to the selected category,btohqsg
If your education can pay amex then go for uob absolute amex for 1.7 percent or amex true cashback for 1.5 percent,btohqsg
Nope  uob have not excluded amaze* retail transaction yet,btohqsg
Another way is use any credit card ( dont get any rebate)  giro spending to hsbc ega to get 1 percent if u fulfill criteria,btohqsg
If grab mastercard can by use  then uob absolute amex to grab (0.3 percent)  giro uob amex to hsbc ega (1 percent). Total 1.3 percent back,btohqsg
But does UOB Lady gives any benefits in Online transactions?,btohqsg
Nope it is mcc specific for the bonus cat u choose. Online or offline doesnt matter,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA promo  we need to top up min 100k and hold till Dec2023 or Feb2024? The bonus interest only applicable 2 months only right   for Nov23 and Dec23.,btohqsg
Hi could joint tenancy hdb be converted to one owner and one occupier for a married couple?,btohqsg
Guys  moomoo 5.8% almost over.. where should we park our $$$ next?,btohqsg
Yes  that's correct  but I still don't know where you're going with this,btohqsg
"For clarity  Amaze does not give cashback/ ""instapoints"" on SGD spend",btohqsg
You are talking about paying a school in Singapore right?,btohqsg
Why would u want to do so?  amaze wallet top up wont get any rebate. Already give u the way and u want to try other way yourself.,btohqsg
What done cant be undone. Dont know what you mean by trying to smoke with them.,btohqsg
Lol I also told you yesterday that amaze will retain original mcc. Too bad lor  next year/ whenever your next bill is  use the methods Queenie suggested,btohqsg
Dec 23  1st will get another 1% from Everyday+,btohqsg
yeah  dats my understanding too. Therefore I see little benefit for pairing UOB Lady with Amaze  except for the 0.5% to 1% rebates via Amaze point which I consider immaterial.,btohqsg
It is useful when using for foreign transaction as amaze link to card exchange rate is slightly cheaper plus get 0.5 percent point,btohqsg
Strategy is alway changing  what work now might not work later,btohqsg
Isn’t it 4 mpd?Also if the spend falls outside the category selected  then it’s 1 mpd?,btohqsg
Now till 29 feb 2024  it is 6mpd on bonus cat. Outside bonus cat is 0.4mpd,btohqsg

I watched this again. Great overview.,btohqsg

Hi   could anyone advise if UOB EVOL credit card can get the 8% cashback when used at Q&M dental? One of the exclusions is medical expenses.Heymax.aistates eligible for contactless. Can anyone confirm please? 🙏,btohqsg
Please critique my guide to Krisflyer miles.1. I think I saw in a recent Honey Money video to get the UOB Preferred Visa for general spend.2. Also for all mastercard use Instarem correct?3. I think it also makes sense to get two UOB Lady's Solitaire Card (husband and wife each) to maximize categories Dining + Entertainment (Bars & Theatres) + Family (Grocery + Redmart) + Travel (as advised above for all flights)My last question for today. 😅 Thank you very much!,btohqsg
Online. UOB VS not ok to use.,btohqsg
