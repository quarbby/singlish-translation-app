how long have you had the mazda?,btohqsg
are you a convert form bmw,btohqsg
the one i like to experiment is the e30. t is like a project car for me. i swapped z3 shifter with short throw. 325 rear brake discs (original is drum) costs me rm700.,btohqsg
i am tired of drum brake leaks and wear,btohqsg
nice. i only owned in in january first mazda,btohqsg
@SGCM_AdminI am quite tired of bad driving habit videos.Can you guys please feature this as a good driving habit in SG?https://www.facebook.com/groups/487930318274402/permalink/1611321892601900/,btohqsg
yes this is very good  i also say thanks like that when people give way,btohqsg
This is practiced in Japan as part of their driving courtesy. It is nice to have it here.,btohqsg
Sure  we will feature some good driving habits in SG😊 Thanks for your suggestion!,btohqsg
Yup  but sadly not many people are aware of this practice😪,btohqsg
all this comes with a lot of driving experience which many dont have,btohqsg
in malaysia  trucks or buses would signal to you to ovwrtake when it is safe. and you honk in return to say thank you.,btohqsg
thats because saying thanks starts with the front person giving way  and thats where the problem lies 😏,btohqsg
I will sure share once it is online. 😁,btohqsg
It is also the unspoken rule on signal to the right on lane 1 to ask politely for car in front to give way to you.I learnt this when I was driving in MY.,btohqsg
