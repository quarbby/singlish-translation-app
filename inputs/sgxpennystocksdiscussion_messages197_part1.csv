If anyone felt wrongfully removed from group just approach any admin for re-entryI will randomly remove people with the following criteria (or any that I deem fit)1. Pretty pic. Ya I anti chiobu. If it‚Äôs too good to be true it probably is. I play a probability game2. Foreigner pic. Face it nobody will come sgx punt pennies from overseas. At most msia or Indonesia3. Foreign names. I do like a poser from time to time but not a big fan. I‚Äôm nationalistic4. Bio has anything related to crypto or forex. If it‚Äôs in your blood it will come out of your mouth5.  Hi there. Any random hi to any members and get reported is instant removal6. I don‚Äôt like you. If I don‚Äôt like you I remove you. It‚Äôs an internal feeling that I can‚Äôt describe. Hope you understandI think the list is pretty much conclusive.Happy weekend,btohqsg
