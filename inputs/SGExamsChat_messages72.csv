@iamahappylittlepuppyI swear with no context  this can come off as Socka’s work,btohqsg

Isn’t this group just some guy talking to himself,btohqsg
Working one muscle grp a day is a bro split lel,btohqsg
You did not just say that,btohqsg
To be honest  I skip cardio frequently,btohqsg
Cardio is good for ur overall health,btohqsg
Targeted muscle training is mostly for aesthetic,btohqsg
Cardio makes u want to die first,btohqsg
Then givs u a longer life,btohqsg
lol I alr feel like that all the time,btohqsg
Weightlifting burns more calories and decreases body fat percentage,btohqsg
It is a tough loving parent,btohqsg
Yes but what about coronary health?,btohqsg
Wait rly it burns more cal?,btohqsg
Well  don't consume excessive sugar and fat,btohqsg
Thats not possible lel unless u count workout time only or superset ur workout like crazy (which basically == hiit),btohqsg
Sure  but this means no bubble tea and cutting off most desserts,btohqsg
Well  that is the cost to pay for diet,btohqsg
I have to watch my health a lot since my my family is prone to diabetes,btohqsg
Just inject the macronutrients directly into my bloodstream,btohqsg
Only type 1 is hereditary isit,btohqsg
Got to factor in muscle repair,btohqsg
Weightlifting1)lift weights and burn calories in the process2)calories are used to repair the several muscle tears from the workout,btohqsg
I really don't have to motivation to exercise lol,btohqsg
Wish it was easier to stay in shape,btohqsg
Diabetes risk can be reduced by gaining some muscle apparently increases insulin sensitivity,btohqsg
My only motivation is not to lose muscle mass,btohqsg
Well for me is topassippt lol,btohqsg

But Charlie life is not bad (assuming you’re clerking),btohqsg
Most Sch V recruits are clerks,btohqsg
does that further increase my chances,btohqsg
can go uni this year sia,btohqsg
but then it's a blessing in disguise la considering there's covid,btohqsg
Wow so passionate about ns hahaha,btohqsg
Why you so critical against nanosecond talk,btohqsg
Do yall like picosecond attosecond or femtosecond talk instead,btohqsg
Wtf that's damn small and I thought nano was small,btohqsg
I mean  there's little context on what is the difference between the different scales,btohqsg
Femto is for molecular dynamics/typical molecular interaction,btohqsg
Hahahhaa I know inter atomic spacing is 10^-10,btohqsg
Pico  likely atomic orbital stuff (conduction band stuff too?),btohqsg
Atto is magic - anything around atto is more of bounds and usually photon interaction than anything else.,btohqsg
But pico and femto idk alr,btohqsg
Wow thanks u study physics huh,btohqsg
DHS hasn’t come out to play yet,btohqsg
I wonder what's my sch distinction rate haha,btohqsg

i scroll the reddit  the information seem to come from one class where only 1/3 get A,btohqsg
Why predict when you can sleep,btohqsg
Transpeptidase based inhibition was a lie,btohqsg
All of science is a lie,btohqsg
It’s all just guesses and observations,btohqsg
Mathematics is based on lies too,btohqsg
Or  statements that aren’t necessarily true,btohqsg
For example  how do you know that there indeed exists the number 0,btohqsg
No way to know but assume that it is true,btohqsg
Although maths is based on rigorous logic and deduction  all of it has foundations in axioms that cannot be proven,btohqsg
So maths too is a lie,btohqsg
Well  there is one truth I know,btohqsg
Never mind  I was gonna quote a very cliche philosophy thing,btohqsg
Are you really hoping for a world where Godel Incompleteness doesn't exist,btohqsg
It would be assuring to know that mathematics is perfect,btohqsg
Oh I see who Fuzzy is now,btohqsg
The summoning of Bio people in the A Levels group right now kind of reminds me of the Mr meeseeks episode in rick and morty,btohqsg
I am usually not supposed to linger in that group over a bio quesition for this long this is getting weird,btohqsg
Followed by 7 years in MI,btohqsg

I hope smiley does not get more cracked by the day  but alas.. ,btohqsg

They will replace smiley with   emojey,btohqsg
Normal smiley but with a honk nose,btohqsg
You like girls with their mouths taped shut? So their screams are muffled?,btohqsg
You are a girl with your mouth taped shut which is why you are typing,btohqsg
John smith is just a girl with her mouth taped shut :(,btohqsg
Yeah so what those mouths do,btohqsg

Petition to destroy Rachel’s nasa sweater,btohqsg

this looks a hell of a lot better than the current logo to me,btohqsg
I think I didThey havent unblocked me,btohqsg
People join u or u force add them,btohqsg
Than they came up with their doscorn crap,btohqsg
They ripped off the dorscon table I think wonder if it is legal??? Plagiarism omggg,btohqsg
Tbh it’s quite funny that they ripped off the dorson table though,btohqsg
But it’s like why would you need it,btohqsg
Ironic they tell about privacy settings like u guys  wtf,btohqsg
I also dk if its the same person,btohqsg
i wld rather have that honestly,btohqsg
It would suck to grad now though,btohqsg
but the current one is like excessive symbolism,btohqsg
we get it earth good but s m o o t h f o n t,btohqsg
I cant even.. they ripped it off,btohqsg
you need a high iq to understand their motives,btohqsg
Make me wonder what else they RIP off omg😪,btohqsg
I don't have high iq ok,btohqsg
if they ripped off sgexams what cant they rip off,btohqsg
Bet they can’t rip off sgFight,btohqsg
that was a couple of days ago,btohqsg
Lol wtf zero for originality hahahah,btohqsg
they got the idea from here,btohqsg
we actually can if sgexams is a trade mark,btohqsg
add inator to the end of everything,btohqsg
Medic bag  ure the medic discord right,btohqsg
I'm quite curious what's a medic bag? Like for emergency ah,btohqsg
the one and only medic bag,btohqsg
I thought is first aid kit haua,btohqsg
If they come up with trauma bag then gg liao,btohqsg
I have no idea what a medic bag is,btohqsg
it started cause of that shit meme,btohqsg
"then it became a sort of ""help everyone but myself"" sort of thing",btohqsg
And aren't they the ones who are bring disharmony in their chat,btohqsg
are all the admins John Smith,btohqsg
i think it's supposed to be irony/sarcasm,btohqsg
just not a very good attempt 🤔,btohqsg
It’s almost as if you have known about this sticker pack before joining SGexams,btohqsg
I like eating fish like I avoid meat If I can,btohqsg
Admin:Btw  various things were done  merely out of humour as we thought some of you guys were overreacting. Feel free to add tutors from sgeducators into sgexams since by parity of reasoning  we shouldn't care. The various things I mentioned are not done out of spite... humour is a more appropriate concept. Thanks.Also admin:You might want to change your privacy settings to avoid being added,btohqsg
im really curious where the bells come from,btohqsg
It’s very entertaining and all but let’s not keep bringing this stuff up,btohqsg
the AWS or the church nearby,btohqsg
I’d rather not give him the attention,btohqsg
ya..gg i haven't received any uni offer yet,btohqsg
lmao the bells is from the gahmen alert speakers,btohqsg
I seen ppl receiving offers for the past week and someone with lower rp alr got offer on 28/4...I worried sia,btohqsg
i wonder if they can transmit speech over the system,btohqsg
blasting astronomia across the country  who's down,btohqsg
If someone with lower RP got the offer it sounds like you should be fine,btohqsg
yea im more worried if I pass the interview it seems like I didnt,btohqsg
which course did you apply to,btohqsg
I heard SIT is catered more to the poly kids,btohqsg
yea..though jc people with lower rp also apply,btohqsg
the outlook is not so good the person who took the interview later and lower rp alr got offer but I haven't,btohqsg
if you are  you can try again next year,btohqsg
no I am not in ns,btohqsg
All the overseas students are now going local,btohqsg
just kidding it's just my grades,btohqsg
What’s the farm science igp anyway,btohqsg
Do i learn how to become a farmer in farm science,btohqsg

The locals can go overseas to get their spots,btohqsg
yea..also ig since I sat for interview the next time I will be better prepared for it,btohqsg
if you can't get into uni this year  try next year,btohqsg
Yeah girls can take a gap year too no worries,btohqsg
I spent  2 years to see the world  and have lots of fun,btohqsg
I think if I have to take a gap year maybe I can use it to build up my portfolio so better chance to enter uni also since my grades not so good,btohqsg
I did that too. Did a lot of volunteering to get into med sch,btohqsg
COVID-19: Singapore's recovered foreign workers to be housed on SuperStar cruise ships 🛳https://cna.asia/3aTGKwL,btohqsg
Stcomments gonna have a field trip,btohqsg
Hmm today’s stats not out yet?,btohqsg
This week's Study with Me is happening tonight  at 7pm! See you around @https://go.exams.sg/studywithme. Happy Labour day!,btohqsg
I wish I got more use than the fertiliser sial  at least help grow trees my existence only to degen,btohqsg
Anyone applied for nusEscholars program or is in it rn,btohqsg
It’s an app that prevents you using your phone while it’s on  or something like that,btohqsg
It makes you leave your phone alone,btohqsg
But i use my phone to study,btohqsg
Thus that programme is ineffective for us,btohqsg
Time to join their competitor’s zoom programme/s,btohqsg
Cute... my stretch marks literally grew 2x the size on my arms,btohqsg
She just collapsed from being her workaholic self  I don’t think she can help u rn,btohqsg
haha thanks but my o levels was 8 years ago LOL😂,btohqsg
I missed the study with me session,btohqsg
https://www.aceclinic.sg/economicsCode they haven send me yet  need wait till tmr,btohqsg
They say need wait 1 day to verify story,btohqsg
100% ab grade v good alr leh,btohqsg
but they say from top 6 jc,btohqsg
maybe they exclude those not frm those 6 schs,btohqsg
I once did a survey of 200 people and found out 100% of them earned more than 20k a month,btohqsg
During my data analysis i excluded the ones that earned below 20k,btohqsg
Thats how the above conversation reads,btohqsg
I still dk how I did for PW,btohqsg
Not have an invigilator for your OP,btohqsg
Huh I tot your year doesn't have pw,btohqsg
How do you know when my year is,btohqsg
Did you just assume my age,btohqsg
Nonsense. Can rebut and say... u mean u only can help top 6 JC student😂,btohqsg
More reasons why one-liner statistics can’t be trusted,btohqsg
How old do u think he is,btohqsg
If ACJC isnt top 6 i would also have 100% A/B,btohqsg
Do the top 6 include anyinstitutes,btohqsg
R  H  V  NY  NJ  E are around  even if you dont include IB,btohqsg
Their results are worthy of top 5,btohqsg
They have a median/mean rp of 85,btohqsg
84.3 for this yr maybeBut i rmb 1 yr it was 85,btohqsg
And EJC was 8/7 this year vs AC’s 9/8,btohqsg
No more top 6 for us,btohqsg
At least ur sch had a fighting chance,btohqsg
The downfall of ACJC began when ACSI opened its IB programme in 05,btohqsg
All the awards he earned went to “John Smith” instead,btohqsg
And when ACJC tried to find John Smith  they couldn’t find it in their student database,btohqsg
Okay nvm this is a bad joke isn’t it,btohqsg
for 2019 batch it was 83,btohqsg
Releasing median instead of mean is a sneaky move,btohqsg
As far as I’m concerned  median = mode = mean,btohqsg
Because normal variables have the same mode median and mean,btohqsg
Okay that joke is even worse than mine,btohqsg
Your just jealous I’m a comedy master,btohqsg
o no yet another rant about point estimates/s,btohqsg
So I was wondering why they put oil in the soap section,btohqsg
They also had soy sauce in those giant soap 5L containers,btohqsg
Since people are hoarding the stuff,btohqsg
America is the greatest country  so whatever units they use is civilised  excuse you,btohqsg
Wtf is your mom doing with 19 liters of soy sauce,btohqsg
i think i can't name a recipe she use that doesn't use soy sauce,btohqsg
You better get yourself checked for hypertension,btohqsg
U should get checked for hypernatrimia,btohqsg
i mean  what did u expect,btohqsg
as in  i not tryna be snarky,btohqsg
but what other dish needs so much soy sauce,btohqsg
I dont know i am vegetarian,btohqsg
My grandma stored her soy sauce in a ribena syrup bottle once,btohqsg
I wanted to drink some ribena in the middle of the night,btohqsg
