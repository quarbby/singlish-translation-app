"so ok  the first time i saw this car was back in 2020 nov  so for the past 2 years i have been wonder who is the owner of this e9  even went as far as wanted to leave a note asking if i could shoot his e9 if there is a chance as well as a name card.so fast forward to yesterday  28 march 2022 i was speaking to another car spotting on Instagram as he mention he found the owner ig of this e9. after i follow and went to find some other cars to shot opposite my cp  he replied "" im your neighbour"" at first i though like oh because same block or maybe nearby block can be considered as neighbour. so i carry asking you from the same block as me ? he replied yes  infact 1 floor above you  and also you might my dad. so at this point i was already like  hmm ok a person living 1 floor above me and i know the dad.afterward he carrying saying he was meeting up with sam ( another e9 owner which i shoot before as well )  and shown my picture toward him and also mention my name and my address. which at this point he was like wtf as wellso in summery i waited 2 year to only find out that this car belong to a neighbour of my that i know since young yeah.",btohqsg
It was your neighbor all along wow,btohqsg
They didn't say a thing also,btohqsg
and when i mean neighbour like a neighbour i haven see a long time as well.,btohqsg
only untill sam mention my name he was like wtf,btohqsg

sitting in workshop waiting for me,btohqsg
But cannot reverse too in when on hks,btohqsg
have to see... my car i think considered quite high,btohqsg
I also think my car is high  untill i forgotten how high the kerb is,btohqsg
maybe i should also do the additional camera to see,btohqsg
saw some cars the reverse camera is looking at the exhaust,btohqsg
That doesn't really allow u to see. U can only reverse by feelings,btohqsg
i think was Jordon's car  the camera install under the car,btohqsg
anyway we'll see... sg never see new euro r hks in years already don't know anything changed,btohqsg
Coz mai mahuan la just wear instead of no need to wear and wear,btohqsg
Got. Yours will be more shiny then others hksüòÇ,btohqsg
car so dirty but exhaust will shine,btohqsg
True story. 2 weeks ago parking and somehow forgot to see reverse cam. Exhaust tio parking kerb. lol,btohqsg
I ever kena  mount my exhaust over the kerb,btohqsg
Thats a pain in the ass,btohqsg
Anyone staying around toa payoh going towards PIE tuas experience that stupid road patch ?,btohqsg
that exhaust guard thingie got use or not,btohqsg
"I never mount  but somehow like push it up abit. The rear diffuser like came out abit lol. I went forward  press press the diffuser  it did not go back in place. Then sit in car and sian. Somehow after awhile  the diffuser ""popped"" back into place lol.",btohqsg
workshop tell me  even you put  you mount the kerb exhaust still bend  you just protect from scratch,btohqsg
This 2 roads. Damn jialat leh,btohqsg
Actually maybe put the mount will be worse. Cos the guard like dampen the sound of impact  inside of the car maybe cannot hear then you reverse all the way. By the the exhaust chui already,btohqsg
I went today on the right most lane. Wa. Jialat,btohqsg
U put  at least it scratches the guard not the shiny exhaust bro,btohqsg
the bottom of the exhaust not shiny i really don't care la lol,btohqsg
The tag is on the bottom bro. U can don care about the exhaust  but u must care about the tag,btohqsg
my j's re-tagged to the side,btohqsg
But hks default at the bottom,btohqsg
but cb pay garager don't know how much,btohqsg
They only able to carrot u once don't know how long once,btohqsg
Bumpy like crazy man! im on coilovers  very painful. lol. Last time then didnt do the left lane  only do the right lane and its a long black batch in the middle of the right lane. That time still can aim centre let the black patch in in between the wheels. Now... cannot run. Both left and right also patch till jialat,btohqsg
Actually nowadays  sg road they patch till quite jialat  ever since CB days.,btohqsg
after i do all that  i find out the j's still crack.  So kena chop again for the hks,btohqsg
Now i switched from right lane to left lane  then cut to right to go PIE. lol. Cannot la the road. walao,btohqsg
They patch already but still uneven. Dont know on purpose or what,btohqsg
like cannot patch even  need patch higher. Maybe long term it will even out.  Oh well.,btohqsg
the road i hate most is going down the slope before exiting fort road,btohqsg
"Like some road surveyor like that. The photo itself does not do ""justice"" to the real patches. lol.",btohqsg
Walao show off the js ahhh,btohqsg
Join the dual pipe hks alr ah,btohqsg
but i really have this feeling the j's crack somewhere else,btohqsg
Hahaha i think inside everywhere crack liao,btohqsg
last time got crack right at that bar,btohqsg
then everytime i start engine  i can feel exhaust coming out from my wheel,btohqsg
nice rims la  but i think don't fit our car,btohqsg
or maybe the problem is white,btohqsg
Inside fibreglass crack is good no ? Help to break in faster  exhaust louder!,btohqsg
His one the titanium itself crack,btohqsg
Dk how many times he weld,btohqsg
