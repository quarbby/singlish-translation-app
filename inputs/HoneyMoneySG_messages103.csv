If it's a refund then usually you'll need to spend the extra on the month you get credited the refund. Check the tracker against your manual tracking would be more accurate.,btohqsg
I wonder where to put the 150K in the whole of June,btohqsg
yes will affect. eg in my case $200 refund so I miss out min spend of 600 as it happen in my final week of calculations  I didnt track and cant spend more in time.,btohqsg
Different. Refunds and fee waivers are separate things. Fees don't count to spending. Fee waivers don't remove from spending.,btohqsg
Hm the CS told me waived amount would not affect. as long as $500 eligible spend  waived amount will only be use to offset,btohqsg
I am using both evol and one so not so direct to check from the app tracker.. anw when does evol rebate come in? started using since last month and have yet to see the cashback,btohqsg
The app's tracker take fromalleligible posted transactions in that calendar month. Doesn't matter you have 1 2 or 3 cards.You already answered yourself  last month you just started using  so the cashback will be this month end.,btohqsg
the amount used will certainly be reflected on your app  the refunded amount will also be offset there properly. evol cashback will give end of next month.,btohqsg
o yes the $500 spend i am not sure exactly how refunds work   as i always hit way over 500 anyways. i only missed my evol card 600 by a little bit once due to the refund.,btohqsg
Thanks cos some cards reflect previous month's cashback at the beginning of next statement month,btohqsg
Can anybody help. I got tiger and webull. Which one gives real-time price for options. I compare both and they give different prices so don't know which one gives real time. Thanks.,btohqsg
To continue on this query  for existing ega users  when do we need to register for the ega promo in order to put 150k in Jun and which will be the reference month? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone recommend any other credit card to replace HSBC Revolution? Just for info  I have CR + Amaze already. Thanks in advance 🙂,btohqsg
Any result for robo advisor so far,btohqsg
If you planned ahead to achieve 150k MAB then no.,btohqsg
Best way to climb on first 100k? As only 23 yrs old,btohqsg
I think UOB cards are having issue. I cannot add UOB card to atome while other cards worked. Similar to uob amaze issue.,btohqsg
Quick question guys.. the interest I received from UOB with 100k is $420.. if I cannot top up 50k by May.. what will be the interest I can get with 100k.,btohqsg
what is the terms and condition of this cashback?,btohqsg
Haven’t read. Just wanted to share 1st to get the news out there,btohqsg
Use excel to calculate MAB and then check against the tiers,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn.. I really don't know how to calculate sia.. so I have to ask.,btohqsg
You can use this as a base:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183200Add in the 50k to whenever you think you will deposit during May.,btohqsg
If you don't top-up the 50k in May then your MAB is 100k  simple as that.,btohqsg
Hi All My Citi Rewards Visa card is expiring soon  Will Citi Bank send me a new card or will force me to change to Citi rewards masterThanks in advance,btohqsg
I didn't receive this email. Seems like only selected users,btohqsg
Like not worth.. I calculated (not sure if I did the right way).. with 100k only get back $286 instead of $400+,btohqsg
Seems like to maximize.. should remain at 100k.. and another 100k for my spouse,btohqsg
Or maybe not... Just 150k in UOB and 50k in Moomoo,btohqsg
Small risk on cash plus I guess...,btohqsg
Yup correct. $286 for $100k  you don't intend to put in $50k somewhere in early May?,btohqsg
Did you include the cash credit from registering for Apr Uob Big Savings Payout promo with 50k incremental fresh funds?,btohqsg
But I don't have so much money to make both UOB account with 150k each cos I got into a bad ponzi scheme 2 years back...,btohqsg
You can try abandoning one of the UOB One accounts from May onwards.First  register the payouts promo by this week for $50k. Then top-up $50k by 30 Apr. This account will have $150k throughout May onwards.You'll get $250 cash credit by end May with earmarked till 16 Aug. This on top of the existing $100k will yield you 4.5% p.a.,btohqsg
what’s the uob promo that i can register? i’m planning to add the 50k to my account by 1 May for the interest rate changes,btohqsg
Thanks. Is SC e-saver also one of it but i saw that it left one month of 3.45%  just deposit one mth and then move to another account in June   maybe maribank / trust after that?,btohqsg
Hi  For SC e-saver if i will to move my funds out on 1st June then i will still entitled to the May 3.45% on the amount i deposited (fresh funds) this month ?Or if i move out on last day of May it will still be base on the ending daily average amount of May right? Sorry not so familar with all these,btohqsg
Hi  any1 knows if Cold Storage voucher purchase will count towards $800 min spend requirement for DBS yuu 388 sign up offer?,btohqsg
As long as u see it in the app  u qualify,btohqsg
Check if u have it in your app. If I have it u qualify,btohqsg
Checked already  app also don't have 😂,btohqsg
Hi anyone can advise? For SC e-saver if i will only want to get the 3.45% interest  i should not transfer now right as its taking the increamental month average? If i put any funds now it will only take the remaining days of the month for this month interest and more importantly next month i need to put in additional funds and only the additional funds will give me the 3.45% correct?So i should only transfer in 01May? Or 30Apr? How it works. Can anyone advise huh?,btohqsg
I wonder why I see it. I hardly ever spend on Trust other than for overseas spend and that was like more than 6 months ago. Since then I have $0 spending on trust card. Maybe they want to push me to use their card…,btohqsg
Hahaha I also don’t use it often  use like once or twice overseas this month nia. Other than that not really,btohqsg
Or the promotion is for Apr and May so it does not compare may vs apr ?,btohqsg
By the way check out the excluded MCC codes. It’s no Cashback cap so if you have huge purchase  this 1.5% can even fight those unlimited Cashback cards. Anyway  I hope maybe over the next few days they roll out to more users,btohqsg
Seems like the usual excluded mcc. Whats the EIR on the cashback rate? Coz this 1.5% is on top of the link point?,btohqsg
I got it even though I never use Trust bank since day 1 of opening LOL,btohqsg
I think they target those never use de,btohqsg
Haha then does it attract you to use it compared to other cards you have?,btohqsg
Using trust card at kopitiam don’t earn you link points?,btohqsg
Haha expected la. Pretty sure a lot other cards gets you better,btohqsg
Hahaha I not NTUC member  the whole trust card and trust bank thing is not attractive liao,btohqsg

If acc open this Apr  cannot view mab?,btohqsg
U open apr why need to know mab?,btohqsg
What is your purpose for wanting to know your mab?,btohqsg
You won’t know the MAB for the current month since the formula based on the whole month. Just track it manually. There are people to use excel sheet,btohqsg
You can count with excel using this as a base:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183200,btohqsg
Has anyone received the lunar new year promo of SC Bonus Saver cashback already?,btohqsg

Hi! Anyone know if booking ticket with smartex trigger 4mpd for lady card with travel category?,btohqsg
I can't register the amaze card or uob lady card under the credit card,btohqsg

Hi hi  by any chance HSBC revolution will have the 3.57% effective cashback in the near future?,btohqsg

So I still get the base rate even if I max my selected categories. Thank you Oscar,btohqsg

Hello  I’m traveling overseas and wondering which is the best card to use to collect mile between the DBS Woman’s World Card and DBS Altitude card when I’m overseas?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc is only for optimal for online transaction and 3x bonus when transact in foreign currency which equal to 1.2mpd   altitude is a base miles card which give slightly more miles when transact in foreign currency but there is foreign transaction fee which both would not be good enough to cover the fee,btohqsg

Hi may i ask how do i use this uob one credit card cash rebate? I already switched to the lady's solitaire card from now on.1. Do i have to spend using the uob one card  then the rebate will offset this May's bill?2. If i dont spend anything this month  will the rebate disappear?,btohqsg
1. 4th month must have spending in the main card holder for the cashback to be reflected. And spending must be > cashback.2. It won’t disappear. Will be stored and reflected to offset 5th month spending.,btohqsg
Sorry pardon for my slow understanding  if my spending is $40 this month  and the cash rebate is now $51.78    will the $11.78 be carried over to next month?,btohqsg
Yes. Must have spending in month 5,btohqsg
Hi  for Moomoo cash plus 6.8%  if I deposit >$50 000 of funds  then during the 40 days guaranteed return  withdraw some of it such that it falls below $50 000  will the guaranteed returns period fall to 20 days  or will it still be 40 days?,btohqsg
Based ont&c  if you drop from 40 days tier to 20 days tier  you'll still be at 40 days  but at the reduced rate.My understanding is they will give you 20 days 6.8% p.a. after 40 days. If you drop below 20 days tier  the promo will be forfeited for you.But best to check with moomoo's CSO.,btohqsg
Is xnap pay having any issue ? Trying to scan regular QR code for payment but can’t,btohqsg
So it's best to just withdraw after 20 days since the remaining rewards don't accrue interest?,btohqsg
You can scroll up to see discussions on it.,btohqsg
Withdraw down to 10000-50000 tier I mean,btohqsg
Or must I keep even 10-50000 tier till promo period ends,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may i ask if anyone knows for UOB One account  is it safe to drain my account on 1 May? I will still get my Apr interest in on 2 May?,btohqsg
You'll still get rewards from day 21-40. My understanding based on their t&c (I may be wrong) is  6.8% p.a. of 20 days will be split to 40 days  so it will be at reduced rate and not full 6.8% p.a. You'll be given the rewards after 40 days.But best to check with moomoo's CSO.,btohqsg
Transactions after April won't affect April MAB.You can use this method to calculate the bonus interest based on MAB:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183200,btohqsg
The $51.78 is used to offset ur Apr bill. And u still have rebate left to be redeemed. Need have spending on the card in subsequent bills to redeem the remaining rebate within 2 years  if not will be forfeited.,btohqsg
It has been two day and still cannot resolve,btohqsg
He never spend full $51.78 haha,btohqsg

Best miles card for mcc8011 is? Apart from general spending card.,btohqsg

Yeah  buy groceries from NTUC can clock spending and linkpoints. Or giant can clock UOB One card additional cashback.,btohqsg
For buying stuff online in foreign website using euros. Is it better using revolut card than using my credit card. Current credit card is amex cashback and posb everyday.,btohqsg
Yup if u only hold this 2 card,btohqsg

Too time consuming tracking many cards.. 😂.. These suits my spending style.,btohqsg
Does pay on NTUC/Ride Hailing Apps+ Kris+ using CRMC consider online transaction?,btohqsg
No for Kris+ as using Crmc in-app via google/apple pay is excluded from 4mpd. Workaround is Amaze+CRMC via googlepay for Kris+Most Ride Hailing apps are online except TadaNTUC via Fairprice is online if not using google/apple pay,btohqsg
Noted. Need to find workaround as keep getting .5$ fee for amaze. Due to 1k limit.,btohqsg
ok. but note that 4mpd capped for $1k in statement month. Incur 1% Amaze fees for local spend more than $1kIf online can use dbs wwmc or citi rewardsif mobile contactless/contactless can use uob ppv/uob signature,btohqsg
Yea. I keep switching with wwmc but due to the statement date  i cant make all the same. Amaze and wwmc is monthly reset but my crmc mid month. So hard to keep track,btohqsg
So tend to use crmc and didn’t keep track my amaze till they release the new nerfed,btohqsg
Side question on heymax  new user. I could see the various condition to clock max miles for cards previously  eg 4mpd online transection only  must select catergory  rewards on foreign spend etc  but seems to be gone now. Is my user problem or theres need to subscribe to anything. Thanks!,btohqsg
Just add all the cards you have to heymax  then type in the vendor you want to use  it will show what cards in your arsenal is good to use or will show other cards that good to use,btohqsg
Cannot request for your statement month to change to calendar month?,btohqsg
Tried but for citi idk why cant. So have to stick with it for years,btohqsg
Does citi app show how many points clock per transaction like uob does?,btohqsg
Not per trasaction sadly. Its all accumulated monthly statement. They remove that function last month or 2 months back,btohqsg
Yea. Called in years back. Maybe i should ring them again to try luck again. Its been years. Lol,btohqsg
Haha weird. Most banks able to,btohqsg
Maybe my cso that time cmi one. Lol,btohqsg
Last i tried to change citi statement month  they said can only change to 5  10  15 or something like that. Cant exactly sync to calendar month. Not sure why citi system so weird.,btohqsg
Yeap. Thats what i got as well if i recall. So im stuck at 18! I was like what sia. All my cards is reset at end of month. Only citi,btohqsg
Maybank only have 18th by default and only if you accept promotional communications they give you 24th. Lol.,btohqsg
I’m looking for a no cap cash back for paying bill to SP services . I averagely pay about 6k to sp. thanks in advance,btohqsg
scb simply cash for 1.5%. But why not split payment on multiple cards? e.g. 2k on uob one  2k on maybank plat visa,btohqsg
Hi all experts  I have completed 20 days for 6.8% but how do I withdraw out? In addition  the interest short fall also 😒This is my first time joining their 6.8% campaign.Thanks,btohqsg
i remember need to wait abit for them to credit the difference,btohqsg
Oh so I just click redeem will do?,btohqsg
Too much trouble already and it will go higher by the end of the year  I’m currently on SCB X . So I’m considering other options   if splitting card will need to prepare even more cards than I already had . Ya it’s for commercial multiple shopsThanks for the suggestions   just want to confirm that UOB absolute 1.7% still works right ?,btohqsg
uob absolute nerf from 6 May,btohqsg
Why not put money into interactive brokers to earn higher interest ? Maybe it is time to get off the UOB boat ?,btohqsg
IBKR need to have 100K invested as part of term and condition right?,btohqsg
That is right . UOB up it to 150 k   so I reckon one can move 100k over to interactive broker and keep 50k in their existing UOB to fund their daily expenses .,btohqsg
Of course   money  would be subject to broker risks,btohqsg
hello  may i knw where should i see this? i think i have completed my 20 days too,btohqsg
Anyone have problem using xnap now? :),btohqsg
what's the best way to make payment for quarterly MCST fees?,btohqsg
You can try to contact moomoo if you track and found shortfall. They will try to give top-up more but don't expect to get full 6.8% p.a. 🤣,btohqsg
You may scroll up to read on discussions about this,btohqsg
As shared -https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/192258. UOB is just not giving us additional  interest. Leaving 50k as monies for daily use,btohqsg
Actually interactive broker LLC is Cash Balance and it is insured by the FDIC for a certain amount. Definitely more than $100k but I forget exact.The interest rates could change daily and it only pays on balances above $xk. First $x earns no interest.I would not feel there is much risk to keep cash in interactive brokers. Withdrawal is not instant and takes anything from 2 hours to 24 hours depending if u submitted before cutoff time of the currency.Moomoo tiger webull on the other hand are different. My comments do not apply for them.,btohqsg
I vaguely remember it was $750k but my brain is rusty and I don’t have good internet to google now.,btohqsg
Could be they take out additional insurance on top of it,btohqsg
Just to be 100% sure  say I have 140k currently in my UOB One (and my March MAB is about 110k)  and will be depositing 50k from another bank. But within a month I need to withdraw 120k out from UOB.I will not be able to qualify for the Big Savings Payout Promo right?,btohqsg

Just thinking aloud. Since it's near end April  is it better to transfer the fund from CPFIS account to CFPOA so that it earns interest from CPF since interest is paid on month end balance of OA?,btohqsg
There's a lack of dp because not many are using this card. Based on my research  your $600 should be split to this. I might be wrong  DBS yuu cardholders please correct me.Assuming your DBS yuu card is linked to your yuu account.10x yuu points - Pay with DBS yuu card (6000 yuu points  credit within 14 days after transaction posted)26x yuu points - Meet $600 qualified spend  capped at $78 or 15600 yuu points  in calendar month (15600 yuu points  credit within 60 days after calendar month)It seems like your 10x yuu points may be split to:1. 1x yuu points (600 yuu points credited on transaction)2. 9x yuu points (5400 yuu points credited after transaction posted),btohqsg
600 yuu points on spot after scanning QR code  given that it’s not excluded item5400 yuu points few days later after the transaction was posted15 600 yuu points in the end of the next month,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming 👍🏻Even if linked  still need scan the yuu ID? Based on the website says need  but t&c says no need.,btohqsg
Cpf interest is calculated based on the lowest value of the month. Transferring back the money doesn’t not impact the interest for that month,btohqsg
CPF don't see the month end balance. They see the monthstartbalanceminus anything withdrawn  so the deposited amount only count from May.You also get charged $2+ for that transaction  so you lose the interest for the $2+ on Apr also.,btohqsg

Good Morning Gurus. Usually I would deposit $550 on the 1st day of the new Month to ensure I meet the MAB of $500 for theOCBC 360 Save Bonus. However  for 1st May 2024 it is a Public Holiday  should I deposit on 30 April 2024  would it be captured under May’s MAB ? or Should I deposit on 1st May 2024 ? Thanks for your reply in advance. 😊,btohqsg

Have to increase MAB by $500 every month right? Means there is an increase of bank account balance of at least $6000 after 12 months? I think this dilutes the effective interest?,btohqsg

Understand the rationale now thank you,btohqsg
Bumping this up... Used amaze empty wallet to surface the MCC  but hsbc advance credit card T&C did not spell out clearly which MCC is included/excluded  just stated Ultilities is excluded.

Just tried XNAP at hawker centre. The app cannot scan qr code  crashes after that.,btohqsg
XNAP is not even in App Store now.,btohqsg

You see the xnap logo at the bottom right? The app allows you to link with like google pay or credit card to pay your hawker meals with credit card via this QR code,btohqsg
Xnap i tried 15 mins ago. Doesn't work.,btohqsg
A tot for those who can’t use XNAP  if they accept activeSG app  that is one way to pay as well since we can top up the wallet via credit card and if currently we have been use the app,btohqsg

Also note that there is currency risk - it has to be converted into USD,btohqsg
Wallet top ups no rewards for most cards  except UOB Absolute/Grab 0.3%.,btohqsg
It seems that the Xnap appln are also remove from google store...,btohqsg
I will use uob one credit card to load value into activeSG wallet to try out if the xnap issue not resolved in short time.  Need to see if wallet top does count as spending. I know for some categories like charity donation are not counted.,btohqsg
Active sg is under gov mcc?,btohqsg

I checked in heymax. Activesg 9399 is definitely does not count for bonus interest. But for uob one spending  I not sure. I know for insurance does not count for bonus interest but count for card spending.,btohqsg
mcc 9399 dun count for bonus interest,btohqsg
Insurance count for bonus interest  don't count for card spending... I suggest you check t&c again,btohqsg
Anyone know if casino levy count towards uob one spending of 500?,btohqsg
My impression I used uob credit card to pay for my prudential and it counts towards the $500 spending requirement. Probably got to wait next month to check as I pay manually.,btohqsg
Same thing for activesg top up  I will try next month since I still have value in my wallet to pay food purchase. Hopefully  they will fix the xnap issue by then.,btohqsg
It goes to spending requirement for bonus interest for UOB One account.,btohqsg
I got mixed up between the bonus interest and rebates.,btohqsg

Hey there  just looking to tap on e expertise within this group regarding CPF matters (Reaching FRS vs using OA money for BTO):TLDRWhat are e pros and cons of reaching FRS faster in my case  versus saving that OA money for my BTO next year?I’m wondering whether I should transfer my OA to SA to get closer to e FRS quicker with e recent change in policy and wondering whether there is any value in reaching FRS quicker versus waiting longer to reach it and saving e OA for e upcoming house instead in 2025.Some context:- my BTO arrives 2025  2nd quarter  we’ve already made e first 5% down payment in 2020- almost 40 years old- working for 19 years already  first 9 years pay was extremely low (didn’t even get taxed so that gives you an idea of how low it was)- wife is employed- currently  OA: $77k  SA: $145k  MA: $71k- have been transferring OA to SA consistently for e last 10 years- not willing to use cash to top up SA because it goes into our monthly rent for e last 4 years whilst we’ve been waiting for our BTO + we’ll need e cash for e upcoming renovation + have been setting aside cash to invest on a monthly basis for e last 4 years rather than put it into e SA- looking to take a short sabbatical next year after the BTO arrives before resuming work in 2026Apologies for e long text but  am Hoping/ looking forward to hear the pros and cons of my thought process/ get some input from e various experiences within e group 😊 - just trying my luck here and giving it a shot by asking.,btohqsg
"Personally  i will first top up 8k to SA to get the tax relief benefit  and trf the remainder using OA if u want to reach FRS quicker.U can count that 8k (or a lesser amt) as part of your investment portfolio. The tax relief means u get immediate returns for topping up (its more signifcant in the 7% income cat)Once you get ur bto  ur montly mortgage can be funded by OA. With my method above  u can take it as ""borrowing"" 8k from your OA at 2.6% interest (assume hdb loan) and getting a tax relief return of 7% + (4% sa - 2.6% hdb loan)Hope this helps",btohqsg
Thanks! Will think about e cash top up for tax relief…Is there any value in reaching FRS quicker? Or would it be better to keep that money in e OA and use it for BTO to reduce e HDB loan and hence reduced accrued interest? We’ve already made e first 5% down payment in 2020. So I’m deciding how much to pay off upon key collection and… that would be impacted by whether I transfer OA to SA to reach FRS quickerI know that transferring to SA gives better returns (4%) as compared to the HDB loan rate of 2.6% but just asking nonetheless,btohqsg
What do you  mean if it’s true? It’s 1 person’s opinion thats all,btohqsg
Cardup is already online and the moment you use it  you are charged with fees. So technically won't really get full mpd  but paying for the miles. And cardup transactions might not even get you bonus miles.,btohqsg
Accured interest only matters if u intend to sell ur hse. Otherwise i wont think too much about it. Plus ur sales proceed with cover the next hse if you do sell  even if u sold at a loss  u are not required to compensate the difference.Depends on ur goal. Reaching FRS early is opportunity cost for tax relief. The impact will be small if your income bracket wont hit 11.5% (since u got SRS you can use too). For your actual situation  I cant advice you on this.,btohqsg
Not sure what to you mean by full mpd? Cardup transactions only earn base miles/points.,btohqsg
You can go on chat assist to cancel the delivery of the debit card. It worked for me.,btohqsg

Hi  I've just signed up for the UOB Big Savings Payout.May i clarify if i top up $50K into my UOB ONE account on 30Apr  will i be able to get the $250 credit (for the big savings payout promo) plus the 4% interest on the $150K in May? Thanks,btohqsg
At 100k MAB  and maintaining same or increase of MAB subsequent month  3% p.a.,btohqsg
Better check your MAB in Mar first to confirm how much you actually need to deposit,btohqsg
UOB PAYOUT  can we withdraw out say 100k for 1 day  then deposit through other bank  just like some discussion earlier about clearing their balances before month end.,btohqsg
This promo  uob uses ur average daily balance so this doesn't really work any more.,btohqsg
"Your ""discussion earlier"" might be very outdated info. Maybe you want to search the chat for ""uob big savings payout"" for more recent info.",btohqsg
Yes I do  but lazy to register haha... Maybe I should give it a try soon.,btohqsg

What are the chances to be the first 500 for those lightning deal if I apply now?,btohqsg
Need opinions from here for UOB my MAB on March is 100k  May and June AC balance zero  will park my fund at other place. 1. Either will join the payout promo before 29th June fresh fund 50k. Total 150k. Earmark bonus $250.2. or just wait for the July promo. To fund in 150k?,btohqsg
For current UOB payout promo  my understanding that ur march MAB will be used.Opt 1  if u join in June  it just delays ur cash credit.Opt 2  assume jul promo is the same  you lose out interest for 2 months. If ur alternative place to park money has good interest  can be a good option. Ofc  we can't predict future and UOB can come up with total different promo.,btohqsg

Hello to all gurus. I myself am in a position that I can't think well because my family got scammed 75k. I need the advices from this community so I'll share my plans but please let me know if I I should make some difference to it.1. 150k in UOB on 1st May. (Will I still be eligible to receive the $400+ interest from my 100k as they only payout on 2nd May.2. 50K in mooomoo for moomoo cash plus.3. Expenses from HSBC EGA.Also  I owe DBS 15 (balance trf).. standard chartered 11k and CIMB 15k as personal loan.,btohqsg
Does your return on your investment outperform your debt interest? How much u intend to set aside for your monthly expense from the stash since u are unemployed now?,btohqsg
Pls share the outcome if such transaction contribute to UOB1 $500 spending 🙏🏻,btohqsg
hi all  what's the hack for income tax payment? which card best to use to pay?,btohqsg
If your returns on everything isn’t higher than the debt interest  why not pay off the debt first,btohqsg
The debts have a tenure of 3-5 years. If I pay earlier  i have to pay penalty..,btohqsg
No. Not really because paying my debts early will only incur additional costs.,btohqsg
So my intention is to take loans and then find a better way to grow it..  definitely not a good idea but I don't can't think of a better solution...,btohqsg
What u are doing is abitrage  if your finance is stable  this is what the rich is doing  but with high interest rate and rocky market  u are walking on the cliff edge,btohqsg
Reducing your accrued interest is definitely important. I hold a different view  accrued interest matters with or without selling the house.Without accrued interest  the govt is paying you interest  which is used in various forms (CPF life etc). With accrued interest  you are paying it yourself. Accrued interest is still a real cost  and as with any balance sheets  it’s good to reduce debts/interest  esp when loan expense is 2.6% vs interest income of 2.5%.If you decide to stay in this forever home  then you’ll have more CPF for retirement. If you decide to sell it and opt for second BTO  then you’ll get more profits in lieu of interests paid back by yourself.,btohqsg
In the past when home loan rates from banks are <1.5%  there’s an arbitrage by using more loan and keeping OA in CPF to earn 2.5% interest. That’s not the case now,btohqsg
Are you able to pay bulk and not the full payment? Taking loans and investing in instruments that does garner better returns to cover the rates is definitely not the way.Seeing your portfolio is only banks and mmf where there’s no saying of when they will lower their rates againPlus you said you are unemployed so what you have now should be your rainy funds,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply. I was actually really okay in terms with my finances  unfortunately my family got scammed la.. so I lost 75k.. the 75k loss is not the big concern but because of the lack of capital  the intangible opportunity for interest or investment gains are strongly affected,btohqsg
I agree. Now I'm thinking of terminating my term insurance. The coverage is minimal and returns will take another 9 years to break even.,btohqsg
Term insurance got returns? Insurance should be the last thing to consider I feel. If you were to get it back a later age  will be too expensive and subjected to health as well,btohqsg
Gg xnap 🥲 need to bring cash liao,btohqsg
Coverage only 50k. In event of death before 65  it will be 150k..I have paid 10 year of $120.. I need to pay another 10 years to break even.,btohqsg
How do u earn money from term plan that only covers until 65???,btohqsg
Go and get a job and then Go into DRS,btohqsg
But the monthly premium is something I want to cut.. I'm also paying for my spouse  hers cost more than mine.. with 100k coverage.,btohqsg
I think is those term plan that will return the premium if he dont manage to claim from the insurance when the term end,btohqsg
It covers until I die or I make a claim... I don't have to pay after 20 years.,btohqsg
Sorry..  what's DRS? And why should I declare bankrupt...,btohqsg
Now it sound like whole life limited pay insurance,btohqsg
Your interest payment will snowball and have no income to service  it's very hard to recover,btohqsg
Oh. I can clear my debt.. I mean I do have emergency cash stash away.. but it still hurts to know that 75k gone just like that from a scam.,btohqsg
For $41k get drs and blackmark?,btohqsg
Money gone can earn back  but stress from creditors is very damaging for mental health,btohqsg
My credit rating is AA. Even not working  the banks didn't remove my credit cards.. cos I never once default before,btohqsg
Bank din remove coz u din update employment status lol,btohqsg
Take a break and rethink your plan  if you can clear your debt so be it. Just look at it as an expensive lesson learnt..,btohqsg
My question to the community is that.. despite the loans that I have.. I still have cash which I want to maximize the growth in the fastest way possible .,btohqsg
What if it is not growth?,btohqsg
The issue is you have no job and yet not enough liquid assets to generate a steady income. Kind of stuck.U should go back to working…,btohqsg
Hahaha. yea I guess so. Lol,btohqsg
I think it also depends on your risk level and how much liquidity you have that can risk,btohqsg
I have to find one that fits me.. I still have 2 children.. both with ADHD and ASD,btohqsg
No returns will beat the interest eir of 5.5% and above,btohqsg
So yea.. my background is complicated. Very different from the norm.,btohqsg
Usually this kind have to do free lance.,btohqsg
200k as liquid if I don't go back to UOB,btohqsg
Maybe you need to calculate if repaying early will be more cost saving than paying per month,btohqsg
If you got cash to repay the loan  nego with the bank for a discount,btohqsg
All the more u need to keep your term insurance,btohqsg
I know 200k cannot do much la. But at least can tank for awhile.. until I find something do-able.,btohqsg
Can I know if buy foodpanda voucher from ShopBack app is considered what mcc?,btohqsg
Tell them you got no job then want to repay early before you got no money pay  then bank scared will let you pay early liao haha,btohqsg
Ohh. Ok... Actually my coverage was also 100k. But something happened to me so it dropped to 50k coverage after I claim 50k,btohqsg
U aren’t related to this guy called domo hor?,btohqsg
200k to a person who spend 1k a month or to a family that spend a few k a month is totally different story leh,btohqsg
Usually in this mental state you will make bad decisions and lead to further loss.,btohqsg
No I don't know anyone with that name.,btohqsg
This is a very good advice. I'll remember it.,btohqsg
Did u file a police report? Any possibility to get the money back through legal avenues?,btohqsg
Yea I know.. now is just trying to make as much as possible with what I have...,btohqsg
Can't get back alr. It's really dumb of my father-in-law la... Those stupid Nigeria scam,btohqsg
Given your situation I would caution u on falling for another scamSometimes too anxious will easily fall prey.,btohqsg
Early repayment for loans is around 3% of the remaining amount  compared to 3-5 years of 5%.It doesn't make sense to keep the full tenure..,btohqsg
And ponzi scheme together...  That's how I crashed,btohqsg
At this situation  you should go with something safer   like what you have now. In case you invest in something riskier and lose it more,btohqsg
The more u eager to get money fast  the easier u lose the money,btohqsg
But with UOB Are you still able to get the interest since you have no salary,btohqsg
The last time I called standard chartered to do a early repayment and the difference only $200+,btohqsg
Any savings is better than none no?,btohqsg
So might as well I keep it for another 1.5 years until it's paid off.,btohqsg
"I use DBS account and transfer myself with ""SAL""",btohqsg
Given that you are unemployed  things might happen that in future you might not be able to repay,btohqsg
Of cos. So I haven't enter any long term investment other than my term/life insurance...,btohqsg
I think the issue with having debt when u can clear it is situtation can change along the year  with no new income  your holding power become weaker when u pump borrow money to investment,btohqsg
Unless the debt is a leverage to increase cash flow that's a different thing,btohqsg
I will try to get a job. But got to work on my resume and it won't be easy because I haven't work for more than 7 years,btohqsg
There are many gig economy if you look hard enough - from 15 to 20.bucks an hour,btohqsg
But if you’re borrowing money to invest  does your investments actually earn enough to make profit and cover the debt interest?,btohqsg
Even doing relief as a taxi/phv earns you a stable income to offset the interest repayment,btohqsg
Yah better find a job better lah. Want to invest to “make back” the money will be a disaster. Just slowly lor,btohqsg
So glad with all the inputs. Thanks samsam  Louis  Queenie MT and mr. 🍌,btohqsg
Maybe his situation is where he needs to take care of his kids  seeing that he didn’t work for 7 years. So probably can look at odd hours shift or weekends which is still not so bad as well,btohqsg
Any towkay hiring please let me know 😂,btohqsg
My last job 7 years ago have a salary of 7k/month. But I only last 6 months there due to multiple reasons... I was a HR director,btohqsg
Time to come.out of retirement and get to work. It sucks but it is the best solution for now to stop the hemorrhage.,btohqsg
Maybe can call up some of your old contacts and see got any opening lor. I myself am not working anymore but i know if i had to get back to work  i can call some people up. Wont get back same position  but at least something,btohqsg
My son needed me then... And im instructed by the daughter of the CEO to sack all the elderly.. I just can't do it.. I tried getting jobs for them from our competitor,btohqsg

As long as you can still walk and talk  have hands and legs.. there is hope,btohqsg
It's a cleaning industry btw.. no one at SG will take up this kind of job at 20-30s,btohqsg
Like I said  my life is not the norm. They are full of twists and turns...,btohqsg
So back to this.. I am also well verse in construction... So leaving my job as HR director  I can go into construction.. but my eyes doesn't have iris so it hurts so bad in the day.,btohqsg

Anyone know if transferring non-FAST SAL from DBS to my 360 OCBC account still works to get better interest? Cos I tried and it doesn't work…,btohqsg
Is this an official statement from XNAP?,btohqsg
Any idea if we could buy ntuc vouchers through fairprice app using amex card?,btohqsg
You tried before and it works for OCBC previously? I recall you can only do that to UOB,btohqsg
What do I have to do,btohqsg
Not really  but I'm not a miles person and I usually use general cashback cards like uob one  hsbc advance  recently added ocbc infinity. For large expenses  I have manhatten. So I don't really need heymax since most of my usual spendings can earn bonus and those that can't  probably won't earn bonus for other cards too.,btohqsg
If you can get same deal at Hour Glass and can fully utilise annual fee go for Amex platinum card.First 16k 6.94 mpd. 16k and above 3.47mpd,btohqsg
Xnap cannot use  internal server error,btohqsg
I though $80 limit for Citibank Cashback?,btohqsg
hi  for people who use EGA giro to pay citi reward ccmy march statement specifies it’d be deducted via giro  and the due date is 30 April. i transferred into EGA on 25 April  so far it hasn’t deducted yet and there’s only 1 business date left before 30 April. it’s my first statement with giro hence a bit worryif anyone happens to have the same due date  may i know if yours have been deducted?,btohqsg
People always confuse Citi cashback and Citi Cashback+,btohqsg
They will deduct on the due date itself,btohqsg
This is quite accurate. Citi usually deducts one business day earlier,btohqsg
Do uob provide viewing of mab for uob one account?,btohqsg
this morning xnap still down ?,btohqsg
Initially thought it was just a particular store  turns out to be the app lol,btohqsg
Probably if he waits for Amex to issue the card the deal noMore 😪,btohqsg
I don't use miles and my cards also for general spend. But I still check heymax when needed 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
check ur citi statement. make sure u see the GIRO as the payment mode. if you dont see it  means the giro setup progress has completed,btohqsg

Hi  can you share how you setup the E-Giro on EGA to pay for your citi cc?I'm thinking of doing the same for my UOB card. Thanks!,btohqsg
Yes. As long is installation plan.,btohqsg
1. get signature registered at hsbc; 2. download giro form from citi  the bank you’re transferring to; 3. sign and send the form to citi  in your case uob,btohqsg
Banks don't accept eGiro. Only interbank GIRO form through mail.,btohqsg
Does this mean I have to find a HSBC branch to go to  and get my signature registered?,btohqsg
$2000 gets 4000 uni$ = 8000 miles,btohqsg

hi just want to ask  quite lost on this  I just registered my sole proprietor business with ACRA  I got my UEN already  I just want to receive payments to that UEN  I checked with DBS  if I want to open an account  there is a $10 monthly fee  is there a way I can accept payments to my UEN without paying a fee or lesser fees?,btohqsg
Maybe can try Maribank Business Account. ANEXT and GLDB if you need multi currency.,btohqsg
All bank cc charge ard 3.25-3.5 percent for foreign currency spending  so any card that give u reward above the fee that will be good,btohqsg
Guys  my Instarem is linked to my Citi Rewards card. Lately each of my Instarem domestic transactions are charged an extra 1% transaction fee.I checked Instarem help desk and they said it's due to any transaction above SGD1K will incur this fee.What should I do to avoid incur this fee while still turning all my Citi Rewards transactions into online spend to earn Rewards points?,btohqsg
Does this 1% fee get reset on monthly basis or it will be permanently there?,btohqsg
just to clarify…. OCBC website: “Credit your salary of at least S$1 800 through GIRO/PayNow via GIRO”i’m also doing a monthly transfer of $1800 from SCB acct my wife OCBC360 using the SALA code. Is it counted as salary crediting?,btohqsg

LOLX… she cannot splurge on bags wahahah,btohqsg
"If you get a call from overseas number to pay for charges  you know the ""charges"" goes into her bank liao. Called bag charges",btohqsg
U can change to credit salary to her uob one haha  it will work,btohqsg

Wife is funny she will have all reasons to say purse  sling bag  Tote bag  blah blah blah are different. same goes for shoes.. lolx. Anyway good that get her $$ into Tbill  told her she can use the interest earned to buy bag. hahaha…,btohqsg
does uob credit card amount used   take into account pending transaction?,btohqsg

Does it work if it’s our own bank account name? Or it has to be someone else account name,btohqsg
Sorry just to double confirm. Yes referring to own account name work as well?,btohqsg

It is monthly limit of 1k,btohqsg
In case of refund charges  no resetting... But it will be reset on 1st of every month.,btohqsg
Ok. Will monitor on 1st may and see if it's reset,btohqsg

Can I ask something that is not relevant with finances? My domestic helper has worked for us almost 17 months..  my wife caught her caressing my younger son's nipple today (my son have speech delay/ ASD) so he can't talk yet..Then my wife also mentioned that she saw my helper touching his penis a liltte more than necessary   because helper shower my son and change his diapers.And lastly  my elder son mentioned seeing her kissing my younger one on the lips multiple times...,btohqsg
Im entrapped in a situation. I can send her back but I do not have anyone to assist me with looking after the kids.. so I'd like to seek opinions for those with helpers and kids... I know this is the wrong community la. But I not in any other communities on telegram..,btohqsg
In the contract  one of the T&C (briefed clearly to her) is no photo taking of my children. But her phone is filled with my son photos..,btohqsg
No chance given? It will take sometime to get a new helper too right..?,btohqsg
Contract is contract  terms written clearly in black and white,btohqsg
Wah. Really ah? If everyone thinks that way.. I guess I will have to do it.. the reason I hesitated here is we cannot manage without a helper.,btohqsg
Helper can always find new one  but what your little one go through (along with what you and your partner have to go through now) cannot be changed. Just My two cents worth,btohqsg
Yea.. understood.. she broke the rules and in fact I gave her bonus every quarter.. I thought I was treating her super good as a boss already... I never ordered her around or anything. Even on our trip to Genting  she loss at casino.. I pay her back when we came back SG,btohqsg
I haven't caught her in an inappropriate act so I cannot make police report right?If she is a pedophile  I want to make sure she receive her punishment and not just pure dismissal.. because someone else will engage her...,btohqsg

Hello Group https://youtu.be/YbunknVryEM?si=60pHbnxCX-KaqYHjFrom the above video  I understand we can use amaze+citi in Kris +. May I know how to link the amaze card in my Kris + app. I’m an apple user.,btohqsg
U cant add amaze to apple pay currently,btohqsg
I have linked my amaze card to google pay. Is there a way I can use google pay to use my amaze card?,btohqsg
Yes just link google pay to your kris+,btohqsg
Then pay on Kris+ with Google Pay,btohqsg
How do I do that? For now it’s only showing my Apple Pay in Kris plus.,btohqsg
Yeah use an android device to make the payment..,btohqsg
Oh yeah thanks. So doesn’t work in iOS. Just read in milelion,btohqsg
As a reminder  if you pair the Citi Rewards Card with Apple or Google Pay  and use Apple or Google Pay to make anin-apptransaction with an app like Deliveroo or Kris+  you will only earn 0.4 mpd instead of 4 mpd.You can solve this problem by:1 Pairing the Citi Rewards Card with Amaze2 Adding Amaze to Google Pay3 Paying in-app with Google Pay using AmazeOf course  this workaround only applies to Android phones  sinceApple Pay does not support Amaze yet(while Google Pay can be installed on iPhone  you can’t use it for in-app transactions).,btohqsg
Yes. And next month is uob lady saving account,btohqsg

Hi all  will paying for GRAB rides directly using Citi Rewards get 4mpd? Or is GRAB MCC under travel??? 😬😬,btohqsg
Can anyone clarify? Is the use of UOB One Credit card a qualified spend for Cardup? Heymax says that cardup spends are qualified but UOB One terms says Cardup spends are excluded from any cashback.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf?s_cid=grm:sg:paid:dis:pmax:na:bn:na:001843:121223-evergreen:onecreditq1:na:ms-sg&vid=ms-sg&pid=OCCPRSMCDCO,btohqsg

Card t&c will always be the greater truth,btohqsg
anyone knows how to change billing period for SP utilities,btohqsg
I think no replacement from agent already  I will just buy air ticket don't let her know  until 1-2 hr before fly  ask her to pack bag Infront of you  ask her delete all your family photo Infront of you. Maybe you can ask agent come over to assist you. Put you kids to somewhere else first. Send her to airport and make sure she go in the security gate.,btohqsg
No agent involved bro. Immediate termination will be my way of dismissal. But unfortunately  we cannot manage without a helper. I guess I'll have to make some arrangements like not to let her sleep with my son and closely monitor her.Will also collect the evidence when it happens and make an official police report if it happens again.. so she won't be able to work in SG anymore.,btohqsg
There is no record of OCBC infinity card on heymax  can I ask if I can get 1.6% cash by taking mrt?,btohqsg
You might want to check again. I'm sure it's there,btohqsg
Infinity Cashback card. I checked with smrt and simplyGo. no record of ocbc infinity cashback card,btohqsg
It's on heymax. But appears as excluded for SimplyGo. Heymax might be wrong  t&c still the greater truth.,btohqsg
Card t&c will always be the greater truth,btohqsg
It is stated excluding simply go in the t&c but I’m afraid there will be some thing I don’t know🙊,btohqsg
If use uob one card to top up ezlink card at mrt station kiosk counted as  $500 spend ?,btohqsg

I want to ask about Money lock .For OCBC and UOB - example if I lock 100K from my UOB one and OCBC 360 respectively.This lock fund will continue to earn OCBC 360  save bonus interest and UOB one interest or not ?,btohqsg
For ocbc 360 yes. If meet requirements eg salary credit,btohqsg
Will booking getgo with citi rewards cc directly through app get the bonus miles?,btohqsg
Just need $500 increase and salary credit .... For ocbc .... Or is there a new promo,btohqsg
My this month sp bill recurring payment will on 9th May on UOB one cc  is after Uob cc bill date  anyway I can manual do early payment myself by Uob one cc? If I use Axs to pay  will my Uob one cc still entitle the >$500 rebate?,btohqsg
For OCBC 360 account  yes. Same requirements apply.You cannot do money lock on UOB One account. Alternative would be using UOB LockAway account which will yield less than 3% for 100k.,btohqsg
Axs excluded  use sp app included  can do early payment on sp app,btohqsg
I can't do it through sp app by manually payment now.🤔,btohqsg
Erm  why not  i do it all the time for my dad even with recurring payment  go to your bills and there will be payment options,btohqsg
There is no lock fund options for uob one but u can always participate in uob saving promo and earmark the fund haha,btohqsg
I try to press every button  can't do the payment.😭,btohqsg
Using axs dont work so u might as well let it charges on your uob one for next statement  just clock the shortfall on uob one loh,btohqsg
Ok  I able to do it now  need to remove my card  then can do manually. After done the payment  set back the recurring bill again. 😊,btohqsg

Should be up to $100 cashback per month. You'll only receive after the end of the quarter  i.e. 3 months,btohqsg
I think still can do this till end May 2024: Use UOB  Absolute Cashback Amex card to top up Grabpay wallet then use Grabpay card at MRT station to top up Ezlink card. This gives u 0.3%. Pay the UOB Absolute Cashback Amex card using HSBC EGA via giro. This gives another 1%.,btohqsg
If you a new user I think got an enhanced cash back that's a different $100 cap for 6 months,btohqsg
$100 per statement month. Note that there is need to fulfil min 5 transactions and $500/$1000/$2000 eligible spend for each of the 3 months of your qualifying quarter to get quarterly rebate and then the bonus 5%.,btohqsg

Not sure if I'm too dumb to understand  or my English is too hard to understand. I checked again with live agent to clarify about the 1% admin fee and this is the result...,btohqsg
I dont understand u also to be honest  1month per domestic spend is still useful if link to citi crmc,btohqsg
There is plenty other way to buy lv to be honest,btohqsg
the admin fee higher than the linked rewards?,btohqsg
Lol there is lv in ion,btohqsg
My question - with each new month  does my domestic spend get reset to zero so that each new month I won't incur the 1% fee between $0-$1000 spend for that month. I ask this question many times but the agent like don't understand and keep trying to tell me my spend is cumulative so I will keep getting charged the 1% admin fee past $1k regardless of month. I make it as simple as possible but the agent keep don't want to explain to me succinctly whether this will happen or not,btohqsg
Convert offline to online is not the original intent of Amaze. I will prefer not to mention it in the chat. Once Amaze change the setting from “online” to “offline”  it is a game over for many people.From Amaze point of view  their business objective is to make money from FX spread and wallet. The rest of “benefits” are discovered by members and make use of it by community here.,btohqsg
I understand members here stated it will reset for the new month but I wanted to get clarity with Instarem team  end up they just make me even more confused,btohqsg
Read this first page  monthly domestic transaction  what is so hard to understand about this?,btohqsg
I dunno  but I don't want to be charged the 1% admin fee past 1k spend.,btohqsg
I can tell u alot of way to overcome this to be honest if the merchant is in capitamall,btohqsg
Then don't use amaze after 1k spend for that month  which is what everyone already advised you.,btohqsg
Just open your instarem app  Card tab and you’ll see your tracker with this information,btohqsg
Damn it even shows when it resets 🤡Tough read 😫,btohqsg
need to weigh if still worth it to use Amaze after $1k domestic spend,btohqsg
Clueless person  even the CSO can’t understand him based on the way he phrase the qn,btohqsg
Yes it's not hard to understand but it confuses me when I ask them this question and they reply me with this:,btohqsg
That why u see if people dont reply in this chat is either they dont know the answer or they dont know what the question is lol,btohqsg
They are replying to your 1 percent fee question earlier. The one on top of your red column. Miss the second line most prob,btohqsg
CSO probably assumed you saw what the app explicitly stated before going on chat with him.1. 1% fee (min $0.50) for domestic transactions above $1k2. Limit resets on 1st May 2024,btohqsg
He and CSO are wasting each other’s time. And now he is wasting our time  even if we answered already  still insisting on CSO confusing him 😂,btohqsg
You must remember  he was answered here before he went to chat with CSO...,btohqsg
Typically  鸡同鸭讲. Like i always emphrasize  ask the right question if u want right answer. Dont give filler inbetween,btohqsg
He just too impatient on getting his LV  need to clarify first before waiting for the CSO to reply. Good problem tbh. Not everyone can afford LV,btohqsg
"And now there's a higher risk of amaze becoming a ""offline"" transaction with the extra yap to CSO...",btohqsg
Actually this offline to online thing has been talked about by all these sponsored posts anyway,btohqsg
I think more of bank nerf amaze* link transaction rather then amaze go offline issue  like what dbs did for dbs wwmc and all other dbs card,btohqsg
Because what u guys replied doesn't tally with what the agent said ma. So who to believe?,btohqsg
After all  amaze saving on fcy fee is alike to snatch rice bowl from banks beside the offline to online issue. From a long term point of view dont benefit bank to accept amaze* transaction,btohqsg
People showed you screenshots of the monthly reset liao,btohqsg
If i am not wrong the agent did told u the spending number reset monthly in his reply.,btohqsg
I went to the Card tab but I don't see this reset countdown anywhere leh,btohqsg
Do you see the tracker under linked bank card?,btohqsg
He did. Then after that he went to explain further and keep telling me the admin fee can't be reset. So what am I supposed to do?,btohqsg
What he mean is that admin fee once charge when u over 1k spend is not refundable  even if there is refund to the charge afterward,btohqsg
Will show this after u tap question mark,btohqsg
Using the latest version of the app?,btohqsg
And i like to highlight it is not 1 percent only  it is either 1 percent or 50 cent minimum per transaction. So if u use for small amt less then 50 dollar u are infact paying more then 1 percent,btohqsg
Wtf?? I'm not even asking that question. Seriously miscomm siah,btohqsg
Like i say u give too many filler  just go straight to question does the monthly domestic spend of 1k reset each month will do,btohqsg
Have you spent more than $1k in Apr? If yes  the message n reset date will appear.,btohqsg
I tried that in earlier agent chat. But they gave the the same confusing replies. That is why I was trying to be as clear as possible. Really spoil my day,btohqsg
Oh well cant comment since no screenshot lol.,btohqsg
Giving more info does not mean clear. Sometimes less is more. Just be straight to the point. 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Just take it as now your question is answer liao and move on  life have more beautiful and important thing to attend to,btohqsg
Since there's evidence that this spend will reset monthly  then I'm satisfied. Thanks all for the replies and I hope u had a good laugh  😂,btohqsg
Next time I wanna ask a question  I'll check here first. But be prepared for 50-100 lines explaining the context first 😂,btohqsg
No issue for me  same 3.12.5,btohqsg
You still can complain to them that on your app no tracker. Clearly something is missing on your app. You try to reinstall before asking first.,btohqsg
I am off to pluck chilli from next block neighbour liao for my lunch condiment haha,btohqsg

Hi all  I recently purchased a flight ticket around 2k using uob lady’s card (i picked travel as a category when I signed up recently). I see that I have only 400 uni$ for this ticket. Is this correct? Seems too little,btohqsg
His app don't have the tracker weirdly. Hopefully it gets fixed with a reinstall haha,btohqsg
Have you read the TnC when the rest will be credited to your account?,btohqsg

Can recommend what broker apps good to buy funds?,btohqsg

Trying to learn more about CC miles!I just apply 3 CC -> citibank rewards  uob lady  and SC smart.im thinking to apply one or two more CC which are the UOB preferred or UOB krisflyer.I heard applying too much CC might affect my credit score. Anyone got the same experience? Also if i request to increase my UOB credit card limit from 2k-3k  Do u think it will affect the credit score.Fyi i also have UOB Evol which i probably gg to cancelWorry about credit score hahaha.,btohqsg
I have solitaire and this is my only spending this month,btohqsg
You can try to apply but whether get rejected or not depends on the bank themselves. But unlikely will affect your credit score for increasing limit or getting more cards. Unless you're planning to get bank loan  no need to worry about credit score.,btohqsg
For retirement planning  is investing in Lion-OCBC Securities APAC Financials Dividend Plus a good option to receive regular payout? Like to hear some opinions from this group. Thank you,btohqsg
Capped at 2k for solitaire  but 400 UNI$ now is still correct.,btohqsg
Not so fast hahaha. Prob get house loan in 4 yrs time,btohqsg
400 or 4000 for the bonus category?,btohqsg
What you define as it is good? This is an investment which means dividend if market is good may go up or go down if market is bad. Or it may not be not be given if there is market crash. You are taking more risk in returns for potentially higher returns of 5% monthly.,btohqsg
What about the bonus then? Of I understand correctly it will be given next month?,btohqsg
Hi  how many days does it take to port in to ZYM? How long will it take for the sim card to arrive?,btohqsg
It's in the t&c on when both base and bonus gets rewarded,btohqsg
2-3 working days upon arrival. As early and as late you can pick on the website.,btohqsg
If i collect the sim card from the physical store  port in will still take 2-3 working days?,btohqsg
hi all  i remember i used to have 1 aapl share in both moomoo and tiger like 4 years back(both is free from new account). now i login to both  seems like i dont even have an account with them? can login but no trading account. anyone has any idea?,btohqsg
Hi  did anyone apply for SCB CNY bonussaver promotion in February and got their rewards ?,btohqsg
Can I check if your crmc+amaze transaction is with the physical card or mobile contactless.. cause i have problem using mobile contactless today,btohqsg
From what I tried  collect in the morning 11am. Port in happen during midnight on that day itself,btohqsg
Mine is physical card.. I can’t use mobile contactless for Amaze cos no Apple pay.,btohqsg
Alright.. nxt time I'll bring my physical card along.. not sure why mobile contactless doesn't work.. thxxGSx@qqplaces,btohqsg
Some time other country machine cant use google pay  so just bring physical card,btohqsg
Uob one card link to shopback for payment counted as $500 spending?,btohqsg
Using Singtel network  so mostly good coverage. But recently got an issue between their network and Singtel so went down for quite a few hours  even their app went down.,btohqsg
Registering for uob big savings end apr and earmarked 50K  means the effective interest rate for 150K is 4.5% per annum in May ?,btohqsg
The collection of sim is only available at their 6 outlets? Cos i see under locate us there are 20 locationsAlso  need to make any payment in their physical shop? Or can make the first time payment in the app?,btohqsg
Yes  it's 4.5% p.a. over the next 4 months. But the cash credit comes in May  so you technically get the 0.5% p.a. for the next 4 months instantly in May.,btohqsg
Oh you opted for sim delivery?,btohqsg
sadly my office site @ paya lebar  is not able to receive their cellular network. But data network is okay  which puzzles me.,btohqsg
If Singtel have poor coverage there  it's gonna be the same for ZYM.. these kind of weird coverage usually you'll see better results on M1 or SIMBA 🤪,btohqsg
My name is Anna from Singapore what about your self??,btohqsg
Hi. How to get the 4% in uob one account from 1 May onwards? Assuming my account has 100k now. Do i just transfer 50k in on 1 May?,btohqsg
150k before Apr 30 1030pm. Don't forget to register for the earmarking promo for additional 0.5% p.a.!,btohqsg
Thank you! Almost time for the transfer then! How to get the additional 0.5%?,btohqsg
"You can search ""uob big savings payout promo"" for discussions on it",btohqsg
Need to check your card settings also. If overseas must turn on overseas transaction.,btohqsg
Yeah.. i checked that.. it was turned on,btohqsg
May I ask if there are hsbc may Jun promotion? Based on April average daily balance for ega account,btohqsg
Lol when May comes then you'll know already,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword“Uob one shopback”to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
i got my standard chartered smart credit card approved  how can i activate the card and get its details before the card is delivered to me?,btohqsg
Hi  wanted to ask if there is such a thing where promotions for credit card signups is slightly different at roadshows? Example  deal on website may state $600 spent for $200 cashback  but salesperson promoted the same card to be say  $400 spent for $200 cashback? Thank you,btohqsg
Sorry I have a query which I didn't monitor. For the uob one account  does the current 5% per annum interest includes the amount paid on the last working day of the current month plus the bonus interest paid early next month please?,btohqsg
Afaik.Daily base interest and bonus interest computing includes first day to last day of the month (except base interest).Final MAB computing includes base interest.,btohqsg
Thank you. I am trying to confirm my daily average for march before I top up my account.,btohqsg
Why not use the app's MAB values?,btohqsg
Sorry is there such a feature,btohqsg
I am noob at using the app except to track my expenses,btohqsg
Oh I actually read the first sentence is to use excel to calculate and missed out the second answer. Thank you,btohqsg
i got my standard chartered smart credit card approved  how can i activate the card and get its details before the card is delivered to me?,btohqsg
Did you try the app? If there's no option then you'll have to wait.,btohqsg
Any9ne using POEMS? Any sales charge for buying UT,btohqsg
Like official standard chartered bank app?,btohqsg
SC mobile I just downloaded  it has the same options as displayed on the website.. need cc number and phone....,btohqsg
I remember seeing this message while applying that digital card will be made available as soon as the card is approved.. however it does not seem to be the case,btohqsg
Just to share  made a transaction today earlier w GXS Debit Card at JB.No Cashback awardedNo rates shown$4.81 charged for 16.80 MYR(Manually calculate... thats 3.492723 RM for 1SGD)Instarem however charged me$35.7 for 122.4 MYR(Rate was 3.4286),btohqsg
If RM35 then gotlucky drawcashback liao. 🤣,btohqsg
oh ya forgot the $10 requirement. DAM IT,btohqsg
But good rates tho. Probably able to fight YT.,btohqsg
yeah  potentially can even win Trust cause of the ✨lucky✨ cashback,btohqsg
Assuming you applied for the CC with SingPass MyInfo  there's no option to add to Google Pay/Apple Pay/Samsung Pay?,btohqsg
i did apply from singpass  how to proceed to add the card to Google Pay,btohqsg
SC don't have such a functionality,btohqsg
Need wait physical card to come,btohqsg
They promoting it on their own website tho.https://www.sc.com/sg/promotions/instant/,btohqsg
oh what the heck its sth new to me,btohqsg
SC app has. But how to get into app 😅Can login with SingPass?,btohqsg
Considering you applied via SingPass MyInfo  they might have created an online banking account using the same info.,btohqsg
wat wld be a good alternative to DBS LiveFresh given its new conditions,btohqsg
Does the amaze+citi reward transactions eligible for those welcome gift provide by singsaver or money smart?,btohqsg
Damn.. DBS Live Fresh card hasn't been that useful ever since DBS Multiplier account was nerfed to trash...For cashback (since you're coming from DBS Live Fresh card)  UOB EVOL/One card is good with UOB One account. Check your spending to see which fits you better.Always good to keep 1 DBS CC on hand at all times... But not for the rewards,btohqsg
As long MCC not excluded by promo,btohqsg
Is HSBC Revolution or DBS World woman card better?,btohqsg
WMCC now v hard to waive annual fee….,btohqsg
can anyone confirm if this works? what are my SC creds? I haven't signed up,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits. I prefer CRMC,btohqsg
just got an email about card approval,btohqsg
Thanks for this info. I just checked and it shows the March MAB. Just to confirm i can use the March MAB to do the transfer to top up to 150k and for the additional promo?,btohqsg
Yup. You need to keep at least MAB+50k throughout the earmark period.,btohqsg
If no info to help you register online then wait for the physical card already,btohqsg
I did a quick calculation. Eg 550 for 100k for 4 months. Interest is only 1.65% for this 100k. Did i calculate correctly? If 1.65% then seems to have better options elsewhere.,btohqsg
550 for 100k is 1.675% p.a. on top of 4% p.a.. So 5.675% p.a.,btohqsg
Oh he's referring to the promo. I thought where got 550 for 100k also,btohqsg
this is on topup of the interest max at 4% for $150k,btohqsg
So you're coming from 50k MAB + 100k top-up? That's a whopping 5.11% p.a for 4 months  I don't think anywhere else gives a guaranteed 5.11%.,btohqsg
About 100k MAB. But thinking to say top up more like 100k instead of 50k if the interest is worthwhile.,btohqsg
No  your interest rate will dip to 3% lol.,btohqsg
Ya. That’s what I think too. So should just top up to 150k to get the 4% right,btohqsg
Yes. Ideally 150k for 4.5% p.a. instead of 3.84% p.a. with 200k.,btohqsg
Thank you!! You have been very helpful!,btohqsg
Trying my luck here.. Has anyone tried linking uob lady’s card for their travel (bus/mrt) mthly concession ?,btohqsg
Wanted to know if i still get miles  im still paying for transport just that dk if it counts 😂,btohqsg
the merchant description is in the exclusion list,btohqsg
I saw the video and EVOL card is more recommended than one card. I have been using the one card and contemplating changing to EVOL now. Is applepay very common these days like paywave? I have been using paywave and never really notice and understand that paywave dun count under EVOL. Shopee is also my most used platform for online shopping. Any advice or tips if i should change to EVOL?,btohqsg
I see… the simplygo concession for bus/mrt is not under MCC4111,btohqsg
Just use ApplePay if you're on iPhone. It's honestly safer to do so since you have the biometrics as a first layer of security.,btohqsg
applepay is just tapping phone on the same paywave machine. Work out the effective rebate u getting and see whuch one earns more. Note that evol need $600 monthly spend and online/mobile contactless bonus rebate max out at $250 each.,btohqsg
Hey open question to the group how many years of age  maximum you should be when u become citizen in sg to have enough money to retire Asking as a expat,btohqsg
oh oops forgot to mention im alr using UOB EVOL  so looking for the next best alternative aside from that. and why good to keep 1 DBS CC?,btohqsg
I think the right question is how much is enough and not how old? You can even retire at 35 if you have established a passive income that grows while have still able to support your expenses 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
"You can do some searching around with keywords ""pay with DBS CC"". Not all answers can be found here.",btohqsg
Wow... Didn't know instarem rare is so lousy!,btohqsg
Their rates are better if you use their wallet. Which means no CC rewards.,btohqsg
Still down. Tried to use but can’t.,btohqsg
Lol the apps already pulled out from both Apple App Store and Google Play,btohqsg
"I think Xnap is gonna go ""belly up""",btohqsg
If XNAP is gonna be decommissioned  what’s another alternative for hawker payment using CC?,btohqsg
For those with citi cards  you guys tend to get lots of fraudulent changes? Its my 3rd card and yet i still get. Last card change only almost a year.,btohqsg
problem i port out again to Gomo (By Singtel) Its working well.But ZYM did say they sent technician down to the building to check. Seems coverage is okay.,btohqsg
yes. Mine too. And after dispute  need to wait at least 6 mths then can cancel card. Haha,btohqsg
Damn. So its common for citi?,btohqsg
I guess their rate is still better than credit card FX + DCC so there's still benefit in using it for cc rewards.,btohqsg
Paylah lo I assumed u are only referring to hawker spend,btohqsg
