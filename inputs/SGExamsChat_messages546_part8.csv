sm ur sharing personal stuff to literally random ass ppl on the internet,btohqsg
but why your feed so.. weird one,btohqsg
I mean idgaf if u doxx urself lah ur decision,btohqsg
I see a new batch of me,btohqsg
But this is kinda bringing someobe down w u,btohqsg
my feed isnt even dating shows its like mystery  songs etc,btohqsg
wait...pocoyo  its just end of sem1 tho,btohqsg
i still dk who u r,btohqsg
no as in thereâ€™s like a bunch of kids younger than me I suppose,btohqsg
Like winstein and zl is more active now as well,btohqsg
bro worked so hard he had to sleep to recover from the stress,btohqsg
we alr graduated so it doesnt matter,btohqsg
but u still know each other,btohqsg
I mean its like tmi cause from the pics youve shown its like all of us have access to her childhood pic  her pri school  her first name and her current appearance alrd from the uncle raymond video,btohqsg
tbh  if she reddits it..likely her case will explode,btohqsg
i reddit something once  and it went islandwide,btohqsg
So in the process of protecting ur friend youve kinda made her more vulnerable by accidentally exposing her private details more to the Singaporean internet,btohqsg
If its either reddit  wakeupsg or sgfollowsall its gone man ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
rmb that sw about taylor swift concert?,btohqsg
school assignment on the taylor swift concert,btohqsg
INVITE HER TO UR SCHOOL AH,btohqsg
i was the one that blew that up on reddit,btohqsg
Damn thats crazy cause ive never seen that one before,btohqsg
Still dont rmb but this goofy af sia ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Top student for that assignment gets their email sent to taylor swift isit ðŸ’€,btohqsg
especially if the post is damn on trend,btohqsg
but if i donâ€™t expose him  he will target more ppl,btohqsg
ur friend is and if she wants to bring it up then she can,btohqsg
if u expose him and turns out ur friend was lying,btohqsg
not saying that she is i dont know,btohqsg
it will bite u back in ur ass,btohqsg
I mean excluding the exposing thing u still gotta know how to expose him WHILST trying to keep ur friend's privacy as well..private as it already is,btohqsg
Chances are shes alrd vulnerable to the internet by appearing on wtv siao lang show he has and has agreed to expose him even if her own privacy may be even more compromised,btohqsg
"But at the same time you still have to do stuff like censor her first name in the whatsapp contact so it doesnt make it easier for netizens to go like ""okay lets find out who exactly she is""",btohqsg
Just keep in mind  we are not saying that your friend is lying or anything. But the way to expose him is not to throw down allegations on behalf of your friend...If she does not know you are doing this and then something goes amiss. Who is going to answer? you or your friend,btohqsg
do u have any exams or ur alr done for the sem,btohqsg
"The biggest point of contention when starting a allegation is to ask yourself ""Are you ready to bear the consequences if its not true""",btohqsg
