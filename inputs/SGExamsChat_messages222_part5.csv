To me yes ðŸ˜‚ every sch is same just that different name sounds different,btohqsg
I did worse for A levels than in j1 hahaha,btohqsg

Its still lies on the complex plane,btohqsg
Name-wise  ACJC has the best name  because the C repeats  which sounds nice  and A rhymes with J,btohqsg
More like if can choose then choose wad we like loJust like handbag. Any bag can serve its function but if i can choose then take advantage of the choosing power,btohqsg

that seeing the institution ''RI'' makes them more interested in the applicant,btohqsg

Selling yourself simply means accentuating the good points and keeping quiet about the less good points ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
It simply means person is talented but sth screwed up,btohqsg
I see  hopefully all employers think that way,btohqsg
