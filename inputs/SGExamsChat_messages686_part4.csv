Coz SKH is the only hosp in the NE region,btohqsg
If moe decides the grade boundaries based on the difficulty of the paper and not take into account the performance of the students then it’s all good,btohqsg
Is there even an educated smoking portion,btohqsg
But if there’s is a bellcurve of sorts or they take into account the performance then I would pissed about all the tutors who sit for the paper,btohqsg
Cos they’re making it harder for real students to get good grades,btohqsg
I dun think it is grade boundaries,btohqsg
Oh so that is where the tasting come into play,btohqsg
Im sure if ur theory is good  that is a given aso tho,btohqsg
But the real practical itself needs skills beyond theory knowledge,btohqsg
Moe said no bell curve but up till now I still don’t know in setting the grade threshold for each subject whether they only take into account the difficulty or whether they look at the performance after marking,btohqsg
Therefore  when the papers for a subject have been marked  a group of experts meets to decide how to convert the marks to grades. The experts look at marked papers from the current and previous years  then they decide what theminimum markfor each grade should be. If this year's papers are found to be slightly harder than last year's  then this year's grade boundaries will be slightly lower than last year's. Similarly  if this year's papers are found to be slightly easier  the grade boundaries will be slightly higher.,btohqsg
This implies that they don’t look at the cohort’s performance,btohqsg
Only judge it based on difficulty,btohqsg
Moe confirms also uses grade boundaries but we just don’t know the exact range for each subject and each year since it’s not disclosed,btohqsg
The more im puzzled w my grades,btohqsg
Uk a levels they will disclose after each exam,btohqsg
I think Cambridge give the grades no meh,btohqsg
The examiners give the raw marks,btohqsg
Seab decides on the standard for each grade,btohqsg
But sch exams only moderate the passing mark lmao,btohqsg
They don’t change the raw mark,btohqsg
They just adjust the mark needed to get each grade,btohqsg
In a sense it is similar to bell curve just that the marks ppl get doesn’t matter,btohqsg
Yeah only need to meet the grade threshold for a particular grade in order to get it,btohqsg
Unless they under/overest the difficulty of the paper,btohqsg
Similar but bellcurve takes into account percentile,btohqsg
And it is also weird to ask the examiner / setter to judge difficulty,btohqsg
Grade thresholds don’t so it’s better,btohqsg
Tbh I prefer a bell curve system,btohqsg
If everyone gets like 80-100 marks for an exam the person who got 80 would have been failed assuming moe designates like the bottom 5 percentile to fail,btohqsg
Grade thresholds if they set it before the paper is marked and only takes into account the difficulty then the distinction rate can vary quite a bit between years if the students in a particular year have better aptitude,btohqsg
I always think w bell curve  someone needs to fail,btohqsg
I still rather have grade thresholds since after all if bellcurve is used  the percentage of ppl getting a particular grade will be fixed unless moe alters it. But if moe needs to alter it because a batch of students is worse or better than usual  how do they decide how much to increase the percentage of failures/quality grades by? They still gonna have to see the students performance on each paper is and not arbitrarily decide a new percentage.,btohqsg
Well not every course has the luxury of past yr paper,btohqsg
I heard nus is like they will tell u how many As per module,btohqsg
But they wont tell u how much to get A,btohqsg
Or its the reverse i cant rmb,btohqsg
but ok for uni i agree on preferring bell curve ngl,btohqsg
like i feel that’s how i get my As and A+s,btohqsg
and it’s always from doing comparatively well in finals,btohqsg
but our studying methods are so different lol,btohqsg
i have never mugged in the sense people think of,btohqsg
almost feels like i smoked through uni,btohqsg
but idk if that’s imposter syndrome,btohqsg
im trying to clock 30h on ypt in march for ego,btohqsg
i mean i have nth to lose anyway,btohqsg
This has been going on for damn long alr,btohqsg
I cant sleep last night and now im just dozing off,btohqsg
And still hving problems with concentration,btohqsg
Then in the middle i will start cursing myself,btohqsg
