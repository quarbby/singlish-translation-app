"I remember that there was a sg youtuber who said ""it is the best time to invest in syfe retis when inflation rises"". Bet he misled alot of people to lose their hard earned savings",btohqsg
Maybe that's why I'd probably not get a sponsor there,btohqsg
"Speaking of which  the community poll now has more ""Yes  acceptable"" for Syfe explanation now",btohqsg
Iâ€™m not sure if@ChrisHMSGwill allow me to share other youtube channel videos here or not lol. But is one of the channels mentioned in the polls recently,btohqsg
anyways syfe say until like it is sept that is pulling the performance down  but i just saw Chris's review  since July also negative returns,btohqsg
Yup. Really really awful and depressing performance from syfe,btohqsg
No need to share the video of other youtuber here. But those who kaypo can ask them pm you,btohqsg
Since syfe's ongoing poor performance  should be continue to DCA or  wait for things to settle down,btohqsg
Thanks for the video  really on point. Think lots of seniors still reluctant to retire because of the points mentioned in your video. And I like this format! Dont know why feels very peaceful haha,btohqsg
Feels you are doing self reflection,btohqsg
I believe that there are people doing DCA consistently for quite a period of time even before September and yet very poor performance,btohqsg
Been DCA-Ing for 5months ale ðŸ˜‚ now negative ðŸ˜‚ do I continue DCA-ong & whatâ€™s the time weight return % thing ?,btohqsg
Yeah this series need less effort to film since i dont need to script it or set up the studio setting  so I could share my thoughts more naturally,btohqsg
Okay la  negative $14 hahaha but if core growth portfolio negative a bit weird leh. Thought US and tech doing quite well past few months until sept.,btohqsg
For me everything negative. And i had way more than that guy core growth. My REITs  core  custom all negative. Even if custom using solid ETFs like QQQ everything also negative. Really depressing performance,btohqsg
REITs negative i think i can understand haha  now dont think industrial and retails REITs doing well,btohqsg
Sfye is v red  endowus also red though abit lesser degree... hai.....,btohqsg
It's okay  we all same boat. Tough year (or two),btohqsg
I only have syfe and tiger broker. Syfe 100% portfoilios all negative. And tiger 95% all negative.Can't believe select large cap growth stocks also all red. Syfe etf like QQQ  VTI  RSP also all deep in the red bear market. Unable to recover,btohqsg
I am a beginner in robo investment. Put 70k plus and in 2 mths lost 1k Liao.....,btohqsg
For Endowus.. Capital not guarantee huh?,btohqsg
Oh no... That's hurt. But don't give up hope,btohqsg
The lost is from more from sfye and lesser from endowus...,btohqsg
Hope? Lost faith? Lost trust also. Are these bad stock picks; apple  Microsoft  tsmc  Nvidia  Facebook  amd  Berkshire  MacDonald  home depot.With Such solid stocks still can red? Then im speechless. Is not like I bought meme stocks like amc. Really disappointed,btohqsg
"According to syfe they said need long term to ""ride out voality"". This is what they said to me when I told them about their disastrous portfoilios:HI XXX Investing is a patience game corrections are pack and parcel. Typically investing is a 3-5 year process (at least). History time and again has shown its time in the market and not timing the market that wins. So stay focused with a long run perspective.",btohqsg
If those investing accounts not guarantee  but for those cash smart account is guaranteed with various interest rate if i am not wrong. Better to do research first though!,btohqsg
I keep hearing all this; time in market and diversification. Soundslogical.myportfolio is fully diversified globally and in all sector.. however  100 percent red.... I hope what these guys  say is truthful and not Bec they want the fees ...,btohqsg
Thks XY! Ya.. Better find out first before pump in big,btohqsg
Nothing is guaranteed. My cash smart also lost....,btohqsg
thought cash smart is like bank acc with higher interest rates,btohqsg
Oh.. Then confirm no guarantee lor,btohqsg
Fully 101% agree withLCM. He may just be a stranger to me but that's exactly what happened to my portfolio alsoIn fact I got 12 portfoilios. 2 retis  2 core growth + equity and the rest custom with ETFs with track record. Yet all negative. Diverisifed so much yet still negative. For those who didn't diverisfy  I can't imagine your pain...,btohqsg
sad right  heard some people around my friends bought meme stocks and dogecoin also profit from it. zzz hahaha,btohqsg
Well  at least crypto is green. Like massive green,btohqsg
For me I don't do crypto or meme. I'm a rather risk conscious person. Yet with all these research still entire portfolio red  really depressing. Not sure if it's bad luck or I bought at a high,btohqsg
why need 2 of the portfolios? different risk/weightage?,btohqsg
Wow. I tot because I was too US big tech equity heavy or lacked bonds or other sector . Can't beleive u diverisfy so much more than me yet syfe 100% negative like the bear enclosure in the zoo. Jialat ...,btohqsg
I am kiasu  bought most portfolio and All red..... But will just hang on..... The lesson I learn is diversification does not guaranteed anything too.,btohqsg
Diverisification for the sake of it. But all still negative. Oh well. Not my fault. I may withdraw 100% from syfe and shift to tiger after 6 month free trial. Cos tiger doesn't charge holding fees of 0.65% amonth,btohqsg
If not wait green then buy meh,btohqsg
If its a good biz  it's great discount,btohqsg
hahaha yeah! so continue to DCA ba,btohqsg
"""diversification is a protection against ignorance""~ Warren buffet..Good to have some etf? Or just DCA into a index fund that tracks S&P500 like VOO or SPY? What can possibly go wrong I guess? Or maybe not ..",btohqsg
Haha when green regret red didn't buy more.. red regret green the time buy too much?,btohqsg
Anyway  more experience doesn't mean will be a winner. If u invest just starting in 2020  u will be a super big winner,btohqsg
I don't dare to open my tiger brokers cause I'm just going to assume everything is red everyday. Just let it bleed lo,btohqsg
Hahahh is okayyy there's blood everywhere in the streets,btohqsg
May I ask  what is a good platform to do crypto?,btohqsg
I guess up to personal investing style  i know some people like to jus do ETFs cause dont need to think. Some like to pick individual stocks  some only buy REITs for the dividends,btohqsg
Ya so it's the timing and partly luck. Now the market is over valued. Will have correction downwards. + All the fed nonsense  debt ceiling nonsense  don't drop worse than 2008 happy ale,btohqsg
