I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúLong application lady‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
your question needs to differentiate btwn before & after 55  voluntary and mandatory CPF contribution. different rules.,btohqsg
whats the offical honey money instagram page?,btohqsg
seems like both case doesnt matter  since the SA = RA. money will flow from MA to SA/RA then go to OA only if not yet hit FRS...,btohqsg
for below 55  even if SA hits FRS  mandatory CPF contribution still goes to SA. you just can't do anymore RSTU,btohqsg
No  the real one is honeymoneysg without the dot  please help to report,btohqsg
below 55  mandatory CPFOA = goes OASA = goes to SA even if hit more than FRSMA = goes SA if MA hits BHS and SA below FRS. Goes OA if MA hits BHS and SA above FRS.above 55  mandatory CPF (from 2025)OA = goes OARA = goes RA if below FRS. If above  goes OA. No more SA accountMA = goes MA if below BHS. if hit BHS: goes RA (if below FRS) or OA (if above FRS).above 55  top-up RA (from 2025)Up to ERS (4X BRS)  via cash or transfer from OA. top-up sums can only be distributed via monthly CPF Life and not lump sum.RSTU below 55goes to SA if below FRS. If hit FRS  RSTU not possible.VCMAtop up MA  once hit BHS  not possible anymore.,btohqsg
SA will continue to grow and get interest  but no RSTU... but if hit BHS  MA go to OA like this...What happens at and after 55?,btohqsg
For UOB Absolute Cashback card  if u spent some amount last statement month and have the 1.7% cashback credited to this month for the bill but u this month never spend on the absolute cashback card but on another card like Evol  how will the absolute cashback cc cashback work?,btohqsg
Then no cashback on the UOB Absolute Cashback card lor lol,btohqsg
you already have the answer at the screenshot you took from Chris' youtube,btohqsg
Mediaave will go OA. Then RA? Freeze right since SA closed,btohqsg
So best is to spend some money on the absolute cashback cc consistently?,btohqsg
cashback will be credited to uob absolute to be used to offset future spending on uob absolute,btohqsg
Understand your qn wrongly lol. See Trazora answer,btohqsg

Am pondering over such tooHow is the credit limit dictated for individuals. Age 55 and below and above has its own set of limits depending on annual income based on website. But is not true for me  is way way below,btohqsg
Planning to apply for new home loan. But I got so many credit cards now. Should I just cancel away most coz a fren told me it will affect my credit ratings and the loan quantum I can secure üòÖ‚Ä¶ any experience n advice here?,btohqsg
i had more than 10 cards and applied for home loan without issue. credit score wasn't affected by the cards i hold  in fact  it builds my credit worthiness by showing i could pay bills on time.,btohqsg
They look at TDSR ... the number of cards is not the issue.,btohqsg
oh this 1 definitely agree i have a few too lol. but the fees meh. closing some not used one,btohqsg
not true as in u high income but low credit ?,btohqsg
Is not even close to whatever is stated here. The difference is vast.,btohqsg
lol need ask bank. Mine not even 4x,btohqsg
Hi all   I will be going Indonesia (Batam) for a week. I see IDR rate are not good now. Should I use iChange or Trust card for payment?,btohqsg
Oh btw  after 55 and below two options(1) hit full FRS sum;(2) hit BRS and pledge propertyCan withdraw OA anytime? Partial withdrawal like ATm?,btohqsg
Hey thks for sharing. I will pay off regularly  fully and early as well. With this I am more assured it won‚Äôt affect my loan application.,btohqsg
But if it is not too far fetched  I guess is explainable. Maybe a look into one‚Äôs length in the employed company also taken into consideration. But if the difference is extremely large  is strange. Am curious thus asking. Applied via Singsaver using singpass  dunno whether that makes a difference though,btohqsg
Which card good for everyday spend like contactless usage  uob ppv or hsbc  giving 4miles¬† ?,btohqsg
Is the iChange debit card accepted at most stores in the JB shopping malls?,btohqsg

BothSome people do via< $10 HSBC$10 > PPV,btohqsg
MCC 8099Pay online or in app.,btohqsg
So can be spend on almost anytime on this 2 cards for 4 miles,btohqsg
Majority of the daily are fine  maybe UOB$ merchant avoid PPV,btohqsg
