Ask him don't forget GP and PW,btohqsg
How hard is it to get into the poly course,btohqsg
He thought for 2 weeks also haven't think finish,btohqsg
Later if he reject and eventually decide poly but cut off cmi den really gg,btohqsg

U kinda can slack abit for o level right,btohqsg
Den he can start slacking after today,btohqsg
But the r4 for his course is quite low,btohqsg
For eae engineering science is a very rare course,btohqsg
But he liked history cuz of his teacher,btohqsg
Just curious what did u and him use to eae?,btohqsg
I regret not trying out now tho i'll be rejected,btohqsg
We went for open hse ü§©,btohqsg
That's quite different from engineering leh,btohqsg
And JC history is like a small part,btohqsg
He cannot balance history and engineering,btohqsg
Huh what does that do in getting a spot in np,btohqsg
I also regret not going for open hse but hey i signed up for red camp so yes,btohqsg
He was inspired by our history teacher and he HCI and NUSH top in cohort,btohqsg

Like out of 10hour in school,btohqsg

Scoring well should not be the reason why he choose the subject  must be genuine interest also,btohqsg
