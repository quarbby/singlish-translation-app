Just need $500 increase and salary credit .... For ocbc .... Or is there a new promo,btohqsg
My this month sp bill recurring payment will on 9th May on UOB one cc  is after Uob cc bill date  anyway I can manual do early payment myself by Uob one cc? If I use Axs to pay  will my Uob one cc still entitle the >$500 rebate?,btohqsg
For OCBC 360 account  yes. Same requirements apply.You cannot do money lock on UOB One account. Alternative would be using UOB LockAway account which will yield less than 3% for 100k.,btohqsg
Axs excluded  use sp app included  can do early payment on sp app,btohqsg
I can't do it through sp app by manually payment now.ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Erm  why not  i do it all the time for my dad even with recurring payment  go to your bills and there will be payment options,btohqsg
There is no lock fund options for uob one but u can always participate in uob saving promo and earmark the fund haha,btohqsg
I try to press every button  can't do the payment.ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Using axs dont work so u might as well let it charges on your uob one for next statement  just clock the shortfall on uob one loh,btohqsg

Should be up to $100 cashback per month. You'll only receive after the end of the quarter  i.e. 3 months,btohqsg
I think still can do this till end May 2024: Use UOB  Absolute Cashback Amex card to top up Grabpay wallet then use Grabpay card at MRT station to top up Ezlink card. This gives u 0.3%. Pay the UOB Absolute Cashback Amex card using HSBC EGA via giro. This gives another 1%.,btohqsg
If you a new user I think got an enhanced cash back that's a different $100 cap for 6 months,btohqsg
