U WAN COME KIRA WORK PLACE PICK ME TMR?  HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
2 and a half years ltr,btohqsg
Wa stuff4less review not that good,btohqsg
My ex old car went there for red seat belt change. Install wrongly haha,btohqsg
Well what is done is done i guessü•≤,btohqsg
Will see how the bonnet turns out,btohqsg
How much is ur bonnet to done?,btohqsg
Rmb to check before u accept,btohqsg
Yep i only gave 50% other 50% is after work done,btohqsg
Aiyo. Why everytime i hear someone talk abt s4L the experience always negative,btohqsg
I try to imagine u know that its negative reviews will be loudest but really too many lol,btohqsg
Everytime i see porche bmw all doing spray painting bodykit all hmmmmm,btohqsg
Give benefit of doubt also shag,btohqsg
When I‚Äôm there a lot of ppl complain that the spray not that good,btohqsg
How about some positive vibes then,btohqsg
Thats why my bonnet spray idk how its gonna come out too,btohqsg
I like my wrap shop a lot,btohqsg
Im their repeat customer and i observe ppl return to them also,btohqsg
It gonna be alright. Don‚Äôt worry,btohqsg
But quite a lot of high end car there for wrapping,btohqsg
They get a lot of customers compared to other shops but i guess there are more bad reviews cause of that too,btohqsg
Like when i was there looking at what design to cut i alr saw like 15 cars there,btohqsg
The only sus thing is its closed doors,btohqsg
That in itself is a problem  they are doing volume business that means. Lower margin but high flow which means your ride receive less attention and a faster job,btohqsg
Which would explain the seat belt,btohqsg
@chloetherx8when u went to do it was it bangaladesh people?,btohqsg
No  i think viet and china,btohqsg
They take 6hr to do mine sigh,btohqsg
And they like to hardsell alot,btohqsg
Yes. Hard sell me sound poof lol,btohqsg
But luckily i managed to bargain and bargain until market price hahaha,btohqsg
Hope you all don‚Äôt get offended. Is my own experience,btohqsg
Yeah i mean for me they know i cant pay all one shot so they let me pay 50:50,btohqsg
Tbh though its not nationality. Its how the boss do the flow and what the focus os,btohqsg
Do they keep telling rhe worker to hurry up and turnover,btohqsg
Which was nice to me but dk how it will turn out,btohqsg
Or do they tell them to get it right,btohqsg
My wrap they did it the second way,btohqsg
Nope the workers infact tell the so call viet agents to not rush them like my bonnet when they switch over to their one and took mine the agent keep rushing them but they scolded her and took their time patiently,btohqsg
That time my seat belt 400$ to change ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya thats why they overprice but will say cheapest in the market,btohqsg
But i show them evident they are not then they bring down the price,btohqsg

See how fast the swifts are,btohqsg
I drove a 32s  so this is one of my fave video,btohqsg
And if u got money  can buy the latest gen swift sport,btohqsg
That one is another league of it's own cos it's turboed,btohqsg
on paper is not much faster than the NA. but in reality  different story,btohqsg
230Nm for 970kg is v fast,btohqsg
but the deprec also v stuidp,btohqsg
but compared to other cars in that range  it's still the one to go for,btohqsg
Nothing in that price cate has more fun than the swift sport,btohqsg
It's like mx5s la. Expensive  but it has no other competitors,btohqsg
if you look at it individually  all cars are expensive now,btohqsg
gt 1 lancer EX just drop 4k in price haha.. lowest deprec for parf now 8.2k,btohqsg
but i think there for v long liao,btohqsg
surely got reason. there's a lotus on sgcm also. heard it's on k24 ü§£,btohqsg

So I usually end up in esso,btohqsg
Or caltex if I want similar to vpower,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt race so pump that,btohqsg
For me and@roincecvery far to pump vpower racing,btohqsg
