the ICC mods blackboard is the worst,btohqsg
My batch FM is less than a class,btohqsg
but ICC is rly damn bad,btohqsg
btw dhs explicitly disallow cfm cxm xfm,btohqsg
cause the classes for c x f are concurrent,btohqsg
I dun understand why they force 4H2 tho,btohqsg
my batch got 2 classes with computing,btohqsg
the teachers say they open for us out of pity,btohqsg
ok no wonder bc im pre ICC batch,btohqsg
ICC is the bane of my existence,btohqsg
U mean the 3H2 1H1 FM thing?,btohqsg
they say since got 11 ppl alr show interest wld be a shame to turn everyone down,btohqsg
i heard the reason they allow 3H2 Fm now got to do with the new UAS system,btohqsg
Tbh i like the bendy part on MRT,btohqsg
Wait u mean they wanted to not hv fm at all???,btohqsg
by right a class need 15 ppl to start,btohqsg
cant they just have a class where theres fm ppl and chem ppl,btohqsg
so technically 11 ppl only but tmjc decided to open a fm class since fair enough,btohqsg
4H2 class and my class is mixed PCME and PFME,btohqsg
ooh but then you taking h1 econs no,btohqsg
for dhs the h1 subjs all at 1 time,btohqsg
i think you miss the interaction and the friendship  not the person himself...?,btohqsg
So ur batch 1st batch TM offer FM as 3H2 1H1?,btohqsg
like h1 econs h1 math h1 history all same timing,btohqsg
Tutorials all the weird H1 same time I think,btohqsg
my class has 2 ppl taking H1 geog,btohqsg
Depends on if full class take,btohqsg
Im not sure about that but most classes in TM is 1 subject combination,btohqsg
