No i just wanna know before the nerf.  So no matter what not worth it for the 1% fee,btohqsg
ok  not much value though since nerf coming soon,btohqsg
I always thought there will be like 0.4 miles for the remaining 3 dollars. So that's not the case?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think so  just block of $5,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s always the negative side of UOB  but bo bian,btohqsg
My Net Worth Journey to $1M: $300K UpdateVideo:https://youtu.be/9wz3caN6myUBuilding wealth isnâ€™t about shortcutsâ€”itâ€™s about consistency  smart decisions  and discipline. In this video  Iâ€™ll share how I reached $300K before turning 30  following a structured approach through corporate earnings  side hustles  and investing.,btohqsg
I just got both the cards ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
not for ppv  for uob VS still get 3.6mpd,btohqsg
CRMC is still safe and a good card to use  just that have to be online,btohqsg
Looks like I gotta use more of shopback and kris + with my citi rewards,btohqsg
ah so it means amaze and crmc -> will have 1% fee now is it,btohqsg
I think Kris + still need go through amaze to get 4mpd ?,btohqsg
kris+ cannot use crmc direct btw,btohqsg
For local physical transaction  yes sadly,btohqsg
So if we use shopback with crmc will it still earn citi points?,btohqsg
but only the 1x not 10x right,btohqsg
crmc cannot use with apple pay just take note donâ€™t forget,btohqsg
If we look at a smaller scale $100 equivalent to paying $1   the 1% doesnt look too big . ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yup  I agree too  will still going to use the CRMC/Amaze combo,btohqsg
applepay in-app no 10x points  applepay contactless still get 10x points for some fashion mccs,btohqsg
Unless individual spent $1000 on physical spent,btohqsg
+ its 4mpd still and the MCC covers almost everything except for travel/hotel,btohqsg
Precisely  covers mostly everything on daily to daily stuff.Maybe hoop on EGA to pay the CC bill to offset the 1% fee ?,btohqsg
but need to be min 50 or close to that,btohqsg
But why not just use UOB PPV?,btohqsg
citi rewards points more valuable maybe lol,btohqsg
Think have to be aware of the $5 blocks,btohqsg
if doing min $50  $5 blocks not so significant,btohqsg
Agree  really depend on the amount ba,btohqsg
Btw.  Anyone try using NTUC app for payment and pair with citi reward  does it still give you 4mpd ? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
So itâ€™s up to individual spending,btohqsg
Thanks â€¦ at least still useful in a way,btohqsg
the point is $5 block is less of an issue than 1% min $0.50 fees,btohqsg
M1/Singtel bill  can link CRMC and get 10x points when we pay the monthly bill?,btohqsg
How about using Amex True Cashback? 1.5%. Does it works on CapitaStar voucher purchase?,btohqsg
singtel need to pay on their website not app,btohqsg
Looking forward to Chrisâ€™ video update/reaction on this ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ahh then crmc wouldnt be an issue to post it as an online transaction i guess.,btohqsg
Well unless my understanding is incorrect  this means that i still can earn 4mpd at Kopitiam using NTUC app for payment and pair with citi reward? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Will Citi reward points expire if you donâ€™t redeem them?,btohqsg
yes after 3 years  I thinkEdit: apparently 5 years  read message below,btohqsg
expire 5 years+3months from card approval and every 5 years thereafter,btohqsg
yes if link citi rewards directly to fairprice app (not via google/apple pay in app),btohqsg
If it is considered as online,btohqsg
Is there a good reason to keep cash in UOB stash or better in MMF or cash management funds?,btohqsg
One is saving account with capital guaranteed and the other is not,btohqsg
True. The stable funds should be good growth for passive income. The digital bank rates are attractive too,btohqsg
Hi all  with the recent amaze nerf coming  what else can crmc be used for on a daily basis?I know we can use the following for the bonus:1. Fairprice (app payment using crmc direct instead of Samsung pay/Apple pay)2. Shopback (app payment using crmc direct instead of Samsung pay/Apple pay)3. Favepay (app payment using crmc direct instead of Samsung pay/Apple pay)Anything else that can be used?,btohqsg
Anybody take a long time to receive the choc finance card? Wonder if its lost in the mail,btohqsg
Crmc + amaze after nerf thoughts: the online transaction still looks good since rounding off is based on $1. Up 5 years expiry of points still fit in well for those needing Abit more time. Indeed it has lost it attractiveness than before but it still serve some target users. However personally Iâ€™m looking at this chance to also align another uob card to match with uob lady card to reset citi new to bank status.,btohqsg
