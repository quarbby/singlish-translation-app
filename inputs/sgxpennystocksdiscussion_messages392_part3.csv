Goodness. What sort of clarification is that.,btohqsg
Mean patient can only go aloneðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Like confirmation of what everyone is sayingAdd some denialWeak,btohqsg
They play with words until they confuse themselves. This only make sense if they classify those from TTSH not as human.,btohqsg
A visitor  caregiver  accompanying person seeking treatment then? Lmao,btohqsg
Hahaâ€¦. Like that nobody can enter SGH at allâ€¦,btohqsg
Still havenâ€™t the part thatâ€™s incorrect,btohqsg
Then blood vessel kena blockage !,btohqsg
Well if the individual seeking treatment happen to be a visitor  caregivers or accompanying persons from TTSH at appointed date  can he enter or not?,btohqsg
They should go back school learn about sets,btohqsg
Think itâ€™s more of language skill. The way they phrase it sound like all from TTSH will be rejected. But they actually mean only visitors  caregivers or accompanying person visiting SGH who happen to be in TTSH at appointed time will be rejectedâ€¦,btohqsg
I think I am getting what they meant. Correct me if I am wrong.Although one has visited TTSH  SGH has no rights to deny him/her entry for treatment.However visitors / caregivers / accompanying persons who have been to TTSH  bringing the patient to seek treatment at SGH  are not allowed in. A nurse will bring the patient in for you.,btohqsg
Yeap.. but on first glance everyone will think they reject all from TTSH due to the way they phrase it. Think they should recruit new spokesperson.,btohqsg
They have every right to do soOnly sinkies no rights.,btohqsg
Thinking maybe itâ€™s time to re enter Sheng shiong knowing the kiasee mentality of the public. DYODDâ€¦,btohqsg
Ya.. I went to ntuc.. My cup noodle tio scoop liao,btohqsg

All these scholar generals cfm think their simi mathematical models bla bla bla show the risk-reward trade off as worth taking,btohqsg
The first thing I learnt in econometrics? Models do not reflect the real world. Especially if your model has many Random variables and uncertainties. That's why there's an error term in every regression eqn,btohqsg
With an unknown virus  your error term sure high what. When the variants all start appearing  no one ever bothered to question? All yes men?,btohqsg
They not paid to say I don't know mah,btohqsg
It's better to say 'I don't know' then to lead us into death,btohqsg
