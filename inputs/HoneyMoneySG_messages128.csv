Hi gurus  want to check what is the strategy to pay for reno works to ID (not furnitures).in the event if they dont accept credit cards. i am looking at about 50k. whats the best way to earn miles from it?,btohqsg
You all can login to UOB app?,btohqsg
I am not able to too,btohqsg
just do surveys and get points to be converted to paypal acc,btohqsg
USD/SGD drops to $1.293. Does that means those investment converted from SGD to USD for higher or guaranteed return promo earlier are losing money?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs always the risk of foreign currency investments.,btohqsg
Unless you have a use for the funds in usd - like buying real estate  gold  bonds  equities  etc,btohqsg
Do you know how to check Citi thank you point next expiry date?,btohqsg
Then those bought investments also have risk of fx depreciation.,btohqsg
Hi all  if I use amaze +crmc or uob ladies to make reservation for overseas activities  and if the activity got cancelled and vendor refund the money  will they refund to amaze  or the credit card linked to it when I made the payment  or the credit card currently linked to amaze?,btohqsg
The answer is it depends on which merchant,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs a refund  will go back to the credit card you linked at the point of reservation.,btohqsg
Based on dp  it depends on the merchant. Some refund to card  but by default it refunds to amaze.,btohqsg
Does Citi still issue Citi Premier Visa card?,btohqsg
Oh yeah I forgot to reply. No issues since morning.,btohqsg
Hi is it worth to use amaze card to link to kris flyer UOB and incur the 1% fee for bigger purchase (~7k)  assuming can earn 3mpd?,btohqsg
You are paying 60 dollars (could be more if you already had other local spend) for 12 600 miles. Is worth it to you?,btohqsg
Depends on what you purchase and which merchant.,btohqsg
does anyone know if buying tea from TWG in taka qualifies for the DBS taka $250 min spend  $150 rebate?,btohqsg
Depending on time frame of investments  and whether the usd weakness is a permanent trend or just a current trade condition issue‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Would using BOC card link to cardup qualify for the $500 spend?,btohqsg
If can hit salary above $6k  spend > $1.5k  3 giro bills  $100k  interest is 4.8%?,btohqsg
4.6%. no need giro bill  pay bill on boc app also can,btohqsg
For 100k in BOC  if you can hit 3 bill payment  it's decent saving account. A more common scenario  4k salary credit  500-800 cc spend  no or less than 3 bills  and we will get 2.8% pa. Do I miss something?,btohqsg
Salary crediting can only choose one so choose the best one which is 4.65% for ocbc 360,btohqsg
There is a no hurdle mari bank acct which u can get 2.7% pa interest credit daily,btohqsg
Hi hi  I‚Äôve recently opened a new ocbc 360 account. Has not put in the 100k yet. My next salary will credit in around 15 Sep.If I transfer in the 100k into my account on 01 Sep  salary credit in on 15 Sep  will I clock 4% EIR interest rate?May I check if ocbc 365‚Äôs quarterly monthly‚Äôs spend of $800  can I include Geneco bill  SP bill  Singtel bills  Simba bills?,btohqsg
100k in mari u get ard $7.40 everyday. This $7.40 u can put in mari invest for 3.58% pa,btohqsg
very easy to meet the higher tier requirements,btohqsg
Why get 4.6 if u can get 4.65% for ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Erm  just in case if I can‚Äôt clock the credit card tier.,btohqsg
$500 for ocbc 365 is easy,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if bills can be included in the ocbc 365 credit card.Cos currently my bills and my prudential insurance is tagged to maybank.,btohqsg
4.65% is at the expense of the $500 increment earning 0.05% right?,btohqsg
Oh. So spend $500 can Liao ah? No need $800?,btohqsg
Yes $800 is for the ocbc 365 rebate,btohqsg
4.3% is inferior to ocbc 360,btohqsg
Thanks bro. May I check  if geneco  SP  Singtel & Simba bill can be included in the rebate?Cos I‚Äôm thinking  ocbc 365 should hit $500 to get the 4.65% interest for 360.Or should I clock $800 to get additional rebate?So if only hit $500  probably the new infinity card is better for the 1.6% cash back?,btohqsg
Annualised it is ard 4.687% pa maybe because of the slight excess or the days in the mth hmm,btohqsg
Up to u just know that even with no rebate $500 spend gives u $50.95 cash credit for $100k,btohqsg
This bonus interest cc spend you received for the min $500 spend ? Or  was it >$800?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 requirement is only $500 spend which is 0.6% eir,btohqsg
I usually spend $800 to get the extra rebate from ocbc 365,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  my Citibank cashback card was approved on 8 Aug and statement was on 24 Aug. In between  I spent $700+ (less than the required $800/month). May I check whether I will be credited with the bonus cashback or just the basic of 0.25% for my spending? CSO said that I'm not entitled to the bonus cashback  hence checking with the experts here.,btohqsg
Wondering whether I'm supposed to spend >$800 within 3 weeks for my first billing cycle.,btohqsg
Anyone tried M1 maxx ? I read bad review about Simba. Thinking of switching telco,btohqsg
M1   simba  the connection not very good.Can try gomo if u don need change phone every 2 years. Gomo tags to SingTel line,btohqsg
Thanks for your advice. I‚Äôll probably get 365  I‚Äôll go check it out what category is included in this rebate for the $800 spend criteria.,btohqsg
Ocbc 365 deal like not very attractive now.Cabin luggage + 2x cashback. $80 more.,btohqsg
I was with m1. Cmi. ü§£ max dunno yet.My whole family using Simba. So far so good. Some places have weaker signals  but overall really worth it.$12 / month deal is the best imo. 200gb local & 5gb international.,btohqsg
If u want good signal  gomo? But they don‚Äôt have roaming data.,btohqsg
If I transfer 100k on 01 Sep  my salary credit on 15 September  I spend $800 on ocbc 365 by end of Sep  will I get 4.65% EIR?Or must salary be credited in the first week of Sep?,btohqsg
Can we still earn pts on HSBC revolution when we use cardup?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc bonus pts cutoff is it by transaction or posting date?,btohqsg
Okie. Thanks so much. I‚Äôll go apply the 365 card for Sep use Liao. üòäüëç,btohqsg
So the $50 from spend bonus includes the extra rebates?,btohqsg
For this video  Chris recco live + specifically for food and dining  but if the person can‚Äôt hit the $600 minimum spend then also no used right,btohqsg
no the rebate from credit card will not be shown in savings acct it will be a separate credit card rebate,btohqsg
No 600 for that month then no used for the entire quarter (except for the quarter you open the acct),btohqsg
How about OCBC  Would using OCBC visa card link to cardup qualify for the $500 spend?,btohqsg
I would think yes with the right card but I never tried before,btohqsg
Is it possible to get the Citi Prestige card without hitting the min. Income Level and using ur fixed Deposit as colleteral?,btohqsg
But not sure what‚Äôs the current FD amount. Previously was 10k  but if they follow UOB for 120k cards  might be 30k FD,btohqsg
May have to check with Citi. Milelion said 15k while suitemiles said 10k. And I can't find any info on Citi website,btohqsg
Anyone‚Äôs amaze card became unavailable in Apple Pay?,btohqsg
nope. was able to use it an hour ago,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to get the referral code in Yuu app? Supposed to share your unique referral code in your yuu App under ‚Äúyuu ID‚Äù (‚ÄúReferral Code‚Äù)  but I can‚Äôt find it,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Dcs unlimited card support what ah  for cashback,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if UOB lady and UOB ppv calculate bonus miles cap based on posted date or transaction date? If I make transactions on 31 Aug  will these go into Aug or Sep quota? Thanks!,btohqsg
Means the bonus miles calculations won‚Äôt hit August quota because it takes few days to reflect the transactions (which goes into Sept) yea?,btohqsg
My bad. Posted date so September. Unless merchant posts same date which happened.,btohqsg
Hi  may I check whether buying DFI vouchers from Cold Storage using UOB ONE card is eligible for 3.33% cashback?,btohqsg
Which credit card earn you most miles for purchasing SIA tickets?,btohqsg
How much? Could be uob solitaire travel  dbs woman world mc or uob kris flyer.,btohqsg
If can split  do it between 2k on uob lady solitaire and 1.5k on dbs woman card. If cannot  all 3.5k on uob krisflyer,btohqsg
I was thinking UOB krisflyer  but izzit only 3mpd?,btohqsg
Yes  highest possible for 3.5k spend already sir.,btohqsg
How about cashback cards for travel related expenses like hotels  activities via klook? Which cashback cards are good?,btohqsg
Cashback card doesn't cater well to travel category like klook. May consider getting klook vouchers from heymax  which is coded as 5311 department store. Have more cashback card option for that.,btohqsg
I see. Are there any miles cards that are good for klook?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc and uob lady travel. If go via heymax  options are endless.,btohqsg
I see. Im new to heymax  will need to figure that out first. Haha,btohqsg
Can check this video on heymaxhttps://youtu.be/nnw9ayUQS8Y,btohqsg
then use this to register heymax for some bonus max mileshttps://hmsg.link/heymax,btohqsg
I applied hsbc travel one card. In order to get the welcome bonus mile  I need to pay annual fee but my statement don‚Äôt have the annual fee. May I know how am I going to go about it? Thanks,btohqsg
annual fee will be charged within 90 days,btohqsg
For overseas spending  multi currency card or credit card (with rewards) better?,btohqsg
Anyone buy things off of iHerb recently/frequently?First time buying from them  but having issues placing the order. I tried two different credit cards  PayPal  Apple Pay  Google Pay. All of them they will deduct my card  then I will receive email that my order is cancelled due to error processing my payment details  then I immediately receive a refund to my card.Cards tried:MariBankAmazeSCB Simply CashCIMB World MastercardTrust Card,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check  can citi presitge fee be waived?,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony.  But I would like to know it is worth to use credit card on overseas spending with 3.25% FX rate to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
What cards do you own? Can't comment without knowing,btohqsg
if you have 4mpd mastercard  it's clear cut to pair with amaze for lower fee.,btohqsg
see if you need to clock spending for monthly spend  and perhaps it's specialised category it depends if you value cashflow and the reward from the transactions over saving FX rate by using cash or multicurrency debit cards.,btohqsg
Hey thanks so much for the link is there one for savings accounts?,btohqsg
There are less high interest saving accts. Plus  each acct having different interests depends on how many categories you can qualify. To name a few  UOB one  ocbc 360  HSBC EGA  standard chartered esaver  BOC smart saver  GXS  Maribank  etc.,btohqsg
XNAP app still not working..i've been using AMEX KrisFlyer for hawker food since May,btohqsg
Same for me  also amex KF card. It opened me to amex cards at least. Sometimes got offer it's not bad to use.,btohqsg
yeah  the recent Small Shop promo quite good  5 times offer to spent $10 and get $3 cashbacki used a few of their offers too,btohqsg
Been using EZ-Link MC. Regret knowing it too late. ü§£,btohqsg
if you dont have AMEX card  can consider getting it. Absolute Cashback not viable.the bonus KF miles via sign-up reward isn't too hard to clock,btohqsg
aM.eX don‚Äôt have AMEX card üòÇP.S. he is in AMEX Plat group too,btohqsg
Yes. It‚Äôs not bad. I do use KFB sometimes when amex got offer too.Managed to get a blue tingkat  and recently some capitavouchers from Amex QR pay. üôÇTheir frequent save to app promo not bad too!,btohqsg
if by end of 12month  only $2000 spending on KF Blue. will AMEX go easy with wavier?,btohqsg
Yes. Just ask nicely from CSO. They can waive. üòá,btohqsg
Apologies but how does it work for hawker food please? Does it allows scan and pay or?,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you. I will have to go read it up. I have been using cash for hawker food,btohqsg
Only works for store with sgqr and having amex logo among the supported payment. My experience for my area is about 30% coverage.,btohqsg
True but is there a site to make comparisons?,btohqsg
Can check out Chris's videos on YouTube.https://youtube.com/@honeymoneysgHe did a few comparison on various saving accounts recently.,btohqsg
it might be too difficult to make a table comparing all the various savings accounts  given they all have different characteristics.I can envision it being even more complicated than the MOH table comparing Shield Plans.,btohqsg
You can check out each bank sites and make your own comparisons,btohqsg
True but theres so many different ones cant remember all of em üòÖ,btohqsg
You‚Äôre right. If one factor in the opportunity cost of that $500 step up  the eir actually drops below 4.6% for ocbc360. In theory  that $500 can earn higher than 0.5% (e.g 2.7%) elsewhere.Also to consider is that the step up mechanism requires a reset at certain intervals (e.g yearly). So 1 mth will not earn that 1.5% which will also reduces the eir. Same reason why tbill hv to be above 3.3% to be feasible for one to use cpf. Ignoring the oppt cost factor above  a 24mth reset interval already also drop the eir below 4.6%. So likely 4.65% is only theoretical.I‚Äôm simply assuming we max $100k base n one can meet all requirements. One probably has to consider many factors to decide which is better. No straight answer one la‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Let's start easy. Do you have salary? Spend on credit card? Any bills to pay? Then people can recommend you a few saving acct to start.,btohqsg
None to the first two bills is just rent,btohqsg
Maribank no frills account here ya go,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Can check when trying to get the overseas spent  do we have to choose the overseas currency when we use our cards? Like in japan  they will give the option to choose sgd or yen,btohqsg
Always choose local currency  jpy in this case. If you choose sgd  they give crappy exchange rate + 1% DCC from the bank.,btohqsg
Btw also I like to ask for citi rewards  do we gain 10x for giro payment for insurance?,btohqsg

I assume u r referring to the maturity of T-bills bought under CPF investment scheme using your CPF OA account.The answer to your question is yes  the proceeds of the T-bills would be automatically credited to your CPF OA account without action on your part.But I suggest that u initiate amanual transferto transfer the proceeds in your CPF investment agent bank (DBS  OCBC or UOB) to your CPF OA account. By doing so  u would gain a month more of CPF OA interest on the proceeds. This is due to the method CPFB uses to calculate interest.,btohqsg

Yes. You are correct. U can use any Citi credit card. No need to be CRMC.,btohqsg

no worries  thanks hannah! pairing with amaze  u meant the citi rewards card?for cashback/miles  do both 'hold' the same monetary value? still cant decide if i'd want to go for cashback or miles.. hmmm,btohqsg
Yup  Citi Rewards MasterCard. I initially got it for the 4 miles per dollar. You can use it on almost everything except travel related. But I ended up using the points to exchange for supermarket vouchers because the miles game is really too long. Voucher is about 3% cashback,btohqsg
thanks hannah! i think mainly non-ASEAN countries is tougher to accumulate miles for? but yeah up to individual preferences..,btohqsg
I was hesitant about chasing miles  so just wanted to give it a try. The good thing is you have a variety of options if you decide not to redeem for flights. Just that I think the value of flights is much higher as compared to that of vouchers,btohqsg

yup correct  i used Amazed thats link with CRM,btohqsg
555√ó15%√ó3=249.75(945+500)√ó1.5%√ó3=65500√ó20%√ó3=300(but become 169 due to caps),btohqsg
The 4mpd is not credited separately. Once the txn posts it should credit the base and bonus pts,btohqsg
I think they didn't make it clear enough that the $250 bonus cashback is assuming you MAXED out the 15% category.That means $555 x 3 x 15% = $249.75Doesn't mean you hit $2k total spend per month for 3 months  by only spending $10 on Bonus Categories mean you will still get the $250 bonus cashback,btohqsg
(per month)Preferred category: $1 x 15% = $0.15Everything else: $1999 x 1% = $19.99,btohqsg
thanks everyone. very helpful for the breakdown,btohqsg
anyone paid for maybank auto loan before?,btohqsg
Does the new cashback trust credit card earn link points too?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can someone share their experience buying voucher from Heymax to clock their outstanding CC spend target? I bought it last night  hope i am in time for this month. May I know generally how many days it take to post?,btohqsg
No. I assumed you have to earn the points through NTUC FairPrice app. Similarly benefits like rebate is meant for NTUC trust card only,btohqsg
the trust card cashback rate isnt trustworthy at all,btohqsg
combined many aspects uob products. UOB one quarter  UOB lady categories and now UOB EVO cashback logic.,btohqsg
i say under 1 month  and the problem is you can only change category once a quarter  so i weigh weigh. nahhh i need the Dining category more,btohqsg
ya might as well put 500% cashback rate with cashback cap at $250 and minimum spend of $2000 per month right? üòÇ fake 15%,btohqsg
Trust is terrible man. I had a failed atm transaction 1 mth ago in rio  and they hv not refunded my money. $300 gone.,btohqsg
Bonus cashback capped at $250 per quarter? The normal 1% no capped right?,btohqsg
Favepay usually takes one day to post. If direct credit card use  2-3 days.,btohqsg
Genuine question  why don‚Äôt people put their idle cash in UOB Stash for 5%p.a? Seems like there‚Äôs no lock in  SDIC covered  no spend required. Just purely maintain or increase monthly average balance any downside/opportunity cost to look out for?,btohqsg
Cuz it's effective 3% pa without promo.,btohqsg
may i know which card is good to pay for bills in healthhub?,btohqsg
for citi rewards need to link with amaze or just the card?,btohqsg
Use with amaze safer  cause you can check the MCC (i.e. 8099) of the transaction. Some have reported that the MCCs can be different.,btohqsg
any recommendations for big ticket/uncapped spending to earn miles? apart from UOB krisflyer.,btohqsg
u better hurry.... Amaze + UOB KF might be killed off soon,btohqsg
but normally the payment will just go thru right?,btohqsg
how to check mcc if like this,btohqsg
Link to empty wallet  transaction will be declined. Then you can check MCC of the declined transaction.,btohqsg
Hey folks  do you know if hospital fee charged overseas has the same MCC?,btohqsg
eh... how u expect us to know which hospital you referring to?anyway it is always best to TEST the new merchant's MCC with amaze + empty wallet before you pay,btohqsg
sigh that being said.. i cannot imagine life without Amaze now that we have been spoilt with Amaze + empty wallet testing method,btohqsg
Hi  May I ask if anyone is taking SIA first class return flight to Singapore and accessing the lounge after landing.Will the bags be taken care and put at lost & found automatically?,btohqsg
Hi  do you mind elaborating? Is it UOB KF or Amaze potentially giving the problem?,btohqsg
rumours have been swirling everywhere.. take with pinch of salt1st Sep = UOB will announce1st Oct = Amaze will be excluded by UOB for all transactions,btohqsg
Critical hit to amaze.If Citibank exclude  KO ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
any investors in Instarem? time to pull out...$1k per Citibank user ain't going to be enough to generate enough flow for them to be viable business in my opinionand they going / already kenna 2nd hit combo from Trust Cashback card,btohqsg
When Citibank rewards gonna announce this,btohqsg
Super sian for me. I only recently got my Amaze Citi Rewards combo going,btohqsg
this one still no changes.. FOR NOW..,btohqsg
true. I have sizable amount of spend on amaze + uob lady (travel & dining) every other month. If uob news is true  amaze only has citi rewards and ocbc rewards left. But ocbc rewards has promotion for fcy right now sooo,btohqsg
When Citibank announce UOB changes? üòÇ,btohqsg
can share what ocbc rewards fcy promo?,btohqsg
Pardon my ignorance :)What other CC or pairing do fellow gurus used to accumulate miles? I just started on the uob lady card (travel).Would trust CC be the best CC for travel or overseas use to avoid all those unnecessary fees?,btohqsg
first is to decide if you can accumulate enough miles within reasonable time frame (cuz miles will get devalued/expired). If you want to play miles game  many people are pairing Amaze + citi rewards or uob lady/KF for overseas spend.,btohqsg
Hi group. HSBC EGA stopped 1% rebate for IRAS Giro  what's the best strategy to pay income tax now,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony. What is KF?Do you mean paying via Amaze at all merchants be it physical store or online where one‚Äôs citi rewards CC is tag to it  in order to accumulate miles? Can apple wallet accept Amaze now without having to bring along physical card around?,btohqsg
where did you hear tis from?,btohqsg
My own experience. No rebate for this Aug deduction. Checked with customer service and they said no more rebate for IRAS,btohqsg
Enjoy 0% in foreign currency transaction fees (up to S$200) when you spend at least S$5 000.,btohqsg
Sorry haha let me rephrase.Was trying to ask  a healthcare related MCC will still be the same even though it‚Äôs an overseas spending right?,btohqsg
I think it is the one. Missed out the part it is only limited to 1000 eligible customers.,btohqsg
KF stands for Krisflyer. yes apple pay takes Amaze card now.,btohqsg
And only for targetted cardholders. I didn't receive the invite booo,btohqsg
This is the first instance that i heard that iras tax payment didnt get 1% ega. Did this happen to anyone else?,btohqsg
Btw  did you do the transfer 2k in and 5 transfer out already?,btohqsg
Ahh. Silly me. I changed my transferr schedule thus missed the July transfer. Might be that. No wonder hsbc changed T&C in May but I still received in June and July,btohqsg
In a dilemma between UOB Krisflyer VS UOB Privi Miles for uncapped spending. While the UOB Krisflyer gives more mpd with the accelerated miles  the categories are quite limited compared to what UOB Privi offers  such as online spend only - amaze gets thrown out of the topic for big ticket spend with its 1k cap so that doesnt help (plus i always max my citi+amaze first). Mainly want to use one of these cards after my other miles cards are maxed for the month + for big ticket items like travel  luxury goods  home reno  banquet etc. Any thoughts?,btohqsg
Don't see why you can't have both üòÄ,btohqsg
haha prefer not to have so many... already have quite afew. trying to only look for 1 more,btohqsg
What do you already have? I'm leaning more for UOB prvi as it's flexible.,btohqsg
citi rewards  dbsww  ladys for earning miles,btohqsg
My combo is uob kf (dining) + uob vs + uob pp.. for hosp bill + petrol ocbc voyage,btohqsg
first. Assuming amaze still works  3mpd at 1% fee is stil better than 1.4mpd. Plus I find its good for booking flights with Scoot/SQ or via Expedia/trip.com. For non accelerated cat  you can still get 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
if you dont want any of the headache  just got with uob prvi.,btohqsg
Hey there  1.2mpd or 1.6 % Cashback which one worth more value?,btohqsg
thats a good point. Didn't think about just using KF with amaze even when theres the 1% fee,btohqsg

For UOB KF card  the membership year cycle starts when u apply for the card or is tagged to ur own kf account?,btohqsg
So does it really matter when apply for the uob kf card?,btohqsg
most of the time no. Unless you are super optimized. People space their UOB miles earning cards to get ‚Äúfree‚Äù renewal of their uni$,btohqsg
"What's this ""free"" renewal of uni$?",btohqsg
For miles card  UOB charges AF in a form 6500 uni$ first. You then request to waive AF and UOB return 6500 uni$ with fresh 2 year validity.,btohqsg
"I guess if you have like 6 UOB miles cards expiring every 2 months  you can have ""free"" extension forever. ü§£",btohqsg

Should it make sense to clear out the UOB one account by end august. So Sep clear out 1 month for the q4 promotion?,btohqsg
I think the one month new funds definition was fake.Those who moved out on 1st July also got successfully earmarked in august right,btohqsg
Yea I am expecting they will have saving promotion on uob one by the incremental vs Sep average daily balance for Oct Nov and Dec accordingly. As they did vs June for July Aug Sep.,btohqsg
With the 2 or 3 interest rate cut expected in the 4th quarter  banks may start to review their promotions if it is still sustainable. Let enjoy while it last,btohqsg
Yeah my strategy was I locked in as many as I could this round already. Including into scb save up level up.,btohqsg
Yea to clear out uob one moving to hsbc ega and actually without the saving promotion it don't max out the uob one account,btohqsg

Yes i just put 150k into UOB now,btohqsg
Yes. Just practice a few times and all will take less than 2 min.,btohqsg
Wah I didn't thought of that. I kinda charge already then realise is not in whitelist (e.g. 5814),btohqsg
Do you let the cashier know when you do that? I would be too paiseh haha,btohqsg
step 1. wait till cashier isnt too busy.step 2. pair amaze + empty wallet then tapstep 3. act dumb ‚Äúhuh. not enough balance. paiseh. lemme check.‚Äù then step asidestep 4. open amaze and check mcc then paywave with the right card.,btohqsg

hi  for giro payment to other cc from HSBC EGA  when does the deduction usually happen?,btohqsg
i have received confirmation that it is set up but the due date is 30th and still not auto deducted yet,btohqsg
depends which bank. And the cc statement got state payment will be via GIRO?,btohqsg
isnt it written there? 15 days,btohqsg
Does ur pdf statement say it will be deducted by giro?,btohqsg
it is citi bank cc. ohhh the statement will indicate payment by giro? will it be somewhere at the top or? this statement don‚Äôt have so i guess giro wasn‚Äôt effective before the generation of the statement?,btohqsg
Better manually pay first. Citi usually deducts 2 days before due.,btohqsg
üëåüèªüëåüèª thanks hopefully next month one will reflect,btohqsg

Max. spend for CRMC is 1K  what if I accidentally charged $500 of travel expenses to the card. This is not counting towards the 1K spending right?,btohqsg
Cap is on the 9x earned.,btohqsg
I am new to this  can elaborate more,btohqsg
The bonus 9x you can earn every statement month on CRMC is capped at 9000. Assuming you spend 1000 on eligible transactions  you get bonus 9000 thank you points. If you spend 500 on travel  there‚Äôs no bonus 9x for that. Means you still can spend 1k on stuff that‚Äôs eligible for the 9x. In conclusion  yes the $500 is not counted toward the $1k cap.,btohqsg
Most importantly dont accidentally pay with wrong card. I feel heart pain üò¢,btohqsg
intend to pay by UOB Lady + Amaze  but do not change the link card to UOB Lady  I feel the pain once the charged notification come from CRMC.,btohqsg
At least not the other way round as crmc is black list. I charged a few grab trips to UOB lady dining üòÖ,btohqsg
Lesson learned  next time will be more caution on this.Thanks everyone for the sharing.,btohqsg
Hi! Can I ask  I have a 2k+ spending on Agoda  which is the best miles card for this? I currently have UOB privimiles  UOB ladys and Citi rewards to accumulate miles. Any other cards to recommend? Appreciate it!,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask if my OCBC 360 monthly balance compare to last month is 80K only (as per portal) I can‚Äôt be getting 4.05% right? Should I top up another 20K to make it 100K. I have salary credited and spend $500 this month. Tq in advance,btohqsg
Can consider apply dbs alititude card now year end got 5mpd promo (cap at 2k spending) but need to join the promo in paylah.,btohqsg
Ooh let me check that out. Thank you queenie!,btohqsg
Where to find that promo? I have but not using it actively cuz low earn rate,btohqsg
Dbs altitude can get 5 mpd plus dbs discount,btohqsg
But UOB points pool  might be easier to redeem a ticket. The DBS discount is tempting tho.,btohqsg
So i will spilt booking as usual. Extra 2mpd u cant justify 18 percent discount,btohqsg
Wow! Thanks just read it. But a question  does it qualify if i pay for hotel at the desk using dbs altitude card there physically?,btohqsg
Dbs also pool in a certain sense altitude point no expiry. Only online travel,btohqsg
Need to join promo then spend. If not no 5mpd. Sep oct is 5mpd for online travel. Nov dec is 5mpd for fcy spending cap at 2k. Need to rejoin promo each month. Minimum spending is 1k,btohqsg

Hi! I have a question about eligible transactions to earn miles.I have a citibank rewards credit card  paired with the Instarem Amaze card.I am going for a dental appointment but I am not sure if it's considered as an eligible transaction for my 4mpd. Does anyone have any experience paying for dental appointments with credit cards?Thank you!,btohqsg
Private dental clinics not under a hospital should give 4mpd. Can always test with Amaze first to check MCC.,btohqsg

Snack insurance May promotion capitaland voucher is here,btohqsg
May I ask if anyone has experience dealing with unauthorised credit card dispute with HSBC?Few days ago  I received sms notif that there was a suspicious transaction on my HSBC Live+ card - about 180 SGD over 2 transactions on Ubereats UK. Transaction was made in GBP.  I immediately blocked the card  then called up HSBC hotline. CSO also did a manual block just in case. He then told me the transaction likely cleared and I need to wait for it to change from pending status to cleared status to file a dispute formdispute form forces me to declare and agree to pay to a $5 retrieval fee? otherwise the form can't be submittedand this is on HSBC webpage:While we will do our best to resolve your dispute  the investigation progress is subject to the merchant's cooperation. It can take between 2 to 6 months upon receipt of your dispute form for the dispute to be resolveddo they really take that long? my card has never left my house. scb/citi reverses such fraud transactions automatically,btohqsg
Hi queenie.My investment in snack is just ‚Äòpending‚Äô. ‚ÄòUnits owned‚Äô and ‚Äòtotal premium‚Äô is just showing zero. Why ah?,btohqsg
When did u make the investment,btohqsg
I made it on Tuesday ü•≤,btohqsg
I had experience working through with HSBC when filling up dispute form was the norm. As u know  pending transactions are pending posting. So  u can only dispute on a charge on your card (posted transaction) . Don't worry about the retrieval charge. If the merchant cannot provide proof of your spending to defend the alleged claim by u within a deadline  the transaction would be reversed.,btohqsg
Thank u very much for replying. Just a bit concerned because I found reddit threads with people having the same issue but took very long to resolve,btohqsg
Such issue takes time because merchants are given time to show cause that you use your card to consume their service (to be fair to both parties). Based on your sharing here  you and your card did not enter UK. It is a matter of time that you would be 'vindicated'. I would suggest u get the concurrence from hsbc not to pay the Ubereats GBP charge.,btohqsg
To add  fradulent transactions are common nowadays. The industry has SOPs and playbook to handle. Merchant buys commercial insurance to protect themselves from fradulent transactions. I have worked with banks over the years to resolve amount from $100 to more than $10 000. As long as we are honest  truthful and keep the banks reasonable information as they request  we would be fine at the end of the day.,btohqsg
Just an update on this. After checking with CSO  it is 2%per year.,btohqsg
thank you very much!! honestly speaking  to give hsbc credit as it is due i have been constantly impressed by hsbc's customer service at least on things they are able to help or clarify on such as giro arrangements errors etc. the security verification procedures in terms of phone and ibanking has been seemingly more thorough than other banks tooi have had other banks with different csos within same bank telling me different stuff  beyond and outside the tnc on their websites when i call/chat with enquiriesjust caught off guard and scratching my head this time round,btohqsg
Pleasure is mine. Glad to be allowed to weigh in on your case here. My experiences are with Maybank  OCBC  UOB and HSBC. I shall not make comparisons because every case is unique.If I may add another point  be professional  objective and consistent when working and communicating with banks on fradulent charges. It is a shared responsibility between a bank and a customer in handling fradulent charges.,btohqsg
So far all my disputes are resolved quite immediate,btohqsg
Possible to not allow deletion of messages?,btohqsg
Next time who asks questions and got answers then delete his/her message  me and my admin will screenshot the deleted messages and post big big so don;t bother deleting.,btohqsg
Latest T bills results really disappointing. 3.13%,btohqsg
Not first time this is happening  always like that. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Sure. Here we mainly discuss personal finance related topics. What do you want to ask?,btohqsg
It's way worse than I thought,btohqsg
I'm currently having 2 main cards that I'm using which is OCBC 360  and N90.For any daily usage I'll use 360 which will try to hit 800 in combine.And any big usage N90 to get mile points.As such would like to check is there any better ways to maximise my CC usage with any app combine?,btohqsg
Maybe they dont want to confuse people?,btohqsg
If u only use 90n card sparely  it will take really long time to accumulate enough miles for any redemptions. Consider a generic cashback instead? Like ocbc infinity?,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Really trying my luck here..May I ask if anyone has any method to split up GIRO payment of a big credit card bill over 2 months (other than paying min sum and incur interest)?I am asking becos i have charged a huge bill this month for tour package payment >40k. If whole sum is paid by my HSBC GIRO next month  the everday+ reward would hit limit. Any method to split over 2 months?,btohqsg
upgrade to Premier Banking. Cap is $500,btohqsg
I‚Äôve asked travel agent to split the bill into 2 payments before.One part pay this month.  Another part pay next month.,btohqsg
Ya. Already charged. Becos of natas fair gifts. Haha. But nonetheless u both of u have been really helpful on this!I have upgraded to premier few days ago. So if i do the sms  and transfers 1st Oct  i shd be able to get cashback up to the new $500 limit.üôè,btohqsg
Any way  just curious and wondering if there is ever a need to split CC payments for such purpose  any methods to do so?,btohqsg
depends on when they amend your status in the system  try to see your app... under Settings  whether you see the word Premier or not,btohqsg
How did you upgrade to premier?,btohqsg
I walked into a branch to fill a form. And few days later upgraded and received the premier debit card also,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I sign up for the hsbc ega today can I still get the interest rewards?,btohqsg
Yup! looks the same as ur screenshot. Has the premier wordüòÅBtw.. how did u do screenshot on hsbc app  my samsung blocks my phone from taking screenshot.. üôà,btohqsg
then should be OK liao!! good luck!!,btohqsg
If u sign up today  u can register for the next round promo  probably on 1st Oct.,btohqsg
"Maybe.. i didnt catch ur meaning of ""sign up"". U mean send in sms to register for the everyday+ rewards?",btohqsg
My case was within a week. But i think they reversed the full amount without charging the 5 bucks Cant remember this part exactly.,btohqsg
If u didnt complete the sign-up and activities (sms + transfer in + 5 transactions) means no bonus everyday+ interest as per the hsbc tnc.,btohqsg

What did u tick in the giro form,btohqsg
How long it took for them to process ur giro?,btohqsg
i think less than 2 weeks i got an sms from HSBC  but abt a month before i got email from citibank,btohqsg
can‚Äôt rmb if i ticked full amount  maybe i made a mistake there. gonna call them see if can change else submit again..,btohqsg
I guess the only trick is to split the payments into 2 different dates  1st one charge to ur current card statement  then 2nd one charge to your next earliest cycle start date. Some merchant allow diff dates payments if its just a few days diff.,btohqsg
Hi there  could I ask what would this card be good for except for the initial 30k miles please? Or do you guys normally cancel it after one year.,btohqsg
Lounge access. I do plan to cancel after 1y if they dont waive AF.,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you as I seldom see any suggestions on using this card to clock miles or cashback here so far.,btohqsg
Hello Gurus! Can I ask if uob visa signature use with kris+  does it consider as contactless payment since it is by Apple Pay?,btohqsg
it has bad local earn rate  cannot use with card up  no promo earn rate (example dbs altitude year end promo 5mpd or uob prvi 5mpd fcy promo). Thats why no one talks about it.,btohqsg
My apologies Anthony. I am asking on behalf of a colleague. Could I ask how to apply for the 5mpd promo for dbs altitude and is it applicable to the altitude visa existing card holders please? I read above it is through the paylah app but I can't see it anywhere there. Thank you.,btohqsg
I can't see the promo myself but you try thishttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/228856,btohqsg

Is it a good idea to put $150k in UOB stash acc + participate in the Building a Nations Campaign?1) 3%p.a on first 100k3%/365*30*100 000= $246.57 monthly2) + campaign end of 5 months = $1 100 cash,btohqsg
Good. U got the formula correct this time. Welcome back.However  (1). you can consider put the $50 000 into other bank account to earn higher interest n compare it to UOB Stash.(2). Your monthly interest will vary depends on number of the days on that month.,btohqsg
So if I linked Google pay  should I link amaze card or the city rewards card ya??,btohqsg
Yes if debit confirm will show up inside your payment method slip. If not show means not ready/setupyet,btohqsg
Ur amaze card. Dont link citi rewards with google pay as citi explicitly excluded that from earning bonus pts,btohqsg
For example even sc e-saver 3.35% still higher then uob slash right?,btohqsg
Oh my bad. Didnt read properly. Uob stash should stop at 100k. Not worth putting extra 50k more.,btohqsg
Need to factor in the $1100 n lock in 5 months.If OP can include UOB One into his assessment and if he can fulfil UOB criteria for 5 months  then can make final decision.,btohqsg
So there is only the way using amaze card to get extra point like grab  online shopping (Lazada etc)? Others just direct use amaze card?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt hit the 500 spend so UOB one is out unfortunately‚Ä¶ but thanks for input üôèüèº,btohqsg
In this case‚Ä¶ is it better to participate campaign by putting in 100k with UOB stash  receive $700 at end of 5 months  and put 50k elsewhere? Maybe T bills,btohqsg
Definitely. Tbills or HSBC ega if you can.,btohqsg
hi guys  im looking to sign up citi rewards card. i gotta ask ü§° but i think that signing up directly on citi is more worth compared to the welcome gift in singsaver/moneysmart?directly on citi is 40000 ty points equivalent to 16k milessingsaver hasdyson supersonic hair dryer  ipad 9th gen  dyson vacuum cleaner  350 sgd shopee voucher. seems like the max i can get is 350 sgd,btohqsg

yeah  you're right (singsaver saysWhen you use your miles for an economy class ticket  you could get around 1.1 to 1.3 cents per mile  but the value could soar to over 2 cents per mile for business class bookings.). im completely new into miles. will do some research first. thanks anthony!also  even getting someone to refer me to split the referral bonus of S$150/2=75. still doesnt beat 350 haha,btohqsg

Hi I‚Äôve realised can max rewards out of Citirewards for only up to 1k spend with amaze.Considering another card for the spend on top of this plan to spend less than 700 on top of this but also foresee some big payments soon coming up in setting up a rented home etc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Any recommendations for a no minimum spend card ?,btohqsg
Is ur spend online/offline? Big payment is what kind and how much?,btohqsg
Consistent spend would be offline. Big payments for perhaps household appliances and bed etc.,btohqsg
Rental home would be unfurnished. So budget spends but foresee essentials being pricey.By the way also like to know if paying for items on Carousell through the app itself considered eligible or is it considered a ‚Äònets‚Äô transaction?,btohqsg
Offline tends to be under UOB preferred plat visa for apple pay/google pay.,btohqsg

Hi  is 2.4mpd + amaze worth it for foreign currency spend or just use youtrip?,btohqsg
which card gives 2.4 mpd with amaze?,btohqsg
Amaze converts spend to local sgd to won't get fcy rate  only local rate.,btohqsg
Anybody have got their funds earmark for Uob nation saver promo?  mine not earmark and bonus not credited yet,btohqsg
Amaze converts your payments to SGD  so you wont earn foreign currency rates (e.g. UOB PRVI Miles + Amaze gives 1.4mpd and not 2.4mpd),btohqsg
If I spend on UOB one card today  will it be posted tomorrow as it‚Äôs a sat? Or what kind of merchant will be posted today or tomorrow if I spend today.,btohqsg
I also still hesitated to clear fund for sep for uob one. maybe later promotion actually not attractive ... hmm,btohqsg
Can foreign coins be changed at money changer or only notes? And is there a limit?,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to seek advice  on which card to use for my upcoming travel trip - for hotel booking (via Agoda  booking) and overseas shopping and dining.I have 3 cc namely  (1) CRMC+amaze  (2) Trust cc  and (3) UOB one. Also has Wise Card as well. Note: (a) No plans on signing up for new card  and (b) okay with miles / cashback benefits as def better than paying using my debit card (which I have been using for my past trips).For advice pls. Thank you!,btohqsg
Fyi I have 2 spending on last Friday posted on next Monday  but 1 spending in sat posted directly on same day  really doesn't quite tell whether it will be same day  sat or next Monday.,btohqsg
HSBC TravelOne card gives 2.4mpd on fcy,btohqsg
I don't think there's a need to pair it with amaze,btohqsg
Please read the original context from original poster. Thanks,btohqsg
7-11 and cold storage are some that do same day posting.,btohqsg
July  and funded in same month.Have another account I register in July but fund in Aug (believe that wont be eligible for Aug period),btohqsg
Then you might need to double check if you did meet the conditions already.,btohqsg
That time got a few also didn‚Äôt get earmarked when others got earmarked. Not sure if they eventually got earmarked or it was due to some conditions not met.,btohqsg
Got it  thanks! By chance usually for such promo it will be earmark on the same day (morning) or random. Cause I believe banks would have batch run to credit and earmark,btohqsg
If I recall most will earmark in the same day  and at most few days later.,btohqsg
I recall only 1 or 2 managed to earmark like few days later. But not like 2 weeks later kind,btohqsg
Got it  Okiee will monitor today and see if it is done. Else I reach out to them again :),btohqsg
Yeah must see the situation since we don‚Äôt know the full details like timing and amounts.But so far if done cleanly and timely with some buffer  I think Uob earmark process is quite well done.,btohqsg
Go to your PayLah app. Click the Rewards tab at the bottom of the app to see your list of 'Enrolled Promotions'. Look out for this promo. If u successfully enrolled  it would be in your list of 'Enrolled Promotions'.,btohqsg
Safest is if you didn't withdraw any amounts from Jul to Aug. But if you did then best to check again.,btohqsg
Would transaction at NTUC FairPrice today (30 Aug) be posted by (31 Aug)?,btohqsg
Most likely not. Fairprice transaction usually posts after 2 days.,btohqsg
The posting date after our spending is a gamble of cards. I have experienced anything from transaction posted on the same day (like what u mentioned) to 14 days (5 days car rental fees charged on the first day of the rental).,btohqsg
Engaging the advice of experts here  in preparing for these potential promos:- UOB One earmar- HSBC EGA for SepOne should be emptying the accounts by EOD tmr in preparation?However  with the 30 days clause  then it'll be better to  empty today  30 Aug?,btohqsg
From my understanding  tomorrow is still working day so we can do it tomorrow before the end of tracking time for each bank.,btohqsg
For such cases where 1st September is a Sunday  I would move all the liquid cash into a neutral bonus interest qualifying account like scb esaver (make sure the July benchmark adb is $1) whose bonus interest period is August and September.Then only start moving into the target HSBC EGA on a weekday.,btohqsg
Hi guys is it possible to get both heymax's miles and shopback's cashback from the same purchase?,btohqsg
So like Anthony  you'd move tomorrow before cut off from the accounts  is that correct?,btohqsg
My experience same as Jasmine when I use FairPrice app to pay for FairPrice and Kopitiam groceries and food respectively. To add  I found that using physical card  (contactless) increase the chance of getting transaction posted 2 business days after spent,btohqsg

Due to the transfer limit  if start the transfer from scb e-saver to hsbc ega on Sunday 01Sept (etc $200k) and Mon 02Sept (etc $160K)Then it will reflect $360K in HsBc EGa on 02Sept and at the same time i will still earn the interest on esaver till 01Sept correct?,btohqsg
If I didn‚Äôt recall wrongly  SCB and HSBC don‚Äôt record transactions on Sundays. They will be posted on Monday instead and accounted from there.,btohqsg
Hello Chris  there‚Äôs no IOS apps ver for this Long Bridge?,btohqsg

Then the 2k transfer in + 5x transactions do on 2 Sep (Mon) for EGA ? Or 1 Sep (Sun) or doesn't matter ?,btohqsg
Just curious  You registered the promo for aug -sep or you waiting to register new promo for sep-oct?,btohqsg

Can consider OCBC Premier Dividend account if you can satisfy the top up per month and no withdrawal.3.3% on the whole quantum.,btohqsg
Your question is not easy to answer as you didn't state how many people you can utilise and what kind of risk profile you are.As you may know  higher risk = higher return.Low/no risk = Minimal returns or need to work hard for the return.I would assume you are as similar to my profile and are conservative.Then:$360k in HSBC EGA (you need 2 persons) 4.x% p.a.$150k in UOB One (one person enough) 5-6% p.a.$90k in SCB Esaver (you need 2 persons) 3.x% p.a.,btohqsg

Uob miles ain't known for good signup bonus,btohqsg
May I ask why was this card good? I looked at it before and it was 5% on certain categories that other cashback cards do better.,btohqsg
5% + 1% from EGA + 0.4 mpd (1 pts per $1). High cashback cap ($150 per month) + no rounding in redemption unlike Citi Cashback.,btohqsg
The uob nerfing of amaze has big impact .. 3.25% fcy will be universally charge If we would  still use the 4mpd card overseas like dbs wwmc   uob solitaire lady. For crmc+amaze  couldn't be use for travel spent effectively. we are technically back to the days before amaze. We are left with 1.2-1.3 miles pairing with amaze which lead to higher cpm. wow suddenly trust cashback card makes sense for overseas hotel booking.,btohqsg

You gotta ask ur agent directly.,btohqsg
I did but this is prudential backend. She not sure hence I‚Äôm asking if anybody did it before,btohqsg
"Not agent but cardup just asks for policy number and doesn't need ""invoice"" of the premium so you can pay whatever amount you want. As long as prudential in the end receives the premium amount I don't think it matters where they receive it from.
