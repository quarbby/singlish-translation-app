"Hi all  has anyone also experienced this? We've been receiving parcels from Shopee Xpress that aren't ours.Unfortunately  the delivery men couldn't take back the parcels  so we couldn't reject them at delivery.The parcels are all addressed to an unknown recipient named 'purtier'. So far  we have received what looked like supplements  some plates (?)  and some water tumbler. :( It is a distressing problem for us and Shopee has only told us to ""feel free to discard or reject the parcels"". They have also told us they'll arrange for courier to come and pick the up but it has been almost 3 weeks yet no one has done so. We have also been nudged them to resolve the issue more quickly.Anyone know what else we can do? :(",btohqsg
On the parcel usually should have contact num right?,btohqsg
Of the person who place order,btohqsg
No there isn't a number and when i checked the tracking ID through Shopee Xpress i could only get a partial number as they hid the rest due to privacy reasons,btohqsg
If only they could block/ban the buyer from using our address :(,btohqsg
Lol itâ€™s a good thing also haha always got free giftsðŸ¤£,btohqsg
If u alr inform shopee and they asked u to discard or reject then u just keep lo  if no use de stuff maybe can bless to ppl who need?,btohqsg
Alright  thanks a lot :) We'll see what we can do,btohqsg
the only thing you can do is to let shopee know each time you receive the parcel,btohqsg
