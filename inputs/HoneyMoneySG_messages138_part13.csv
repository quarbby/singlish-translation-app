We apologize for the inconvenience caused.Was sending  a msg on HSBC app and I saw this. Not sure if its already been posted.  But FYI,btohqsg
Lemme try sending a message on hsbc too haha,btohqsg
Indeed#egaOk everyone can calm down and enjoy your holiday. We check back tmr.,btohqsg
too many contact them to ask WHERE IS MY 1%!,btohqsg
hey guys for OCBC360 savings criteria  does the daily balance look at Available Balance or Total Balance? my total balance is more now because there‚Äôs a cheque deposit to my account,btohqsg
Hmm  only between Oct 11 to 17?My Giro from 11 till now all didn‚Äôt get the 1% .Did u guys get the 1% from Oct 18 till now?,btohqsg
We havent gotten any since 11 oct. Dont worry. Hsbc is fully aware and they will fix it (slowly),btohqsg
They are only aware it didn‚Äôt work between Oct 11 to 17  that‚Äôs according to that message. üò¨üòÖ,btohqsg
Well. It took them 3 weeks to acknowledge the error. I do have faith they will fix it albeit slowly. Just stay calm and wait.,btohqsg
Just wait and see lah  why so gan cheong,btohqsg
and i thought the wordings were already so reassuring.. still got unhappiness.. what can i say..,btohqsg
Look at MAB - Monthly Average Balance,btohqsg
Mine is 25th $50k GIRO deduction.Also no cash back yet. üòáSo far this 1% has been delayed before  but will be settled eventually.,btohqsg
His spend and our spend are not the same üòÇ,btohqsg
Credit card.My wife spend quite a lot every month. I just keep working to keep up with her spending.Going to punchek already.,btohqsg
Your wife looks like bai lu ah  that‚Äôs why upkeep so high,btohqsg
Its ok. Happy wife happy life.,btohqsg
They stay very near each other. ü§£Both in Jiangsu. üòÅ,btohqsg
Save abit for rainy days üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes. Hidden stash is a must! ü´¢üòå,btohqsg
Hi anyone know if UOB lady‚Äôs considers MCC7991 as Travel? (Tourist attractions and exhibits),btohqsg
Don't think so. Can you book via OTA?,btohqsg
Isit time to transfer money out of chocofin to earn higher interest?,btohqsg
Yep online. That‚Äôs what the attraction websites seem to code as.,btohqsg
Ota I meant those sites like kkday  klook trip.cometc,btohqsg
Oh yeah I can. Was just wondering since it was slightly cheaper on the original site.,btohqsg
The price difference is what you pay for the miles under 4722. Similar to cardup  charges admin fee for you to earn miles.,btohqsg
For me I will transfer to HSBC EGA to earn 1 month of 4.+% for Oct promo. Basically anywhere that has higher interest. Currently HYSA I can think of is UOB one acc/ ocbc 360/ HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
UserAshishhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:not a place for job search,btohqsg
hello guys! can i ask what are the most valuable items to redeem on moneysmart store? i have 10k points with another 10k coming in by mar‚Äô25. actually looking to wait and use it on macbook  but would it be more worth to use it on shopee vouchers and get macbook from shopee instead?,btohqsg
I registered HSBC EGA on early October but I didn‚Äôt put in much money so my plan is to put all my cash into HSBC EGA to earned the interest only for the month of Nov less than 250k. Then move funds to UOB one for the save up promo in Dec,btohqsg
UOB one promo needs to clear balance in Dec.,btohqsg
yes the first part of using 2nd month of the HSBC EGA October/November/December plan is good.high high chance HSBC EGA will cut in November cycle.,btohqsg
I cleared mine for the month of Nov. means I will have to participate for the Dec UOB save up promo as my Nov mab will be 1k. 1 month in EGA and the other month in esaver then back to UOB one.,btohqsg
for SC marathon savings  if I transfer in $100k now  will it get reflected on 31 Oct balance?,btohqsg
Yes my guess it will drop further as well. Oh well we can only go for which ever that give higher return,btohqsg
UOB one promo Dec will use sep MAB.,btohqsg
hopefully ocbc dividend plus doesn't cut yet,btohqsg
Ahhh means I missed it alr? :/,btohqsg
Sad I guess I shall wait for January promo and this time will remember to empty my UOB acc by Dec 24 to anticipate for Jan 25 UOB promo,btohqsg
i think we are all going to be sad sad tomorrow,btohqsg
will we have hsbc nov promotion? as I didn't want to do the Oct Nov Dec since my Sept had a high balance. I just googled hsbc but not sure why they wrote 2.75% interest (2.75+1),btohqsg
Probably every bank that gives bonus interest as promo?,btohqsg
Hopefully uob one remain 4 percent interest for 150k,btohqsg
Uob likely no change. They have reduced it recently,btohqsg
nobody knows for sure which banks yet  but definitely some will reduce on 1st november  or at least announce reduction with a future effective date.,btohqsg
If UOB promo for Dec use Sep MAB  then Jan will use Oct MAB?,btohqsg
I applied CC on singsaver with promo this month  did not receive my card yet.The spending requirement only starts when I receive my card? Or the spending requirement is ending today üòÖ,btohqsg
