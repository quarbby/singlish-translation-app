citi smrt card is best for this. Next closest is Scb Manhatten that gives 3% capped at $200 in a quarter (i.e. $6667 spend),btohqsg
Add scb smart for Apple icloud or Google one or Google YouTube payment will earn scb smart points?,btohqsg
For the UOB Promo  with regards to Incremental Fresh Funds  does that include salary?,btohqsg
For jumpstart can I ask if using liquid pay to pay will count towards the cashback?,btohqsg
For students I guess the jumpstart debit card is the best card to use?,btohqsg
Best card if you spend <$400 a month,btohqsg
I haven't checked if DBS Live Fresh student card has min spending requirement,btohqsg
Once I start working after I grad uob one is the best?,btohqsg
I would say as college student pickmaybank evibes -> 1% cashback no conditionsdbs live fresh -> 5% pub tpt,btohqsg
Getting a student credit card builds credit score to help get ur working credit card more easily,btohqsg
why none talk about RHB HYSA promotion ? up to 5.5% EIR without any salary requirement,btohqsg
This seems better than ocbc and UOB account,btohqsg
yes but only for incremental balance  mean you need to take out your balance at following month (month 2) put somewhere else  before put back at month 3,btohqsg
Feels a lot like HSBC EGA promotion,btohqsg
It's alot less complicated than EGA  and also faster crediting of the additional interest compared to EGA,btohqsg
Just to update  interest for SIF GoSavers was credited on the last day of the month last month  they also show you the period for which the interest is for  a very good no-frills option for 2.5% pa,btohqsg
The base interest only 1.x %. The additional 3.5% only applies to the new funds. Example  u put in additional 500$  3.5% only on the 500$. Not the total amount 5%.,btohqsg
Can look at RHB like what Jackson shared,btohqsg
total interest base + bonus for your incremental balance of curent month compare with previous month balance,btohqsg
So  imagine I have 100k and every month I put in 1000. Then it would be 100k x 1.x % + 1000 x 3.5%? Is that correct ?,btohqsg
no month 1 will be 100k * (1.x +3.5%)  month 2 will be 1000 * (1.x +3.5%),btohqsg
thats why month 2 need to move out somewhere and month 3 bring back again in,btohqsg
can see example on this pagehttps://rhbgroup.com.sg/rhb/personal/CASA-Promotion,btohqsg
LOL ... I understand now. ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
esaver SCB now better 3.8 % also no salary rrquirement,btohqsg
Like that ocbc 360 lose out liao.,btohqsg
Can someone enlighten me what is SIF GoSavers ? Thanks,btohqsg
Hmm till 31 Jan 2023 only tho,btohqsg

Also every mnth need to tell HR GIRO salary to new bank acct ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
hey guys I hope this is not a stupid qn but to hit the minimum spend for CC welcome gifts  does it just mean any spend as long as it meets the min? Like even pay back student loan  or top up grab card?,btohqsg
Education and grab top-up are well known exclusions for eligible spend,btohqsg
Both the RHB and EGA no salary crediting requirement,btohqsg
A fuss free online banking account that gives 2.5% p.a. on first $100k. Only need to maintain $1000 min balance,btohqsg
