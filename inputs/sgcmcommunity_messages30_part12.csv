Depends on how long you're staying and what car,btohqsg
harder to find an E92 M3 to rent all around Europe,btohqsg
also can't quantify the emotional value of doing it in your own car,btohqsg
rentals for higher end vehicles can be exorbitantly expensive and shipping a car on carnet plus insurance can be cheaper if you're staying long enough,btohqsg

Bro itâ€™s Europe. All kinds of Europe cars also hv no? If go Europe  y still rent e92? Cars cheap there. I donâ€™t think rent is expensive,btohqsg

Not for mainstream rentals. Yes you can rent many exotic cars within some cities but they rarely allow you to take them out  of city limits or go on longer road trips. Most rentals are day rentals at the nurburgring or in maranello,btohqsg
We're referring to a road trip around Europe into places like Romania  Italy  France  etc.,btohqsg
For driving pleasure more than having a car,btohqsg
