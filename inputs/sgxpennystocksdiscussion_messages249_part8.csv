China another lockdown I am surprised thereâ€™s no medical day,btohqsg
Master Yuan  can I request for yzj chart if possible?,btohqsg
demand for medicals except for vaccine should be at a constant rate now. Flare up  lockdown  new varriant would not cause any spike in demand.  irregardless of lockdown or no lockdown China does not need to buy from outside of the country as they supply a lot of countriee. No reason for medicals to go up . Unless something cause major increase in demand for medicals,btohqsg
V2y looks like wanted to move as well,btohqsg
I still think MT will go up hahahaha,btohqsg
Although I agree with you but at the same time Medicalâ€™s stocks are highly speculative,btohqsg
Hopefully..the place alrdy chiong. V2y so slow,btohqsg
Ya... That's why I say v2y bb weak,btohqsg

Haha my tot only coz everytime the place move v2y also move. But tdy prove me im wrong haha,btohqsg
Medical 2 days haven cheong much,btohqsg
The reason why I bought back The Place is because it opened above 51 resistance  and moved up which is a sign of power. Take Yinda chart as reference. After creating a candle with a long wick at the top  next day gap up & close higher thus forming a small white candle besides the wick of previous day candle. MACD histogram still turning up. This one can hit 60 in the coming days.,btohqsg
dun know why jt has so many small 100 shares..selling and buying... ðŸ¤¦ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
