Hi everyone  i am wondering if any of you have a similar experience. On February a made a initial deposit of a Cat B vehicle with the scheme 4 bid guarantee COE no top up vehicle haven’t arrive SG. My worry is that because COE has increase 20k in a blink of an eye will my dealer return me my initial deposit and dishonor the deal?,btohqsg
he managed to bid for ur COE already?,btohqsg
ur contract with him is 4 bid G.COE  hence he got 4 chance,btohqsg
he might not bid so fast.,btohqsg
So he will wait until it “drop” then bid is it ?,btohqsg
4 bid dont mean he need bid consect 4 times  as long as he bid and get ur COE within 4 times,btohqsg
u check with the dealer did he bid lo,btohqsg
usually if by 4th bid no get they will make one apper for u de,btohqsg
