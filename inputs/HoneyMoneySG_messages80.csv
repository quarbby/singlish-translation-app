Same question for SRS (account with DBS),btohqsg
the only way to invest in the S&P 500 using CPF is by using Endowus which allows you to invest your CPF balance into LionGlobal infinity US S&P 500 Stock Index Fund which tracks the S&P 500.,btohqsg
Thank you  is there a YouTube tutorial on this? I tried but they created a portfolio with amundi funds instead,btohqsg
The Amundi Prime USA Fund is an SGD-denominated unit trust that tracks Solactive index  with a fund-level fee or total expense ratio of just 0.05%. You can invest in it using cash  CPF  or SRS. Solactive US Large & Mid Cap Index spans the biggest 530 companies in the US  and closely tracks the performance of both the S&P 500 index and the MSCI USA Index,btohqsg

Hi  anyone can advise me? Trying to set up card up recurring payment for my insurance premium.. if let‚Äôs say my premium start every 1st in the month  and premium paid to date is 01 Jan 2024.,btohqsg
Is there a way for my wife to transfer her CC earned points into miles into my krisflyer account? Reading up that it‚Äôs not directly possible..,btohqsg
Any good promo for SC card ?,btohqsg
I mean new sign up promo,btohqsg
UOB ladys. I know OCBC/SC allows,btohqsg
Uob don‚Äôt try. If audit  your kf account will be suspended,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the amount? If small they usually don‚Äôt check,btohqsg
Just look for the most recent premium invoice and use that as a reference (add a month and minus few days). It doesn't matter if you paid the premium few days earlier  they will consider it as paid once the actual premium date comes.Last monthly repayment just put when you intend the repayment to actually stop.,btohqsg
HiHow about using dbs cpf oa? Any advice/ sharing is appreciated üôè,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt make sense for it to be such a big deal also.. just trying to book the flight together,btohqsg
Briefly read up bout this. This is just using your own account to book a ticket for someone else right? Not pooling miles into 1 account.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right. Redeem into her kf account. Ask her nominate you,btohqsg
Polling is not possible. Another way is to buy your own miles. Nowadays can buy easily,btohqsg
I see  but before I set up in cardup  do I have to log in to pruaccess for example to change the payment mode first ?,btohqsg
Definitely.. easiest way is to switch to giro then cancel giro on the bank end  then it'll become cash already.,btohqsg
The best investment is invest in yourself,btohqsg
Before all these  do a financial check on yourself first. Important is what's your current lifestyle budget  what are your expenses and how to cut unnecessary spending.If you intend to be passive investor  look for index funds  ETFs instead of picking individual stocks. Set aside small amounts now to dollar cost average. Increase the amounts once you have an income.Don't rush  time in the market is always better than timing the market. Don't let emotions sway your decision to invest.Don't fall into the trap of lifestyle inflation. You don't need that latest phone your friends have  you don't need to attend every outings your friends ask you to. Just budget yourself well and pay yourself first.,btohqsg

ya..1st till the last dollar...for the next 6 monthsbtw  it's average balance...and 1st calender month wasted..2 weeks ofdecember has passed..,btohqsg
Hi  i would suggest you to use hsbc everyday account for your insurance premiums. You get 1% cashback via giro payments.,btohqsg
If you want to use cardup  the current miles is 1.4mpd using uob priv visa. And use hsbc giro to pay the cc bills,btohqsg
Noticed they have they promo until end Dec. so u are saying the 6 months include this month?,btohqsg

I am just confuse by the chart. So this chary is just for illustration purpose only?üòÇ,btohqsg
ya.. scenario example onlyyours will depend on how many zeros u have? hahabut theor calculations are on point,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion  will look into it but abit hassle to open hsbc Acc but I‚Äôm using dbs altitude 1.3mpd still not that bad I guess,btohqsg
Haha shag. U think they will roll the promo over to Jan? Coz like u mentioned  it has been going on for awhile with the advertised ‚Äúfirst 6 months‚Äù for a few months liao,btohqsg
i also duno keh..lol..shoukd still have...but 3.5 could drop?,btohqsg
Is amaze card still good for foreign currency payments? I was charged a fx spread of about 3% when paying for air tickets in pounds.,btohqsg
u using Amaze+uob lady? 3% spread is better than 3.25% fee+mastercard spread.,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to get some opinions on accumulating vs distributing ETFs. Distributing sounds attractive  but if I invested in accumulating ETF and just sold some shares when prices reach an amount I would be happy with  would that be a similar comparison to receiving dividends?,btohqsg
Like the July only till 31st Dec,btohqsg
so their limited time promotion has been so for at least 6 months? haha,btohqsg
i not sure how true..DISCLAIMER!!! haha,btohqsg

Description : ISSUING CENTRES SINGAPORE SGPGuys  have anyone had this charge before and know where this could be from? I'm suspecting it's my miles conversion from dbs but the amount is $25 instead of $27. Other than that I've no idea where this could be from...,btohqsg
You may want double check DBS website how much they charge on mile conversion fee.,btohqsg
Hi all Just want to check for MCC5814 I use amaze+Citi rewards combo  will I get 10x points?,btohqsg
$25 with 8% gst will become $27. My guess,btohqsg
Sign up in Dec 23  promo rate will be given for 6 months i.e. end May 24,btohqsg
ya..should be this...so th eprevious post also not sure the fellow's info accurate anot....?,btohqsg
I didn't see the previous post,btohqsg
What I mean is the website said it's $27 but the charge is only $25. So I'm suspecting the conversion charge is not in yet and this is something which I didn't use the card for? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
How about visa? Did you apply for any visas recently?,btohqsg
Nope I didn't  that's why I'm wondering what isDescription : ISSUING CENTRES SINGAPORE SGPShould I call in to help centre?,btohqsg
Depends if your hotel is hit by the Hsbc Revo nerf on mcc.Separate payment is good strategy. Refer to my wedding payment video,btohqsg
So far you're the first and only person that highlighted this transaction here.. so maybe you can just call fraud hotline and try to refund if the card is untouched one,btohqsg
It‚Äôs your preference. Some investors would rather go accumulating for ease of mind but some investors prefer some sort of cash flow. Do take into consideration applicable costs such as bank charges  taxes and commissions.,btohqsg
can also use uob ppv (mobile contactless) for $1.11k in calendar month and uob signature (contactless) $2k in statement month,btohqsg

I also interested  what is the dcs card? Credit card?,btohqsg
All transactions with Amaze are excluded as per option ‚Äòq‚Äô.,btohqsg
I assume you‚Äôre on margin and bought using the given buying power  not cash on hand?If so  you are loaning cash from them and will incur interest rates  depending on the currencies.,btohqsg
amaze link transaction excluded for dcs,btohqsg
I remember I buy without using margin leh üòÖ I buying Singapore REITs,btohqsg
What should I do now lol üòÇ as my cash is in -ve I assume I accidentally buy in margin,btohqsg
anyone invest this Syfe's Pimco Fund?,btohqsg
I read that I need to either top up my Acc or sell the stock away ah,btohqsg
Learnt something reading upYou should top up. Not sure of margin rates for SGX stocks  but it is 6.8%I do not use margin. Anyone uses it?,btohqsg
OCBC titanium still worth to get?They nerf $1k per moth,btohqsg
I called moomoo CS üòÇ he ask me to top up my cash by redeem the sgd Fullerton fund that I have will do. I think I accidentally buy in margin because I have cash in the Fullerton cash fund.. luckily only -146,btohqsg
Yes.Just topup the negative value will do‚Ä¶ I think margin accounts must opt in separately and must do through a round of KYC. You can‚Äôt remember going through the process? Also  isn‚Äôt your cash balance known to you clearly and then buying above your cash value surely will lead to a loan‚Ä¶ üòÖ,btohqsg

Ocbc quite infamous for not waiving Annual fees and being inflexible.,btohqsg
Are u on 360 acc? If not any reason y u need this card?,btohqsg
"I thought Moomoo has the auto redemption under Smart Save to settle trades?I did a trial in Moo Moo.One will only incur margin when one buys more than what auto redemption can handle.A small ""Using margin to buy"" msg will appear above the amount due.There are also two columns indicating:1. Max Qty to Buy (Cash) and2. Max Qty to Buy (Margin)",btohqsg
yup  using 360 account. overall credit card spend for year 2023 is about $6k. thought that was ok  not exceedingly low.,btohqsg
You missed by 4k. That's 40% under ü´†,btohqsg
Planning to get a luxury bag (>1000euros) during my upcoming europe trip  are there still any best credit cards that I can pair up with amaze for the best rates fx rates and credit card rewards?,btohqsg
If you don't spend 800 per month seems pointless to use that card lol.Suggest UOB One account + UOB EVOL card combination,btohqsg
I think min is $12k  so it is miss by 50%.,btohqsg
Because if you clock their cashback is 9600 only  they want you to spend 400 more lol,btohqsg
Hi all  isit worth to use Amaze + Citi Rewards overseas if I'm not going overseas yearly? Cuz amaze points expire in a year,btohqsg
Evol Ned min spend Right too ?,btohqsg
600  which is more reasonable for a 6k spending,btohqsg
Whats your intended use case?people using this don't really look to use it for amaze points  but rather the citirewards points. citirewards points last up to 60 months,btohqsg
Ya I‚Äôm not sure what I did but definitely careless at my end  but at least a lesson learnt üòÖ,btohqsg
CIMB has FCY promo. 3% (capped at $100) rebate on FX on top of the 2% luxury spend cashback. Cannot pair to Amaze.,btohqsg

Anyone knows how to open a HSBC EGA account if I'm an existing credit card holder?,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thought they can guide us to do it online. Must I deposit money on site?,btohqsg
I thought without amaze points  youtrip wud be better leh? Cuz exchange rate for using amaze is not good right? Did i rmb wrongly,btohqsg
thought there were issue applying online if already have hsbc cc.,btohqsg
Amaze still good if can get say 4mpd from CC,btohqsg
Yeap I think have to drop by their branch to open,btohqsg
There's a request a callback button for those who already have cc but no bank account with them.. maybe can try ü§™,btohqsg
"the only reason to use amaze+ Citirewards is the conversion of any purchase/transaction to become an ""online"" one hence making most things (as long not excluded MCC) get the 4mpd from citirewards.what you seem to be comparing (foreign fx rates) is quite different from the above use case (apples to oranges) as i do believe youtrip doesn't convert purchases to online while maintaining MCC for  citirewards",btohqsg
Yes I understand  but the context here is for overseas usage,btohqsg
Ok great so Amaze + CitiR(4mpd) overseas still better than Youtrip ah?,btohqsg
i mean if you value youtrip's benefits over 4mpd + instapoints then yes? its really two quite different things that will appeal to different people based on their preference :/,btohqsg
From both cashback or miles perspective  youtrip no longer makes sense compared to using amaze + your favourite MasterCard.This is because either cashback or miles earned would more than compensate the additional fx spread that amaze has over you trip.Youtrip (in my opinion) only makes sense for the purpose of withdrawing cash at atms overseas because the net cost of the foreign currency cash is cheaper than changing cash at Arcade money changers.,btohqsg
Guys what is the best ways to top up my Grab Wallet? thank you in adv..,btohqsg
Get out of that trash ecosystem called grabpay. Its completely worthless at this juncture,btohqsg
Uob absolute cashback. But using the credit card itself (1.7%) is more worthwhile than using it to topup grabpay (0.3~0.6%),btohqsg
thank you due to some personal reasons i had to topup and I am likely to use a Credit card to do so,btohqsg
Amex TCB no longer gives cashback for grab top up,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for sharing. That mean I have been using for nothing .,btohqsg
Any credit card to intro for use to pay in hospital bill?,btohqsg

the stores only have 0% installment for some bank cards. If they have buy-now-pay-later like Atome then can use Amaze+CRMC,btohqsg

Hi anyone know when the 40 000 thank you points from Citibank credit card promotion will be credited into account?,btohqsg
So meaning no way for seniors to use bank card for their mrt trips?,btohqsg
Yup. Can upgrade existing concession card to simplygo concession card and do auto top-up. Can get ezlink points for rewards.Top-ups DO NOT count for spending for most credit cards. Check your cards tnc.,btohqsg
Honestly kind of worth for Seniors to use concession card because they get at least 30% discount.Keyword is at least  because really long distance rides can get them around 60% discount.Just set the card up for auto top-up and you can redeem rewards on ezlink app also.,btohqsg
I thought if it‚Äôs possible to double dip with concession and miles card. But since it doesn‚Äôt recognize then no choice,btohqsg
You might find luck with UOB absolute cashback card for 1.7% cashback with 25 cents fee per auto top-up.,btohqsg

Hi  any advice for applying HSBC revolution credit card from singsaver  money smart or hsbc websites to get the best cash offers and benefits e.g luggage bag? üò¨,btohqsg
I would say just be very patient üòÇ I applied for mine in early August 2023 and until now they still say my application is processing. I already gave up on getting any sign-up gift cause by the time they approve I'm sure the promotion period will be over ady,btohqsg
üò≥ Which one did u apply for the card? Singsaver  money smart or via hsbc website?,btohqsg
SingSaver  but the bank itself is quite slow one. My brother's one took like 8 weeks to approve also I think. So be careful of the promotion period eg. if it ends 31 December 2023 then it's a bit scary,btohqsg
In that case  perhaps apply via hsbc website seem a better choice üòÜhttps://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/revolution/#welcomegift,btohqsg

Hi all  for singsavers promotion  if the promo ends on 22 nov  i signed up the credit card on 20th   does that mean that if i reach the minimum spend after the the 22nd  i wont be eligible or is it 1 month from application (ie till 20th dec),btohqsg
as in convert citi miles to cashback? or u asking $ value of 48k miles with partner airline,btohqsg
Yes. The discounted fares only applies to concession cards that have the name  face  NRIC etc‚Ä¶ like students and seniors. Anything else is normal adult fare.I think maybe because these concession cards got some encoded data to tell the machine that you student  senior etc. Bank cards and normal anonymous ezlink cards cannot encode data so normal fares ah.,btohqsg
I also interested to know‚Ä¶ alot of credit cards don‚Äôt give rewards for instalment payment so curious too. üòÖ,btohqsg

Citipayall promo is 1.8 mpd  independent of the card mpd rate.4mpd is for online spending  exclusive of citipayall.,btohqsg
So I don‚Äôt need to apply new credit card. That means my Citi rewards no cap at 1k also? Doesn‚Äôt matter which card I use?,btohqsg
If you want to use Citipayall  can use citirewards  max cap spending of $120k  minimum of 8k.but the intial points obtained will be lower than other cards to my knowledge  the bonus will come in later for you to hit 1.8mpdYou get 0.4mpd first  then when the promotion ends you get the remaining 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Oh why lower than other cards? I thought you mentioned it‚Äôs independent of the card?,btohqsg
The 1.8mpd is independent of any cards used.But the base + bonus is different for each card.E.g. premiermiles earns 1.2mpd usually  citi rewards is at 0.4 mpd.the promotion will top up the remaining miles at the end of promotion period.,btohqsg
Ooh but the net is the same but just differing time it is credited in?,btohqsg
yes  eventually it's the same  but make sure u hit minimum 8k spending,btohqsg
For OCBC 360  if i withdraw my pay every month it comes in  is there an ideal timing i should do it? eg anytime before 4pm? I have been setting up recurring transfer which should be ok right? thx!,btohqsg
Total right? Do t have to be one transaction,btohqsg
Hi experts  does Citi bank ask previous career experience for credit card application ?,btohqsg
no. why would they ask that?,btohqsg
Is there an alert for new new credit card promotions on moneysmart or singsaver?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also curious about that. The staff ask my email address  phone number and my pass 10 years working experience,btohqsg
I'm more curious why is there a staff involved for a cc application lol,btohqsg
Weird lol. Unless you not working rn and applying for cc.. which I know usually will just reject,btohqsg
You can always delete the message. üòÇ,btohqsg

Hi question about Dbs points to be converted into miles. By When should I redeem / convert them? It will be expired after one year   right?,btohqsg

Isn‚Äôt the exact same as what I shared in the picture above ?,btohqsg
Your earliest expiry is 31 mar 2024,btohqsg
So by when I should redeem the points? To be safe ?,btohqsg
Hi.Is there any other way to scan for kofu QR code? Try to use Xnap app but cannot work for kofu.,btohqsg
By mid mar should be safe  but do note that to convert to miles there is minimum and each conversion have fee thus usually i sweep clean all for 1 year worth,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm aiming to convert all year worth. So before middle of march. Got it  thanks,btohqsg
Hi  if I use CRMC on grab for transport and grabfood order not wallet top up. Will get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Did you check if that the vendor has XNAP logo on the SG QR?,btohqsg
Not every SRQR can use XNAP  must be with XNAP logo then can use. Usually only available on newest SGQR+,btohqsg
3 fund portfolio1. Voo2. Qqqm3. Schd4. Cpf top up 8k annuallyIs this good?,btohqsg
a. Should consider overlaps between funds affecting risk (e.g. Apple is in both VOO and QQQM  potentially there are stocks which appear in all three ETFs)b. You can divert the funds meant for these portfolios through SRS contributions first for additional tax savings if not alreadyc. CPF contribution strategy would heavily depend on what kind of returns you think you could get outside and your timeline. If you're investing in 100% equities then putting away 8k in SA/MA may actually be the worse performing option vs investing directly  even accounting for the upfront tax savings.,btohqsg
Thanks  noted that overlapping risk  currently not in the tax bracket that worth toping up more than 8k  cpf is just an additional step as was inspired by Chris to reach FRS and also 1M65.,btohqsg
SRS you can top up every year so there‚Äôs less need to worry about which year you‚Äôll be in a higher/lower tax bracket to strategise so much. But if you‚Äôre saving up for other things (home  marriage  etc) then having to locking up the funds till 63+ is an additional considerationThis is different from topping up SA/MA where yes you‚Äôll hit BHS and FRS and then you can‚Äôt top up anymore  so you may need to be a bit more strategic with when you do those top ups over the course of your career,btohqsg
Hi can i know if uob kf cc annual fee waiver is possible,btohqsg

UOB CNY Savings Bonus Promo:Assuming there is this promo  we shall empty out UOB One Account on 29th or 30th Dec 2023?If we empty 100k on either of the above date  are we still able to get the $400 saving bonus for Dec 2023?,btohqsg
Ur 3 ETFs are basically all US mkt  with extra weigh on tech and dividend paying coys. Rather than diversification  which is the essence of a 3-fund portfolio  urs is making ur portfolio more concentrated in specific sectors within the US mkt instead. but if those sectors are what u believe in over the long term  then i guess those ETFs are good choices given their low fees. However  i will go with cspx or vuaa instead of voo  for lower dividend withholding tax and no estate tax.,btohqsg
1. 29th is safer in my opinion2. U need to keep ADB at $100k with account at $0 on 29th December onwards. Use excel to calculator what‚Äôs the balance u need to keep until then. I kept $111k from 1st December already.,btohqsg
$0 for 3 days is alot of damage to the average..! LOL,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtYou din participate UOB Xmas promo?,btohqsg
You need to keep daily balance at $110 714.30 between 1-28 Dec to enjoy max 5% interest if you transferred out on 29 Dec.If transfer out on 30 Dec  daily balance between 1-29 Dec shall be $106 896.55,btohqsg
19 days of december have since passed..haha,btohqsg
You need to do your own calculation what is your average daily balance as of 19 Dec. Then from there top up the amount difference today(20 Dec).,btohqsg
Need extra 45k if from 22nd Dec onwards,btohqsg
"Let say the CNY Promo truly starts on 31 Dec 2023  we can participate immediately and transfer back this ""fresh fund"" back to UOB or will hv to participate only after 30 days?",btohqsg

Hi all  any idea why the US markets are beating money market funds by a wide margin now (and growing bigger by the day)? And do you think by placing funds in short term FDs  T bills  etc is getting riskier by the day vs  example  equities that pay dividends? Curious to hear your thoughts,btohqsg

Hi all  may I know what‚Äôs the best way to spend uni$ for UOB credit card holders aside from buying air tickets?

Hi all! Can i ask if citibank rewards card do not cover in-app mobile wallet transactions  are there any way I can work around with? Is it through using amaze card?,btohqsg
Fly economy also not that bad. Not ideal but better than redeeming for random stuff. Unless you don't travel at all.,btohqsg
hate to apply for air tickets  unless economy with saver booking or else bo hua. thats why prefer a more direct way,btohqsg

Does someone here has Excel or formula how to calculate ADB ?,btohqsg
Need some help on the ADB as I didn't manage to get the OCBC bonus for last month,btohqsg
Do you know why you did not get? Which one you did not get? Salary   spend or save bonus?,btohqsg
OCBC save bonus criteria saying must have 500 ADB more than last month  I just check mine is showing 2 digit ADB now. Wondering how to increase to 500 to get the Dec save bonus,btohqsg
My small tips for you and everybody on ocbc 360 Ôºö1). Transfer in $600 on 1st of every month.2). When salary and monthly interest are credited into the account  transfer it out by 6pm on same day. So ADB will remain as $600 increase throughout whole month.Just these 3 types of transactions every month on your account. You shallavoidusing this account for other transactions  so not to disturb your planned MAB.Most important step:Login to ocbc 360 account via web on every week n last week of the month to check the tracker to see have you fulfil the criteria (salary  spend and average daily balance vs last month).Remember to spend at least $500 on OCBC eligible card monthly to meet 4.65% criteria  Or else 4.05%.,btohqsg

Assuming your current month ADB vs last month is only $40 more as of 19 Dec and also you don‚Äôt have any other credit/debit transactions between now and 31 Dec.To increase it to hit min $500 ($500-$40) x 31 / 12 = $1188.34Need to deposit $1188.34 before 9pm today(20 Dec).ÔΩõit is zero safety buffer}But usually I will use min $600 to have more safety buffer or in case any miscalculation. With this  I will prefer to deposit $1446.67 today.,btohqsg

Ipaymy or cardup linked to citi rewards?,btohqsg
Citi rewards only max $1k. Not suitable.I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code. Eg. Universityhttps://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Maybe UOB absolute cashback if they accept amex,btohqsg

Hi Finance Gurus  can I check if Trust credit card will count towards the 5 card spend we have to do monthly to get that extra 0.5%-1% extra interest on our trust savings account. Or only debit card can?,btohqsg
both CC and debit should count,btohqsg
uob one but must clock min $500 card spend,btohqsg
both are good. put 100k in each. for ocbc you need to increase 500 every month so at some point you will want to reset back to 100k,btohqsg
Ok  I think I stick to OCBC then. Like not very big diff,btohqsg
The big difference is can you spend $500 every month  is your saving hit $100k. It is by tier. Depends on the tier you have  the interest received may difference.,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î but has the $500 be certain category? I‚Äôm using Citi rewards for most transactions,btohqsg
Yes. On UOB one. You only get 0.05% per year if you did not spend on uob eligible card whereas OCBC you still can get higher interest.Eg. Earn $50 interest per year with $100k saving on UOB One account without credit card spend.I strongly recommend you read the info on both bank websites to understand both products.,btohqsg
For standard chartered smart card  how long does it take for fast transaction payment to clear the statement usually take?,btohqsg
I‚Äôd recommend using EVOL with the UOB account. It‚Äôs more generous with cashback compared to the One card. As for the UOB Savings Acc minimum of 500  I don‚Äôt think the list of exclusions are very high. You might wish to check the T&C but the app is good about telling you exactly when you‚Äôve hit the 500 and so you can switch to other cards then.,btohqsg

for evol card do you still need shop only at certain group to get cashback? can still get cashback if u spend groceries at sheng siong? min spending must be $600 right?,btohqsg

Most places with NETS machine can generate NETS QR.,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits. Break it down to individual transactions and how much do you spend on them monthly.,btohqsg
i would say majority is food  in a mix of cash and card  and drinks that i pay via paynow to friend that paid,btohqsg
do CCs count in drinks as qualifying spend for miles/cashback/points?,btohqsg
And what spending range would that be? If it is higher can consider Uob cards with higher ceiling limit .. VS   lady card,btohqsg
About 900-1.3k per month  which is why I'm unsure about cards with minimum spend,btohqsg
anyone have standard chartered credit card? how long does FAST bill payment take to reflect?,btohqsg
Try out Citi card  rewards or cashback it is pretty easy to use. Those with online and physical payment need some monitoring. There are many videos u can watch on YouTube HMSG,btohqsg

Depends on the tnc. If they specifically state how much you have to spend for the fee waiver  then you will have to hit it the minimum to get it.Besides  chances are that you may not get the second card approved.,btohqsg
Ohh I see  forgot to consider that second part üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi all  i have alr hit the min spending of $800 for citi cashback card and transaction has been posted.Is the cashback supposed to be updated in the app instantly or till the statement month ends? Cos currently i only see a slight increase in the cashback amount which is a 0.25% cashback.I have checked heymax ai website for the mcc of Bellygood and it is under caterers  which is one of the category for citi cashback card. How reliable is the mcc indicated in heymaxai? Cos previously i charged my card to amaze and the mcc dosent tally with heymaxai indicated mcc.,btohqsg

Hi experts  What the diff between mobile payment and contactless?,btohqsg
Hi  Cupid. Contactless means the card has to ‚Äúkiss‚Äù üíãthe terminal n the terminal responses with beep sound.Mobile contactless means your device/phone has to ‚Äúkiss‚Äù üíãthe terminal.,btohqsg
LOL heck no. Still very useful card for everything else,btohqsg

I thought the last published minimum is 80k but they hide is now,btohqsg
So far  mine has been positive,btohqsg
Did u check today? Today was negative,btohqsg
Yes today is negative because the unit price dropped from 1.0152 to 1.0150,btohqsg
But past 28 days annualized interest is still 4.07%,btohqsg
So nth to be alarmed abt as long as the annualized interest remains high,btohqsg
I see. I put in yesterday night. Hit w negative.. I so Heng,btohqsg
First time since inception it dropped in value üòÖ,btohqsg

For UOB Evol card  I spent $490 on Google Pay  $380 on Shopee (online)  total $870 > $600. Have fulfilled the criteria?,btohqsg
Depends on $490 spend on which category,btohqsg
Shopee - If not top up Shopee Pay  should be counted,btohqsg
Bit unsure with the balance $100  after the two $250,btohqsg
Actually u spend $300 on Online & Contactless will do,btohqsg
Can consider spend on public transport  correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
Google pay to pay online or gpay for mobile contactless?You definitely hit the 600 min spend. But if all is online spend  you only get $20. If is mobile contactless then $40.,btohqsg
Makan - Most likely no issue,btohqsg
"So you have clocked both cashback categories. But because of ""overspending""  your effective cashback rate is 4.6%  based on what you mentioned above. Anything else added will reduce your cashback rate further.",btohqsg
Thanks  it's fine. I'm aiming for the $40,btohqsg
If u using EVOL  best is to have a secondary card,btohqsg
So  on the $100 (on top of $250 for 2 criteria)  it can be included into any of the 2  namely mobile contact less (Google or Apple Pay) and online purchase,btohqsg
Like HSBC Revolution or Citi Rewards Card,btohqsg
Once u spend $300 on each category  use the secondary card to spend,btohqsg
Remember online payment using Google pay or apple pay is NOT mobile contactless,btohqsg
Anyone able to pay GE 3.5% with Citi payall?,btohqsg
It will be classified under online payment? Any example?,btohqsg
Mobile contact less = Paywave  but iso using credit card to tap  use Google or Apple Pay. Correct?,btohqsg
Mobile contactless is like paywave yes. Online payment using Google Pay/Apple Pay is like XNAP  Favepay  McDonald's App  payment on f&b website,btohqsg
Mcdonald app  Grab rides  Shopee Lazada purchase with Evol card registered inside will be considered online purchase. Correct?,btohqsg

Not Shopee. It says top-up Shopeepay is excluded. You can buy things from Shopee and pay with your DBS Live Fresh.,btohqsg
OK. So just have to remember fave is excluded from dbs live fresh. So weird  is counted for evol but not for dbs live fresh,btohqsg
Different cards la  same like amaze excluded for wmmc but not crmc.* they are not charity organisations after all,btohqsg
if the mcc fits your lady's solitaire cat you can consider pairing that with amaze for 6mpd,btohqsg
Ah i have to change categories  but yea gr8 idea. So it's generally more efficient to earn points via CC + Amaze than changing and paying with wallet cash yea?,btohqsg
well efficiency would be subjective and based on your value of a mile - since transacting via amaze+cc is essentially buying miles (cheaply)personally if I can get 4-6 mpd via amaze  I'll pick it over youtrip/revolut/cash,btohqsg
ah true  yea i thought it would be more worth it too compared to cash  but was afraid the charges might make it moot. gotta check on the limit for citi rewards to see what's it. But thanks!,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been holding the Trust credit card since the application is the easiest and Fairprice groceries are my main spend.UOB EVOL is next option if you can make 3 monthly minimum online or mobile payment to avoid the annual fee.,btohqsg
Uob evol need any min amt spend to avoid the annual fee? What if not met...how much is the anuual fee? TKs..,btohqsg
You need the minimum $600 spend to get cashback and perks but you just need to incur 3 monthly spending to get auto-waiver for annual fee.,btohqsg
"Hi everyone  may I ask if funds transferred from OA to SA will be considered ""reserved""? likewise will the interest earned from the SA account in general be considered ""reserved"" and unable to use for SA shielding  because I understand that RSTU to SA is reserved and cant be use for shielding and hence would like to avoid that. Thanks!",btohqsg
1) OA to SA funds not considered reserved.2) Int from RSTU of funds to SA is also part of reserved.You can check in the web portal when u login. There is a hyperlinlk for reserved funds under the 3 acc summary,btohqsg

Hi guys I have been using the UOBKrisflyer credit card for a few months  I don't see the miles in my krisflyer app. what should I do?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I did the UOB Lady's Solitaire application by SMS. May I know how to check the status of my application? Cheers and Merry Christmas!,btohqsg
What did you spend on? Are they eligible transactions?When you applied  the card  did you provided correct Krisflyer membership number?,btohqsg
Have to wait for them to get back. At least that was what I did. I tried calling the call centre and they also told me to wait previously.,btohqsg
So I'll just be expecting an SMS/call then?,btohqsg
I wasn't asked for membership number  majority are eligible transactions,btohqsg
Hello  may I know how long did you wait for them to reply u via sms ? Cus it‚Äôs been over 5 working days,btohqsg
How do they know your Krisflyer account number?,btohqsg
I thought I can link it up through the app but there isn't this option,btohqsg

hi i got a cpf qn. if i top up 8k to my mum who is 70+ age now  i get tax relief. but can she withdraw it from her RA readily to use as allowance?,btohqsg
I took me almost 7 working days,btohqsg
Does 10X citi rewards card paired with amaze work for online attraction purchases? (Gardens by the bays ticket),btohqsg
is she at FRS already?The catch is this (based on my old era rules):1. you can only topup to your loved ones if they are below FRS2. they can only withdraw from the RA if above FRS,btohqsg
she met her FRS but i can still do top up to her RA. i did a 600 topup just last week because govt sent a mailer saying will match dollar to dollar up to 600,btohqsg
as she's 70+  her FRS back when she hit 55 was only 94-95k.,btohqsg
Before age 55  you can top up your SA to the prevailing FRS.Once you turn 55  and your RA is opened  you can top up your RA to the ERS. The BRS is meant to provide you with monthly payouts in retirement that cover basic living expenses,btohqsg
My first application it took them more than a week to reject it. Cos i was an existing uob card holder  so they used my income from years ago when it was still below 120k. Then they send me instruction to update my income  after that i reapply and they approved it in 3 days.,btohqsg
ah it seems after RA is open  you can topup to ERS.But if i am not wrong  you will not be able to withdraw the topup amounts (will show as Reserved). You should however  be able to withdraw the amounts above FRS from the original pool.,btohqsg
thanks MT  in this case  it sounds like it works.,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/growing-your-savings/saving-more-with-cpf/matching-grant-for-seniors-who-top-upnow it is so confusing... above FRS yet will get matching dollar for dollar topups if 'invited'?,btohqsg

not really a loophole i guess  since the amount is reserved,btohqsg
true. anyone has experience withdrawing from cpf RA. i did a trial $10 but its been 1wk   nothing receieved yet. haha,btohqsg

Hi I have a question on my parents CPF. They have already retired many years and 70+. They have limited money in CPF and previously self employed hawker center. I saw they have some amount in OA and do you think it‚Äôs better to transfer to MA or keep in RA or SA. I‚Äôm thinking no point keep in OA since the interest is too low and cannot take out right unless is RA?,btohqsg
70+ I don't think can transfer over to SA   I not very sure,btohqsg

Between ocbc Frank and dbs live fresh  which is better,btohqsg
Hey guys just want to check if anyone managed to redeemed this these 2 days ?,btohqsg
Y? Doesnt ocbc Frank don't  differentiate between online and contactless   which make it easier,btohqsg
theres always FX risk so some people prefer to deal in sgd fund because of that,btohqsg
So for dbs live fresh  must spend $300 for each category?,btohqsg
$200 to $400 each cat  make up total min $600,btohqsg
So if $200 for the online  then I must clock $400 for the contactless?,btohqsg
yes to get 5% that is,btohqsg
So if clock $600 for live fresh  mean get about $30 cashback,btohqsg
yes with additional 5% cashback for green merchants e.g. simplygo,btohqsg
If you can fully optimise $800 to include all the cashbacks  meaning $400 online and $400 contactless  and within those $800 you also clock $300 sustainable  you get 6.88% effective cashback rate.,btohqsg
Any recommendations for supplementary credit card to get with a partner? Preferably no min spend and cash back focused thanks,btohqsg

Somebody has same thought on this earlier. You can search chat history using ‚Äúuob promo 30‚Äù to see what others reply to him.,btohqsg
I won't use YouTrip in this scenario.if you hit max rewards limit on your card that pairs with Instarem I suggest to deposit SGD to Amaze Wallet using a linked MasterCard. you then spend using Amaze Wallet balance which gives you much better FX rate than using linked CC. Also  foreign currency spend on Amaze Wallet earns more InstapointsMoreover  if the MasterCard you use to top up Wallet has GIRO setup with HSBC EGA  you get 1% indirectly from HSBC Everyday+ bonus,btohqsg
Hello everyone  can I clarify if I hit the annual CPF contribution cap of 37 740  does that mean I cannot do any voluntary contribution for tax relief? And can I still do for parents top up for relief then?,btohqsg
