💰Pika World Morning Updates💰Equity markets rose higher as economic data continued to show good signs of a weak recession ahead. Latest earning from Micron is better than expected as this corporate earning season registered yet another positive outlook.Coming in today is a string of key economic data such as GDP  Initial Jobless Claims  Pending Home Sales  and FOMC member speech.Given SPY continued to trend higher  we have since then offload some of our VOO holdings (we still keep our S&P 500 holdings in Endowus platform) as we try to go lighter.Our sub-account IBKR which began at around 6 June  has continued to trend better than expected and we will provide further updates on the market here and in our trading channel.Have a splendid holiday my friends  and will catch up tonight!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

HK🇭🇰 hungry.. 🇸🇬 SgX go to🎲..🤣,btohqsg
Depends on individual.  I would still drive and freedom to travel anywhere i want.Plan route. Know the timing of traffic jam. Example I would leave sg when ppl still sleep.Even 1/2 hrs make a difference.Example last Saturday I left sg 630am. Those after me are stuck in jam.If woodland jam  I use tuas. Longer distance from my place also worth it. Fuel cheap in Malaysia so compensate the distance.,btohqsg
if we failed to plan we're planning to jam🤣as such  OSOD hor😝,btohqsg
