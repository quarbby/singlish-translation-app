Now my dream car is either Toyota Crown,btohqsg

Nothing beats having supercar horsepower while carrying a bed from IKEA in the back,btohqsg

770hp shld be fast enough ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
My biggest regret was not getting the Skoda Octavia VRS Kombi back in 2010 instead of the VW Jetta,btohqsg
upgrade everything and interior is good stuff,btohqsg
It was only like...10k more at 110k iirc,btohqsg
HuracÃ¡n STO is my favorite HuracÃ¡n-^-,btohqsg
The Octavia VRS Kombi is basically a Golf GTI MK5 in wagon guise,btohqsg
from factory some have full airsus,btohqsg
so u could literally slam them,btohqsg
some euro style modding(personally think its cool but not my style of modding),btohqsg

The lambo is a 1:24 I got from bangkok,btohqsg

The main difference between this and the standard PC011 case is that it has that 5 inch screen behind that shows ur GPU or CPU temp and clock speed,btohqsg
not bad for brand by car company,btohqsg
this kind of case not really optimal btw,btohqsg
400 for a case with a lambo badge slapped on,btohqsg
just get a normal case and slap on your own stickers and bam,btohqsg
Bro on average how much is a Lambo logo pin,btohqsg
There is a a method to doing up the fans for these types of of cases  I used to build gaming rigs on a commercial basis for 5 years  before doing what I'm doing now,btohqsg
I like it  I can afford it. So why not,btohqsg
the case design by itself is nice tbvh,btohqsg
oh it comes with a display and all,btohqsg
ok 400 isnt insanely far fetched considering lambo tax and all.,btohqsg
Yup that extra 5 inch display is exclusive to this special edition,btohqsg
And the panels on the top and front which are SECC steel on the normal edition  are carbon fibre on the lambo edition,btohqsg
You just see how much is the Secretlab Lamborghini chair lol,btohqsg
I didn't buy the lambo chair because honestly I find gamer-design chairs like the kind Secretlab does  incredibly uncomfortable,btohqsg
Eh nice eh what is that,btohqsg
