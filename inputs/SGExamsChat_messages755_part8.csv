When discussing the primary culprits of global warming - such as gas-burning power plants  gasoline-powered vehicles and methane-emitting livestock - air-conditioning seems less conspicuous. Yet  these cooling devices are potent accelerators of climate change.Many air-conditioners use hydrofluorocarbons  which are potent greenhouse gases  as refrigerants  in addition to consuming vast amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels.As the world warms  more people turn to air-conditioning for relief  further heating the planet in a vicious cycle. The World Economic Forum estimates that unchecked  air-conditioning-related greenhouse gas emissions could increase global temperatures by 0.5 degrees Celsius by the century's end.Cooling is responsible for more than 7 per cent of global emissions and is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050  according to the United Nations Environment Program.,btohqsg
