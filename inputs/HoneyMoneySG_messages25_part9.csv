Get Amex TCB and GPMC  pay via AXS,btohqsg
Ok  I thought it be shown in the credit bureau report. I paid all my bills  nothing outstanding.,btohqsg
can look into getting CitiPM  it's the next best  if u want to get 1.2miles,btohqsg
I mean I only spend 1k per month. Only this insurance payment is a huge payment. So not really sure is it even worth getting another card for jt,btohqsg
Just worried $6k unbilled amount and $5k grab topup will flag some negative on my credit rating.,btohqsg
For citibank I applied through their web as I already hold premiere miles. So won't get anything for new signup,btohqsg
Probably should be quite fast since your already their customer,btohqsg
Applied on 27thdec. Now still waiting. Was told 5 to 7 working days. But still waiting,btohqsg
Feel free to drop them a call regarding it. I think they will be fine since your already their customer onhand,btohqsg
Called twice. Say will send Email to expedite still the same,btohqsg
no issue at all to have spending on another card,btohqsg
No sure if Maybank visa platinum will earn Cashback for insurance,btohqsg
Then no chance just wait. Is it u got big spending upcoming,btohqsg
Hi im planning a trip ato jan oct or nov period this yearI have just applied for the HSBC revolution card and citi rewards + amaze card (still waiting for cards).My flights tickets cost estimated for 2 pax is at $2.4kHowever  HSBC revolution card 10x rewards is capped at $1k.Is there another card that i can apply for to maximise miles or cashback?I will also need to add in hotel cost which will be another large amount.,btohqsg
it does  but need to meet the tiered spending for all 3 months for a quarter,btohqsg
DBS WWMC max 2k (4mpd)   UOB Visa signature min 1k max 2k (4 mpd),btohqsg
dbs wwmc (4mpd capped for $2k monthly) or dbs altitude (3mpd capped for $5k monthly) for online flight/hotel,btohqsg
Just to check  if i only use WWMC for flights and hotel booking Would we still be able to get the annual fee waived? And is there a min spend every month?,btohqsg
No min spend. Waiver usually quite easy to get even if you don't hit the stated minimum for waiver.,btohqsg
hI guys. Is there a min amount to exchange currency on IBKR? I tried 100 sgd but it said the min amount has to be 2k usd,btohqsg
"It's not ""can be centralized""  the nature of CBDCs is that it IS centralized. It's right in the name ""CENTRALIZED bank digital currency"". Singapore has renamed it ""Purpose Bound Money"" or PBM. Which as it's name suggests  is more like a voucher  then money as you can only use it within certain limits (i.e. the purpose that's tagged to it).There are several ongoing ""campaigns"" that are nudging us towards the use of CBDCs:- Rebranding it PBMs- CDC vouchers- Gov Wallets (via Singpass)- No more printing of new notes (for CNY?)- Strongly encouraging digital payment methods over cash (environment?)We are still a long way from full fledged CBDCs but we are certainly headed in that direction. IF the entire economy only relies on CBDCs  this would mean a central governing body that stipulates our personal spending habits... telling us what we can and cannot buy.CBDCs are not to be confused with Crypto. Whilst both are digital  the underlying technology of crypto seeks to decentralize power whereas CBDCs aims to centralize power.",btohqsg
So even for bnpl also not applicable?,btohqsg
Happen to see this. Any inputs?,btohqsg
Hi  need CPF advices here. I will be getting my HDB soon and my current CPF balance is as follows :OA : 131kSA : 44kMA : 58kWas thinking to transfer some of my OA to SA but no idea how much i should transfer. So need some advices here. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
If u not investing in oa. Maybe after deduct the amount hdb will deduct + if your salary for oa is enough to cover monthly. Not sure the actual procedure of hdb as I not yet getting. But I think this is the process. Or u can bid for tbills part of OA to take advantage of artibirage rates.,btohqsg
Example if your salary enough to cover installment through OA. Then either tbills all except 20k. Or transfer to SA.Of course this is part of strategy. Your cash side is different.,btohqsg
Need to think about futures rstu as well if you earning high salary that need yearly contribution to reduce tax.,btohqsg
Existing card holders get card very fast  last month apply Crmc and get it in 3 days,btohqsg
I don't know why mine take so long,btohqsg
On new note  dbs has intro paylah for angpao  but don’t think it is wide acceptable,btohqsg
This seems to be a popular question. Let me gather my thoughts and make a video,btohqsg
No idea then  I also shock get the card in mailbox in 3 days,btohqsg
They want your spend. Don't want mine,btohqsg

Hey does anyone know if payment through Apple Pay on Kris+ is counted towards online spend or contactless spend? For UOB Evol,btohqsg
Hi what is the best way to top up you trip now that grab is nerf?,btohqsg
City Payall. You get miles not bc. I think they have promo until 31 jan. Note processing fees 2%.,btohqsg
u have the option to retain up to 20k in ur OA....,btohqsg
Maybe consider Amaze… Although 2+% worse exchange rates but got 4mpd,btohqsg
U can transfer after the flat purchase right? The officer will ask you how much to down payment,btohqsg
hihi if we were to use amaze card to pay for insurance bills  do we enjoy the citirewards points ( if its tagged to citi rewards card)?,btohqsg
No  MCC is still passed through,btohqsg
No  insurance is a common exclusion  Amaze simply changes mode of the transaction to an online one  it doesn't change the MCC,btohqsg
i see   thanks for the quick reply!☺️ what would be the best strategy for insurance in that case? considering the nerfs everywhere,btohqsg
"e-angpao has actually been around for several years now  but has never really taken off. These days there's a hard push towards going digital and they've even stopped printing new notes this year  on the premise of ""saving the environment"". We will continue to see more encouragement to go digital  such as discounts like NTUC $6 discount for $55 CDC voucher used  And we will continue to see limitations with paper money  such as stores not accepting paper cash or not printing paper cash or being charged to use paper cash  etc.As crypto is a direct competitor to CBDCs  I think that we will continue to see more FTX-type cases cropping up as well  that will result in regulations on the premise of ""protecting people"".",btohqsg
