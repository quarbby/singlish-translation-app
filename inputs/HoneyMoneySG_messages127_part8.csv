is there any hope waiting for a UOB Krisflyer promo that is applicable for existing cardholders? planning to travel & book flights in the next month or so,btohqsg
No point. Not often that UOB has promo for existing customers. And flight tix will go up while you are waiting,btohqsg
i was thinking that too  looking back the past year most promos have been for new cardholders,btohqsg
Even their promo for new cardholder is muddy at best. No way to know if you got it as it's only for first 100. And not paid our for 3 months. Not to mention they are super slow. So best to get the better price for the ticket now than wait for a miracle,btohqsg
