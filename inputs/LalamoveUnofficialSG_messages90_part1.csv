Grab must be thinlking everyday how to kill off deliveroo panda n llm,btohqsg
Kill off deliveroo  Panda and LLM. At the same time suck driver / rider dry dry.,btohqsg
Grab will never kill off deliveroo  panda or LLm. Our garmen must let other country know we are an open country. 1 company cannot bao ga liao. must have 2 or more to play around... Just like Certis cisco n Aetos... BOth are Garmen,btohqsg
If grab monopolise. Will be like our petrol.even Whole world dropping petrol price will still go up.,btohqsg
So all riders should boycott grab before it's too late,btohqsg
Ah Tan already just bought a GCB. Very lich liao,btohqsg

The ryde driver is a asshole,btohqsg

Do you take bike order to stack too?,btohqsg
The jizz is...Learn ur routes ar..i cannot teach this skill..When picking orders I will look at PU and drop off area..,btohqsg
If high value..+6 +8 +10 +12..,btohqsg
If not i cant be bothered...,btohqsg
So normally stack with car order?,btohqsg
If to drop off difference of $1-2 i will stack..better than 1 order..usually during peak period,btohqsg
$21 car order + $19 bike order..,btohqsg
I wont be bothered with below $16 bike orders,btohqsg
Like that have to go CBD all the time,btohqsg
See if u heng or not,btohqsg
Lol..i do CBD..i dont do other area unless im ard the area..,btohqsg
Another things is you need to be near CBD then you will see more orders?,btohqsg
Not so..but ur ratio of getting the orders is higher..within 3km radius of PU,btohqsg
No wonder I swipe 15 times also canâ€™t get knn,btohqsg
If ur out of the area u still able to see..but limited choices..the nicer choices when ur nearer the area,btohqsg
I work 1 day almost wanna give up ...,btohqsg
But if ur the type who die2 need to depend goggle map to go around cbd area..than gg,btohqsg
Route is ok for me is about getting jobs,btohqsg
In cbd area i dont need goggle map..unless its a unfamilliar area..which is low cause i only take PU from famillar usual places,btohqsg
Monday I waited at woodland ind maybe thatâ€™s why,btohqsg
Ur new  if u wanna trt CBD area..need to effort to familliarise in the area for 3 weeks min,btohqsg
Off course la..woodlands area bulk of the orders come from the senoko food hub,btohqsg
I swear to myself never take from there again,btohqsg
Make me wait long long and fare not as good,btohqsg
Yes I will go CBD more often,btohqsg
I stay hougang...i never go ubi..i cannot wait and hang around,btohqsg
MPV orders sucks..heavy stuffs + cheapos cust..,btohqsg
Lol but lor the fare not bad,btohqsg
