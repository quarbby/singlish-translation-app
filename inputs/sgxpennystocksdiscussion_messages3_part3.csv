Not enough Covid vaccine for all until 2024  says biggest producerSerum Institute warns that companies are not increasing production capacity quickly enoughThe chief executive of the world&rsquo s largest vaccine manufacturer has warned that not enough Covid-19 vaccines will be available for everyone in the world to be inoculated until the end of 2024 at the earliest.&ldquo I know the world wants to be optimistic on it&thinsp .&thinsp .&thinsp .&thinsp [but] I have not heard of anyone coming even close to that [level] right now &rdquo he said in a video call from London.In May  the World Health Organization&rsquo s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan predicted that it would take four to five years before the pandemic was under control  adding that a vaccine &ldquo seems for now the best way out&rdquo but it was no silver bullet. Other important factors are containment measures and virus mutations which could make a vaccine ineffective.¬† Assuming there are two or more vaccines that are at least 75 per cent protective against infection  three-quarters of the world&rsquo s population could be vaccinated by mid-2023  said Peter Hale  the executive director of the Foundation for Vaccine Research in the US. &ldquo That should be enough to curb the spread of infection and stall the pandemic &mdash though not good enough to consign the virus to the dustbin of history &rdquo Mr Hale added.https://www.ft.com/content/a832d5d7-4a7f-42cc-850d-8757f19c3b6b,btohqsg
