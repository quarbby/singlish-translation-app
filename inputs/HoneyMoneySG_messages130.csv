Only worthwhile cards to consider is BOC family and Maybank Visa Platinum.,btohqsg
only 1x point since it is not under one of the fashion mcc for 10x points  use Amaze+citi rewards (via applepay) instead to get 10x points for online transactions (amaze converts to online),btohqsg
Hi would like to enquire for uob one acc to earn the interest  after trf salary to acc  how long does it take before i can use the money i trf provided i already hit the uob amt i wanted.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure about Frank as it has a bonus component to the cash back. Evol excludes CardUp if I didn‚Äôt recall wrongly.I studied both of them when I selected and I dropped the slightly iffy ones.DBS Vantage can also select cash back mode and with EGA  break even on promo code but it‚Äôs so minimal compared to the miles.,btohqsg
BOC  Frank and Evol also has a much smaller quantum. More hoops to jump through üòëThose were my primary considerations when I went for the process.,btohqsg
if i already got a debit iuob card and i apply for uob stash will they auto link mine existing card to the uob stash or i can remove the linkage?,btohqsg
"HOME175 can only be applied with Vantage Card? I tried just now but Cardup stated ""Sorry  you are not eligible to redeem this offer""",btohqsg
This offer was sent to me via email. Sorry if it‚Äôs not a common promo code üòëIt states that it should work with all Visa cards.,btohqsg

Try their recurring code for 1.85%Or if you‚Äôre new  the one from Chris (HONEYMONEY) gives $30 off fees,btohqsg
Anyone tried? Kris + to pay Harvey using UOB signature. Is this online or contactless. As UOB signature requirement is contaless = apple pay  tab‚Ä¶.,btohqsg

Hi  if my lifestyle spending is such that I can clock $800 through UOB Evol card and having the UOB One Account for the savings wise  is it still worth having UOB evol card with the UOB one Account?With the changed criteria  the maximum I can get is even $30 or slightly more as I don't have much overseas transactions day to day.Should I change UOB One account to another savings account? But I do feel UOB One still easy to qualify for the interest rate. Compares to SCB Bonus saver where have to fullfil criterias such as bill paymentsShould I change my UOB Evol to another credit card? I am confused by the change of the terms and conditions to UOB Evol Cardüòî,btohqsg
yes. your husband is main account holder?,btohqsg
still ok lor 30/800=3.75%. Consider uob one card if u transact at merchants that give bonus cashback e.g. mcdonald  grab  shopee  dairy farm group  sp services,btohqsg
yes  he is. speaking of main acct holder  when i asked the CSO to confirm who the main acct holder is (this is after account is opened for few days)  he said there's no such thing  both names are same 'level'. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but we did tell the bank to put my husband as primary holder when we opened the account.,btohqsg

How much is your estimated spend?,btohqsg
How big ur bill is gonna be? A few k then UOB KF. Less than 2k then UOB lady sol dining + travel,btohqsg
Might be worthwhile calling Hai Tien Lo and ask them whether they allow u to split Kris+ payments,btohqsg
got the $18 cash coupon. Thanks,btohqsg
Not really. U get some ezlink points but the redemptions are not useful.But time and again Ezlink provides promotions so just keep a lookout.,btohqsg

I‚Äôm new to Amaze.. Consider going open Amaze. My spending is like local daily spending less than 1k.. Usually around 700 to 900. Can Amaze be link to PayPal? Using PayPal for USD for some subscriptions. Once in awhile would exceed 1k for big tickets.. What are the Mastercard to pair with amaze? I don‚Äôt really want use Citibank cards. Will be using Amaze on apply pay.,btohqsg
Oh I do buy foreign currency online.,btohqsg
After Oct 1  amaze can only used ideally with Citi rewards master card (maybe ocbc rewards and Maybank too). Not a lot of choices left.And reading ur use case  I don't think amaze is a good fit.,btohqsg
U join amaze at a bad time.Only left Citibank and Ocbc and Maybank works well with amaze.,btohqsg
Hi just wanted to ask a simple question. Currently I have paired my citi rewards card with Instarem. And have converting the points from citi rewards to kris flyer miles. Just curious  what will be the best way to convert the citipoints?I feel that normal cashback with rate of 2.27% might not be that great but Krisflyer seems like a good deal so far,btohqsg
Thks. Finally received the uob lady card yesterday  that is almost 1 week.  Now would like to consult if buy travel insurance  hotel booking  and all the usual overseas spending like tickets for place of interest  restaurant and shopping  they are under the Travel category? Again  thks.,btohqsg
No. Dining related transactions will still be under dining category  excluded transactions will still be excluded.If your travel is from Oct onwards  remember to use the card by itself instead of linking through Amaze.You might want to re-read the t&cs.,btohqsg
Have you checked what's your MAB for Aug?,btohqsg
Actually what is ifast business? I have read in their website  but still not understood  only for business? High networth? Anything for common people?,btohqsg

For new users  who deposit 100k into Cashplus & hold for 90days  does it mean that there is no need to perform the 3 & 8 buy trades at the 3k & 10k level?,btohqsg

His MAB for August will be 805.28- 73.53 =731.75,btohqsg
Just realised the bottom part. So confusing at first,btohqsg
Haha yea. He took alot of effort to type out all the transactions,btohqsg
You need to have 731.75  + 500 for your MAB for this month. Ideally put in some buffer,btohqsg
I'm going to assume that your spreadsheet tracking is based on the transactions on your OCBC app.You need at least $1318 in your OCBC 360 account from today onwards to be able to meet Save criteria.,btohqsg
For those using Cardup  may I know which are the cards being used ?,btohqsg
You can go to CardUp's website for the list of eligible cards. Their calculator also can give you the reward amounts.,btohqsg

I am considering a hotel banquet and hence it is a big ticket spend. Is there a good advisable card for this use ? I am open to miles as well as cash backs.

Hi all  existing Vicom cardholder get discount when going for car inspection still ?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt use for 9 months. Thinking wan to use for this last quarter because I seem to be spending quite a bit on the bonus category merchants like Shopee and grab. But dunno if can get fee waiver or not,btohqsg
I think yes. I went recently they tried to get me to sign up saying annual discount.,btohqsg
Then it‚Äôs shaky. Make sure annual fee month is not before your payout month.,btohqsg
They seem to have included a min spend requirement for this discount at vicom  hence asking here for confirmation.,btohqsg
It will definitely be. My last quarter ends Nov so payout in Dec which is when I will get charged my annual fee. So better not to use ?,btohqsg
Must be very precise.What date is your payout and what date is your annual fee.Because if payout and annual fee date is the same.Eg 2nd December. Still can make it.U can spend the Cashback awarded. Then cancel the card. (For Uob ok  scb no ok),btohqsg
Cap at $60. Account only can open between 18-26,btohqsg
Does car servicing counts towards crmc x10 points if paired with amaze?,btohqsg
Hello all. What is a good miles card for single big purchases (5k and above) locally?,btohqsg
What are you buying and do they allow split payment?,btohqsg

1 time then just whack amex plat charge signup bonus. Maybe qualify for 10x too.,btohqsg
Do challenger do split payments ( not installment )?I am also puzzled or only certain shops do that ?,btohqsg
get 4mpd in $5 blocks only if mcc is whitelisted for online transactions,btohqsg
Challenger can split payment if not crowded.I split my payment when I bought a single unit of iPhone I think $2000.Just be careful Uob ppv has problems being recognised at challenger for rewards if u use applepay.,btohqsg
Ya. You can be clearer on ur requirements then we can give better recommendations,btohqsg

If already have 100k committed in the account. Can we then do $1 x 8 times cash plus subscription to fulfill the 8+3 trades?,btohqsg
Lol so weird  classified as fast food...,btohqsg
This should be the most accurate  esp if you use master card to pay.,btohqsg

How often do you exceed? I personally I'd get another 4mpd card.,btohqsg
Used Amaze to txf $ to msia acct b4. The fx rate n fee is displayed before confirming the transaction. So can use it to compare with alternatives. If got amaze points or promo to offset  fees  it may‚Ä¶ be worth it. Can consider top up to tng using yt and then using tng to txf to biz.Bank txf=giro  duitnow=paynow/fast.

Hi gurus  can i ask if there's any credit cards out there with benefits for payment of digital ads like fb/ig?,btohqsg
Yes your calculations are correct. You should include $1318 daily from today onwards.,btohqsg
Not all policies can be paid using cc for GE,btohqsg
Thanks! Well noted and great info. Hadn‚Äôt been paying using their app. My insurance are 40k a year. Easily can meet their Maybank tiering.But if I go through AXS does it count for spend for the Maybank platinum cashback rebates? I just activated my card,btohqsg
Yes well noted on this too.Older policies I believe can‚Äôt be done,btohqsg
Yes. But worth a try first,btohqsg
I think crmc and other general spends cards can earn miles. Can you check mcc for those transactions?,btohqsg
No. Must direct. Else can use CardUp.,btohqsg
Maybe restricted based on type  not age. I‚Äôm servicing one from 20yrs ago,btohqsg
are there any better ways to check the mcc other than using instarem amaze?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm talking about those ineligible are those my parents bought for me when I was a kid- pay for life kind. I‚Äôm in my 40+ üòÇSo I think 30+ years or more policies,btohqsg
Depends on both. Certain type can pay with cc even if older. But certain type can only pay if commenced after a certain date. And certain type cannot pay with cc.,btohqsg

But this month I don‚Äôt see it in my transaction even though I‚Äôve spend for my selected category in Aug,btohqsg

"Finally opened my webull app and pleasantly surprised that the 3% special offer had been deposited to my account....HOWEVER as the USDsgd exchange is at an all time low (1.29)  inclusive of daily interest and 3% bonus  I'm still at at a principal loss! (~ -0.39% loss)And this is before converting usd to sgd which will result in commission fee and further negative losses aka lose more capital!Lesson learnt; don't be blinded by the ""generous"" offer  don't rely on a single source for info...It's esp heartbreaking as all my savings (6 figures) is in USD and I may need to redeem and exchange to SGD soon because of personal commitment (wedding housing etc)Sighhhh üò≠üò≠üò≠",btohqsg
Take it as lesson learnt. Fx fluctuation is always a risk.,btohqsg
i never did any webull before..but i tot there was an option to do the SGD version (or was that a past promo).,btohqsg
WeBull CSO said the promo was only for USD so I exchanged sgd to usd,btohqsg
And I read the T&C again which states that sgd is also applicable.... they shared that their cso gave the wrong info and compensated me with 200usd,btohqsg
Even with the compensation+ daily interest+ 3% special bonus  I'm still at a capital loss,btohqsg
yeah must read the TNC and understand the risks when doing lohi myself also kenna from SNACK.. just to get $80 capita vouchers.. i bought $4k of SNACK.. now down $200,btohqsg
Sharing the incorrect info by WeBull CSO  horrible horrible horrible!,btohqsg
actually did u try asking for more than USD200 compensation?,btohqsg
Minimally to cover the FX commission rate both ways,btohqsg
if you can prove that you intended to put into SGD  but were misled into putting USD  i think you have a case,btohqsg
Yes  as shared in the screenshot. And I put in almost the MAX amount to take advantage of the promotion (got greedy)  so my capital loss is quite substantial. Haiss....,btohqsg

"If I use my DBS credit card to bill payment another credit card  I know it does not earn rewards. Does it count towards annual fee waiver?Meta AI seems to think soWhen using your DBS Vantage Credit Card to pay another credit card bill  the transaction is considered a ""Funds Transfer"" or ""Payment to Another Card"". In this case:- The transaction amount WILL count towards the annual fee waiver spend requirement.DBS Bank typically requires a minimum spend amount (e.g.  SGD 25 000) within a specified period (e.g.  12 months) to qualify for an annual fee waiver. Since funds transfers or payments to other credit cards are included in the total spend amount  using your DBS Vantage Credit Card for such transactions can help you meet the spend requirement and potentially waive the annual fee.Please note that terms and conditions may change  so it's always best to confirm with DBS Bank directly or check your credit card agreement for the most up-to-date information.",btohqsg

Why would you trust meta AI?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs more of I googled and couldn‚Äôt find a proper answer so at least this AI give me a basis to work on. Hoping the experts here can help.,btohqsg
Don't think it will contribute to AF waiver,btohqsg

They mentioned that it will be credited this few days. I will monitor first  otherwise I‚Äôll call them again,btohqsg

Which part of snack TNC was misleading or is it better I search your old messages?,btohqsg
I never said I was misled.I said I losing more than the benefit.,btohqsg
Hi Casey  is supp card spending tracked separately or they appear on the main card account?,btohqsg
Don't say that.. you are not greedy and it's normal to want to maximise returns.Can understand how you feel. My experience is with moomoo where different CSO can give different answers..,btohqsg
Scb shows both main and supp card spending together. Quite stupid actually.,btohqsg
I've cancelled my sup cards as there is a weird situation where you can't do credit limit review online if you have sup cards. They need sup card holder to acknowledge and signBut for online transaction it actually will ask you otp to send to which  main or sup,btohqsg
Thanks very much for the replies Casey and MT. I really suspect cannot both use at the same time because how will SimplyGo track it if it ties to the same unique card number?Nonetheless  I will try to call CS tomorrow to find out for sure. Hope they don‚Äôt give me wrong answer üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Everybody expect interest cut this month  it shall drop. Are you still in lock in or crawl back period?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still within my existing home loan fixed period  but I can do a free reprice anytime from now on. That‚Äôs why for me it‚Äôs not a question of whether it‚Äôll drop  it‚Äôs how quickly and how much SG rates will respond to US drop  which will factor into whether I wait to reprice or just pull the trigger now,btohqsg
Anyone here used Choco Finance up to 20 K ? What's your view ? Do you get daily interest ?,btohqsg
Likely the reprice rate that bank offers to customers who are still in lock-in/crawl back(reimbursement) period will be higher than market rate. Bank unlikely to offer those customers(in lock-in or crawl back(reimbursement) period) with market rate or lower rate. Let us know if you can get market rate or lower.I presume you know what is the difference between lock in period and reimbursement period.,btohqsg
Yup there are daily returns. Of course impt to remember its not a bank so there may/may not be long term guarantees but for what it is at the moment  its like a good add on / supplement to a ocbc 360 / one account or the stashaway simple  given its 4.2% annualised,btohqsg

Overseas spend is 2.2mpd on altitude & 5399 doesn‚Äôt seem to get anything on the other cards on promotionhttps://www.singsaver.com.sg/campaign/dbs-credit-card-livefresh-altitude-posbeveryday,btohqsg

Lol he mentioned stable dividend of 6% which can get every month kind.. then I got spare cash so not sure if I should go for this fund... Sound like this fund is not a good choice? üò≥,btohqsg
Did he tell u admin fee? Fund maintenance fee? Etc,btohqsg
I think is 3% by the bank,btohqsg
And there is yearly management fee. I got told 1.45% pa. üòÖ,btohqsg
You do a simple maths. How much already makan by the bank?,btohqsg
Dividends from investments are never consistent depending on economic conditions. Also  capital are not protected. What happens in bad times? If the fund went down in value  I don‚Äôt think they can do anything. Are you prepared to take this volatility?,btohqsg
Ahh I was told the dividend will be based on the sum I put in  though there charges n fees.. so say if I put in 50k  it's dividend based on that?,btohqsg
Then if bad times come  your fund drop to $45k  your dividend will be lesser based on $45k. Did they highlight this to you?,btohqsg
Yeah it will fluctuate.. I tot 6% dividends sound okay? And stock/bond will also drop when bad times?,btohqsg
yes. recently thinking to payback some amount for my premium financing and RM also mentioned PIMCO instead so as to offset the interest rates from financing of 4+%,btohqsg
The problem is these RM promised the sunny days. What happens if it is rainy days  stocks go down and dividends down? So are they prepared to cover for your shortfall? You can ask around to know what you getting into. It is not a bad fund I said but know what you getting into.,btohqsg
Yeah true.. definitely there will be bad times,btohqsg
Throw them the hard questions. It is your hard earned money you parting with.,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the advice... If otherwise  any good investments for spare cash or for wealth growth?,btohqsg
Yup great minds think alike haha,btohqsg
At my peak i had 32. It was a mess. Technically there shouldnt be a limit.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt offer a good advice to you as my profile likely to be different from you. Other than High Yield Saving accounts  my portfolio of earning passive income comes mainly in reits and banks. The moment to invest into them has passed. We are just riding on the winds of expected interest rate cuts. So maybe others can advise you.,btohqsg
Not financial advice. For myself  im putting money in ocbc and uob high interest saving acct then srs into s&p 500.,btohqsg
U use SRS to invest into s&p500?,btohqsg
Is it a wrong thing to do? üòÖ,btohqsg
$20K is good  any amount above $20K not so worth liao,btohqsg
Nah not saying wrong.. cos I just put into FD.. s&p500 sound better though,btohqsg
again please do your research. Start with the youtube link i shared earlier. Many options are better (with capital guaranteed) for srs.,btohqsg

Hi All  can I check if OCBC 360 Account is taking ‚Äúcurrent month average daily balance‚Äù? I have SGD 120 510 inside but I withdraw 20K out  yesterday so should I empty all out? I remember 360 acc  can‚Äôt perform withdrawal.. but 2nd Sept .. I did top up 510 as part of requirements. Tq in advance,btohqsg
What are trying to do? Empty out or 500 save criteria?,btohqsg
To earn interest 4.05%..500 save criteria alr fulfill but i perform withdraw. This account can‚Äôt withdraw else interest will drop üòÖ (that‚Äôs what I understand),btohqsg
What do you mean save criteria already fulfill? Are you depositing back the 20k later today?,btohqsg
Good morning everyone  may i ask What is the best credit card for big item purchase?I am currently an owner of Citi Rewards Card + Amaze for my daily spending (except transport and big tickets).,btohqsg
Do you understand how to calculate ‚Äúmonthly average balance(MAB)‚Äù? Perhaps google it first n understand how bank use it.,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt figured it out yet  Still in exploration phase  I have Chase Sapphire Reserve from the US that has been serving well so far  However Cardup charges additional fees for non-Singapore issued cards.,btohqsg
But 11k spend a month? If yes  card up will help you waive annual fee for dbs vantage. Personally i think its worth it.,btohqsg
How big? And what are you buying? Where are you planning to buy it from?,btohqsg
Thanks  Yes  11K is the spend  Singapore is expensive ü§ê,btohqsg
Under $10k/ annual. Electronics and furniture. Online,btohqsg
Check Citi smrt if it works for u,btohqsg
No. I will not deposit back so I am thinking I should not earn any interest tis month if my understanding is correct? If no interest  i should just empty out and move to other bank üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi like to check does salary credit for uob and dbs savings still working ? through fast transfer from another bank account.,btohqsg
If compare to last month  confirm lower this month since I withdraw 20K out alr,btohqsg
Every month either 1st day or 2nd day.. I will deposit $510 as part of saving criteria,btohqsg
no point doing so if your MAB this month will not be 500 higher than MAB last month,btohqsg
Your decision a bit late.. already 9 days into the month. Why don't just keep $120510 inside? And I don't think $510 is enough to meet the save criteria since you only deposited on 2 Sep.,btohqsg
no save component but have other components. See if it is still worth it to keep or move to other bank,btohqsg
Ya there are other components so may still be worth it. Can withdraw down to MAB 100k (or even 96k),btohqsg
Chocolate Finance returns me 2.41 on 9 Sep with bal of 20002.11 ?,btohqsg

Haaa haaa am just curious. Never had more than 2.31.. with balance hovering around this amount,btohqsg
Once u have more than 20k  it will be subjected to the performance of the chocolate finance investment. You are lucky to have more. Got ppl went negative before,btohqsg
Ah I see. Let me monitor and check the next couple of days and see the daily returns. Tkss,btohqsg

Hi Gurus of UOB one account. May I ask how much could we trust the progress bar of the UOB TMRW app for CC spending? If it meets  means 100% meet?Will it on end of month decide that some transactions are excluded and then reduce the amount spent?,btohqsg
if it says met  it is met. I have never had it cancel anything on me. It lags behind your actual spending btw,btohqsg
Instarem rate vs youtrip rate  I think require spending on instarem to see the rate,btohqsg
Very accurate. If you suddenly refund something and it brings you below the minimum before the end of month then can't help you already.,btohqsg
Amaze rate is marked up against mastercard rate,btohqsg
youtrip has better rates than Amaze. People use the Amaze way to earn miles. up to you,btohqsg
Amaze+card better if can earn more than 2% or equivalent on the cardif not Amaze wallet is comparable to youtrip,btohqsg
does CRMC has cap limit of $1000 for 4mpd earned on foreign currency if pair with Amaze?,btohqsg
Yes. 1k cap is for both local and overseas spends combined,btohqsg

Do u mean pay insurance using OCBC CC consider eligible spending?,btohqsg
"@StellaRilakkumaand I are trying to clarify. When you mean the ""same""  i suppose u mean the 360 account and ocbc CC has the same set of whitelist and exclusion criterias  if they dont earn ocbc points  they dont count as eligible spending (unlike uob one acct and uob cc has their own set of different tnc). My understanding correct?",btohqsg
ocbc 360 card spend bonus interest has same exclusion as card rebate/points,btohqsg
Hi all  UOB ONE Credit Card user here... Does anyone know how to calculate the amount of spending needed to get the $20 cashback/rebate?,btohqsg
Hi! I like to also ask about the giro arrangements for the cashback. Does it matter if it is an e-giro arrangement? Or I need to submit a giro form with my signature that have been registered with the bank at one of its branches?,btohqsg
Hi uob gurus  for uob one cc  if you expecting cashback for the quarter for this month  does it means you have to spend $500+cashback for this month to be eligible for the next quarter?,btohqsg
is this the additional bonus cashback?,btohqsg
Where's this $20 from? Additional cashback merchants?,btohqsg
no  cashback has no bearing on spending required,btohqsg
As long as it's not a self initiated GIRO through HSBC app/website. eGIRO requires you to initiate through BO app/website while postal requires you to send through the BO. Latter requires signature on HSBC EGA. Both are eligible.,btohqsg
Ok Thanks so i just maintain my spending at $500 no need to take into account of the cashback. üôè,btohqsg
This is UOB One Debit Card.,btohqsg
Then got difference between cash rebate and cashback?,btohqsg
Hmm but you see ah  in July I only used the UOB ONE Debit card to pay some investments amounting to $300Everything else  I use the UOB ONE CC... I just wanna learn how it all adds up,btohqsg
I think you have to be clear on your question.If you're eligible for cashback  the statement month after the eligible statement quarter will receive the cashback. You don't have to be eligible for the new statement quarter to offset your spending with the eligible statement quarter cashback.If you plan to be eligible for the new statement quarter  then you have to continue to meet the spending criteria for that statement quarter.,btohqsg
My RM told me egiro cannotIs it a new change?,btohqsg
Your RM is wrong that's all,btohqsg
Ok let me rephrase my question. I will be getting my uob one quarterly cashback for the Jun-Aug period. I was asking since the cashback will come in Sep statement  do i need to spend the minimum $500+cashback amt to be eligible for Sep-Nov quarter. Cos i worry that the cashback will set back my $500 spending to below $500.,btohqsg
Maybe I misunderstood your wording the first time.Cashback is cashback  spending is spending. Both are separate. Like what Trazora said  cashback has no bearing on spending required.,btohqsg
Np thanksüëç  appreciate the explanation from both gurusüôè.,btohqsg
Guess you might want to check with CSO on the difference. The cashback is clearly the one advertised with a cap of $20. The cash rebate might be something else.,btohqsg
Anyone can open hsbc EGA online? I can't because I have a hsbc credit card so I went to the plaza sing branch and it was a 2-hour wait time to see a hsbc financial advisor! I can't wait this long during my lunch break! Any alternative?,btohqsg
take half day leave... it is worth it,btohqsg

yeah still down.. wanted to check if my Claims are credited.... can't login,btohqsg
Anyone knows why hsbc has this weird rule to go to a branch to open account? I guess most other banks use online singpass to open account...,btohqsg
they have lousy FATCA information issue,btohqsg
I did ask the branch staff she just said this is the rule lor,btohqsg
if you have ZERO stuff with HSBC.. you can open HSBC EGA online.. but u will fail the GIRO setup due to no signature.the moment you have credit card with HSBC.. due to some FATCA information reporting issues  you are flagged as incomplete customer information and cannot open banking account,btohqsg
Wow thanks so much for this insight,btohqsg
I did via Zoom after indicating interest on the EGA website. But the bank officer took 2-3 weeks to contact me and also the account opening took a further 10 days!So it was a rather long wait but I didn‚Äôt need to wait at the Bank,btohqsg
For giro setup you need to go down to the bank anyway to provide signature,btohqsg
From my experience  it's faster than opening acct. Just tell the reception you are there for signature. They give me a form to sign and that's all.,btohqsg
Talking about EGA account  I just kena $3 fee for banking in a cheque. No bounce so I‚Äôm wondering why.Anybody else can corroborate on fees for banking cheques into the EGA account?,btohqsg

What does EGA cash back for credit card mean? I understand the cash back for GIRO payments but I have been getting small streams of a few cents and I always wondered where those came from.I only have one credit card with HSBC  Live+,btohqsg
I thought they don‚Äôt pay cash back anymore on their HSBC credit cards? I did setup auto deduction for the card through EGA.,btohqsg
You mean for eg can pay citibank credit card via HSBC EGA acc & get 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Those I can reconcile. It is these weird ones.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm new to HSBC EGA as well. I‚Äôm also trying to reconcile their credits to me.,btohqsg
Guys  conversation with HSBC CS. Time to look at HSBC cards a little more seriously,btohqsg

And 1sgd for UOB One? üòÇ,btohqsg
I met salary + Save + Spend,btohqsg
How many categories did u get for this amt? And how much was ur Aug MAB?,btohqsg
I open my OCBC on 1 Aug 2024,btohqsg
Salary + Save + Sped MAB 101 000,btohqsg
Something is very off. What are the individual amounts for ur each salary/spend/save for Aug?,btohqsg
for some reason ur salary credit didnt trigger,btohqsg
Salary credit on 25/8 is 2060 Credit Card Spend 1 600 Save 501 total balance 103 420,btohqsg
Don't know why the interest is low,btohqsg
Considering the EIR is 4.6% if meet all criteria of salary spend save should get 387,btohqsg
2060 is real salary or u ownself transfer?,btohqsg
either the transaction wasnt coded as SAL or it wasnt paid through a corporate account,btohqsg
EIR for save and spend works out to be 176,btohqsg
Was paid through a corporate account  I need to check the salary code though,btohqsg
Likely the company didn‚Äôt use the required methods,btohqsg
By corporate  the company I work in,btohqsg
Actually it's from a Corporate Account . OCBC can't seek the company to change their code mah,btohqsg
Their system cannot detect is from a corporate account ?,btohqsg
it has to fulfil 2 conditions:1) from a corporate account2) transaction must code as Salary Payment,btohqsg
u can check the salary credit transaction on 25 aug if it shows SAL,btohqsg
Try calling ocbc on your statement it will appear 3 line items if u met the conditions. I got mine today.,btohqsg

Hi can i ask where can i check what is my UOB lady current category?,btohqsg

Must citi Rewards be paired with amaze on all transaction to earn the bonus points?Can you use citi Rewards by itself w/o pairing to amaze in Google/ Apple pay digital card and still earn those online purchase Rewards?,btohqsg
"You can also report any fraudulent charge on the card itself and get a replacement card.Have seen people stating difficulty with disputing fraudulent charges on Amaze.Hope you're tracking your spending closely and not exceeding 1k SGD spend on Amaze  especially if you're linking it with other cards.On the other hand  Citibank cards are highly prone to BIN attacks  your ""extra layer"" wouldn't help since they directly attack on the card and not Amaze.Nonetheless  as long MCC not excluded  it'll earn rewards on CRMC.",btohqsg
No and no. But read up the t&c sent by JT.,btohqsg
I see...will be more carefulThank you üôè,btohqsg
To best way to be more careful is to read both CRMC and Amaze t&cs in full.,btohqsg
After fujian gang  banks are very cautious. So it‚Äôs very normal to get this sort of requests. Just provide everything they ask for if u want to continue your relationship with them.Bank has the right to terminate relationship anytime without providing any reason.,btohqsg
Citi froze my account for 1 month already,btohqsg

It‚Äôs so easy that my Fujian cousin in Suzhou also can open a OCBC account to do money transfers to Hong Kong.,btohqsg
Not in Malaysia. Maybe too many scams in Malaysia already,btohqsg

Do you mean the expiry date is the cc pts expiry since the card validity is 5 years or is it 3 years? Sorry that i forgot to mention that i hold the card for more than 10 years so if you are referring to calculate back 3 years it won't work for me.,btohqsg
can i use citi rewards card for transport? ie using as my bus card or buying concession with it? saw on their website i can get 10x points for ride hailing  this means i would have to for example book grab and pay with this card? or can i top up using this card?,btohqsg
Hi. Is it possible to stack rewards/cashbacks by paying though ShopBack linked with Insta.Amaze which is linked with eligible Credit Cards?,btohqsg
yes for grab can use crmc directly. for buying/topping up/use as bus card  won‚Äôt get anything 10X with crmc/crmc-amaze,btohqsg
thanks for response  so to conclude only if i use to directly pay for grab i will get 10x points the rest of the examples i listed all will just be 1x correct? but are all these considered eligible spend for the singsaver bonus?,btohqsg
hailing (grab  gojek  cdg as far as i know) can use crmc directly and get 10X. if u use amaze can also but will eventually eat up to that 1% fee if ur local spending is >1k per calendar month.simplygo tap using crmc/amaze-crmc  top up concession using crmc/amaze-crmc willNOT GET10X. only get 1X.so yes you are right.not sure about singsaver cause i have no experience in that. maybe the gurus can chip in!,btohqsg
icic thanks for your inputs!! appreciate it!!,btohqsg
by any chance does anyone know if i buy items from those F1 pop up store using CRMC would that count as eligible spend for SingSaver promo bonus? if pair with amaze will i get 10x points?,btohqsg

They should be eligible for the promo bonus. I will say use amaze for the Pop up purchase to get 10X.,btohqsg

hey guys  if i use amaze (linked with citi rewards) on apple pay do i still earn 4mpd or do i have to use the physical card?,btohqsg
Maybe u can get other 4mpd card for local then CRMC + Amaze for overseas.For citi premier with amaze is 1.2mpd as it charge as SGD in Citi statement.Don‚Äôt think CRMC and citi premier can stack together. U will see CRMC as points system  citi premier directly as miles.Hope it helps to clarify some doubt :),btohqsg
Amaze on Apple Pay will get 10X(4mpd) as long it‚Äôs not under the standard exclusion list,btohqsg
so which card should i apply for? üòÇ,btohqsg
If u more than 10 years. Then I guess u have to contact Citibank to check safest. Can do live chat Loh,btohqsg
