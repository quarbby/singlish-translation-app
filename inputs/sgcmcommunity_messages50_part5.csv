Objective question. Assuming 2.5l for both models  between Vellfire and Alphard which would you choose as an owner driver for personal use (not private hire etc).Looking at the two between PIs and Borneo  I cant see a sizeable difference between the two but appreciate any thoughts feedback etc from the group here.Have a good Tuesday,btohqsg
i think vellfire looks nicer in my opinion haha,btohqsg
i know not a lot of ppl think so but unpopular opinion hehe,btohqsg
none . just buy a van .. if need alot space,btohqsg
honestly  idk the diff sia HAHAHA,btohqsg
fuel price go up means less cars on the road?,btohqsg
Prepare jelly cans  go fill up petrol now,btohqsg
Thanks Shane. Would be good to hear,btohqsg
Toyota stop Vellfire production.Alphard sells better due to its Majestic front grill. More pricey too.Vellfire is cheaper.Get it before it gone.You can always install the Alphard front grill bodykit outside.,btohqsg
Thanks Aaron. Pricing I note VF price differential. Do you know year of VF last production? Is this global discontinuation or just export (but still ongoing with JDM Vellfire?),btohqsg
Japan stop.2022 announced stop.Now model are all 2018 facelift model.,btohqsg

Fuel company neeed to spent money to built oil rig and such 1,btohqsg
If margin keep going down is pointless,btohqsg
Best way is to increase petrol price,btohqsg
Let said Singapore for example now got 4 k ev   means 4 k less car go to petrol station.,btohqsg
Then day will come when it hit 100 k car,btohqsg
Gov not yet find a good way to tax people for EV and encourage adoption at the same time,btohqsg
It is growing   and every growth is a lost of income for these company,btohqsg
So it a very simple thing with ev on the rise and esg   petrol price will just go up in the long run,btohqsg
And don’t underestimate the take up rate,btohqsg
The road tax for entry level ev is 1000 plus nia   and got 45 k rebate what else they want lol,btohqsg
