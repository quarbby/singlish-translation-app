Just curious  for miles chaser  is it reasonable to own about 5 to 6 miles cards for different purposes?Daily expenses except Travel  I use citibank rewards linked with amaze up to $1000 for 4mpdFor next $1001 to $2000  I use HSBC revolution for dining  transport  groceries  online purchases (via contactless or online) for 4mpdFor big ticket for travel   I use DBS woman world master up to $2000 for 4mpdFor overseas big ticket  I am thinking to sign up OCBC 90n for 2.1 mpd since such purchases are less frequent  so points with no expiry stands out for me.For local big ticket item  I am thinking to sign up OCBC Titanum awards for 4mpd for online and offine but downside is points valid for 2 years (24 months) only.,btohqsg
We have to balance between the number of redemptions we have and the Type of spending we spend on. You‚Äôve got a pretty good to do list for spending.,btohqsg
For 90% populations  3 cards can get to 95% optimal miles game in Singapore. But then you factor in sign-up bonuses from here and there  there are reasons to own more card for churning  basic ROI evaluations. It's all coming down to ROI  ability to keep track and do frequent ROI calculation.,btohqsg
applied for it thru myinfo via their website yesterday... approved immediately,btohqsg
I did that. Not sure y taking so long. I called HSBC and they said they are reviewing.,btohqsg
Assuming used up Amaze+crmc  can consider Amaze+uob prvi mc for overseas big ticket. 0.7 less mpd but save on 3% fx fee.ocbc titanium only covers a limited list MCC,btohqsg

What payment options are available in eSAM for MOE schools?,btohqsg
Hi all. I read somewhere that SC Smart card don't earn point for macdonald app. Only earn point when doing in Store payment.  Can I use Citi rewards for Macdonald app?  Does it earn 10X rewards?,btohqsg
I have the same problem  been waiting for a month and chasing them  haven't received any follow up yet  they just keep telling me they will get back to me,btohqsg
Hi. Can I link my Maybank fnf card to amaze so I get the offline retail spend to online and get the 8% cash back,btohqsg
I think is totally reasonable as long as you can budget your spending well and always do your calculations and maintaining expiry of points and all i myself have citi miles  citi reward  hsbc revo  uob ppv  dbs woman  and both ocbc tri card.the main idea is that  as long as you know what ur doing tho for me i would not suggest doing ocbc 90n for foreign spend due to the bad rates and 3.25 fcy.So i will still tag amaze with my citi miles As for ocbc titanum  if u have a big expenses or u always shop taobao shopee lazada and other etc which u can read the list  it's really good  just a reminder to be in Blocks of 5 And always remember is to maximize the specialise card that is v hard to hit first   then use the easy card like amaze tag with citi reward.,btohqsg
not to forget i also have krisflyer acend card   but i only use to for welcome bonus. and dbs attitude for the lounge visit or if my travel hits limit on my other 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
Is it worth it to take the foreign currency fee to use the cards overseas for 4mpd or to use revolut/youtrip to save on the fees? (extra outside of amaze crmc),btohqsg
Paying CC visa for 4mpd is about 0.81 cpm. But if u use amaze card u be paying about 0.3cpm assuming 1.2% spread. Weigh it accordingly I guess.,btohqsg
Promo overValid from 15 July 2020 to 31 December 2020,btohqsg
Yea I meant after amaze cap is reached. Technically since it's less than 1.5c  it's worth it right? It seems like it makes sense but seems most ppl are against doing it. Vs using cash from money changer (x spread?) or revolut  I'm just wondering what are everyone's thoughts on that.,btohqsg
Is Paying through app consist online payment?,btohqsg
how do you derive that amount tho,btohqsg
don't forget there's a 3.25fcy also.,btohqsg
Yes can. The MCCs will stay the same when converting to online.,btohqsg
Yup McDonald's app should be considered online. So can use citi rewards for 10x rewards points.,btohqsg
For electricity bill  which bank offer more cashback?,btohqsg

Hello  can i check if anyone knows for tbills auction through cpf OA  roughly how many working days does it take to reflect on our cpf statement after results are out,btohqsg
Better rate than ganeco or seneco?,btohqsg
Let's say $100 with fcy does it mean I'm spending $103.25? So $3.25 spent on 400 miles  doesn't that translate to 0.8 cents paid for a mile? Am I calculating it wrongly? If each mile is worth 1.5 cents to me  it's pretty worth it no?,btohqsg
What's the best Cashback credit card to use for online shopping eg. Shopee taobao,btohqsg
I think people already mention KrisFlyer ascend card. I use it for education (e.g. udemy  CFA) and private hospital (specialist clinic) expenses and other commonly excluded expenses. You can consider if you have such needs,btohqsg
Hi! For the citi cash back card  do i need to spend $800 every month to enjoy the 8% cashback or spending $800 every alternate month will also qualify for the 8% cashback? TIA!,btohqsg
