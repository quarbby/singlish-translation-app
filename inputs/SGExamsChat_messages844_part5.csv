Syria has a russian military base  would be interesting to see what happens to it,btohqsg
not good news for middle east and the world,btohqsg
do you use more of the letter Z or S  when it comes to conjunctions? cause i don't really bother so much about logically collected data from statistics surveys done in general,btohqsg
it's more of a generalized observation from myself ig,btohqsg
like in terms of social internet texting  messaging alike,btohqsg
texting is just short hand etc but like,btohqsg
certain words like “lift” are inherently british,btohqsg
i mean the european side not so good either  a month ago germany disbanded their govt..now recently france as welltheres a bunch of chaos in many countries worldwide..tough world its becoming,btohqsg
and also it’s like even if we text informally,btohqsg
what we know as correct grammar is british,btohqsg
for me bc i’ve edited articles on an american website before im v used to switching,btohqsg
if you consider the so-called grammatical rules of british as well  then obviously what u say applies,btohqsg
because i was mostly referring to a lot of informally done texting over the virtual world of social media,btohqsg
i mean if you want you can consider sg as having its own form,btohqsg
that's cool  though usually i generalise very specifically in terms of subjectively speaking as well,btohqsg
if i add myself as reference,btohqsg
mit has a survey where you fill it in and they can guess p accurately what type of english you speak,btohqsg
people love to assume (for my case la)that im somehow narcissistic,btohqsg
and yes sg is one of them,btohqsg
for me they guessed american before sg bc of my experience,btohqsg
so like our grammar is kinda all over the place but our vocab is very very british,btohqsg
as for myself who I consider to be very involved in terms of creative writing  i had to do the test at least 2 times to get Singaporean English detected from that survey LOL,btohqsg
"Is ""time to makan"" english? many used them",btohqsg
yea it was a temporary situation but it showed major cracks within the french govt,btohqsg
They really guessed singaporean as the first choice,btohqsg
I thought my English was pretty standard,btohqsg
Somehow mine was1) Singaporean2) Australian3) US black vernacular,btohqsg
all these happens while gen z is still trying to gain a footing in society,btohqsg
actually  a bunch of the people born in the late-years of the millennial era as well  aside from the average gen z youths,btohqsg
Your third guess is my first one...,btohqsg
Does this mean I am allowed to say the n word,btohqsg
The third one they put my dialect as scottish lmao,btohqsg
i remember it was around 1996 to 1998,btohqsg
coz some people consider being born 1998  a gen z,btohqsg
plz let me stay forever 12,btohqsg
Adulting is hard but I get to eat ice cream,btohqsg
There's a age range grouping that says millennials is 2004 and below,btohqsg
ya  it gets a little inaccurate sometimes,btohqsg
or like in terms of inconsistency,btohqsg
there's no so-called official listed years of the different generations,btohqsg
Actually range for Gen X and Millennial is too large,btohqsg
in another 10 yrs  it doesn't matter,btohqsg
there is a term Zillennials which i believe is between 1986 and 1997,btohqsg
Gen X 1965 to 1975 Millennial 1976 to 1985,btohqsg
i don't consider myself an adult,btohqsg
so is my friend forever 20,btohqsg
wah shit.. how many years  already sia? more than 3-4?,btohqsg
Good Luck and All The Best to those receiving their N Level results!,btohqsg
