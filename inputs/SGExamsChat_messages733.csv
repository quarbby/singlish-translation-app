YOU KNOW YOUR COUSIN 7 YEARS OLD ALREADY GRADUATED WITH FIRST CLASS HONOURS WITH 10 PHD IN MEDICINE,btohqsg
Depends on the collective responsibility part. Parents are responsible indeed but there's only so many times u can blame poor parenting,btohqsg
What do yall get hit by,btohqsg
Probably because the separate school would not yield the same opportunities,btohqsg
Some parents cannot accept the diagnosis and expect things to turn normal,btohqsg
im surprised i haven't read any cjc pregnancy posts on the subreddit so far,btohqsg
I tryna find the acjc girl,btohqsg
And things like abuse or even sending them to mainstream schools happen,btohqsg
It isn't but to the parents it's a sink or swim kinda thing cuz u would either integrate them or keep it separate forever.,btohqsg
But she act she not from acjc,btohqsg
oh the one who crushes on her ell cher ah,btohqsg
i may or may not know her,btohqsg
But i must say to qualify to pathlight / mainstream JCs  it means they are high functioning,btohqsg
i know several ell ppl in my batch,btohqsg
omg i saw the girl with the white cap walking around with the ac rugger too shes really pretty i wanna know who she was,btohqsg
you can't say a school is trash and then go no offense 💀,btohqsg
ok yijc is a trash school,btohqsg
Got this cj baddie keep appearing in my tiktok,btohqsg
Bro they give me this topic for CC3,btohqsg
lmao..that is what trending is fir,btohqsg
ive seen countless xmms insta reels on insta..and their accs are public..follower counts below 300,btohqsg
Can i ask how y’all are very sure it is autism and not something else,btohqsg
Let me bring you back some memories,btohqsg
the algorhitim have not hit them yet,btohqsg
Ability to work in team is not a requirement 💀💀,btohqsg
Ok i can understand how it feels la but i think Singaporeans in general lack empathy,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSFx2W1Tm/this is the first video on my fyp 💀,btohqsg
you have schizophrenia  autism and mental retardation?,btohqsg
and a fear of acjc girls,btohqsg
Btw uk that there are also normal people who are free loaders right,btohqsg
i hate the fact that we didn't get paid for carnival,btohqsg
Lol there's only sm parents can do,btohqsg
classmate submitted this for my module final graded assignmenttask was to create a portfolio layout using adobe. do you think he has autism?,btohqsg
this isn't internship this is slavery,btohqsg
Just saying bro the diagnosis ain't so clear cut one.,btohqsg
I thought it was a charity event,btohqsg
welcome to the real world bitch,btohqsg
insta comments going to get wild on this,btohqsg
"""i thought slavery was only for blacks my n""",btohqsg
It likely is  look at how the JCs affected were just all the government non IP JCs  nothing else.https://mothership.sg/2017/04/ex-nmp-calvin-cheng-makes-the-point-about-the-jc-mergers-that-no-one-wants-to-talk-about/,btohqsg
It ain't even a fucking spectrum sometimes the line between autism and other disorders frequently changes over revised DSMs,btohqsg
kuro's entire identity is being old,btohqsg
and getting triggered when group work is brought up,btohqsg
he actually had because if it was a normal student  he wont have passed that module,btohqsg
that submission failed 3 main criterias for the submission,btohqsg
"From the article""The Government may need to avoid sounding elitist but I don't.Birth rates have fallen and in choosing which JCs to close  one has to go with the least popular JCs. That is  the ones with the highest cut off points. Elite JCs are highly competitive — there will always be more demand than supply.Merging Hwa Chong and RJC is thus a ridiculous idea.Why the new JC Eunoia? It's not a normal JC. It is being set up as another elite JC to take in IP students from several elite secondary schools - Catholic High  St Nicholas  SCGS.Civil servants won't be able to give you this reply of course. But it's the truth.""",btohqsg
you cant say that to a submission like this,btohqsg
when not a single criteria was even made,btohqsg
they finally shut down the ip system through fsbb 30 years later,btohqsg
Oh ya talking about PW  how were you exempt from the PW requirements,btohqsg
criteria was color coordination  docummentation and must show symmetrical elements,btohqsg
Auto exempt if u can proof u can't even do it,btohqsg
that submission had none of the 3,btohqsg
Im a bit confused coz they seem to be doing 2 things in opposite directions,btohqsg
Oh I thought IP will still continue to exist in IP/IP and express only schs,btohqsg
there was no color coordination..no color palette,btohqsg
and there was no symmetrical elements anywhere,btohqsg
And someone’s advice for me ‘the only way around it is to be an elitist ur own’,btohqsg
"""we don't want elitism""also government:INTRODUCES THE IP SYSTEM",btohqsg
Yeah sometimes CC speaks the truth even if ppl hate him lol,btohqsg
But I rmbr him ranting about hawkers not accepting non cash payments,btohqsg
nope because he would have failed,btohqsg
It's pretty hard to fail a mod.,btohqsg
Actually i hv been annoyed by the ip thing,btohqsg
i mean if you dont submit anything,btohqsg
you still have a possibility of passing,btohqsg
It was started a year before i p6 i think,btohqsg
he did..just nothing that was wanted,btohqsg
yeah  you can't just give students the easy way out by not taking o lvls 😭,btohqsg
Then yes but u can submit gibberish and u might still pass with a D-,btohqsg
also  ip affiliation is only to certain jcs,btohqsg
why can't there be affiliation to other jcs like acjc  asr?,btohqsg
I think this makes sense coz the ip wanna just go elite jcs,btohqsg
government is doing the complete opposite of what it's supposed to do,btohqsg
"Another quote""MOE says that they chose the JCs to merge by geographical spread.This is PR spin. But PR spin has to be believable. As many have pointed out Hwa Chong and NJC are right across the road from each other.It is obvious that the JCs chosen were the least popular by cut-off points. There is nothing wrong with that. So just admit it instead of spinning an incredulous story.Note: someone has messaged me to point out that all 8 are non-IP non-mission Government JCs. Which explains inclusion of Anderson.""",btohqsg
No lah. Saint Andrew’s is Christian missionary sch,btohqsg
Cj ac and sa are Christian,btohqsg
"but you see the module was a art module..he submited game screenshots to faci..that had 0% of anything to do with the mod itselfthe faci literally asked him infront of the whole class ""who's game you playing? your dimissal or your time?""",btohqsg
that's why ip stream is stupid,btohqsg
you can only go to elite jcs  which is literally elitism,btohqsg
ive always knew rp or maybe even other poly would give special cases for people with special needs,btohqsg
Bruh it was april my o lvl yesr when moe boomed this bad news,btohqsg
because there is noway 2 known special needs students are now y3 poly students,btohqsg
when they dont even know basics of design..as a y3 design student,btohqsg
But erm ip is ofc to elite jcs?,btohqsg
both dont even know what is a colour palette,btohqsg
but you can't just get free admission into an elite jc just by looking at your psle score,btohqsg
Jesus  Kuro. Listen  if you really wanna do this with your life you have to believe you're necessary and you are. People wanna live like this with their elitism and big fuckin' egos they can't even managed  then you're necessary. The only reason they all get to continue living like cunts is because we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and then the whole world gets really fuckin' fair really fuckin' quickly and nobody actually wants that. They say they do but they don't. They want what we have to give them but they also wanna  you know  play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from. Well  that's more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow  so fuck 'em. Fuck normal people. You know  the funny thing is  tomorrow if all of this goes tits up they're gonna crucify us for being too reckless but if we're wrong  and everything gets back on track? Well then  the same people are gonna laugh till they piss their pants cause we're gonna all look like the biggest pussies God ever let through the door.,btohqsg
you need to separate elitism from meritocracy,btohqsg
How did it make you feel. But at least for 2018 admissions all the COP rose thanks to the merger  so it was easier to get into a better sch,btohqsg
It's too much work to fail a student,btohqsg
Coz i was 12 and asr was 12 and coz i bet on tjc as 1st instead coz i dw go merger,btohqsg
yea im just highlighting there could be favouritism to special needs..but it feels real unfair ngl,btohqsg
The world is hypocritical fuck just look at bedok that little shit,btohqsg
Well with net 12  should’ve just gone with asr,btohqsg
what is your main consideration when choosing a jc,btohqsg
At least i hv 1/2 my cert MJC,btohqsg
is it its reputation or its distance,btohqsg
But at least besides your pw and GP the rest of your tm experience seemed fine,btohqsg
Wait nett 12 right not raw 12,btohqsg
Actually will there still be balloting if the sch is ur 2nd choice,btohqsg
At the end of the day it's just a funnel arbitrary deciding if students are smart or not,btohqsg
It was my 2nd choice  i think i tried appealing also (i cant rmb),btohqsg
Ohh ok  thought it must be first assuming you just meet the cop,btohqsg
And bonus point same as last person admitted,btohqsg
what? so you get into ip and slack for the next 4 years?,btohqsg
2nd choice got ballot anot ah,btohqsg
Or is it only given to 1st chocie,btohqsg
lol how to slack if they mess up they have to retake psle,btohqsg
Yeah there’s some ppl who dropped from IP cos their gpa not good enough to continue on,btohqsg
And now there is a what now ‘common paper’,btohqsg
My class had someone from chs ip dropped to o levels then end up a levels did badly,btohqsg
"you can't just say ""oh he's/she's an ip student he/she will cfm do well for Os if he/she had been in the express stream""",btohqsg
What makes you think they didn't retain some innate form of understanding even before.,btohqsg
Wished i just put asr as first,btohqsg
yk there are ip dropouts that did shit for Os right 💀,btohqsg
But i heard the proportion of people who enters the sch at the last cop is damn low,btohqsg
Hard to tell if it would’ve went better tbh,btohqsg
No my point is that then the measure is fucked up,btohqsg
But at least for GP it would’ve I guess,btohqsg
It could boost my chance of entering asr a lil,btohqsg
Because u are rewarding those that slack off and last minute just do well cuz innate ability,btohqsg
that's psle bro  but how would we know if an ip student is STILL ACADEMICALLY STRONGER than an express student come the o levels?,btohqsg
I mean if you had gone to asr instead of tm,btohqsg
But then again proportion of ppl entering at the last cop is v low,btohqsg
since they don't have to take Os,btohqsg
Oh I can just ignore the rest because meritorious as it is I made it,btohqsg
you can't compare y1-4 results with the freaking gce o levels,btohqsg
It is coz the merger did not went well (which is something I obviously would not know when applying),btohqsg
ok ykw i have the sticker for you,btohqsg
I think merger basically screwed over all the merger schs,btohqsg
I don't even get the point of exams and rankings,btohqsg
Yeah but u have to recognise that the system we created ain't exactly fair too,btohqsg
But I guess asr still better than tm  it’s just that in particular for you  since your grades at tm turned out fine at asr it might have been worse,btohqsg
Im not sure if it is consistent across all mergers but tm has a disproportion of teachers fr tpjc,btohqsg
Like you may not have had that magic Econs cher,btohqsg
With lots of drawbacks which we will or are already experiencing,btohqsg
but when you say you don't want elitism you have to put in action. but clearly our learning system hasn't until fsbb. and the implementation of fsbb did not completely solve the problem yet,btohqsg
Oh well that sucks. It’s just like how at asr the srjc chers pull things down,btohqsg
Erm i think we should not look at it that way coz my magic econs cher was fr tpjc,btohqsg
There is the issue with sinkies like bedok. Let's make this clear. This is a white paper we identify issues that require solving and let decision makers solve the issue,btohqsg
Ok but on average I’m guessing mjc departments would’ve been better,btohqsg
If we don't even identify the issue then they won't even know,btohqsg
I can only speak for that few subjects i take,btohqsg
Then u have kids like bedok just saying cry about it as if that's gonna change shit,btohqsg
i do agree that psle being what allows people to bypass o levels completely is a bit meh bc you're 12 when taking that test,btohqsg
but blaming it on elitism is just,btohqsg
I can safely say that math and the sciences  defo mjc has a better department  econs  tpjc has a better department,btohqsg
i think it's more like blaming the learning system rather than elitism atp,btohqsg
Yeah tbh it's the separate but equal system,btohqsg
My dad knows a pe teacher there and he said students were measuring the projectile angle they need to kick the football,btohqsg
i started doing calculations with my bowling,btohqsg
Reminds me of that TYS qn,btohqsg
yes that's why i agree with that part,btohqsg
Gp i dunno coz i dunno who fr where lol,btohqsg
I mean my first lesson and I summarised the events of WW1 and got told to sit down so there's that,btohqsg
She took another 6 lessons to cover the same shit,btohqsg
It is not a ‘lesson’  it is student’s own thing,btohqsg
what's the next merger of jcs,btohqsg
I wait and see if it will be NJ and HCI  RJ and EJ  or will it be a JPJC + YIJC,btohqsg
That would probably involve merging IP JCs,btohqsg
imagine if they merge cjc and sajc tgt cos gvt ran out of options 💀💀,btohqsg
vjc and njc merger would be interesting,btohqsg
Anderson serangoon tampines meridian junior college,btohqsg
I propose a SG Open University,btohqsg
lol imagine the number of government non IP JCs go down to one. Cos all 4 left merge together,btohqsg
The SC must be v stressed during morning assembly,btohqsg
Jurong pioneer yishun innova junior college,btohqsg
just make an anglo chinese university which prevents gangsters from entering cos they aren't acs boys,btohqsg
Not rlly what I mean along the lines of UKs Open University,btohqsg
They won’t retain the names of the individual JCs at that point,btohqsg
Just come up with an entirely new name,btohqsg
Na just have 1 SG JC,btohqsg
sg will run out of jcs after the mergers 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
They will say ‘need to cherish every sch’s identity’,btohqsg
imagine they merge acsi and sji 💀💀💀,btohqsg
Then u have like 200 classes with balloting,btohqsg
I mean for sec schs they normally don’t do that during mergers so moe would just find some other way to appease ppl who are angry about the merger,btohqsg
I mean it's bad but eh. Means u can just go in and out no questions asked.,btohqsg
interesting  but the east will run out of jcs,btohqsg
Ok right people say they merge these 8 is coz they are ‘newer’ and ‘less history’,btohqsg
imagine tmjc merging with another jc like cjc 💀💀💀,btohqsg
Should just merge YIJC with MI or create a 2nd 3 year a level course sch,btohqsg
Education should be fluid and not so fucking rigid haizz,btohqsg
atp just make one jc for every part of sg,btohqsg
Poly can only LOA for like 1 sem,btohqsg
Like that moe can lower the JC entry score to less than 20 raw,btohqsg
east  west  north  south and central,btohqsg
If not they kick u out,btohqsg
they are definitely not beating the allegations,btohqsg
But CJC is really far away fr tmjc tho,btohqsg
They can slowly lower it to 17 first then maybe later 15 raw,btohqsg
atp i am interested in seeing a yijc revival,btohqsg
I was told I wasted 2 years at RP as if I just was doing it for the cert,btohqsg
or convert yijc into a poly,btohqsg
Well they should tbh  my history cher also think 3 years for a levels should be a bit more common than it is now,btohqsg
Most of the yi students can’t cope in 2 years  the entry requirements are just a bit too lax,btohqsg
Yeah but it should be more common,btohqsg
But removing it will do more harm than good,btohqsg
Dawg not to shit on yi but do uk their 90rp rate is sibei low,btohqsg
I think the requirement should be lowered to raw 17 at the very least,btohqsg
yijc merging with mi would be interesting though,btohqsg
I think the requirement is in net,btohqsg
Yea so why would mi merge with yi,btohqsg
i think a 3 year course in yijc would appeal more ppl to enter yijc instead of gg poly,btohqsg
I mean to reduce the no of JCs if merge,btohqsg
Na I suspect its just the rigidity of it,btohqsg
If not make YI 3 years so another institute is available,btohqsg
I studied using YIs notes before as well,btohqsg
They keep yapping on about structure,btohqsg
Not everyone can afford to travel to Bukit Batok lmao,btohqsg
the east should have 1-2 more jcs tho,btohqsg
Which I mean ig from stem it working but humanities u don't just do that.,btohqsg
merging into 1 east jc is kinda stupid tho,btohqsg
Eh hm in a sense yea but either way it'll benefit them wat so what talking u,btohqsg
dhs also if you wanna count it,btohqsg
Now east is just TJC VJC and TM,btohqsg
Nyjc is pretty near the east,btohqsg
but the west is stacked of jcs,btohqsg
DHS is almost east but I would say more south,btohqsg
Dhs is the closest to the city,btohqsg
Like with new TEL it’s literally 2-3 stops from Marina Bay Area,btohqsg
do you think every jc should either have an mrt line to itself or have an exit just outside the jc?,btohqsg
The location is so prime I’m surprised the govt hasn’t acquired it back and shifted dhs somewhere else,btohqsg
Wait why talking about np now,btohqsg
Just as long as have decent transport links is fine liao,btohqsg
some jcs are rlly inaccessible in terms of public transportation tho,btohqsg
Then ya la if its that bad then yes but as long as its not over stretched it's fine imo,btohqsg
I just think our conception is too narrow,btohqsg
then wtv Ur trying to say and reinforce is useless,btohqsg
Bro u cant just overgeneralise like that,btohqsg
Why tf would u even do that,btohqsg
Bro just run it under cool water for 5-10 mins and in that time u contemplate on your dumb decisions that led you to get burned.,btohqsg
I mean scraping it or not just going it is all that matters cuz unis provide more academic freedom,btohqsg
Come I go your room blow the wound for you,btohqsg
If u party often you can use vodka to sanitise the wound or hand sanitiser,btohqsg
I am surprised u don't even have like a small supply,btohqsg
"I mean as an option  yes  but I wouldnt recommend it as a ""compulsory"" thing",btohqsg
But anyways  I have seen people who were pretty much forced to go jc instead of poly come to this school. So I can tell why some of them would feel that way.,btohqsg
But then on the other hand  I do see some of them being hardworking uh  just that kena pulled down by PW.,btohqsg
YIJC and MI no similarity at all,btohqsg
Ok then it should be just merge yi with another JC  or make yi a 3 year a level sch. Merging yi either mi would just be to combine the sch’s resources so that yi won’t be completely dissolved and MI would have more resources. But then again if the 3 year a level route should be made slightly more common  merging would not be the best idea. I think it would be better to just make yi a 3 yr course sch.,btohqsg
why are you guys still debating about a 20 cop jc and an institute that uses the r4 system LOL,btohqsg
they should just be gone at this rate  like what@ticktockisaclocksaid,btohqsg
I feel like throwing up every other day,btohqsg
U are hving nausea like almost every day,btohqsg
I think u should visit a doctor,btohqsg
How do u get use to vomiting,btohqsg
When i hv nausea  the more i walk  the more i will want to throw up,btohqsg
Then i remembered i was in the mrt stn then i just wait for everyone to come pas  hide in a corner to throw up,btohqsg
I'm no doctor but Sounds like you lack adequate food or you have not been sleeping with a full stomach,btohqsg
Idk im used to feeling like shit everyday,btohqsg
I think she mentioned she eats in the morning,btohqsg
Is the feeling of throwing up everyday and only when u go to sch?,btohqsg
And for how long it has been,btohqsg
Im guessing it is psychological related coz i do hv some sort of similar thing where the symptoms is just associated more w sth than other things,btohqsg
Lack of sleep sometimes leads to nausea  I encountered that nausea b4It usually occurs at the front portion of the brain,btohqsg
But do u actually throw up,btohqsg
I havent thrown up since 2022,btohqsg
Then what is the feeling u are experiencing,btohqsg
Is like the feeling in your stomach that is very 不爽,btohqsg
those schools get their trash rep for a reason,btohqsg
Trash or not i dun think it is a good idea for them to cut down anymore JCs,btohqsg
If anything it will just be a further move towards elitism,btohqsg
Coz my gastric comes w nausea too,btohqsg
Than actl wanting to throw up,btohqsg
How can it be I thought that’s for pregnancy,btohqsg
I certainly don’t think that’s the issue,btohqsg
Some songs make me calm down and not want to 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬,btohqsg
For me my psychological symptoms were masked by the fact i just recovered from covid and i tot it could be covid,btohqsg
Bruh I need that yt yarn boy gif,btohqsg
But i realised it is kinda psychological,btohqsg
I spoke to the doctor for 45min lol luckily there were no patients behind me,btohqsg
Most certainly not especially since you said the issue has been around for quite a while,btohqsg
Yea I think if im pregnant i will know,btohqsg
But what the doctor told me was i need isotonics and it is due to my bp💀💀,btohqsg
No bruh not only pregnancy hv morning sickness,btohqsg
Tho there is this pregnancy induced nausea and vomiting,btohqsg
That is certainly not the case,btohqsg
If you are on the boat maybe you will feel 🤮🤮🤮,btohqsg
Like some ppl just like that in the morning,btohqsg
Me thinking im pregnant aft having nausea despite me having no contact with males whatsoever,btohqsg
Hmm is there any known cause,btohqsg
This is overthinking  there are a lot of causes to nausea vomiting ranging fr migraine  indigestion  motion sickness  psych and all that,btohqsg
Wait peko do yk about the gss in my class,btohqsg
It is similar to motion sickness  something related to imbalance in the brain,btohqsg
Anywy hes not a guai shu shu,btohqsg
Js some guy i had. apast with,btohqsg
Like when i sit on the floor last time during assembly  i come up i will feel giddy,btohqsg
So i need to slow mo,btohqsg
Aint that cause rush of blood,btohqsg
I actually love my parent’s reaction  he come and tell me ‘vj v lazy start at 8’,btohqsg
Coz mj starts at normal time amost same as sec sch,btohqsg
Wait ur brother is in vj right,btohqsg
Oh for dhs is standardised across the 6 years,btohqsg
But the guy in my class is always late,btohqsg
Last time he was not late he was always early and then we will play together,btohqsg
Hmmm i was always missing detention by 1 late coming,btohqsg
now when i see him i want to throw up,btohqsg
Last time morning assembly when singing the national anthem/school song I keep wanting to fall,btohqsg
Oh btw my ct say we are too quiet in terms of singing,btohqsg
There was once it was only week 3 and i was like SHIT i alr 4x late,btohqsg
My ct said my class late coming is ridiculous,btohqsg
We used to play amogus together,btohqsg
It was only in july j2 that it wined down lol,btohqsg
I need the 6.50 bus and sometimes it comes at 7 or later,btohqsg
In my sec school there was once the boys had 80% of attendance  in the last minute 80% of the girls in my class turned up. The year head held back those girls for briefing,btohqsg
That is so opposite of what i would expect,btohqsg
Like literally out of 17 girls at 8:29  only 2 girls was present,btohqsg
8:30 everybody is told to stand,btohqsg
My class only had 8 guys,btohqsg
The guys were always the more obedient ones in my class  even the worst of guys turns up with 5mins to spare,btohqsg
I remembered in j1 they showed the top 5 late coming classes,btohqsg
And my class bar chart was the highest,btohqsg
I cant sing so i will not sing too loud,btohqsg
The only person signing was my principal everybody else literally kept their mouth shut,btohqsg
The teacher entered by the back door,btohqsg
There was once i wanted to do tt but it was locked,btohqsg
Walking another few metres v tiring,btohqsg
No it is coz i do kinda hv low bp,btohqsg
Every JC should be have both 2 years and 3 years and features POA and MOB,btohqsg
I cant imagine mugging for 3y,btohqsg
i mean make both 2 years and 3 years for every JC,btohqsg
Long long long ago  there were 2 three-year centralised institutes: Outram Institute and Jurong Institute; they merged into MI,btohqsg
That was … 20 years ago?And there were even more CIs besides those two but were closed,btohqsg
if failed J1 transfer to 3 years class,btohqsg
Nah not all. But I agree that commerce stream should be expanded to a few JCs at least and not just restricted to MI,btohqsg
If the students in RI and HC can get like 30% 90rp they’re coping fine  it’s just that moe should tighten the requirement for JC,btohqsg
What I mean for the 3 years is if failed J1 transfer to 3 years class,btohqsg
We can see what a shitshow yi is,btohqsg
last time commerce stream is not offered in jc is cuz there were too many accountants,btohqsg
what i mean is if failed J1 transfer to 3 years class,btohqsg
i mean thats abit extra no?,btohqsg
Wdym? I thought commerce stream was in JCs more than 20 years ago but moe made all JCs stop offering it around the same time MI was established,btohqsg
So that’s why I think YI should be converted to a 3 year institute and then moe lowers the l1r5 entry score for jc to like maybe 17,btohqsg
Oh wow so from more than 2 3 year institutes to one,btohqsg
In 1987 the Ministry of Education set up the first institute  Outram Institute  to offer three-year pre-university courses on a centralised basis. Outram Institute prepared students for the GCE 'A' Level Examinations. Initially  it concentrated on commerce subjects and had only the commerce stream. The arts stream was later introduced to the school. In 1989  Outram Institute was the first pre-university centre in Singapore to offer theLondon Chamber of Commerce and Industryexamination  on top of theSingapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Levelexamination.,btohqsg
I’m not sure if people are willing to make an admission that they had been “wrong” or “too idealistic” about the max L1R5 for A level track all these yearsMoreover  decisions are made in the spirit of allowing multiple pathways of success (although the unintended outcome could be pathways of delulu for many),btohqsg
Had the only commerce stream as of 1987? Then I suppose if my JC teacher was right  commerce was eventually expanded to JCs for a while cos she said her JC had commerce stream,btohqsg
It was stopped even before MIA few batches my seniors had Commerce and MI hasn’t happened by the time I cleared my A level,btohqsg
Seletar Institute(Chinese: 立德高级中学) was established in January 1988 as Singapore's second centralised institute.Jurong Institute(Chinese: 裕廊高级中学) was formed in 1989 as Singapore's third centralised institute.Townsville Institute(Chinese: 城景高级中学) was the fourth centralised institute established in Singapore to offer a three-yearcurriculumleading to the Singapore CambridgeGeneral Certificate of EducationAdvanced Levelexamination.,btohqsg
Yeah  but tbh a 3 year pathway to the same exam is not very much different. By retaining the requirements for the 3 year centralised institute(s) but tightening the one for Jc  absolutely no one is being restricted from taking A levels in Singapore I guess,btohqsg
Wow  so it went from 1 to 4 and then back to 1 really quickly,btohqsg
It says OI only had one stream at the start,btohqsg
Closure of Townsville and Seletar InstitutesWith a fall in demand in three-year pre-university courses in favour of two-year junior college courses  Seletar Institute witnessed a rapidly falling enrolment  to 130 students in 1995. In November 1995  the Ministry of Education announced the closure of Seletar Institute and Townsville Institute owing to the rapidly falling enrolment  from 3560 students in 1993 to 2328 students in 1995. Both institutes ceased the intake of first-year students in 1996  and ceased operation in 1998 with the graduation of its final batch of students.On 26 July 2003  decision was made public by the Ministry of Education on the merger of Outram Institute and Jurong Institute to conglomerate the sparsely organised three-year pre-university institutions into a single entity.[2]This move was to allow consolidation of expertise and teaching resources of the two institutes  and provide students with more customised programmes and facilities  thereby enhancing the delivery of the three-year pre-university education programme. As a result  Millennia Institute was established on 3 January 2004.,btohqsg
I think the decision makers have the data they need regarding popularity for 3-year institutes as well as overall number of students who qualify and want to go on the A level path,btohqsg
I’d like to think they made data-driven decisions,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately we don’t. But we can see the students in yi clearly aren’t coping well because the results are worse than MI  despite MI students having worse o level results,btohqsg
So at least a level performance wise for each sch we have a rough idea,btohqsg
With options  it is back to the students and parents to make the best decisions for themselves,btohqsg
Yeah I understand they’re different  but ultimately to me as long as no one else is restricted from taking As  and the results are likely to improve with this move  there’s nothing to lose,btohqsg
Some delulu parents will just force their kids to go to Jc even if they don’t want to and can’t cope with the rigour of a 2 year course,btohqsg
If the decision makers remove options based on this  then the tables will be turned and they can get accused of depriving optionsIf the students and parents make the decisions to not take up less than ideal options  then the decision makers can rethink options by saying “dwindling popularity”,btohqsg
Additionally  the decision makers have also made available many more uni and uni spots,btohqsg
Yeah I guess they’re in a tight spot  but if they had the courage to do the mergers  I guess they can surely try doing what I suggested and see how it  goes. They can also float trial balloons to see whether the public is generally supportive of it  and I definitely do.,btohqsg
Mergers are an outcome of dwindling popularity and overall population for the younger cohorts. I think it is clear what can drive decisions: needs and popularity,btohqsg
if failed J1  transfer to 3 years class.,btohqsg
Another week  Let the afk intern grind begin,btohqsg
They probably will need a new JC in Tengah,btohqsg
Yeah I suppose  but from what I’ve seen  I think that yi shouldn’t just continue to exist in that form and it should be abolished or just converted to a CI. Beyond providing more choices to those with a raw l1r5 of close to 20 (like maybe 17-20 range)  those who end up going there whether they like it or not see worse outcomes than those who went to MI. Every decision will have their tradeoffs and to me the tradeoff of restricting ppl with a high l1r5 from going to JC in turn of increasing the likelihood of better results is worth it,btohqsg
Aren’t all JCs just 2 years? Unless you’re saying that you got transferred to MI,btohqsg
It is sad but my friend fr yi shared that some of the std were forced to end up there  it is q sad,btohqsg
I feel like in such cases the students know better but their parents are overbearing,btohqsg
I mean they should do this,btohqsg
Based on my impression of some of the (potential) decision makers through some brief interactions … I don’t think “poor performance” will make them “remove options”I think “waning popularity” willIf it is “poor performance”  I think the decision makers’ advice will be for the institutes to buck up,btohqsg
Then the students can’t choose for themselves what they think would give themselves the best outcome,btohqsg
Erm like it is not practical for all schools to run 2 and 3y programme concurrently,btohqsg
Maybe one JC will get shifted to Tengah  rather than to start a new oneA level is definitely not as popular as before,btohqsg
Actually if their parents throw them there nd they are so demotivated  then it defeats the purpose,btohqsg
Btw are u a chem jc teacher,btohqsg
If there is a need to be addressed  I think a shift is more likely than to start a new one,btohqsg
Erm i dun think it is a good idea to cut anymore  the merger of the 8 jcs has done enough damage,btohqsg
I see. It’s hard to tell if YI cop is 20 almost all the time cos of waning popularity or moe just basically forces them to accept as many students as they can so that those who get raw 20 will have the option of going to a JC. If it’s the latter  then I think  that’s alr a sign that they should tighten the requirements for JC,btohqsg
WAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAH the one qn i didn’t want to answer 🫥I was but i am no longer,btohqsg
And u think by making it not there will solve the parental overbearing issue…,btohqsg
Mm yeah I think poly popularity is still rising,btohqsg
Oh so u went into private or,btohqsg
I dun think moe forces them to accept as many std as the demand is…that was why there was a yr it fell below 20,btohqsg
I think cutting by 2-3 points to see how it goes first will work. No doubt it will cause an uproar among parents who want to force their kids to go to JC even if their results aren’t stellar  but eventually students as a whole would be better off,btohqsg
For the most part. Even the times where sci stream fell to 19  most of them who entered likely had one bonus point,btohqsg
But while the bulk of it is what it is  there are ppl who choose YI base on location coz look  there are not many jc choices u hv if u score above 12/13,btohqsg
people look at cop20 will avoid. When the JCs merge  COP of them lowers so those that cannot make it just goes to better courses in Poly like Sciences and Accountancy  leading to lower cop for these courses,btohqsg
ASR is legit not very far away from YI,btohqsg
And u want someone living in north to be travelling to pasir ris,btohqsg
Haha but my plan is to join social work sector in 10 years’ time if conditions allow. See how!,btohqsg
Yes but what is ASR cut off…what if u score 12/13,btohqsg
With the new campus I mean. The old srjc campus is then quite far,btohqsg
I know someone who go yi coz asr rejected,btohqsg
Another option is to overhaul the YI leadership and also still tighten the entry requirements. If LCM and the previous principal can bring NY cop down a lot (same for srjc principal)  I think more can be done to improve YI’s fate rather than to leave the worst ppl to lead the sch,btohqsg
When was the last time YI had a new principal?,btohqsg
Do you think we want (to be seen as) a society where decision makers make decisions for the non-decision makers in this manner?It will take a while but hopefully the younger parents will be more enlightened and wiser about what works and what do not work for their children 👍🏽,btohqsg
They never changed principal since the merger despite all other JCs receiving a new one by now,btohqsg
Ok i dunno the sitution in yi but i dun think it is a good idea to forcefully cut the cop but rather leave it to market forces to decide,btohqsg
Erm i dun think a change in principal by now has anything got to do w the merger,btohqsg
Yeah sg govt is top down  but sometimes ppl in leadership must be willing to make tough decisions even if some ppl do not like it. As for the 2nd para  I rly do hope so but unfortunately ppl’s mindsets would be hard to change.,btohqsg
A principal can be w a school for very long,btohqsg
Yeah still the same old de Silva from innova jc,btohqsg
I think it will be better off to leave it to market forces,btohqsg
To each their own. But if ppl do not know what is best for themselves  govt may need to intervene,btohqsg
It can either be forcefully or nudging them,btohqsg
But it can change  with more information available and with changing expectations. During my era  it was radical for someone with L1R5 < 10 to want to go to a poly. My classmate had L1R5 < 10 and went Nursing and we frankly thought she gonecrazywoke,btohqsg
YI is there ok i mean there is a portion of ppl who are forced to go there by their parents  but it is also a hope for some others who screwd up their Os,btohqsg
Like for the diabetes issue  we try to nudge ppl away from consuming sweet drinks through all these campaigns as well as making use of salience bias by assigning grades to drinks. We don’t force ppl to limit their sugar intake,btohqsg
It is the parent’s responsibility to do what they want for their children. How does govt intervene on that,btohqsg
YIJC atmosphere needs to be change,btohqsg
Yeah it’ll take time. We’ll just have to see I guess. I’m not sure how moe came up with the number 20 as the requirement to enter JC a long time ago  but at least with the data we know  students in MI perform better than YI,btohqsg
I actually admire those who are really passionate about it,btohqsg
20 could also have been an arbitrary number set a long time ago when not much data was available on the performance of the students. But moe did not tighten the requirements even if the data suggests it would be overall of benefit to do so  for fear of backlash.,btohqsg
So if it’s past time to do it  just do it imo,btohqsg
They might have decided based on comparison with other countries  especially those whose population take O level as well  and countries that are seen as direct labour competition  as well as have had input from consultants,btohqsg
If im the Govt I will just leave it to market forces but perhaps ensure YI still get sufficient resources and good leadership,btohqsg
That classmate of mine is doing really really well right now. If you join CGH  you may get to hear her name haha,btohqsg
But i honestly dun think it will do any good by removing yi or lowering the 20,btohqsg
Yeah  since we do not have much historical data on the performance of local students. But now that we can refer to our own data  we can make decisions that are more informed,btohqsg
I see. At least I think one thing we can all agree on is that de Silva needs to go,btohqsg
After the introduction of IP  there was also suspicion that raw L1R5 = 6 may not be as “6” as before,btohqsg
Wdym? Like it’s less prestigious/ easier to achieve given that the pool of students who did the best in psle are no longer competing with others during the o level exams?,btohqsg
Guys jn my math teacher said the most illegal thing ever,btohqsg
Not less prestigious but may be easier to achieve given the cohort make-upBut it was also hard to conclude because of changing syllabus and focus of questions have shifted at the same time,btohqsg
No one I knew actually did a thorough comparison and investigation but that was definitely what some people “observed” and “felt”,btohqsg
Not surprising if that’s true anyway. But also up till now we don’t know whether in deciding grade boundaries  moe takes on a similar approach to the uk GCSE whereby they don’t factor in the cohort’s performance and just the paper’s difficulty,btohqsg
In other words the grade boundaries are decided before marking the paper so the number of students getting a particular grade is irrespective of other’s performance,btohqsg
"ok so she wanted us to raise hand then she said ""heil hitler""",btohqsg
Also jn during handball i was goalkeeper and i blocked 2 goals out of like 6 💀,btohqsg
"She was like""guys do the heil hitler pose""",btohqsg
Maybe i am the special needs,btohqsg
I love Biology and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my Biology knowledge and play with viruses so I can make more Biology songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these bacteria to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love biology. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
Draw a book out with relation to O lvl Biology,btohqsg
You not having recess now ?,btohqsg
You may find this website interesting:https://www.lostwomenofscience.org/?mibextid=Zxz2cZ,btohqsg
btw that was a modified copypasta,btohqsg
Is de silva the name of the principal or a made up name,btohqsg
I remembered my math teacher telling the class A levels is probably the toughest 2y of ur life and here im suffering more,btohqsg
A levels is the toughest 2y of study life.,btohqsg
Spoiler alert: tougher years are ahead,btohqsg
Guess who is going to sleep in class,btohqsg
this is called taking care of yourself so that you are able to fight the battle,btohqsg
He kind of looks like he’s on drugs lol,btohqsg
or he looks he did not sleep well,btohqsg
@chemcerI took LD on the wrong day sia,btohqsg

Oh where is the place ah,btohqsg
I've never heard of the term in SCDF,btohqsg
Damn Alot of these cases these days ah,btohqsg
I MCing during hari raya week,btohqsg
Cause I left 3 more week to pop,btohqsg
Also do not exert when u are not feeling well…dun be like me freaking everyone out when i just fell to the floor while walking during pe,btohqsg
It has been years and i still hv the scar,btohqsg
now is bio lecture aka nap time,btohqsg
damn gg leh i wanted to sit aisle so its easier to zao cause i brought my bag then now the ppl behind are damn noisy 💀💀,btohqsg
I hate this sia  i cant concentrate when the whole lt becomes noisy,btohqsg
But aisle wun u get noticed / called out for sleeping,btohqsg
@Ryannnnnnnnnnthe natural selection jokes in sgfollowsall chat is way too good,btohqsg
you should teach us your ways,btohqsg
how the hell do you find such good stuff,btohqsg
@LonelyreaHELP READ THE RP CHAT LOL,btohqsg
My chem cher will not start until there is silence,btohqsg
Sometimes gotta learn to tune it out,btohqsg
I straight up just go and do other work if Cher haven't start yapping,btohqsg
But not when the teacher is already present,btohqsg
That's what I did for chem,btohqsg
There was literally no value my chem cher could add to my lesson that would make me want to stay in class,btohqsg
I was like 4 tutorials ahead or smth (tbf this is just ejc things),btohqsg
The lecture-tutorial pace was so bad,btohqsg
We finished covering the whole chem syllabus by j2 term 1,btohqsg
But tutorial wise we just started on alkenes,btohqsg
My class tutorials is damn fucking behind,btohqsg
Cuz we did one chem chapter per week,btohqsg
Most shld be doing nitrogen compound alrd,btohqsg
Pon every chem lesson that isn't practical,btohqsg
My class still at fucking carboxylic acid,btohqsg
Cher check tutorials go thru so slow,btohqsg
So just decided to take a break,btohqsg
And the worse part is organic chem can literally be simplified into two big areas,btohqsg
I used the time to go try memo the reactions sia,btohqsg
I dun think i had any subjects that are particularly slow,btohqsg
U don't get to play with chemicals tho,btohqsg
And I got a chemical burn,btohqsg
Maybe needa find a cause of this…,btohqsg
Please dun drink chemicals in the lab,btohqsg
There is also a reason why normal water is not to be brought in,btohqsg
But that can be a good sign in a sense that the cher is not forcing things,btohqsg
And adapting to the class pace,btohqsg
Speaking of which i was pleasantly shooked when i got to sit in the HOD class after prelims when classes combine,btohqsg
I feel like I have two feelings: sleepy and high,btohqsg
I don't really have a healthy in between,btohqsg
I am in a bad position to say this coz i too procrastinated seeking help until it became really really bad  but i think u should speak to someone,btohqsg
my parents will just say I'm not eating/sleeping enough,btohqsg
cause after this lecture I have 2h free period,btohqsg
then I want to go outside to buy stuff,btohqsg
It is always easy for them to say these  but ur health (including mental health)  is urs and very important,btohqsg
And it feels like it is going to affect ur acads too,btohqsg
(If u trust ur school counsellor) maybe that can be a starting point,btohqsg
Else there are also ample external sources,btohqsg
Wah ur breaks are really long,btohqsg
Like ur parents are not qualified to talk u out of this,btohqsg
My acads have been going downhill since y3,btohqsg
And by pointing at reasons that may not be it  it can feel worst,btohqsg
And yes y5/6 prolly gonna be worst and there is A levels  now is still early so i think u should try to get this sorted out,btohqsg
that's why I say I'm gonna get PENTA U for A level,btohqsg
Please no  mental health is reversible,btohqsg
Instead of saying u are gonna get badly becoz of this  why not try seeking help from someone trained,btohqsg
I do hv experience w ppl pulling out all sort of wild reasons like what SMA??????,btohqsg
And then suddenly just hyper at night for like 4 hours,btohqsg
It makes me feel way worst and panick mode honestly,btohqsg
I hv been this like ever since completing As,btohqsg
It is important to seek help early so it doesnt get to irreversible state / needing meds for it,btohqsg
And it seems psychological related coz it seems to me that it is happening when u go to sch,btohqsg
I have been like this too ever since completing As,btohqsg
Arent we fr the same As batch,btohqsg
Strangely im always high when i lack of sleep,btohqsg
when bio lecturers leave blanks in notes 🤯,btohqsg
no I like bc of relatable but my notes no blanks anymore,btohqsg
The weather is crazy until im chilling for a bit in the aircon now lol,btohqsg
Something that needs to change is about those who need help dun readily seek help,btohqsg
For some reason I’m always the most awake in class when I didn’t sleep that night  just weird af body things,btohqsg
Your body is compensating for the flight or fight reaction,btohqsg
Me when ns doesn't give me 7h of uninterrupted rest,btohqsg
I was about to @ you,btohqsg
they audit a lot of times this 3 months already,btohqsg
Anyway im legit damn sien everyday esp when i see the 2 girl in my class,btohqsg
cb u run in China road less than 2 mins you kenna knocked by car lmao,btohqsg
Somthing like  tmr I heard got audit  those people going for it....,btohqsg
Then whoever kenna chosen will go,btohqsg
I did one ops day right b4 I Ord XD,btohqsg
I feel very bad cause there only 1 subject I actl feel like studying,btohqsg
then the other subjs I legit dw to do,btohqsg
so later I get A for h2 bio but U for other subjs,btohqsg
what are your thoughts ronald reagan,btohqsg
