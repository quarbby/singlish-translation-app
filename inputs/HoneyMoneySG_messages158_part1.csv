Youtrip really has security issues. Caution to all to only keep balance inside when you plan to use soon. Don‚Äôt just park and forget. Looks like card lock feature is not guaranteed üòì,btohqsg
This should be the same for all mobile wallet,btohqsg
hi  does it count as online transaction if i pay for food via applepay through the food ordering website with CRMC?,btohqsg
Considered mobile wallet transaction with CRMC and will not earn 10X.,btohqsg
thanks and if i key in the card details then will be considered online right?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know why I couldn't register with Amex pay with my highflyer credit card?,btohqsg
Hi  may i know when u submitted the withdrawal?,btohqsg
"Hello I have question if I buy from Krisshop click via Kris+ app and the transaction states ""krispay*krisshoponline Singapore"" does this considered an SIA group transaction from the $800 spend for UOB krisflyer card",btohqsg
Hi  say if im dining and is those order and pay through the qr at the table  previously use crmc+amaze through apple pay is ok  now should use crmc but typed in details rather than apple pay. Is it right?,btohqsg
Ya type in your crmc details.,btohqsg
But for dining when you should tap your phone or card at the reader machine  that will not be considered as online. That why when Amaze got nerf  we will find a card that can replace for dining and shopping not online.,btohqsg
Received an email update from CF  but mine‚Äôs worded differently,btohqsg
Yes. They will use your USD first  and if it's not enough  will convert enough SGD to make the trade,btohqsg
wow interested added even during withdrawal period?,btohqsg
Not interest. Just some positive  capital appreciation due to ‚Äòmarket movements‚Äô from selling funds. It can be equally negative too,btohqsg
I suspect for this sensitive period  CF won‚Äôt want to further drive down consumer confidence by showing negative returns. Then confirm no more net new customers liao‚Ä¶,btohqsg
agreed. from a consumer‚Äôs pov  this is motivating and reinstates some confidence in CF (once they sort the mess out). If all turns out well their end after this fiasco  I will redeposit again.,btohqsg
do u all receive? i received the email  but my wife CF withdrawal no email yet  although both withdraw same time with few mins different,btohqsg
I got my fund back from CF,btohqsg
Withdrew 10th march 1030am   no email yet also.,btohqsg
According to CF statement  if your funds were deposited recently  it takes a longer time to withdraw as compared to the rest who had deposited their funds long time ago ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Had most of it in since September last year but did some withdraw top up here and there. Maybe they consider the last deposit date only.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok tho hopefully all good since people are getting theirs back.,btohqsg
which is shitty cos they ask you to deposit to confirm mode of withdrawal,btohqsg
also  if you look at transactions under profile  they will show when they sold your investments to send you money. mine shows sold on 11 Mar.,btohqsg
Received mine from CF! Gain $1 phew,btohqsg
Interesting. Mine has sells on 10th and 12th march but the amounts aren‚Äôt anywhere close to what I‚Äôd withdrawn,btohqsg
I deposit hundred on the day I withdraw. So i dont think this assumption valid?,btohqsg
lol no point guessing. Just trust the process and close this chapter üòÖ,btohqsg
Even if you deposit since day one but you recently received a referral reward  you will need to WAIT. that's the punishment you get for referring people,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask if using UOB lady card still can earn 3.6 miles for SPC petrol station?,btohqsg
For online spending  means any online spending  don't need to be the listed MCCs right?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone got use Ocbc infinity with atome before?Tried adding my card but keep saying try again later  but all my other cards no issue.,btohqsg
What do u mean? For HSBC Revo  only the MCCs listed TOGETHER WITH online payment will get the bonus (for e.g. it has to be a 5812 payment MADE ONLINE),btohqsg
Oh I see. Okok thanks. I thought any online spending.,btohqsg
Yea actually pretty trash card lol,btohqsg
I'm still finding an online spending  (not shopping category) card for both sgd and fcy that gives 4mpd. Alr exhausted my Citi rewardsMaybe DBS wcc but expiry 1 yr abit tight,btohqsg
UOB Visa Signature if u can hit the 1k min spend,btohqsg
Whoops mabad  yea online only for FCY at least it fulfills that part ü§£,btohqsg
yea provided can clock min 1k foreign spend,btohqsg
For the UOB Visa Signature  if I use AXS to pay my insurance via that credit card  will it be counted as spending to fufill the 1k min spend?,btohqsg
Mine is SGD but on foreign platform. Partially is foreign spend but just this alone cannot hit 1k. Total add up all online transactions monthly $4k averageBut all is online transactions. Not shopping category. Need a blacklist card  can't do whitelist,btohqsg
Oh  so it needs to be 1k worth of contactless payment in order to unlock the 4mpd,btohqsg
only blacklist 4mpd cards are citi rewards mastercard/visa and dbs wwmc  2mpd there are dbs wmc and chocolate card,btohqsg
1k worth of local spend that are not in exclusion list to get 4mpd for local contactless/petrol,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I know Chris made a video for payment of weddings using credit card for miles  but i believe there are alot changes to credit cards. Could I ask what is a good credit card to use for banquet now?,btohqsg
No problem for me lei. I added the ocbc infinity card after I gotten and activated the physical card.,btohqsg
More or less the same. Only thing changed was amaze + crmc having 1% fee now.,btohqsg
So still UOB Preferred Platinum+ UOB Visa Signature + UOB Lady (travel)?,btohqsg
