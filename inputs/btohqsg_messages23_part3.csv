hi  june bto for singles is the mature non-mature estate thing still in effect?,btohqsg
fml. thought can go for the kallang or tampines one. 2 freaking years. always out of supply. its getting ridiculous. thanks anyway.,btohqsg
The url looks a bit fishy,btohqsg
If not fated with mature estate  means not fated... Apply 10x also like thatüòù,btohqsg
Hi morning Any one have pictures lakeside Bto?,btohqsg
i think got resident chat one,btohqsg
Pr + Sc vs Sc + Sc got difference when it comes to buying bto/resale?,btohqsg
Can find this info on bto portal?,btohqsg
Yeah abit unfair but lol rules are rulesü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Can PM me to join the residents chat; we regularly send pictures inside,btohqsg
tell me about it. also this round still stuck with non mature estates. only upside about woodlands is RTS might be nearby?  all the 2 rm flexi seem to be allocated to old folks and maybe destitute or ex criminals. feb hougang near my parents place. went to MP also they dont give chance.,btohqsg
You can always wait for October launchMaybe can get to apply for Bayshore,btohqsg
Don't knowIf you are keen in PLH  you can buy 2R resale as a single when the Standard / Plus / Prime kicks in,btohqsg
Anybody knows roughly when next month bto will be out ?,btohqsg
PR + SC additional $10K levy. If one day PR become SC or u have a SC child together then 10K will be given back,btohqsg
Just to confirm. If have a PR spouse and an SC child  does this levy still apply?,btohqsg
same situation  PR spouse and SC child  called HDB to check  no need $10k levy,btohqsg
Already have 2SC in the application means no more this levy,btohqsg
U must include the SC child in the occupiers in the application,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong hdb used to offer this type of similar flexible layout bto in the past on selected projects (iirc Queenstown). Good to see that they are expanding the option.,btohqsg
May I know the location area of this Kallang/Whampoa BTO?,btohqsg
Is this the same location? Says June though,btohqsg
No problemAm guessing that HDB is sharing this publicly earlier since there is also Kallang Whampoa in the BTO next monthIn case people who are keen in this zone prefer to try for White Flats  they can wait and apply during the October launch insteadBetter than apply in June and get told about the White Flats only thereafter...,btohqsg
No  it means higher chance of getting any queue number,btohqsg
Any one can advice pls don‚Äôt bomb me   my current address was used by my parents 2 room flexi bto under senior scheme they used my address for ballot 4 yr plus years ago . This end july then they will meet their MOP then I can shift out of the current estate. I wrote in to appeal to apply for June BTO for other estate other than the current I am staying. They said cannot because the rule said 5 years but I only apply result out in July need to wait for it to build Min 3.5 years. If I go ahead and apply are they able to check ?,btohqsg
My advice pls think carefullyBefore using MCPS  no joke they really ‚Ä¶.. I let my parents use mine and now stuck,btohqsg
Don't understand what you are saying,btohqsg
Just try applying for the bto sales launch? At most $10 gone haha,btohqsg
Can cos I am divorce with kid,btohqsg
Not me my parents for 2 roomFlexi,btohqsg
If me  i will just apply and see howPlus  apply doesn't mean will get queue numberI believe that HDB will find out at some point and raise the issue if it still matters by then,btohqsg
Anyone gt tengah garden waterfront unit floor for 2 room flexi blk 209A,btohqsg
You can apply HFEBut for June BTO if you can't apply due to thisSystem will block you automatically,btohqsg
Hi guy can I ask I‚Äôve applied HFE before my wife got PR and her PR just approve last week  should i reapply HFE and will the loan amount change after I reapply?,btohqsg
If system didn't block you from applying June BTO than just go aheadWhen have issues with HDB than say,btohqsg
Hi can I know when the launch will be for the June bto ?,btohqsg
I think you can write into HDB to reassess since your wife just attained her PR status and ask them what documents to provide for loan reassessment,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also wondering about this too,btohqsg
https://mothership.sg/2024/05/no-partition-walls-bto-hdb-white-flatsAnd also@wei_binwho asked about the location earlier today,btohqsg
The deterrent will be the 10 years MOP  assuming this project is classified as Plus or Prime since it will be launched in October,btohqsg
From October 2024 onwardsEven BTO beside woodlands MRT will have 10 years MOP already,btohqsg
Because next to MRT  so at least Plus alreadyIs Woodlands an example or did i miss the news? üòÖ,btohqsg
Have no idea how many % of people that will be~But at least won't really see the BTO there selling for millions like 5 years later,btohqsg
Any issue with having more Plus flats?Standard / Plus / Prime supposedly depends on the infrastructure and amenities surrounding the siteAnyway  my previous comment about the MRT was specifically for Woodlands(i confirm won't say the same about location like Bukit Panjang because that is a forever ulu place to me üòù),btohqsg
In a way  that could be how it worksSay  even within Tuas or Taman Jurong itself  there can be a mixture of Standard and Plus,btohqsg
Sounds like they will evaluate as per each town make up and maybe mark some as more exclusive. Anyways it's just speculation. Wait for OCT launch prices will know liao,btohqsg
Anyone know this june bto for kallang area roughly how many units offered?,btohqsg
Easier to tell only if there is one site near MRT etc and another further away offered in the *same* town in the *same* exerciseLike  eliminate as much of other variables as possible,btohqsg
It depends on what the applicant is looking for baThe October one seems more town-ish but maybe there are people who prefer suburb-ish,btohqsg
Holy lord location is *chefs kiss*,btohqsg
