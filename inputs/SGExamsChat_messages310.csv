I can say....Forget abt local uni if u have private dip,btohqsg
Ppl tAke local dip and a level also may not get into local uni,btohqsg
Cuz can Still go local poly,btohqsg
ITE then local poly is a longer route but worth it in the long run,btohqsg
ITE student here  finished 2 yrs Nitec  now doing Higher Nitec 1st yr,btohqsg
Am hoping to go to local poly after Higher Nitec. However  I am scared that ITE students hv a harder chance of entering poly  as they accept O lvls students first.,btohqsg
Unfortunately  my family cannot afford private diplomas at private school,btohqsg
Dun worry there was the new policy that they are accepting more higher nitec into poky,btohqsg
And ite students have a diff path from Os,btohqsg
Part of the Aspire programme if I remember correctly in 2016,btohqsg
My neighbour is ITE then NP then NTU,btohqsg
No matter uni or not...Local diploma wins private diploma,btohqsg
Heard a lot of Higher Nitec students got rejected for JPAE 2021. Most of the ITE grads who entered poly did so via EAE  as far as I know.,btohqsg
So at least ur local diploma can get an OK job,btohqsg
Not say go ITE means sure go p0ly,btohqsg
Go for the common smth prog,btohqsg
My bestfriend in that course rn,btohqsg
And based on my friend's bf just get through eae GPA 2.5 can go in de,btohqsg
Am looking to go to Information Technology in SP.,btohqsg
Hey guys any opinions of the course business infomation system?,btohqsg
A mix of business and IT and it allows u to go study IT in future,btohqsg
I got some relatives teaching that course in ite,btohqsg
Then how about the business element in it? Wouldn't that be kinda wasteful if can't go smth business too?,btohqsg
it allows u swap between both esp when u pursue uni,btohqsg
for example if you are considering a double major,btohqsg
personally if your more interested in biz just go full on for a biz course  but I warn u the low courses are competitive,btohqsg
Idk? I not their student but,btohqsg
I know alot of their student made it to poly uh,btohqsg
Business can pick up next time if u want...IE. MBA... U can't go from a business dip or degree to IT that easily without stating over,btohqsg
U can always pick up biz in future easily,btohqsg
Actually the curriculum should be posted somewhere om their website,btohqsg
But to do IT in future with a biz knowledge...I think near impossible,btohqsg
personal experience choose what u want :) if your not a big fan of IT i suggest you dont do it  and against IT specialisation depends... some IT do a lot of coding  some do a lot of modeling etc,btohqsg
I would say that IT and Biz are 2 of the most competitve school generally,btohqsg
Agree too .. if u hate coding ..u just hate coding...it's not for everyone,btohqsg
esp  on the accounting side u need to learn c#  sql  and python,btohqsg
also In poly theres this thing known as diploma + or PLP  it allows u to pursue 'mini' diplomas aka minors in other sectors  eg. like IOT  AI etc,btohqsg
IS is not just about coding tho,btohqsg
depends on what u really like :) the popular courses in IT and Bis are generally an L1r4 of 4-9 ish?  feel free to ask me if u want,btohqsg
U can further study business info systems in rp cuz they have a course thr too,btohqsg
IMO  they are using the name 'business' to lure students in to study,btohqsg
E.g. engineering many find it boring  then put 'engineering with business' suddenly intake increase,btohqsg
Somehow maybe students nowadays want to be own boss and do own 'business'. But like what someone said  it might be better to do a full pure course instead of these 'rojak' ones,btohqsg
E.g. say a full engineering course needs say 30 modules.Now to fill in some 'business elements' and to still keep it at 30 modules means some content has to go.So it means as a future engineer those who take the hybrid course won't learn as much as those who take purely engineering.Then want to do business  they also learn only a fraction compared to those who took on a full diploma solely on business.,btohqsg
ps. NP has an interesting program for entrepreneurial business.,btohqsg
its called SANDBOX  they will give u a $5k grant to start your business,btohqsg
if its successful they will give u another $10k for incubator stage,btohqsg
oh no wodner my friend opened a food business,btohqsg
yes they have a cca for budding entrepreneurs and things like that,btohqsg
theres like a prototyping section resevred for them which u can book for free and also many interesting events  like tedex etc.,btohqsg
also u can apply for mentorship programs  such as harvard business club etc. but usually these are also offering to the school of business also,btohqsg
aka a event ppl run to get into uni,btohqsg
yall see any jc tedx on linkedin,btohqsg
see what they like n post,btohqsg
I shall take my leave now,btohqsg
But can you keep piglet as pets here,btohqsg
I just saw someone casually walking their pig outside. Im like ..'am i dreaming',btohqsg
Or this is normal lmao üòÇ,btohqsg

I need to interview low class people for my social studies project,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how you should approach it but ok,btohqsg
prob a better way is to do up a survey form with low ses as target audience ask a few simple questions then ask them to provide contact details(eg telegram user) if they dont mind being contacted for interview smth like that,btohqsg
hewwo i heard discord a lot of low ses people...,btohqsg
maybe can go there ask? uwu...,btohqsg
uwu i heard someone can't do econs,btohqsg
ya can find koushireo in discord,btohqsg
i heard he's very high class one,btohqsg
kou it‚Äôs time to eat your medicine,btohqsg
ya he low ses can find him,btohqsg
It sounds so offensive to call someone low ses ngl,btohqsg
i just said he's a distinguished gentleman,btohqsg
Everyone shud be still be treated the same despite the ses,btohqsg
yea doesnt mean you are high ses you are better than ppl,btohqsg
Do you know where i can ask for low ses people to interview?,btohqsg
U nid a permit//a pass tho,btohqsg
i hope you are not planning to go their homes and ask for interview its quite rude,btohqsg
Like imagine people asking you why you are poor,btohqsg
Now I damn curious which sch got that ss,btohqsg
you should know that income or money related things is a sensitive issue and you should be very careful about asking related qns esp to strangers,btohqsg
ps my brain cells got killed ystd lol,btohqsg

What course do you think i can apply?,btohqsg

My student 5 n I'm even worried he can't go in sci course,btohqsg
With the help of cca points   then i can get 8 points but idt that's enough to go pfp after hearing ur story,btohqsg
I don't rmb cca being applicable for pfp,btohqsg
@chemcercca can use for pfp now mrh,btohqsg
Indallahif uw ICT course go for common ict,btohqsg

I want a stable job HAHAHA,btohqsg
Hahahah cybersec is not good for a stable job,btohqsg
I heard so many scary shit abt comsci,btohqsg
Speaking from a comp sci student pov,btohqsg
What courses do u think provide stable job,btohqsg
Nursing is wayyyy stable than cybersec btw,btohqsg
Cus i very boring person  no have goal,btohqsg
Oh is biz or econs alright,btohqsg
Should i continue w dpp or sec 5?,btohqsg
Btw does biz analytics need code,btohqsg
Idk I can ask my mum for u,btohqsg
How many hours do u spend on comsci btw,btohqsg
And I dun wanna do that anymore,btohqsg
Ehhh q short to me uh,btohqsg
Is there any hybrid computer science business courses??,btohqsg
Poly really sucks at preparing you for exams,btohqsg
Ok zao back later I think,btohqsg
Are u doing 2109s next sem arh,btohqsg
does everyone need to learn python in nus?,btohqsg
cos of the general education modules,btohqsg
Unless you go rich companies that give good benefits,btohqsg
Hi am curious anyone from business admin in NUS ?,btohqsg
Pm me Pls if you are willing to share your experience,btohqsg
But most ppl may opt to take 1 python/computing related module before graduation,btohqsg
I never took a module taught in Python before üòé,btohqsg
if they dont learn python then what can they learn in computing? just theoretical stuff?,btohqsg
One of the many other programming languages I assume,btohqsg
Did u actively avoid it or just by pure luck? Idw take python either,btohqsg
My curriculum is programming 1 in C  programming 2 in Cpp,btohqsg
And then programming languages don't matter anymore after that,btohqsg
If it requires you to use a certain lang you better pick it up yourself,btohqsg
May i ask anyone who was in pfp about their experience in year 0,btohqsg
same as in year 2004 for me üòÇ,btohqsg
this is very true. I picked up python myself during work.And also use the programming methodology to write bots for maplestory back then üò¨,btohqsg
my uni everyone learns python and one mod have to use recursion to write function for tower of Hanoi problem or smth,btohqsg
the recursion concept is hard for beginners,btohqsg
its not like some hard ass chess game,btohqsg
but yea its quite simple to understand compared to some of the later concepts,btohqsg
Everyone keeps talking about it like it's calculus in math,btohqsg
i think even 2d array is way harder,btohqsg
did they teach u all that in python?,btohqsg
[[a b] [a b]] is a 2d array,btohqsg
we only learnt the basics algorithms and some ML,btohqsg
Linked list worse. But im an idiot so ig my opinion carries little weight haha,btohqsg
You will probably learn it soon  if not at a higher level,btohqsg
I feel like if you can master this you are quite proficient alr in python,btohqsg
the remaining u have yet to learn is just higher level application,btohqsg
The idiot part of the linked list part,btohqsg
not sure lol i ended up specialising in some sort of business engineering,btohqsg
or esd in my uni if you want to know the proper word for it,btohqsg
so im not going into csd which is essentially cs and software engineering which will prob teach more in depth about programming stuff,btohqsg
think for me the hard concept to pick up,btohqsg
Anyone knows of a Desu in this chat?,btohqsg
Hiii anyone knows the range of cost of a laptop that the poly is selling?,btohqsg
Uncle think Unsupported User is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
My suggestion is get from outside. Sch sell price tends to be not the lowest in markey,btohqsg
U can always compare price in school and online prices,btohqsg
And your qn is kinda vague because different specs of laptop is required for different courses,btohqsg
If u need for intensive programming etc then they usually require more ram and higher processor speed . So set aside 2k?,btohqsg
