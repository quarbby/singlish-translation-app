Yes if u only want SeptemberYes only valid until September.To get more must do again,btohqsg
I have deposited $2k and 5 x FAST out but did not receive such sms.,btohqsg
It will come although buggy sometimes,btohqsg
Wait at least 5-8 days. Majority of customers will receive but not all will receive the sms.,btohqsg
There was 1 month most of us didn't receive the confirmation sms. üòÖ,btohqsg
GIRO is not fast transfer or paynow. It Will take 1-3 days to show on recipient account.,btohqsg
Given the current interest rates  UOB or OCBC saving account I s better ? Given that I credit salary and can meet $500 spending on dining and groceries,btohqsg
But that was the sms I received on 17 August for the 2k + 5 transactions done in August. I thought this has to be done every month?Anyway  I just kiasu and did again in September.,btohqsg
Can you increase 500 balance a month? If yes  ocbc has better rate. if no  UOB .,btohqsg
But based on the card  UOB One have a better whitelist spending than OCBC rewards ?,btohqsg
You chose to auto convert UNI$. If convert manually can redeem entire balance.,btohqsg
This SMS is from Aug round. For Sep round you will be qualified till Oct.,btohqsg
So based on this sms  will I be earning 4.6% interest on my $100k balance (31 Aug) in September also?,btohqsg
Any idea if I were to port back to OCBC 360 from UOB on the 1st day of the month will I get the interest ? As I recall OCBC interest is credited after salary is credited,btohqsg
From what i understand  3.x% is referenced to a reference month (which is the month before your sms registered). If u registered in Aug  then Sep's MAB - July's MAB = amount that earns 3.x% this month.And for the 1% bonus interest  the incremental is referenced to previous month of each month. So Sep's MAB - Aug's MAB = amount that earns 1% this month.Please correct me if I'm wrong. I also learning. üòÖ,btohqsg
Is there a check box for this or something?,btohqsg
You have to opt in with form for auto convert.,btohqsg
Your interest will be credited next month anyway. As long as you fulfill all the req in that month.,btohqsg

Dear gurus. Saw that this is valid for new card members. Does that mean that if I already possess the citi cashback plus card. Applying for CRMC though this platform will not qualify me for the gifts? May I assume so?,btohqsg

Best to dyor  find the one that seems the most beneficial to you. Important is the value for money. Cheapest does not best  more coverage does not mean value.,btohqsg
Yes the in and 5 out needs to be done every month. When done it lasts 2 months.,btohqsg
Although it just need to be done every alternate month  but i guess everyone dont really bother to keep track  and just sms and do the transfers every month diligently. üòÖ,btohqsg
