Mazda aso not popular in mlysia . should be safe. but EV should be safest steal liao no place charge😛🤣,btohqsg
legend says if they steal ur tires and rims  go nearby shop can find one hahaha,btohqsg
I heard German also safer unless they steal the whole car,btohqsg

Lowered car on air suspension with removable steering wheel,btohqsg
No way to get Jack stands under the car,btohqsg
And can't drive off cause no wheel,btohqsg
Must be a not so popular quick release mech though,btohqsg
Later the thieves very smart and carry a wheel around,btohqsg
My friend's latio on 8 bricks when he came out from massage. One guy approached him and offered 4 wheels for SGD800. He had no choice but to agree and whoa. The guy pushed his wheels out from nearby,btohqsg
they steal the popular cars n dismantle everything to sell spare parts,btohqsg
hahaha this one is obvious la,btohqsg
they won’t sell the whole car cos can track the number,btohqsg
that's y if you drive civic or Vios or Altis. very popular with the thrives there,btohqsg
nobody wants hyundai. it is probably expensive wheels,btohqsg
Too bad Korean cars share same pcd w jap,btohqsg
if they manage to get real BBS,btohqsg
