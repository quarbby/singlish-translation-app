well UK is just personal statement mainly + whatever tests for relevant unis,btohqsg
so it's not that much work tbh,btohqsg
since it's all under the UCAS portal,btohqsg
Though tbh i also cld have attended nus but i decided to not to do so,btohqsg
hmm .. do I need to grind extracurriculars as well (olympiads etc.)  besides achieving perfect academics?,btohqsg
the US requires a lot of extracurriculars,btohqsg
i'm in my 7th year in ntu now. 4 years undergrad -> 3rd year of phd,btohqsg
or you work a bit first then go back to study,btohqsg
Yea but I wld say at the end of the day,btohqsg
Will yall retake on the exact same year when u collect results,btohqsg
No one wld rlly care much abt what jc you go to,btohqsg
Or even what a levels you have,btohqsg
ok for UK it's really just grades  employment history if any  and personal statement. extracurriculars are mainly to help you write the statement since they tend to like those that show off the depth of knowledge and skills you have,btohqsg
from there you can get invited to an interview + any technical tests,btohqsg
Maybe i wld try to retake once,btohqsg
if you dont retake in the same year,btohqsg
i alr registered to retake a levels while in ns before ntu accepted me,btohqsg

then i forgot to get the refund for it,btohqsg
