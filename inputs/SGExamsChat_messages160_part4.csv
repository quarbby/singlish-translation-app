Who cares about Psle when you work?,btohqsg

‚ÄúSorry  you ain‚Äôt hired because score not high enough‚Äù,btohqsg
Cuz everyone gonna end up in the same sec sch,btohqsg
i rmb i got A* A B C,btohqsg
I can't even understand PSLE mathematics at this age. So don't worry.,btohqsg
yea  when i go JC my teacher say they dc about ur o level,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not like you grad from primary sch you can qualify to work,btohqsg
Their teaching in math was so rigid,btohqsg
I wished i could learn algebra in primart sch,btohqsg
O level is needed for UK and some US uni applications,btohqsg
If you do IP they will care about Sec 4 grades,btohqsg
ye my pri sch math alw cannot A*,btohqsg
come sec sch A1 wasnt a prob for a while,btohqsg
And they apparently don't see L1R5. Use percentage of A1,btohqsg
In primary sch my math always get A,btohqsg
i.e.  if 5A1s out of 10  50%,btohqsg
Yup they ask you to enter the grade only,btohqsg
