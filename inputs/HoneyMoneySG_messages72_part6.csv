Bonus uni only come in next month,btohqsg
Sadly amazon is categorized as education,btohqsg
Isit really worth it to pay annual fee for these kind of promos?,btohqsg
Hi everyone. So other UOB One account where we earn 5% EIR  what is the next best account to have?,btohqsg
Shopee is not education i suppose? Been noticing that amazon is the only one with education mcc,btohqsg
Bonus also capped at 1k only right?,btohqsg
if u using uob lady's card  bonus cap for $1k spend posted in calendar monthif u using uob lady's solitaire card  bonus cap for $3k spend posted in calendar month,btohqsg
Just sharing. I have a Trust credit card with credit limit of $1000. I made a mistake of requesting for a credit limit increase to $5000 and declaring I'm not working. They rejected my request  and terminated my credit card instead. Dumb move on my part. :(,btohqsg
HI  I have a payment of over SGD3 000 to make for school fees. May I check if there's any cards that would accumulate miles for such payment?Unsure if it falls within a certain category.,btohqsg
Education mcc usually is excluded for rewards unless u use ipaymy and cardup  pay a processing fee to get miles,btohqsg
Hi all  can I transfer back my sgd from iChange to bank?,btohqsg
Quick check  regarding Miles is this valid?Apple Pay for transport 6mpd - UOB Lady's (selected transport cat)Apple Pay for contactlessÂ 4mpd -Â UOBÂ PPV,btohqsg
Usual uob stuff like 5 dollar blocks  uni merchant etc would apply more for the ppv,btohqsg
For ppv transaction amount is rounded down to nearest 5,btohqsg
Then points are awarded based on that rounded down amount,btohqsg
if public transport never hit $5 bucks  how ah?,btohqsg
Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but only the base point for ladies calculated like that right ? 0.4 mpdThe bonus point is end of month / 5 right ?,btohqsg
If lady card yes. It's a mastercard so simplygo will batch the transactions of 5 days or $15 whichever is earlier. So if u use like 5 days in a row shd get base points for >$5 la.If ppv card the bonus is per transaction so it's near impossible to get base/bonus points coz public transport usually doesn't get to $5 per transaction,btohqsg
No no I meant ladies their bonus points tally up and sum up at the end of the month then wrong to nearest $5 and divide by 5 ðŸ˜… so at worst his earning 5.6 mpd on below $5 transaction,btohqsg
Ya i was just referring to the base point. 2 things can be true at the same time,btohqsg
ok like that Lady's card will still able to hit,btohqsg
contactless and mobile payment same same or different?,btohqsg
different  mobile payment is through samsung pay  android pay  google pay  apple pay etc  contactless is tap card or paywave. mobile payment is contactless while contactless not nescessary mobile payment,btohqsg
Can you waive off annual fees on Ladyâ€™s Solitaire if you hit a certain spend?,btohqsg
Any workaround ways to transfer money from Youtrip back to bank account?,btohqsg
Can top up with Paynow to exact amount  then spend with Youtrip Mastercard.,btohqsg
For general purpose spend is UOB Prvi Amex / Master better or UOB Preferred Visa?,btohqsg
Amex depend on merchant whether they accept it,btohqsg
How about UOB prvi master vs UOB preferred visa?,btohqsg
Don't risk it. You bank account could get frozen for money laundering,btohqsg
In order to get the ocbc360 acc 0.5% interest on spending category.If I use the ocbc 365 card to top up my grab wallet  does it count as qualifying spending?,btohqsg
"What is ""general purpose""?UOB PPV gets you 4 mpd if you pay using mobile contactless.UOB Prvi is 1.4 mpd for anything else.Why not both",btohqsg

Hi  wanna check what is the best way to top up youtrip card? If use credit card  do we still get the cashback?,btohqsg
No cashback if from credit card,btohqsg
Any best way? So use paynow only ?,btohqsg
Is there any perks we can earn by topping youtrip,btohqsg
Use Paynow or top-up from MC. No perks but at least better than paynow and you keep your MC active  easier to get membership waiver,btohqsg
Hi Pros here. Will you be able to help me with the below questions:1. Does CitiRewards cars award 4MPD for all online transactions on Shopee? Or it depends on what the MCC code is?2.
