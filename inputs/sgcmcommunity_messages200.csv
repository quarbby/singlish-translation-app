Since when renting is cheaper thn owning,btohqsg
if it is cheaper be careful when u drive the car tyre come off,btohqsg
Actually rent cheaper. U only rent when u need. Own jialat. Some days u don’t need at all. Many days u only use 1-2 hrs.,btohqsg
When u dun have enuf for DP its cheaper in that sense,btohqsg
Probably you can take an example and break it down for our view?,btohqsg
$70 daily + insurance etc… = $90 a day? so about same then?,btohqsg
This is nt a phv chat grp,btohqsg
Then use normal calculation. Dont use phv calculation,btohqsg
Then compare w non phv renting,btohqsg
Why must suit ur way sia,btohqsg
Pros and cons on each side,btohqsg
Got words from a friend in car industry  the used cars are moving slow although COE keeps rising. The EV demands very strong now. Also heard EV resale value is bad,btohqsg
depre so high who want buy LOL,btohqsg
cus the newer ev like byd all so cheap,btohqsg
Ya ev bn so cheap now who want to buy problem resale,btohqsg
We gotta accept that EVs are here to stay in the long run..For better or worse,btohqsg
I think most people want EV after trade in their car,btohqsg
Which is why used cars not moving fast,btohqsg
"buy 2nd hand car coe itself is low  when wanna scrap or touch wood smth happen u scrap car u not getting the ""high coe amount back"" ur getting the ""low coe amount back"" this risk who gna bear",btohqsg
EVs now has become like mobile phones,btohqsg
Plus used cars r mostly old tech,btohqsg
i would say its a fire hazard. did u see the mercs ev in South Korea that burned in a underground garage?,btohqsg
Why pay so much for a stock HU tht does nothing. No safety features,btohqsg
Always new better tech coming each year old car tech useless,btohqsg
Byd mpv on the radar now,btohqsg
i still want my GTI leh,btohqsg
Mod the new volks till gti lor,btohqsg
Haha I know you can anytime  just that you know you’ve other priorities going on ;),btohqsg
even with stage 3 cannot hit crank stock GTI HP,btohqsg
mai gong liao. waiting for my june bto ballot.  hdb haven get back to me,btohqsg
Then u drive lane 3 when ppl poke u,btohqsg
i filter 2nd then poke them back,btohqsg
Nowadys just look like can liao,btohqsg
They buy high u think they will sell low?,btohqsg
i can accept trade off. i have new and old car  once you change the head unit everything like new,btohqsg
further old car can be more fun to drive as they have more torque,btohqsg
my new yaris has all the toyota sense installed  dont see i use them much,btohqsg
so are my full honda sense,btohqsg
do you need to pay over the top for them it's your decision,btohqsg
I enjoyed my toyota safety features,btohqsg
At night just set 95kmh on acc  turn on lane keep assist,btohqsg
while i agree that the auto cruise is nice  after less than 10 times  not using liao,btohqsg
The most obvious diff is  kena scratch. If your own car  you can dun give a damn. If it's rental  you have to pay and is usually in hundreds if not thousands,btohqsg
Bad cos of the incentives but being Singaporean  will still factor in one,btohqsg
u read the battery replacement cost issue la,btohqsg
may be papy give incentive after 10 years of use,btohqsg
Is it more expensive than Engine Explode and Buy new engine?,btohqsg
Hybrid also got battery tiagong also not cheap,btohqsg
If rental  sure have to replace before you return. If your own car  you can scrap if the maths can add up,btohqsg
yes  my ws said change vezel hybrid battery cost 6k,btohqsg
Maybe not but sure have to tweak coe,btohqsg
Last time was much more exp,btohqsg
but change change one by one  there are 6,btohqsg
Now hybrid cheaper thts y dealers dare to throw 10yrs warranty,btohqsg
can elect to change one that is spoil  no need the whole thing,btohqsg
And as long as u service w AD  ur battery basically free for life,btohqsg
coe more expensive than the car,btohqsg
Last time when hybrid just came out  AD only put in 1yr  3yr. Or max 5yr,btohqsg
Now they just give u 10yrs,btohqsg
i think the whole world only spore used car price may increase,btohqsg
i believe as long as u take car  bar unlucky  can last de,btohqsg

i havent tried dolphin  but i can say atto 3 is great,btohqsg

depends on driving school. usually yes  u must complete the syllabus before the school allows to take the TP test.,btohqsg
😄 255k before electricity carpark insurance and maintenance,btohqsg
No brainer. Rent cheaper. Hybrid Altis also $70,btohqsg
One altis now 180k. 70 per day for 10 years alr 255k,btohqsg

Siao ah. Ppl rent only when they need. Who want to hold on for 10 years,btohqsg

In case shit goes down  u deregister still got $$,btohqsg
like what Kenneth said  the dealers gna kill themselves,btohqsg
keynesian economic of theory says must have intervention if not demand and supply will always be at the wrong place,btohqsg
No ofc choose 1 with low coe. So the price upfront will be lower,btohqsg
High coe means ur car depre higher per day sia,btohqsg
in case u get smoked by Mk  since dealers pricing cars depre alongside w new cars.. eg a 2018 Altis and a 2021 Altis also 22k depre.. ahem ahem..,btohqsg
Juz buy car with low coe,btohqsg
Anybody has fumigation kit or lobang for car service  now?,btohqsg
Since when is Altis 22k depre? Even the current depre of 13k is mad crazy for this,btohqsg
Low coe means you recover lesser when you sell  compared to getting one with high coe. Arf also affects how much you recover  that's why EV ppl say low or no resale value,btohqsg
Nothing to do with maths score 🤭,btohqsg
Aiyah it depends on what the individual wants  no right or wrong,btohqsg
One piece of COE now can get 2room BTO lol ?,btohqsg
Jialad lea some dun even know how to pump petrol HAHAHA,btohqsg

How does Grab determine if ur car can do premium or just lapsap Grab car?,btohqsg

Means COE will increase in prices this round ?,btohqsg
Even if drop  also nt drastic drop,btohqsg
Usually cant even pay for insurance + 1yr road tax kind,btohqsg
I when to analyxe the coe.. even if there is financial crisis in 2008  coe only drastically drop in end 2009  with $1000 coe in 1Q2010 and by 2Q recovered back alr,btohqsg
This show Singaporean is very rich even during financial crisis,btohqsg
So  unlesss government intervene like in Jan  $75k coe. Coe will never drop,btohqsg
I scared Lawrence Wong change coe ruling cause he said he is prepared to review everything,btohqsg
But when I come to think of it. Coe will always be using money to bid,btohqsg
No subsidy to be given one. It’s unlike housing when they give rental voucher or what,btohqsg
Cause think about it. They give subsidy  dealer will still increase price over time. So no point.,btohqsg
just make dealers pay what they bid,btohqsg
Unless they remove COE from bank loan. COE cash only   maybe will drop but who will be happy?,btohqsg
The issue of big family with low income need car or don’t need car all what medical issue  govt sure no care.,btohqsg

Wah if they tighten this. For housing  still got million dollar flat. End up it’s harder to get car but car still ex.,btohqsg

oh but i rmb last time i see forums got ppl say ev insurance 5k,btohqsg
Can just enter into those online one,btohqsg
I did last time was 29xx,btohqsg
yea but they maintain 0% for cat A B until Jan 2025  means after that doesnt mean will have more than 0% limit uh?,btohqsg
they announce they gna have a 0% growth,btohqsg
i rmb they announce it when i was in poly or sec sch,btohqsg
and that is more than 10 years ago,btohqsg
sian i tot had chance hahaha,btohqsg
actually  guys  reason why now coe demand is outstripping supply is cus we have an increase in population,btohqsg
in terms of just coe being issued,btohqsg
u can't have something growing without the infrastructure to support,btohqsg
aka 6.9m pop white paper and our coe,btohqsg

But the car had to be under your name to take loan right? Technically you are the car owner no?,btohqsg
@MG_SMneed to find the right credit company to loan u,btohqsg
Technically u dont need to hold a license to own a car,btohqsg
U need a license to drive n buy coe,btohqsg
It’s ok. I will never buy anything if I cannot afford or not confident I can pay in full. That’s why I like the 40/60 rule. Usually if after a year of payment u cannot afford selling your car should cover the bank loan. It’s a way of protecting ourselves from bank debt during crisis.,btohqsg
A lot of things can be done,btohqsg
Just tht process very long n tedious,btohqsg
If nt how do u think Tommy Goh can park so many cars without COE in his house,btohqsg
Car sharing firms kept buying cars that's why,btohqsg

Trade in new car better value thn renewing,btohqsg
7yr old car. No more loan. U wait till 10th yr?,btohqsg
Or u straight cash out ur 7yr old car for a new car?,btohqsg
but that would be if the COE on the 7yr old car is high  so can get back high amount when deregistering?,btohqsg
Why wld u dereg a car when u alrdy finish ur loan,btohqsg
U practically drive for free for 3yrs,btohqsg

The most wrong info is people fancy Covid or other kind of recession for COE to fall. Wrong  we don’t need those as it affects many lives. If one thinks COE too high  just don’t buy car. Simple.,btohqsg
"Ur naive  sanctimonious take on recessions n COE prices reveal a staggering lvl of ignorance. No 1 fancy pandemics or recessions. These r catastrophic events that we cant choose or control. Ur simple suggestion: “If COE is too high  just don’t buy a car"" show just how out of touch u r with the real world. Ppl need cars 2 live their lives  support their families n run their businesses. The reality is that COE prices r influenced by economic conditions n when a recession hits  it's not abt ""fancying"" it. It's abt bracing 4 impact  n yes  prices may drop cos demand weakens. That's not some ethical dilemma. it's the cold  hard truth of economics. So  b4 you spew this self-righteous nonsense again right  maybe get a grip on how the world actually works. It's not a matter of wanting or not wanting a crisis. it's abt understanding that we don't hv the luxury of choosing our circumstances.",btohqsg

Cos ask too much  dealer dont want entertain,btohqsg
Some consignment car price is lower than market average.. but also means smth else lo,btohqsg
Means rabak car want to faster get rid of it,btohqsg
or cud be just used car market priced too high..,btohqsg
Not really Coe high so used car seller will sell based on current Coe valuation due to replacement cost,btohqsg
