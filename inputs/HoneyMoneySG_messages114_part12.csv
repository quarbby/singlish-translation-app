Deposit into the moomoo 5-10 mins  investing probably 1 day depending on the time,btohqsg
Do you earn any miles point for petrol spending under krisflyer UOB credit card?,btohqsg
No not under the mcc list,btohqsg
Only UOB lady card (with transport category) and UOB visa signature (with minimum spend of $1000 per month),btohqsg
Or just use mobile contactless on uob ppv,btohqsg
Thank you  if is pair with amaze would that qualify for it.,btohqsg
No  doesn't work. Amaze card only make it an online transaction while retaining the original MCC category.,btohqsg
Yes. Only ESSO tho (if you pay via the Kris+App with Krisflyer UOB card. 3+0.5=3.5mpd total)That being said  renting cars on getgo or other platform where petrol cost will be reimbursed is best to go to esso to get free miles back,btohqsg
The preferred platinum visa? It works? Haha didn't try. Maybe will give it a try,btohqsg
Very nice. Thanks! Will give it a go. Have more options,btohqsg
Hi  may I know what you mean by cash out? How to redeem from Moomoo after the first cycle? üòä,btohqsg
Ya cuz I have no loyalty for petrol stations so I always use ppv which kind of works for most petrol places,btohqsg
Hi gurus  got a question. Say I hold 1000 shares. does that mean I will get a payput of (1000*0.54) on 19 April and also another (1000*0.54) on 20 May?,btohqsg
Hi guys  regarding SingSaver CC rewards. I did online shopping  but the item I just received was faulty. The procedure is to refund the item and place a new order. Would that disqualify me from the rewards? If so  can I make up the refunded amount now to stay qualified even though the effective spending window (end of May) has already expired?,btohqsg
I believe you will be disqual  have to see the tnc for any clause on this.,btohqsg
If refund i think gg‚Ä¶ can ask for replacement item instead of refund tryAny spend which is later refunded no longer qualified spend,btohqsg
yes  only can refund back to my CC. Guess I have to choose between keeping the faulty item or CC rewards lol. Thanks for the inputs  appreciate much.,btohqsg
Why not call the bank and ask since I think they have the final say,btohqsg
Cannot ask them to issue vouchers for the refund ah,btohqsg
i not sure about singsaver but moneysmart told me there will be warranty by the manufacturer,btohqsg
It's a stacked campaign from the bank and SingSaver  already sent an email to both  will call tmr.,btohqsg
It's TaoBao very troublesome  had a hard time to navigate thru the refund process  the SG plus items must return items and refund cash only. No Alipay or vouchers.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I plan to get an UOB Prvi Miles Card.. should I go for the AMEX  Visa or Mastercard version?,btohqsg
I believe your stack rewards should outweigh the taobao item ba. If it does rather get the singsaver and bank rewards then make another purchase on taobao,btohqsg
can i earn miles from Citipayall to purchase a second hand motorbike from shop,btohqsg
Visa if u intend to use cardup,btohqsg
Sing saver rewards are given out already?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just want some advice on the current HSBC EGA bonus interest promotion‚Ä¶ if the bonus interest is only on the incremental funds  does it mean if I have 100k  it doesn‚Äôt maximize fully if I pump in the 100k in 1 shot in the 1st month and just leave it there?Is there a hack to this?Thanks,btohqsg
it is based on incremental monthly average balance (mab) compared to that of reference month. The more days in the month u keep the 100k in the account the higher the mab. No hack to this.,btohqsg

üëã What is the best way to buy Capital Mall voucher‚Äôs and get the best cashback or miles rewards?Is it through Stacking  credit cards discount  other apps.  Hope some one can help to advise. TIA,btohqsg
Hi anyone able to explain how does the cashback gets credited to using cashback cards?,btohqsg
do they deduct off the final amount or some other way?,btohqsg
Different cashback cards work differently. Some is given points for you to offset your spending by redeeming it  some auto credits into your card and offsets partial of the credit card statement amount,btohqsg
Citi cashback auto credit to next statement in block of 50s. Citi cashback plus have to redeem on app in block of 10s,btohqsg
yea  need min $50 cashback before auto credit for citi cashback card,btohqsg
Hi  for buying furniture (sofa  dining table  mattress) in JB. Which card will be good? UOB VS? Any other alternatives if the amount of more than 2k?,btohqsg
Hi  if I do the Giro top up to CPF using HSBC EVG  do I get the 1% Cashback? Thanks,btohqsg
I think only bill payment qualify  u can always check with hsbc,btohqsg
Better don‚Äôt check with CSO. Try it out  If have enjoyed.üòÖ,btohqsg
Technically should get the 1% cashback.Mail the completed GIRO form to CPF and it'll take up to 21 working days as per any other GIRO mail-in application.Take note that there's no BRE for RSTU GIRO application.,btohqsg
IRAS NOA now available for me. Not sure if same for the rest. Even though it's dated 18 Jun. üëÄ,btohqsg
Hi all  for Citi rewards + amaze  I max the CRMC card already during may. To check if I can continue gaining bonus points  is to look through Citi app and if my 'Points earned this month' is not capped (~10k pts) means that the bonus points is reset and I can continue to earn pts on qualifying purchases that earn 10X BP  correct?,btohqsg
Ok all good I found my answer,btohqsg
