What you mean offer you 50$ ?,btohqsg
Really . They give you $$ for retention ?,btohqsg
I think in 2024 many people cancel this ocbc rewards card...,btohqsg
Yes. Need to complete 5 transactions on any amount. Then they will transfer $50 to your account,btohqsg
I never keep track on that. Nowadays I just use this card to spend on venus   guardian and watson to earn 6 miles.,btohqsg
I'm using Amaze + Citi Cashback (8%),btohqsg
Yes  Amaze converts your transactions to SGD  but fx rate around ~2% lousier than Youtrip/Trust,btohqsg
can we awarded 10x point using CRMC+Amaza  for JB petrol?,btohqsg
As long MCC not excluded in t&c,btohqsg
Submit interbank GIRO form through mail and wait between 4-6 weeks for approval. If you submitted your form to AMEX on 6 Apr when your first query was answered  you would probably have it approved and ready for May's statement.,btohqsg
Anyone facing this issue too  when trying to add citi rewards card into amaze?,btohqsg

Wrong answers only?You need to tell us whether cashback or miles at least? And what cards you have?,btohqsg
Is citirewards with amaze ok? Or is HSBC Revolution?,btohqsg
HSBC mcc whitelist so I rather not use thatWill do with amaze and CRMC or UOB PPV,btohqsg
If I use UOB PPV Apple Pay in foreign countries  does it count as mobile contactless 4mpd?,btohqsg
oh  did u receive 4mpd? Or must you still meet the $1k local spending first?,btohqsg
Revolution is no longer as good as before. Milelion has rate it . Not a must to take,btohqsg
Ppv no minimum spend  uob vs is the one with 1k foreign spending,btohqsg
anyone know if telco and my republic can be rewarded with points with the DBS woman's world card ?,btohqsg

Just wondering  if I link Citi rewards MasterCard with amaze  and use amaze on Gpay can I qualify for the same 10X rewards point as if I am using the physical card?,btohqsg
I don't think UOB VI is for miles earning... That's more for luxury I think?,btohqsg
Hi I am new to crmc+ amaze  to earn 4mpd for in app transactions like shoppee  spotify or Netflix  do I use crmc or amaze card(linking to crmc)?,btohqsg
If in app can use directly as long as is not recurring charge. Shopee is fine but not top up to shopee pay,btohqsg
Hi  could I get some advice as am trying to research but still not too clear on the various options.For purchases under Electronics (Apple products specifically)  does this qualify under the 10x Citi Rewards points if I buy direct from Apple online store? As the terms seem to only be specifically for online clothing and accessories store.Checked out Heymax as well and it seems to be one of the better cards to use to clock mpd  but trying to figure out if it‚Äôs 10x points or 1x point for the Electronics MCC.Thanks!,btohqsg
I dont think u can use googlepay for paynow qr link to card for pay  gpay for paynow qr always deduct from bank acct,btohqsg
There seem to be some issue with apple website online payment report by other as being offline. U can always get from apple flagship from shopee and lazada plus use coupon there for better deal,btohqsg
CRMC award 10x points for all online txn excluding travel MCC... But specifically for Apple Online pls try to use it with Amaze. Like@qqplacessaid  there's chance your transaction is coded as non-online (i.e. chip based) then your 4mpd become 0.4mpd.But rmb the 1k cap applies.,btohqsg
Oh good point on the other platforms  thanks for the suggestion!,btohqsg
Ok yes got it! I can‚Äôt use my Amaze already since that‚Äôs been maxed out for the month üòÖ so I might have to use the other shopping platforms instead,btohqsg
I always wait for flash deal or those special date sales  it can save u some extra to spend on other stufd,btohqsg
So fast max out .. spending more than 1 k a month,btohqsg
Can we use shell apps when driving in Malaysia..?,btohqsg
Amaze no promotion to sign currently,btohqsg
Anyone familiar with WISE here? Is it better to link WISE to Credit Card? Every transfer money is charge at hw many $?,btohqsg
For credit/debit card there is 3.15%/3.09% fee  use PayNow to fund is free,btohqsg
Transfer to their bank account method is also free,btohqsg
Sorry noob question for Amaze. It is mostly good for overseas spending only right? If local spending  might as well use the credit card directly?Or am I mistaken?,btohqsg
If I use Krispay or shopback to pay in a restaurant  will I still get the 4mpd or 8% Rebate for solitare card and maybank family and friends card?,btohqsg
People use it for CRMC because it converts offline transaction into online type. Thus enable 4mpd.People also use it to confirm MCC of merchant.,btohqsg
Means transfer from debit account to wise?,btohqsg
Transfer from your bank account  add Wise as payee  when you choose bank transfer on their app they will show you their bank account number to transfer to,btohqsg

Hi all  for CardUp  the total amount charged to the credit card is eligible for rewards right.For example  if I use Maybank Platinum Visa Card and the payment amount keyed in to CardUp is $1965  based on the current CardUp promo fee of 1.85% for Visa cards  I will be charged $2001.35.Meaning to say  I will qualify (based on the latest T&C) for Maybank's quarterly cash rebate of $200 (assuming I will charge this $2001.35 per month for the entire quarter).,btohqsg
Hi for the UOB Preferred Platinum Visa  for the 4mpd  I assume if you load up onto your Apple Wallet without using the physical card it still counts?,btohqsg
You should not use physical PPV card because you won‚Äôt get 4mpd. Only mobile contactless gets 4mpd so ya definitely load into your phone and paywave with phone.,btohqsg
Currently I have the following credit card:1. Citi Premier Miles2. UOB Krisflyer3. OCBC 360 (going to cancel this card)4. POSB Daily (more for SPC petrol cash back)5.

Hello Experts Can I have feedback on my understanding below if I want to maximize the interest earned for HSBC EGA:1. Opened account in April 2024 and registered by SMS for HSBC EGA promo in April 2024 - hence I will earn bonus interest for April and May 2024.2. On 31 May 2024  I have to move my funds from HSBC EGA to somewhere else and leave only minimum balance throughout month June 2024 to avoid penalty.3. On 1 Jul 2024  I have to SMS to register for the July bonus interest promo and put back my fund inside EGA. My incremental ADB that will earn bonus interest will be against month June 2024 balance.4. Leave the fund for 2 months (July and Aug) to earn the bonus interest.5. Repeat step 2 above on 31 Aug 2024.,btohqsg

I guess I be rejected .. as I only annual income 42 to 43k.. at least I tried apply for UOB ladies account . Is successful,btohqsg
go for the $30k version first,btohqsg
I have already.. because I want to have the 2 category bonus instead of 1,btohqsg

Look out for the manhole.. don't just walk later fall inside. Jump over..,btohqsg

Lol... no point l√†..  rather put in spore saving bonds. About 3.5%,btohqsg
Some people try the app application method. Should get almost instant approval  if not can still check status.,btohqsg
I got it at way below requirement.All the lady woman card very useful.,btohqsg
You also got Dbs world woman card ?,btohqsg
i guess depends on when you got the card? For a short period i think they were quite lax with the income requirement. But now apparently is tightened.,btohqsg
Oh Wah.. I think I was lucky. üòÖüòÅ,btohqsg
150k really a lot.. that $$ I already invest in stock market,btohqsg
The reason why I want to get that card is because I want to put it under massage and facial... because I heard citi rewards under this only 0.4 to 1 miles earn only,btohqsg
Just get Uob ppv or Uob vs.Can get 4mpd,btohqsg
Yes.. uob preferred visa I also have...,btohqsg
Wah granny so fast lol I wanted to reply that,btohqsg

Hi. Any recommendations of  a credit card to be used as a second card. So no min spending  generally open to cashback/ miles. Was using the ocbc rewards card previously but read that it is not as good now. My main card is uob one card because of the one account.,btohqsg
Is there expiry date for HSBC reward points under HSBC T1 card?,btohqsg
3 years is actually above average,btohqsg
I decided to go for T1 since the points will soon pool with HSBC Revo and I am not in the UOB/DBS ecosystems. Hence  if I go for other general spend I'll probably have orphan pojnts,btohqsg
Points can be transferred to kris flyer,btohqsg
HSBC 3 years expiry date. Before expiry  quickly trasnfer to Krisflyer which valid another 3 years. Total 6 years?,btohqsg

Might consider pooling your cards to one that‚Äôs the same bank and that pools points.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt hold on for miles for too long..,btohqsg
Yes agree. I hate it when Sq devalue the miles... more miles equal per sgd,btohqsg
Any idea which best miles card?,btohqsg
Certain miles will gone to the drain... when not all miles can be transferred to Kris flyer account.,btohqsg
Now uob no longer can be transferred to krispay,btohqsg
Only citi bank and dbs allowed,btohqsg
Is the HSBC revolution still okay? In terms of miles?,btohqsg
Actually I feel at a certain point Amex card is still good . Because all spending per miles will be transfer to KrisFlyer.  No short miles is wasted.,btohqsg
I think it still works as a supplementary card to the stash since there‚Äôs no AF,btohqsg
Why would u transfer to Krispay when there will be a haircut,btohqsg
They can claw back your rewards for the card you cancelled after 4 months. At most is ban you from getting future sign up rewards. Depending on the t&c.,btohqsg
Cut orphan miles loss.Use uob kris flyer.Amex ascend .Better choice,btohqsg
Any dbs credit card will do? Eg. Dbs altitude pay other credit card bill and giro payment via hsbc account,btohqsg
I see. Dbs allows giro arrangement without need for submit manual paper?,btohqsg

What is your credit limit now for CRMC card?,btohqsg
Recently we bought air tickets ($4K) and cos we've already hit our uob one card spending for cashback  we thought to get some points instead. So we overpaid the cc and bought the tickets. Still works but wonder if I can just increase the limit moving forward.,btohqsg
It's $1.2K since forever üòÇ never had issues cos I use and pay immediately.Really just to collect points,btohqsg
Credit limit at 1200 is really low,btohqsg
CRMC only give 4mpd up to $1k. Beyond that almost similar to pay using your bank atm/debit card  CRMC also exclude airticket too.,btohqsg
Hi does anymore knows whether lalamove Topup will earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
max cap is 1k  and i dont think travel related gives for 4mpd,btohqsg
Ahhh that's useful to know. So no point increasing my limit then? So can earn max 4000 mile per mth?Yes later we realised our air tickets were not 4mpd üò≠,btohqsg
if you have another card  i dont see a point in increasing your limit. since the bonus points are only up to 1k spending,btohqsg

**Regarding UOB One***Sorry  I just watched Chris's video on Tax Payment thru CardUp. May I know if my plan below works?Background:-I always wanted to open an UOB One Account but couldn't fulfill the monthly $500 credit card spending consistently.-I am currently using OCBC 360 (with GIRO salary crediting)-I am currently holding UOB Stash account under Rising Dragon Promotion (the earmarked amount should be released by 18th May 2024).My Plan:-Open a UOB One account now.-Apply UOB Evol Card now.-Setup CardUp tax payment arrangement with UOB Evol Card before 24th May 2024.-Transfer $150 000 (from UOB Stash Account) on 1st June 2024.-Fulfill the monthly salary crediting requirement thru FAST/PAYNOW from my DBS personal account from June onwards.-Fulfill the monthly credit card spending requirement thru UOB Evol Card for tax payment via CardUp monthly from June onwards.Question:1) Does my plan makes sense? (UOB Evol + CardUp to fulfill UOB One Credit Card spending and FAST payment from DBS personal account to fulfill Salary Crediting requirement)2) I just searched Cardup inHeymax.ai  seems like UOB Evol Card is eligible for 8% cashback. Is CardUp considered online spending with $20 cashback cap for CardUp spending ($600)? While the CardUp fee for $600 is less than $20.3) To fulfill the credit card spending in June  should I setup CardUp tax arrangement on 24th May or 24th June? If I setup the arrangement on 24th May  when will CardUp charge my card?Thanks!,btohqsg
WWMC is $0.556 block ? üò±I didn‚Äôt know that,btohqsg
Evol doesn't earn cashback with cardup. You may use the cardup calculator to find the best cards to pair with,btohqsg
To answer all 3 qn  don't make sense because CardUp is not eligible for rewards.,btohqsg
Thanks  I see. I am new to heymax.Let me find out.,btohqsg
Heymax is not 100%. T&c is.,btohqsg

For payment of income tax using card up  there is a promotion which seems better for Visa.Is there any Visa cards available for miles accumulation which does not have a 1k cap per month? Otherwise since my income tax is more than 1k per month  there would be ‚Äúwastage‚Äù.. anybody with the same problem?https://mainlymiles.com/2024/03/28/cardup-offering-2024-income-tax-payments-from-1-75-fee/,btohqsg
Dont get what u mean by 1k cap as cardup does not qualify for those 4mpd card bonus point. U need to choose the best base miles card for cardup and those have no cap,btohqsg
Use this webpage to check which card can earn how many miles per dollar.https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculator,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to check OCBC cash back? I have been using frank for almost a decade totally forgot about the cash back,btohqsg
Anyone signed up for UOB big savings payout promo on 30th Apr?Wanna ask if your fund been earmark yet?,btohqsg
Its decent. The welcome bonus of 20 000k miles for paying annual fee is good. The earn rates of 1.2/2.4mpd is comparable to other cards. But I got it because the points will soon pool with HSBC Revo.Given the low earn rates of General Spend cards  I want it to pool with my existing cards. If you are in UOB ecosystem  Privimiles seems good as well,btohqsg
What I meant was that the card up platform is used to pair with certain miles credit cards. So if the cap for the max amount miles I can earn in a month is relatively low  then I need to find a credit card which has a higher cap.Not sure whether I got this logic correct. üòÖ,btohqsg

Yes  if via cardup. Card up is consider normal transaction,btohqsg
Hi  my understanding is credit cards only givebasemiles on those transactions charged using cardup. I am not aware of any credit cards that have cap on maximumbasemiles you can earn per month.Eg. UOB VS has 0.4 base miles n 3.6 bonus miles = 4miles.You only get 0.4 mile per dollar via cardup..,btohqsg

whats a good card to use after the 1k cap on citi rewards mastercard + amaze?,btohqsg

There is plenty of card but really boil down to your spending habit,btohqsg
Yes  got for other card in maybank for the extra bonus first then get platinum visa,btohqsg
I have Maybank family and friends card already  normally spending charge to Uob one card  this is just for income tax payment which currently just giro from my bank acct,btohqsg

Does anyone here hold a hsbc premier acc via 15k monthly crediting? May I know if the min balance is 5k or 15k? I‚Äôm quite sure it‚Äôs 5k  but when I went to open another joint acc the cso insisted it‚Äôs 15k. Hence wondering if any tnc changed on minimum account balance,btohqsg
Ah ok  thought 2k is for normal acc. If premier is also 2k  that‚Äôs great thanks!,btohqsg
No aunty. Premier account don‚Äôt have fall below fees,btohqsg
yup.. MINIMUM balance to avoid fall below fee is always $2k regardless your tierthe $15k inflow per month or $200k AUM are criteria to maintain Premier Banking.,btohqsg
i'm not seeing it as waived,btohqsg
ah ok thanks for the info!!but i always just keep $2000 inside all the time anyway  never know when get downgraded back to Retail level since the $15000 per month inflow is supposed to be a limited period promo only.HSBC Premier Banking by right need to keep $200k AUM inside one,btohqsg
on that topic  is there any way to do the $15k / month? eg: You transfer in the money yourself using GIRO similar to what UOB One supports?,btohqsg
It is just a $15k FAST IN requirement... does not need to be salary,btohqsg
Shiok  thanks for the tip! What benefit do you think is the most worth it in HSBC Premier? Is it just the $500 cap on 1% cashback on GIRO payment? Or some other perks are quite good?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA premier banking is good for the 4.x% p.a. interest and the $500 1% GIRO cashback cap.,btohqsg
You need to go down to branch and get the cso to tag your account under the 15k crediting via a form. Very ley chey but worth the one time effort,btohqsg
Seems like banks are quite stringent on account opening now due to multiple scams. Yesterday I felt interrogated with so many qtns on how I plan to do my banking etc  as if I‚Äôm gonna commit fraud on this new account man,btohqsg
Though I feel this cso seem to be judging and thinks I can‚Äôt maintain a premier acc. Kept asking me if I‚Äôm sure I can do the 15k. Wah Lao I said yes,btohqsg
Thanks for the tips! According to:https://www.hsbc.com.sg/premier/privilegesThere is also a $1600++ Sign Up bonus if you bring in incremental $300k deposit.For the 4.x% PA you mentioned  is it the monthly promo that you have to sign up for via SMS  or something else?,btohqsg
u need to control 2 HSBC EGA accounts in order to get consistent 4.x%Otherwise only 3.%,btohqsg

Is this true even for international contactless?,btohqsg

U can. Just know that hsbc will reject if you sign your giro form digitally if you are setting up giro payment for another name.Need to print without signature then sign with ink for them to accept. If u are setting up giro to pay your own cc bill then digital signature is ok.,btohqsg

15K Fast in is to fulfil HSBC premier requirements  can just fast in. For everyday rewards for premier is 5k in and 5 transfer out. So normally I just pump in $15k monthly on first of each month and withdraw out in 5 transaction to settle the requirements,btohqsg

You can try. You can't select salary payment as purpose.,btohqsg
Steps- You need a banking app that lets you setSalary Paymentas the transaction purpose. DBS  StanChart  UOB and CIMB should have this feature. OCBC does not.- Set up a PayNow Transfer OR FAST transfer (yes this works as long as you haveSalary Paymentas the transaction purpose)- Set Transaction Purpose asSalary Payment- Transfer at least S$2000 to your UOB Account- The salary tracker within your UOB app should reflect the amount within 2-3 daysThis is the way it used to work. takes a few seconds :),btohqsg

it is true..i roughly looked at it before.. if you have i think $740 of insurance bills PER MONTH  then it is worth itCalculation:$1000 at 4% p.a. interest = $3.33 per month opportunity cost$3.33 of miles earned at 0.3mpd = 3.33*100/1.5/0.3 = $740 of 0.3 mpd spend to earn $3.33 of miles per month,btohqsg

For $320: $100 will earn 400 miles and $220 will earn 88 miles. So technically 488 miles / $320 = 1.53 mpd üòÖ,btohqsg
It didn't specify insurance payment via cardup. All I know is direct payment using dbs altitude insurance definitely doesn't count to the minimum spend,btohqsg
So unless cardup change the mcc code of the payment not to reflect as insurance. Otherwise DBS probably will still not recognize it. Make sense?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just wondering   CardUp shows 7399 on Heymax and this mcc is excluded in signup tnc Might be similar to dbs vantage whereby signup not eligible but maybe can clock the miles. Anyway ask the cso is better in written form.,btohqsg
"I have applied for GIRO payment plan for my income taxes  and i want to use CardUp to make recurring payments  must the recurring payment be the same for each month?Or can i use the ""update payment"" function to adjust the amount so that I can pay more for certain months and lesser for others?",btohqsg
I just need to make sure that I do the exceed the total amount of taxes I am supposed to pay?,btohqsg
Hey i got money but dont know what to do invest,btohqsg
OK. I had same thoughts. Giro once set and they will occur deduction on specific day. If the CardUp deduction  which is most likely after the Giro deduction date  you need to key in the amount that you need to pay all remaining amt after offsetting the amount that you will be deducted from Giro of the particular month.Hope my long sentence is well understood.,btohqsg
Hi all.. talking about GIRO.. I've my hsbc ega giro for dbs credit cards approved yesterday.. my dbs cc payment due date is 20 may.. do u think the giro will take effect or I need to manually pay this month?,btohqsg
If u already receive the dbs statement before the approval  I don't think it will giro this mth.For my uob statement  it will state giro payment if that statement will be deduct via giro.,btohqsg

Is it worth while to convert SGD to USD for the mmf USD 5%?or mmf SGD 3.6%?any1 done the calculation is it worth the conversion?,btohqsg
Depends on your view on usd/sgd and also the fx spread applied.I would generally say don‚Äôt convert unless u have use for the foreign currency upon maturity.,btohqsg

Anyone receive qualfied sms for hsbc everyday reward for the month of June 24?,btohqsg
True  for now I don't have use for USD. Just attracted to the high interest 5%.But for longer term like 6mth or so  if u constantly get the 5%  it should outweighs the fx spread?,btohqsg
But the April SMS covers until 31 May. So should be ok I guess?,btohqsg
What about expected usd depreciation if US cut interest rates,btohqsg
Not sure how many % the spread they charge you  but I know credit card charges 3.25% fx spread. You earn 5%/2= 2.5% in 6 month  then‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Yeah. Cover only til May. Wonder if the promo continue to June and beyond?,btohqsg

Unfortunately you ask the wrong person. Moomoo has never good to me. For every moomoo promo I participated  moomooalwaysmissed to release the rewards to me and I have to keep chasing them via chat many many times. Moomoo always admitted they missed to give me the rewards.,btohqsg

There‚Äôs something that I want to clarify about this Altitude card. For local spend  you are awarded with 1.3mpd.The miles are awarded based on single transaction or the total amount of month end statement?If I paid $9.90 for a meal  I will be awarded 1 DBS point only?If my monthly statement is $99.90 for local send  I will be awarded 19 DBS points?Am I right or I‚Äôm missing out something?,btohqsg
You will earn 9.9√∑5x3.25 = 6 (round down) DBS points for $9.90 transaction when it posts. Minimum $1.54 local transaction for 1 DBS point.,btohqsg
Hi  just want to ask  for the Citi Rewards + Amaze card  if I use the Amaze card to tap on SimplyGo transactions  will it be rewarded bonus 10X points? I'm aware that Citi Credit Cards can't get bonus points for SimplyGo,btohqsg
Am I right to say that I will need to spend at least $1.54 per transaction to get 1 DBS point? Lesser than $1.54  I will get nothing DBS point?,btohqsg

Like this need to call? Can just read from tnc,btohqsg
Since you need to pay for it regardless  why not just pay the admin fee and get the rewards? Rather than you pay the downpayment and not get anything. But you have to calculate if getting the rewards is worth to pay the fees,btohqsg
That guy doesn‚Äôt read or google themselves.,btohqsg
At the moment i can only use uob priv and per my cal each miles will have a valuation of 0.73 cents,btohqsg
I think Amex forgot to cancel one of my credit cards. They called me to ask which one I‚Äôd like to cancel when I applied for a new card. So 1 charge + 4 credit seems to be possible.,btohqsg
Because I need confirmation since some website say can   some say no,btohqsg
i managed to get a 6th Citi Credit Card long ago (when they were looser).But last year when I had 6 cards and wanted to apply for Prestige  they forced me to cancel 2 cards before they would approve Prestige. SighBut no regrets. Citi Prestige is one of my most valuable Miles card (alongside UOB Lady the Queen).,btohqsg
Power they allow you to have more than 2,btohqsg
Prestige card is quite similar to uob solitaire card. You don't earn 10k a month ... you don't get it,btohqsg
Is not like scb infinite card. Even you earn 30 to 35k .. you can get it,btohqsg
But prestige can get by depositing 10k  solitaire is 30k,btohqsg
That's another good point... but you put as secured.. I don't think you earn any bank interest,btohqsg
For UOB the last time my mom did it they allowed the promo FD rates,btohqsg
Yes... I think the website and terms and condition.. more safe than milelion and singsaver,btohqsg

thanks for the warning..i decide to guide my friend to do his Tbills on 1st June Saturday then.. since Saturday can do during day time.,btohqsg
Does insurance payment (GE) give you cc points for crmc?,btohqsg
SSB is Mon-Sat  7am-9pm.Tbill is any time IIRC.,btohqsg
Not true also. But try not to be too far off the required salary mark.,btohqsg
Uob lady solitaire 10k per month is too far ahead... can't reach,btohqsg
Lucky the uob saving account.. they never ask for too much for the extra 2 miles..,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not worth it leh.Unless you MS the lady card like some people who max $2000 every month to another card.,btohqsg
Pressured into clocking $1500 or more.,btohqsg
I heard many in aaron group go for it,btohqsg
Means must hit 1500 a month for extra 2 miles ?,btohqsg
To make it worth lo. Considering 1 miles is 1 cent.Now interest rate easily 3% up.,btohqsg
Go see video on uob lady saving acct  it is the opportunity cost u lose on interest verus miles u earn from it,btohqsg
Yes. Please support Chris video. ü•≥,btohqsg
I saw it .. the guy forget his name .. recommend to put minimum 10k in lady account,btohqsg
I think optimal is 10k which is the most worth it,btohqsg
Then again.When one person needs miles  he can never get it at 1cent at that moment. So more miles is always better.We can always get money everywhere but miles are harder to come by. Also considering this factor.,btohqsg
Guys any better fixed deposit rate than Syfe cash+?,btohqsg
Haha depend on individual  miles to me not as attractive as cash,btohqsg
You need to understand differences between fixed deposit vs syfe investment. You can‚Äôt have high returns and low risk together.,btohqsg
That's why is not really worth if paying coffee 2$ to 2.20 for a 5 blocks rewarding card...,btohqsg
