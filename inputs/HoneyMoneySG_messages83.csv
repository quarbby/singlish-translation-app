Since you already fully paid your HDB  you will be OA positive from your contributions.. so you can do CPF shielding before RA is formed so that the OA will be transferred rather than SA.,btohqsg
Depend on model and if there are promotion  need to do your own research,btohqsg

Bid-ask spread is standard practice  that's how the market makers make their money...buy at the ask  sell at the bid (that's why as soon as you enter a trade you already start behind)  and if you're trading in fairly exotic/illiquid items the bid-ask spread can be quite wide.,btohqsg

Service charge lol. It's clearly written on the app.,btohqsg
No. He kenna 29 cents (10%) twice.,btohqsg
GST is charged on Service Charge  0.29/(2.9+0.29)=9%.,btohqsg
Lol ok got it. Yes u are right.,btohqsg
Ah i see! Thx for the reminder,btohqsg
Haha good one.. own self increase gst to 10%,btohqsg
Like scam lol but it's been that way for the longest time I guess,btohqsg
The gst is on both the 2. 9(sushi) and tax,btohqsg
Send email to them and get $20 free voucher .,btohqsg
If u do the math2.9 + 10% service charge is 3.199% of 3.19 is 0.2871 round up to 0.29 gst.,btohqsg
Just happen that GST also 0.29 after factoring the service charge,btohqsg
Haha if the spending is higher than the gst will look more accurate also ü§£,btohqsg
I learned it the hard way a  few  years backI  ask the vendor directly üòÇ and i got the death stare,btohqsg
GST is paid on both goods and services ;) it's in the name,btohqsg
9% GST is on both the food price and the service charge.,btohqsg
Service charge also need to pay gst ? lol üòÇ power la,btohqsg
gst = goods and SERVICE tax  so yes  services are taxed,btohqsg
Been that way since ages ago leh,btohqsg
So if I go barber and pay him for the service of cutting my hair  I don't need to pay GST?,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I was charged a total of 2.8% for my Airbnb transaction for International Processing Fee from UOB? Is this normal?,btohqsg
yup it is and I have been done a few times before.,btohqsg
How is this avoidable in the future? 2.8% is abit ridiculous for a purchase charged in SGD,btohqsg
Must see which batch of ssb. If every year is above 3% just keep it.Once sold u might not be able to buy back. And they are dropping.New salary then put into uob one.,btohqsg
have to check every time who the processor is  I guess. :( unless someone else has any ideas,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs sgd. it should just be additional 1% for crossBorder fee. Processing of sgd overseas.,btohqsg
Apparently UOB doesn‚Äôt give any warning? Even UOB sms stated the original amount from Airbnb,btohqsg
Is this normal across other banks?,btohqsg

So what are the local spend means? Online or physical card also can? If I want to pay via citipm,btohqsg
Yes  as long as the transactions are not found in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
Yes okay  but where should it be spent? online or physical chip card usage?,btohqsg
Huh how can we tell you where to spend? It depends on what you want to buy or need to buy right? What if I tell you to spend 800 at 7-11?,btohqsg
as long ( as many ppl have mentioned) not in the exclusion list,btohqsg
sorry msg sent out of order.,btohqsg
idk why the previous msg didn't send but it doesn;t matter for premiermiles,btohqsg
For premiere miles you will get the points for ANY KIND of method of payments: in store  online  apple pay Google pay as long as NOT in exclusion list,btohqsg
Hi  may I check that the snack by income payment is charge to which mcc code? Anybody knows?,btohqsg
Where can I find the exclusion list?,btohqsg
to add on transation need to be minimally 5 SGD,btohqsg
Citi PM don‚Äôt have $5 block,btohqsg
So no point to link it with AMAZE if your are using it in SG. To link with AMAZE is for foreign transaction. But there are other alternative cards with better MPD.,btohqsg
i need to redig the link but im almost certain it does. in fact  thsi should apply for most of the citicards,btohqsg
No this is incorrect. Citibank cards get miles for every dollar spent. You might have mixed up Citi Premier miles with UOB Prvi miles.,btohqsg
Is this the exclusion list for citi premiermiles card?,btohqsg
Okay  I should not be using the citi pm card here  right?does it apply for citi rewards as well?,btohqsg
I mainly use citi premiermiles just for citi payall promo.This exclusion list applies to all the citibank cards listed. There is a separate TnC for citi rewards also,btohqsg
Paiseh  but where do i find the icon ?,btohqsg
Uob one acc has been ard for quite some time  but u can be sure they will be quick to adjust their interest rate down fast once global interest goes down. So it depends if u wan to lock in ur interest rate in ssb for 9 years or bet the interest rate will stay high for the years to come.,btohqsg

Hey folks  anyone knows how long it takes for singsaver to handout the credit card rewards? applied for SC credit card for cash back in September but still no news yet..,btohqsg
Medisave withdrawals are subject to various limits. Generally  one can‚Äôt use 100% of their Medisave for operations so which is why it‚Äôs good practice to at least get a As-charged hospitalisation plan. Whether B/A wards or even private hospitals  getting one is better than none.,btohqsg
Medisave alone is not great but you can use it to give you additional health related coverages. If you want to learn more by your own  you can use these 2 links from MOH:1. Hospitalisation Plans (Integrated Shield Plans):https://www.moh.gov.sg/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/about-integrated-shield-plans2.

If you can hit $600 consistently then UOB EVOL  if you can only hit $500 consistently then UOB One.,btohqsg
UOB Lady's Solitaire  $120K annual income  2 categories  $3000 spend.DCS Cashback  5%  min $400 spend max $1000  Diners merchants only.,btohqsg

Investment tend to make wrong decision easily if u keep seeing daily and might panic sell,btohqsg

Generally fund are not stock  value wont drop to complete zero,btohqsg
Recently global market drop. So won't be surprised snack portfolio drop.,btohqsg
Save your heartpain and anxiety. Just use FD next time,btohqsg
The gist of this fund is invest for the voucher given and that it will cover the loss incur. This fund history dont look good and is in on downward trend since ineption in 2014,btohqsg
If withdraw during free look period it will cancel the policy. May also void the rewards right,btohqsg
High chance reward will be void and even if freelook it is based on bid price so might incur loss as well,btohqsg
Also because it promises to distribute at a rate of 4.5%-6% so it tied its own hands somewhat. Seems like it‚Äôs been able to achieve an average growth of 2-3%  and the distributions are what‚Äôs declining the NAV,btohqsg
This one is investment so wont refund full de even if freelook,btohqsg

Hi all  I plan to use ipaymy to pay my taxes but it's a little too late because IRAS will deduct from my GIRO on the 6th (next Mon since tomorrow is weekend)  will there be any negative implications to go ahead using ipaymy which will payout on the 9th (Tues)? I know the second deduction is on the 20th of the month but not sure if I will be charged for the unsuccessful GIRO deduction because my account is less than what they can deduct and wondering if the GIRO arrangement with IRAS will be canceled  cos they detected another payment mode   that is  through e-payment ipaymy - can anyone shed some light from their experience?,btohqsg
690 x6 miles is 4k plus then u divide by 2 is uni dollar  so the bonus is correct coz u need to factor in the base award earlier also,btohqsg
Can I check - does UOB One account needs to maintain $500 average daily balance monthly like OCBC 360 account ?,btohqsg
? Sorry I don‚Äôt get it üòÖ,btohqsg
need maintain 1k balance to avoid fall below fee,btohqsg
Hihi wan to check whether is it possible to open UOB one account as joint account for couple?,btohqsg
Does it mean if I have $1k in Jan  then Feb I maintain at 1k will do?,btohqsg
Should be fine even if late by a few days. But suggest to cancel GIRO arrangement once you setup ipaymy.,btohqsg
$5 fee if you don't meet $1000 adb.,btohqsg
Ok it‚Äôs confusing on adb üòÇ if I don‚Äôt have $100k to park in savings Acc   but I can spend min $500 cc and credit my salary or do 3 giro transactions   is it UOB one account still the best?,btohqsg
UOB One account is just credit $1.6k and $500 cc spend.You can refer to the table below on the interest rates tiers  if you have less than 30k  it'll be 3.85%. If you have $100k it's 5% EIR.,btohqsg
Should receive the bonus later this month,btohqsg
Oh I edited my text  I mean it‚Äôs confusing to monitor the average daily balance.. I‚Äôm using 360 which I think I can only qualify their salary 2% + save 1.20 % + spend 0.60% = 3.8 % .. sometimes If I can‚Äôt increase my saving by $500 per month I will only receive 2.6%?Whereas UOB I can earn 3.85% even if I maintain my Acc balance to be the same month to month right,btohqsg
What does maintaining account balance got to do with UOB One account? First 30k is 3.85%  as long as you credit $1.6k salary and spend $500 on eligible UOB ccIf you fall below $1k ADB  you'll pay $5.,btohqsg
Should be included right?Ez link doesn't mean SimplyGo transactions I guess,btohqsg
SimplyGo transactions are BUS/MRT and are considered contactless.,btohqsg

Hi. Anyone has AIA proachiever policy? I am paying $6000 premium per year. I think generally for all ILP needs to wait quite some time to see the returns? It is also because the hefty fees in the beginning. Mine incepted since Aug 2021. Does anyone bought it way earlier than me?,btohqsg
Can I check if I buy something with monthly installment of 100 bucks each with UOB one cRs. Will the 100 bucks be considered for the eligible spend of 500 bucks?,btohqsg
Or UOB will just take the spend of the full amount ( e.g 3k at the start),btohqsg
I have mine rejected until I updated my income. Your exp may differ. They seem more particular for this card - that is with spending history with them and deposits,btohqsg
Can check for UOB lady  if redeem biz with tax of around $300 in euro. Will still earn 6mpd,btohqsg
What method are you using for monthly installments?,btohqsg
lol. that guy sounded so convinced there were.,btohqsg
Yes if your category is Travel,btohqsg
totally excluded unless ur installment is via bnpl app like atome,btohqsg
Not jus the begining  u continue to pay very high recurring fees as long as u hold them,btohqsg
Seems like hard to breakeven unless the funds are super performing,btohqsg
Hi! For private hospital bill payment  which CC is good to get cash rebate? Does hsbc advance has any exclusion on it?,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong  AIA pro achievers stop paying fees from 13th years onwards. And u get annual bonus shares then too. So if u hold long term  would still make more sense compared to roboadvisors (which charges fixed rate on AUM indefinitely)Cheapest option is still ownself buy index. But for this  would not be as diversified as robo or AIA pro achiever and u need to be more consistent in DCA.Fund-related fees are all priced into the buy/sell price of the fund. So negligible diff between buying funds thru AIA  brokerage or other financial institutions. (Based on my knowledge),btohqsg
Where got stop paying fees one? The underlying funds  which r usually actively managed still charge u  typically a high fee with track record of losing to passive funds. If u think u r not charge any fees  it jus means u dunno how (and how much) u r being charged. Which is not surprising  cos insurers deliberately make it opaque,btohqsg
Yup I read is MIP of 13 years. Mine is version 1 the pioneer. Correct.,btohqsg
Refer to my last paragraph. I emailed AIA before  underlying fund fees are priced into buy/sell price  similar to brokerages when u buy directly urself.But feel free to email them to double confirm. Don‚Äôt take my word for it :) I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yeah I am not too smart to manage my investment. I have some blue chip stocks only. Hence I think getting one ILP is suffice. Diversify my portfolio instead everything in one.,btohqsg
U can do a simple excel table. Every year pay x% on AUM w an assumed growth rate for robo or brokerageDen compare that to aia  pay premium till 13 years den get bonus x% in shares  with an assumed growth rate too.See the results for urself. But ultimately  take heart  by investing ur money  u will be better off den those that don‚Äôt invest!,btohqsg
At least that getting one ILP is still a good thing. Even though everything is back to own preference  many still says they don't trust ILP.,btohqsg
Depending on ur risk levels  learn to spread out across different investments. ILP has high lock in period with no guaranteed returns. Other forms of investments include T-Bills  SSB  CPF related instruments. Weigh your options and see what works best for you,btohqsg
Personally I‚Äôm quite high risk  I do syfe‚Äôs equity 100. But I hold a small bit in ILP and in crypto too.But why I‚Äôm willing to do so high risk is because‚Ä¶ I have a long runway  I have sufficient insurance coverage and emergency fund for now.,btohqsg
Agree. I prefer FD and those capital guaranteed one. I guess the ILP just have it one that's it. Myself always anxious on fund performance. Getting another ILP is not for me already,btohqsg
Wow have a long runway? Not sure what is your age range if don't mind me asking?,btohqsg
ILPs and other instruments evolve w time. Companies are introducing new  relevant and more enticing investment opportunities that meet younger generation‚Äôs risk appetite.Always be open minded  look out for what‚Äôs being offered  and re-weight ur options. What used to be bad in the past  might offer good opportunities now,btohqsg
Mid 20s. But I‚Äôm working in finance so I suppose more well-versed in that area. Maybe that‚Äôs why I have higher risk appetite too,btohqsg
Agree. The proachiever version 3.0 is enticing. But we can't predict the future. If the ILP is well performing  might be regret to think back why didn't buy one more. Life oh life!,btohqsg
You got read the part on sum-at-risk? üò¨,btohqsg
I'm mid 30s. I should have been more adventurous at that age of 20s. I am at insurance sector,btohqsg
It's not at all enticing  the charges are disgustingly high. ü•¥,btohqsg
Yeah if not how insurance earn money sia,btohqsg
Fund related fees are typically charged by them selling ur holdings. Dosnt matter the mode of charging  still too expensive  esp considering nearly all these actively managed funds tend to underperform their cheaper passive counterparts  over the long term based on past data. And to buy it thru insurers that add another layer of commission/fee is worse.,btohqsg
Just only comparing ILPs  have other ILPs that charge way lesser charges. AIA charges the most.,btohqsg
Yeah. No turning back. I am quite regret to have AIA. Should have gone to FWD,btohqsg
Haha this discussion could go on and on. Ultimately  every investment has its pros and cons. It‚Äôs footnote and whatever.So best to read  understand and choose what fits your current situation. Know your risks  accept your risks  and potentially earn from it.Nevertheless  apart from safe investments like govt bonds/bills  or CPF  no one can predict the future abt how riskier investments would perform in long run.,btohqsg
Benefit charges are charged annually as long as you hold the policy (because there's a death benefit to it). The other charges that's standard to all funds  be it ILP or not  are the fund management fees.,btohqsg
Mine is pure ILP. Hence are the fund management fees,btohqsg
Also have one ILP plus protection. Well many said don't mix it cos the protection parts will eat up the fund value when gets older. I also bought it and no turning back. See how.,btohqsg
Pure ILP also have. You can check your contract. The older ILP have higher fees early on (first few years) but the overall fees actually lower. The marketing is real.,btohqsg
Hard to say‚Ä¶ I would assume an efficient and competitive market. What this means is‚Ä¶Generally if a fund charges more fees  could be due to marketing‚Ä¶ but that aside. It could also mean the underlying fund is more lucrative  or there or some bonus or benefits e.g. stop paying AIA fees from 13years onwards / bonus shares.If fees of an ILP from 1 company is cheaper than that of another company  generally there shld be a reason driving that. Look into the details and understand it.,btohqsg
Have a good weekend everyone! Don‚Äôt too stress over investments  do your due diligence and embrace the bumpy ride :),btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows what is the procedure to redeem UNI$ for krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
The underlying fund is better if they charge higher fee is simply not true.,btohqsg
I agree w your statement. That‚Äôs why I was careful in my message.I say more lucrative. I never say will 100% perform better. Higher risk  higher potential returns. Not guaranteed.Higher fees  generally means there‚Äôs a driving factor behind it‚Ä¶Thus  as I said in previous messages  read terms  understand what u are buying  and see what best suits ur needs,btohqsg
"But FAs need to also do their part to be more honest in their explanation of the terms and not just cover on the ""benefits"". I'm not fully against ILPs  I have them myself but need to DYOR before you commit to any.",btohqsg
Agree. I think individuals need to do their due diligence too. Don‚Äôt assume just because there‚Äôs an agent  den you don‚Äôt have to read up.But also  if you don‚Äôt ask abt smth  don‚Äôt jump and say it‚Äôs on the agent too. Everyone is responsible for their own money. Shared responsibility.,btohqsg

Hi  I have some healthcare payments that are regular. I go to routine TCM and Chiropractor and other medical services that are not hospital-based and are more elective.

Yes I applied online sometime last year! I applied for UOB One and UOB Krisflyer debit cards. I got the cards in a week. (But one of them didn't come with the pin code  so I went directly to the nearest UOB Branch to sort it out),btohqsg
I went to the branch at CCK. Staff are quite efficient.Would recommend writing down a list of questions for them to answer if you are unsure of some stuff. They are really helpful. Downside is the waiting time. Waited about 1.5 hours for my turn.,btohqsg
Actually can just change the pin of the card online. So can set your own pin without waiting.,btohqsg

Uob evol card is apply at the same time when you apply the uob one account?,btohqsg
i applied evol like 3 months after uob  one account,btohqsg

Via axs or which mode of payment if using uob card?,btohqsg
Just to simplify (pun intended)  all contactless VISA  MasterCard and NETS cards are auto-enrolled into the SimplyGo program. Just (paywave) tap in and tap out with your card. That‚Äôs all.The SimplyGo app is purely to track your journey  fare amounts and raise disputes. It has nothing to do with registering or anything.Please  oh please tap in and out with the same exact card. Physical tap in  physical tap out. Mobile tap in  mobile tap out. Watch tap in  watch tap out.,btohqsg
Physical card tap in  mobile tap out is equal to two separate transactions and you‚Äôll be charged higher‚Ä¶ mean you enter station / bus without exiting and you exit station / bus without entering  incurring maximum fares for both instead of one single fare. ü•≤Why? Because your card number is different on different device so system thinks you use different cards although it‚Äôs same card. Lol.,btohqsg
Yup.. that's where SimplyGo app comes in... Wrong device can use the app to claim back the extra charge for using wrong device.. they are very forgiving,btohqsg
True‚Ä¶ but with this knowledge (and lesson learnt for me)  can avoid inconvenience. üòÖ Almost SimplyNoooo when I see the posted statement.,btohqsg

Would like to check about CPF vcsa  I understand that we can contribute directly to our SA. Questions I have below:1. Are we still able to do VCSA after 55 when our SA went into RA?2. If we cannot withdraw $ from SA (after 55 and already met FRS in RA)  how can we maximize SA for our retirement?Thanks in adv for the advice.,btohqsg
Yup.  Seems that this is only way.  Thought can do it online.  But can't find the option from online.  Interest only 3.15.,btohqsg
RSTU*You can top-up RA after 55 till ERS. Anything topped up to RA will contribute to CPF Life payouts.Highly unlikely to still not be able to withdraw from SA if hit FRS in RA as they use the reserved funds first to form RA. To maximise is to leave it inside and get 4.08% p.a unless you really need it  instead of withdrawing all the available funds past FRS. You'll need to do shielding so that they'll use OA to form RA.,btohqsg

1) How much interest will you save from the lower/ better housing loan rates by placing the 200K in the bank. How comfortable are you with the 200K investing in higher risk instruments that generate returns which surpass the interest you are  saving by investing this amount vs. placing in the FI2) Corporate Bonds maybe ?

No. My time was also 10K. I called into OCBC. The CSO told me 10k and my spending for previous year was 9600+ or 9700+ so can't waive. I asked him only 200+ difference also can't waive? He said yes  cannot waive...üòì,btohqsg
You can try to go SCB ibanking site and login there and try register for egiro.. then select HSBC under bank.,btohqsg
Damn that's a sad sad promo,btohqsg
Hello! Any idea where in SCB ibanking it can be found? I‚Äôve looked everywhere in the webpage but could only find the manual GIRO form,btohqsg
Can't help you with that.. but based on the eGIRO guides  they all put similar steps:1. Go to merchant/billing organisation eGIRO registration page2. Select bank for GIRO arrangement3. Authenticate to bank4. GIRO process and ready,btohqsg
So maybe they support paying out from their bank but not paying into their cards.. so you're left with snail mailing or direct in branch.,btohqsg

1. Since you can refinance in March  your bank is proposing you put $200k for lower rates now? Is the lock in ending in March or that is the earliest you can refinance?2. 400k is a substantial amount but it is not that huge either  would you be open to put part of it into safer instruments and the remaining into higher risk ones?

Referring to the YouTube video from HoneyMoneySG on the best use of mileshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71s-Hass-yYI am a bit confused and seeking clarification.ADL to SIN costs $604 economy and $2768 on business. Miles is 30.5K and 68.5KSo including the $95 tax  that's(604-95)/30500= 0.016 cents per mile for Economy(2768-95)/68500= 0.039 cents per mile for BusinessDoes that mean that the business seat is more worth it because I am getting the value of almost 4 cents per mile?,btohqsg
Huh I have to spend $800 in SIA related then will entitle for 3mpd for my other eligible purchases such as Lazada / Shopee ah?,btohqsg
"For UOB KF card  ya  by *card year*So say your card expire in Apr  means Apr 2023 to Apr 2024  must have $800 SIA-group purchases (SIA  Scoot  KrisShop) then will count the ""shop online  etc. etc."" as 3mpd  to be credited 2 months after the card year)",btohqsg
Omg üò® on pt 1) it‚Äôs not eligible for $500 spend for this card (ok thanks  I really missed out this on my research üßê)On pt 2) even if I tag to Amaze  since UOb KrisFlyer CC is not under the list of eligible cards for UOB one account  I guess it will be useless to link to Amaze and buy my cat food and litter via Lazada right,btohqsg
2. Yes. End of day MCC is the deciding factor. But at least u will know what to use next time [ if wrong ],btohqsg
for Lazada and Shopee yes a bit pointless  Amaze is useful if you are doing retail shopping in malls then it can convert those like if shopping at LV or you go Watsons physical store then yes you link to amaze to convert to Online.,btohqsg
Ok let‚Äôs say I spend $5k and link with Amaze at LV store in Feb and by end of the calendar year then I manage to clock $800 min on SIA related group purchases  does my online purchases from LV and those previous months entitled for 3mpd ?,btohqsg
yes canThe Accelerated Miles will be awarded on these transactions for the entire membership year  not just from the time the minimum spend was met.https://milelion.com/2023/12/06/how-does-the-krisflyer-uob-credit-cards-accelerated-miles-feature-work/,btohqsg
Yes  redemptions for business class you will always get better value per mile than economy. But the actual value you get will come down to how much you would've been willing to pay in cash in the alternative (i.e. if you didn't have miles  would you have forked out $2.7k of your own cash to buy that business class flight? What is the max you would have been willing to pay in cash for that flight?),btohqsg
Bank haven't proposed yet.Most likely will split 400k up,btohqsg
The 200k idea is they propose one right,btohqsg
That's not correct  shopee and lazada practice dynamic mcc,btohqsg
1) Can shop around if you are prepared to refinance with others and whether your current income situation has changed compared to previous application.2) any thoughts about using maybe $200-$300k to offset the current mortgage to bring it lower?,btohqsg
meaning there is a range of mccs that could potentially appear  typically it is based on what you buy,btohqsg
Not sure worth bringing the loan amount lower. Will have to look at what is out there to invest,btohqsg
For 1. I assume you mean do a partial repayment of the mortgage? Or it's a different scheme. Right now bank will probably offer you around 3-3.5% mortgage rate  while you can probably get at least 3.5-4.5% investing in short-term/money market bonds externally. So from a pure reward standpoint I feel it doesn't make as much sense to do a repayment instead of investing. But of course if you value being debt-free earlier then by all means go for it.,btohqsg
Huh‚Ä¶ what does that mean? The MCC changes?,btohqsg
Ya thanks! Was thinking along this line,btohqsg

or alternatively if you've bought in the past and really want to know the mcc  you can ask your bank,btohqsg
Ok ya.. that‚Äôs the other way to work around it. or maybe use amaze link to empty wallet to buy sth from the particular seller  and see their mcc code? ü§î,btohqsg
Sure but do keep in mind that there is still a small chance it might change  even if you buy the same product from the same seller,btohqsg
Dats why usually people recommend to use a card that gives reward for online instead of specific mccs  eg dbs womans world/ citi rewards/ citi smrt etc,btohqsg
I‚Äôm using the hsbc revolution for the cc sign up rewards only ie $500 spend. What do yall think I should do with the points after? üòÖ(Have other 4mpd cards so I doubt I will use this card after hitting the minimum spend),btohqsg
Will there be enough points to convert to miles with just $500 spend? üòÖ,btohqsg
They wont know  it is randomly assign by lazada,btohqsg
Thanks for the explanation. So I would be unlikely to fork out the $2.7K. Max $1 500 for it. So what would you suggest given this  buying economy outright or biz class saver redemption?,btohqsg
Min transfer 25k points (10k miles)  you need to spend 2500 at least,btohqsg
Waa is there any use for 5000 points üòÖüòÇ idk vouchers or smth?,btohqsg
Why not just spend 2500 and transfer the points out?,btohqsg
The other way is to convert to 2.5% cashback (to offset future bill)  min 4000 points,btohqsg
In that case you‚Äôre still getting about 2 cents per mile value which is not bad  and better than economy redemption. By all means go for it :)Another way to think about this is - at 2 cents per mile  if you earned them on a 4mpd card you effectively got around 8% cashback  which is a pretty great deal considering to the current cashback card landscape,btohqsg
There is miles conversion program for hsbc revo  $43+ 12 months unlimited conversion. But if you only convert one time  may be ex.,btohqsg
Have anyone NOT receive their posb cashback bonus which was suppose to be paid every 7th of the month?,btohqsg
So then I should just use the cashback option  $500 x 2.5% I‚Äôll get $12.50 cashback then next month I‚Äôll just spend $12.50 on this card and use the cashback to offset this spend? üòÉ does it work like this üòÇ,btohqsg
No you can‚Äôt offset the $500 spend cos the points only arrive in following calendar month after the spend.So is you spend $500  pay it off.Then spend $13 once you receive the points  offset using points. Pay off the remainder if any,btohqsg
So instead of $600 ticket on Economy  I am willing to pay 2 cents per mile for Biz Saver  which is good?What I still don't get (apologies for this) is that the actual cost of the ticket ($2768-$95)/68500= 0.039 cents per mile for Business  but my max willingness to pay is$1400 for the ticket (1400-95)/68500= 0.19 cents per mile.I'm having trouble comparing the $600 dollars economy to the 68 500 Biz saver miles.Thanks for your help.,btohqsg
Hi any guru can advise on this üôè,btohqsg
It's not an apples to apples comparison because you're trying to compare economy and business tickets. How you can look at it is:Scenario 1: Taking economy  is paying cash (means I've chosen cashback cards) or paying miles (means I've chosen miles cards) better?Scenario 2: Taking business  is paying cash or paying miles better?- In this scenario miles is clearly betterBut it's a purely personal choice on whether for any given flight  you want to take economy or business. That would depend on many things like flight length  which part of your trip it is  lounge options  travelling companions  etc.,btohqsg

If you want to get the cashback then you'll be buying $800 worth of groceries from Sheng Siong every month..,btohqsg
Sheng Siong no minimum spend required,btohqsg
maybe you're thinking of citi cb 8% instead,btohqsg
but ya  uhm 200 not much. Can always try  if they reject cancel the card lor,btohqsg
Can try. I just saw someone's post saying they only spend $200 every month and able to get waiver. If digibot fail to give waiver just cancel lor,btohqsg
Good idea üëçüèª. Can I ask you a question üôãüèª free one year annual fee mean if next year Posb don‚Äôt let me waive off I can cancel the card and don‚Äôt have to pay anything right ?,btohqsg
Ya  your annual fee payment is always for the upcoming year,btohqsg
Oh do take note that for everyday card  they give their own points called daily $ and not direct cashback  so u have to manually redeem (offset paylah  credit card bill). Weird system but oh well,btohqsg
I haven't spent on this card for 4  5 years also can get waiver each year. Don't think they decide  or only decide by spending per month.,btohqsg
I think DBS is most forgiving for annual fee waivers,btohqsg
what about uob  I have ppv but I haven‚Äôt used it whole 2023 because it is not applicable for one account bonus interest üò¢,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs for 2nd year onwards  correct?,btohqsg
Yeah. Agree.. I think I got a POSB card for more than 10 years. Never made any spending on this card ever since I gotten the card. (It came with another credit card which I applied). The bank also waived the fee every year.,btohqsg
I think the most unforgiving one is OCBC,btohqsg

hi all  would yall recommend fcy spending for meals and groceries (e.g. in jb) using hsbc revolutions? would love to hear some opinions :),btohqsg
It is insurance mcc  suppose excluded,btohqsg
@O010stOp_98se_ndingsh_80643it188probably meant the spend requirement on the account  which in theory should qualify (assuming SNACK uses insurance MCC),btohqsg
Note the part on no card rewards though,btohqsg
If you are paying online with PPV  only whitelisted MCCs can get 4mpd.,btohqsg
Yes. It will qualify for UOB one ACCOUNT spending requirements  but not for cashback  miles or points,btohqsg

Quite confused  shopback signup  capitastar app and hsbc revo don't really have a direct relationship with each other?Best sign up reward for Shopback is probably the referral reward  you can ask a friend (or me) for a referral code - $5 if conditions metThen  you can link Capitastar app with Shopback app. No extra rewards  just gives you instant stars instead of having to scan the receiptYou can add your HSBC Revo card to Shopback so you can use it with Shopback Pay (and stack the Shopback Cashback + 4mpd if whitelisted mcc),btohqsg

From my understanding  BOC gives 6% cash rebate and 1.5% unlimited cashback without minimum spend.If annual fees cannot waive  it‚Äôs $32.40. But from what I‚Äôm hearing  not much issues asking for waiver.Before applying for this  please read up yourself about this card as I might be mistaken. üòÖ,btohqsg
I used Sheng Siong Diner‚Äôs Club but have so much difficulties asking for waiver and cancelling it.Finally cancelled it and never look back‚Ä¶ never gonna be a DCS customer again.
