And the AD knows that Volvo is planning to go all electric in a few years so they are trying to earn for as long as they can,btohqsg
Wearnes is known for their high margins on Volvos anyway as mentioned by Mr Xun earlier,btohqsg
so you know what that means right.Less maintenance means higher margin,btohqsg
