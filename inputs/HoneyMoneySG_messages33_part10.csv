Hi is there payment limit for paywave for ocbc 365 credit card?,btohqsg
The only trick I did when wanting to apply for CC is to see the required spending required and how many months they give to hit the min requirements. Then I just wait till the time I want to go holiday  I dump all the spending there from buying air tickets to booking of hotel. Then I get back the cash back. So far it works well for me.,btohqsg
"It depends on the cards also. Cos I don't take the ""atas"" cards cos I don't qualify.. hahaa",btohqsg

I thought I can use Amex -> GPMC -> EZlink then realized GPMC block when trying to add it as payment method in Ezlink. Sigh..,btohqsg
Yup. GrabPay get nerfed  and EzLink deliberately doesn't accept Amex cards for topup (despite using Stripe as their payment processor - who charges the same fees for Visa  MC and Amex),btohqsg
So GPMC basically block attempts to use it to top up ALL wallets?,btohqsg
How is much is grab paynow QR daily payment limit.,btohqsg
$5000 is the maximum you can spend a day,btohqsg

Only cimb comes into my mind when I see 10% 😂,btohqsg
it feel so surreal  i think it must have a min spend,btohqsg
Sure.  Thanks.  I will not ask further. 😊,btohqsg
Fairprice e-gift voucher counts toward grocery spend? Want to maximize my trust monthly and quarterly cashback 😅,btohqsg
if not mistaken  the spending must not be within FairPrice Group,btohqsg
Non-fpg spending I already completed. There is still 1200 potential quarterly linkpoints I can earn  so was thinking to buy vouchers and spend them next month. Most probably won't be using Trust for the next quarter,btohqsg
Guess I will have to try do a search and saw ppl asking but no reply also,btohqsg
Just realise I can pay singtel bills with credit card. Which card/s will be good for this?,btohqsg
Thanks. Is this considered online payment? Wondering if dbs live card works as well.,btohqsg
Hi guys  just a question  for HSBC Revo card. Understand there's a cap on the bonus points earned after crossing the $1000/ calendar month. But should still rcvd the 1point/$ spend right?,btohqsg

GPMC can be used at GTM to top up Ezlink card.,btohqsg
