When i can lvl up like the pros,btohqsg
Do like 16 jobs in 6 hours,btohqsg
I do 6 in 3 hours plus already max out liao how possible???,btohqsg
Run up to customer place at least 5mins wait them open door etc,btohqsg
6 customers = 30mins of handing food to them,btohqsg
Picking up also 5mins provided no food delay = 30mins for 6 customers,btohqsg
Assuming all short distance per drive also 10mins +/- ignore weather or traffic   fly mode   1 hour  parking anyhow park also need 3-5mins  make sure take correct order   tts another 30-45mins   like tt 6 orders already near 3 hours,btohqsg
the more relevant metric is average revenue per hour  not jobs per hour  or better  income per week or per month (per person  for team jobs.) Focusing on a number like 16jobs/6hours is very misleading. Burst rate earnings are not sustainable long term; you can work 20hours in a single day for a huge income spike but it's not sustainable.,btohqsg
