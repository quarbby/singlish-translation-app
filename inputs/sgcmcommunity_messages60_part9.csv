the raod tax difference is low,btohqsg
my eletricity bill per month is $80 only,btohqsg
and i drive like 24k a year,btohqsg
this alone is big difference already,btohqsg
dont need go malaysia and wait in the jam just to save petrol,btohqsg
uhh only E6 is below 130k,btohqsg
unless uw like a renault twizzer or smtg,btohqsg
Just get a standard model 3,btohqsg
Road tax is 2 k plus,btohqsg
Uhh expensive if you buy from wearnes. You go to stockist and purchase is much much cheaper. You have to understand car dealership business model is no long earning from selling you the car. They earn when you come back for replacement parts etc. Therefore i alw recommend volvo friends that are out of warranty to just get parts from unico or xinzhong.,btohqsg
Personally i have never seen volvo parts that are hard to get ah... unless u crash ur car then the internals like piston etc need replace but by then i think total write off liao,btohqsg
And yes  volvo resale is sh!t🥲🥲🥲,btohqsg
But you buy the car you love.,btohqsg
If you want to get volvo  better love the car  or pray that coe keep going up😂😂😂,btohqsg
I know somebody who bought v90 at 14k depre... coe go up up up  now V90 is at 22k depre,btohqsg
Buy and sell within 1 month  earn 20+k,btohqsg
No. Its acknowledge by bmw asia,btohqsg
But its the latest idrive 8. Dun affect the old 6 and 7,btohqsg
Something to do with gps. So it affect the i4 ix and the latest 218,btohqsg
If price goes down for you to get the deal done  and bmw commits to solve it for you as owner after the sale  perfect 👍🏼,btohqsg
Had this experience with my chery 😝,btohqsg
Lol. I am one of the earliest impacted by this. Did get a feeling They didnt treat me too seriously back and work on it slowlt then coz ix has low sales volume. But once i4 and the new 218 also on the new os  thr complain should come pouring in.,btohqsg
At very precise location the infotainment will reset. Dun know what logic. But thats how it is.,btohqsg
saw some 1 ix3 also need to be tow back  as the key dont work,btohqsg
Are they stockist? Am looking for parts,btohqsg
unico abit ex but i think have more relevant parts,btohqsg
A tree branch collapses on a very 'suay' BMW 116D after a lightning strikeLevel of 'suay-ness': Over 9000😰➡️ React with 😢 if you think the BMW driver is really suay!👉🏻 Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
share photo of your ride leh,btohqsg
Tbh  I like it too HAHAHHA-R,btohqsg
just need new wheels  suspension  bbk  exo  manual swap  stage 2+,btohqsg
this car has a very strong engine block,btohqsg
if you want can alw swap w S60r parts,btohqsg
Manual is out of the book,btohqsg
Am thinking of upstroking it 😂,btohqsg
yeah dont bother to bore ur engine block. S60r 2.5 tend to have cracked cylinder walls as the walls are too thin. When u use the S60R rods u will uprate to slightly more than 2.3.  then just tune and get bigger snails.,btohqsg
Also do take care of your automatic transmission,btohqsg
manual wld be better but auto is fine too,btohqsg
Plus urs is I5 tho  just straight pipe and it will sound good,btohqsg
for legal reasons this a joke ah,btohqsg
@xunxunxunxunbtw is it illegal to twin turbo a turbo car?,btohqsg
U meant already legal have 1 turbo but you wanna add another turbo?What do you think 😂,btohqsg
Apparently they only say you cant turbo a NA car,btohqsg
So which means is legal though,btohqsg
you can if the exact same engine comes from the factory w a turbo,btohqsg
volvo have inline 5s that came from factory NA and Turbo,btohqsg
its legal to turbo the NA,btohqsg
but u have the ensure emission are within legal limit,btohqsg
So can twin turbo a b55?,btohqsg
Don’t let anyone stop you from doing the things you like,btohqsg
LTA won’t stop you if your pocket is full of cash and you got a lot of time to entertain their bullshit policies 🤣🤣,btohqsg
