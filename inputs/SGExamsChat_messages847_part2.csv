are you using both malaysia's ringgit & singapore dollar  as a comparison model?,btohqsg
imo  it's not really a great alignment statistics tool but it's just a rough idea,btohqsg
kWh as units for power usage.,btohqsg

The only difference is that we have to pay tariffs and levy,btohqsg
Computer Engineering or Digital Systems and Design\,btohqsg
same here in Peninsular Malaysia  next July  15% electricity bill hike. jesus,btohqsg
can try  see whether you like your environment.But certain places in Europe  cost of living is so damn high.Like 20 Euros+ just for a simple meal.Also limited choice of options.,btohqsg
terrace  yes for meAbout $800 to $900 electricity bill monthly,btohqsg
That unit seems to be kWh not SGD ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
for my side is because there are 6 adults 4 kids,btohqsg
parent in laws + 2 helpers ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
if you're the only breadwinner of the family. Your family expenses surely quite high ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

cuz wife likes piano. She's going to take diploma exam soon,btohqsg
this I wish I learnt this earlier on in life. I mostly sink in the swimming pool haha,btohqsg
Realistically is it rly that useful for self defense?,btohqsg
cuz my son overly active. So I gave him an avenue to burn off excess energy without being destructive while leanring something,btohqsg
as long it doesn't end up hurting someone else ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
ballet for girls  flexibility. But stopping soon  not something to continue long term,btohqsg
