this one your territory tell me one,btohqsg
1.5 Astina for both hatchback and sedan,btohqsg
okay la i quite like it  1 step down is elegance,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve the highest variant 2.5 Mazda 6. Yet I donâ€™t use all the features,btohqsg
Upto one's personal preference  that's why they offer the different trim levels,btohqsg
I know a friend who's relative ordered a Kia cerato with fabric seats  no sunroof  no touchscreen,btohqsg
Well if you donâ€™t mind the lower power,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what a wise decision is. He knows what he wants.,btohqsg
For me I chose the 2.5 because itâ€™s more powerful and itâ€™s all the important safety features. Also sunroof. Although this is not main draw. I hardly use,btohqsg
How can you not love the looks,btohqsg
sunroof is good  drive through the CBD at night and wow... u will fall in love,btohqsg
Still nice to have  even if you don't open the sunroof itself  can open the sunroof blind for some natural light to come in,btohqsg
In any color itâ€™s a beauty,btohqsg
If only we got the new turbo variant in Singapore,btohqsg
Actually the more I look the more Mazda look like tesla,btohqsg
Ok I see many are now sold. Mazda,btohqsg
The back view is very similar,btohqsg
America and Australia sells only 2.0 and 2.5 litre version of Mazda 3. Previous Mazda 3 here had 2.0 litre SP / Sport. Unless someone PI current 2.0/2.5L.,btohqsg
If one is in that price bracket  it is an easy recommendation,btohqsg
correct  learning to road hog from Mr Road Hogger himself,btohqsg
Not at the current price but as the prices go up  they go up for the competitors as well,btohqsg
expensive lor  machine price can match mazda 6 already,btohqsg
Go for this jx volvo. No regrets. Makes heads turn,btohqsg
Lol just don't do that on the overtaking lane can already,btohqsg
Iâ€™d say more gorgeous than your volvo,btohqsg
i do that on all lanes  make sure everybody stuck behind me. I weave across 4 lanes along CTE to warm up my tyres,btohqsg
Mazda is a small company and theyâ€™re detailed oriented,btohqsg
Need to drive those mega truck to block all 4 lanes,btohqsg
My Volvo is here to stay though  its between Mazda 3 and Jazz,btohqsg
You drive this you block that floor-pedalTesla driver la.,btohqsg
Hold him in the fast lane,btohqsg
Please la. Honda jazz? No Honda here. Canâ€™t even come close in terms of style and looks,btohqsg
cheap abang... the car only here for 2 years,btohqsg
2 years later when coe go down will change again,btohqsg
Cheap ainâ€™t good. Buy a car you love.,btohqsg
honda is QUITE decent too leh,btohqsg
Honda is a good car no question. Just not stylish,btohqsg
you just wait for Julian's FD2R to come out on SGCM... video was filmed todayðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
I donâ€™t question Japanese cars like Nissan Toyota Honda in reliabilities. But car is more than just utilities,btohqsg
The new fit look so cute,btohqsg
And the new civic also look prettier,btohqsg
Old vezel looks good. New one errrrr,btohqsg
Look at the new fit and civic,btohqsg
Nice really  not the new one,btohqsg
i go into the car 3 times  knock my head 3 times,btohqsg
im not even that tall but i cant even fit in the middle seat,btohqsg
New civic looks good but I rather go for accord,btohqsg
YET in the jazz i could fitðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
oh i saw the civic 1.5T w the bodykit and SSR rims  looks splendid,btohqsg
That's y I said not good,btohqsg
