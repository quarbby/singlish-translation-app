paired with a good gearbox  simply lovely,btohqsg
for a luX tank like this  I prefer the GLS600,btohqsg
Which do yall prefer? The X6M or GLE63 AMG?🤔,btohqsg
im a merc fan sooo... gle63 amg 🤭 I don't really like the body shape of the X series,btohqsg
Any other options yall wanna include?,btohqsg
think cayenne turbo will be good competitor hahah,btohqsg
tough pick! but i would be happy with any of those 2!!,btohqsg
Price bracket lah sir.. disclaimer: not attacking you ah,btohqsg
admin (probably) deciding life choices on which one he prefers now 🤣,btohqsg
you own e63 don’t pretend la haha,btohqsg
Do you mean look wise or value?,btohqsg
Would be interesting to have a poll done,btohqsg
X6M  RSQ8  Stelvio QV  GLE63s  Cayenne Turbo,btohqsg
good shout! pretty sure its a competitor too,btohqsg
A bit off the price range?,btohqsg
most of the stuff is 600k+,btohqsg
Diesel can bah. Not too X.,btohqsg
but ya haha  underdog then? :P,btohqsg
not really  then need to compare what it competes with instead like cayenne base  q8  etc,btohqsg
not the higher performance variants of these,btohqsg
Someone sure come add Tesla Model X,btohqsg
coe 21k cheaper hit 600+k lor😂😂,btohqsg
Have y'all seen a Tesla Model X on our road before?,btohqsg
All between 650 to 750 ish depending on options as well,btohqsg
Only seen on YouTube by Germaine Tan,btohqsg
like a spaceship with wheels lol,btohqsg
if only singapore had more Model S,btohqsg
How was it in person? As impressive as looking at it through the screen?😆,btohqsg
I’ve been in one in HK,btohqsg
More impressive haha  those gull wing doors.,btohqsg
Definitely a cool piece of technology though,btohqsg
Gaps and didn’t feel that impressive closer up both look and feel wise.,btohqsg
Still very impressed by how those doors open up in tight spaces. Maybe can't fit in some of our MCP though,btohqsg
Just my personal opinion lah. Wonder if they have memory functions that limit how high they open?,btohqsg
the X is really quiet tho! been in an s x and 3 and the x is still my favourite,btohqsg
I can’t really compare coz when I was in one  we were mainly crawling through city traffic from hotel to restaurant,btohqsg
ahhh  hopefully tesla sg brings the X and S in soon,btohqsg
Just curious - are there things to mod on ev? Performance mods or like tuning?,btohqsg
stage one will be useless in this case sadly,btohqsg
but rims can make a ev look damn sick,btohqsg
Got ar u can google track,btohqsg
Many many carbon fibre for upgrade,btohqsg
i scared i say i get yellow card,btohqsg
but its bui bui forever alone,btohqsg
wah this one diff breed alr,btohqsg
Software nothing liao we are at stage 4,btohqsg

naturally a lot of torque also,btohqsg
maybe the ecu remap the battery to stage one when press that button haha,btohqsg
No just scare when I floor,btohqsg
