If you go Kyoto  donâ€™t go arashimaya bamboo forest. Overrated,btohqsg
I rly miss my Japan trip now,btohqsg
For Osaka Umeda sky building escalators are cool. Teamlab also has some very nice displays. Also try to findshotengai (what they call those long shopping streets that are usually sheltered),btohqsg
Also right if you want to buy cheap food at department stores (especially the Isetan at Kyoto station)  go just 30 mins before closing. The food hall would have shops selling perishables between 10-50% off,btohqsg
Ah planning go nara deer park,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t go sadly  but from what I saw from otherâ€™s ig stories it looks quite fun,btohqsg
Osakaâ€™s aquarium also seems quite nice,btohqsg

I also didnâ€™t go there lol  didnâ€™t have time but one of my sec sch chers did and it looked good,btohqsg

Kanazawa was quite nice too. Itâ€™s a city but much less crowded than Kyoto or Osaka,btohqsg

the best places r the chrome hearts shops in harajuku>>>>>>,btohqsg
Ah ok I guess families with kids or ppl who like art will appreciate more,btohqsg
Like 21st century museum of contemporary art in Kanazawa would be more appreciated by artists than ppl like me,btohqsg
only thing i enjoyed about japan was like the chill lifestyle,btohqsg
like the streets looked good and etc,btohqsg
