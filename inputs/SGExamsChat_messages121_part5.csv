Who uses the library to reference materials ah,btohqsg
If the books are like some rare materials I can understand,btohqsg
Sadly if non-incumbents have any thing undesirable in their past  the incumbent will hammer it in and broadcast it,btohqsg
The reference libraries will probably be empty,btohqsg

well point 3 is valid  point 4 isn't answering the qn and point 5 is not rly valid enough,btohqsg
The incident he points out is just ‘for example’,btohqsg
He’s saying that all the NS allegations about him are in the same class as this one incident,btohqsg
he didnt talked abt the part of NS when he came back drunk,btohqsg
point 4 is also a misdirection,btohqsg
he didnt address the claim of him being MIA at work half the time,btohqsg
I think point 4 is just straight up ‘out of topic’,btohqsg
Too many points he need to defend,btohqsg
Can help in the campaign tho,btohqsg
He can help PAP by joining opposition,btohqsg
