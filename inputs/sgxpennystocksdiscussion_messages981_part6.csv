Crude Oily🛢️ WTI steady at 69 on Fri(1)as markets assessed Israel & Hezbollah exchanged accusations of breaching e ceasefire agreement. These came just a day after e ceasefire took effect  reinforcing some risk premium to oil prices.(2)Further contributing to this risk premium  President Putin warned of a potential new strike on Ukraine using a nuclear-capable ballistic missile  following Moscow's recent large-scale attack on critical energy infrastructure.(3)Still  traders remained cautious as they awaited further insights into OPEC+'s production plans after e four-day postponement of a key meeting. At e rescheduled meeting on December 5th  the producer group is set to discuss whether to proceed with restoring supplies or extend production cuts into 2025 to avoid oversupplying global markets.,btohqsg
