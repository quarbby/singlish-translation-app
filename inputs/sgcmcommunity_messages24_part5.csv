Good afternoon Mr Anwo!Today's weather is very hot with a high of 33 and low of 27. Partly cloudy condition from 4-6pm but it will be all clear after 6pm. Do wear sunscreen as UV index is at a high of 8.,btohqsg
We are talking about computer failure or total loss of 12V power right?In the tesla you still can depress the brake because it‚Äôs linked to the Master cylinder,btohqsg
I wasn't very comfortable when E-brakes these days are called Electronic Brakes not Emergency Brakes.,btohqsg
Not sure if you are referring to EPB (electronic parking brakes). Emergency braking is still referred to as E braking in driving schools right?,btohqsg
I am referring to the computer responsible for overriding your input. E.g. Cruise controlNot the computer responsible for reading your input. You seem to misunderstood from the get-go.,btohqsg
I think you are the misunderstood one. The computer cannot override your throttle input if you mash on the brakes because the brakes are still linked to the master cylinder,btohqsg
Even if it applies full throttle and you hit the brakes it will come to a stop,btohqsg
I never mentioned electronically controlled brakes from the beginning. lol,btohqsg
The computer cannot override your input because your steering rack and brake pedal are still connected mechanically,btohqsg
I never said computers are controlling your brakes. lol,btohqsg
Nope but there‚Äôs drift mode and you can set the amount of power to the rear like dccd,btohqsg
What about steering rack. It will become hard to steer when power is cut off to motor,btohqsg
can a model 3 tow ah? since it has such large amt of torque,btohqsg
What I am refering the event of Tesla feature is that the drive by wire throttle failed to disengage when they should be previously.,btohqsg
Hence I‚Äôm telling you there‚Äôs not steer by wire or brake by wire! How can it be overriding,btohqsg
Is it still possible steer? I can‚Äôt steer mine too hard,btohqsg
U compare a ice and a ev car,btohqsg
Then tell me how does a tesla do auto lane change. You funneh eh,btohqsg
"""When they should be previously""Do you mean it happened before?",btohqsg
time to hit the gym MrX  its bulking season,btohqsg
You still can press on the brakes right? What about in the case of Toyota unintended acceleration? They didn‚Äôt step on the brakes? Lol,btohqsg
Both are cars  both got 4 wheels. The differences are minor,btohqsg
Chicken and duck talk.Without understanding the technology or implementation üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes  but the failure points to the situation where you pressed the brake but ECU controlled throttle are still kicked in due to failure.,btohqsg
aiyo i sense a heated argument incoming  please calm down and if ur car ECU decides it want to crash  just sit and prayüôèüôè,btohqsg
So what you are saying is what if the tesla apply full throttle in case the ecu fail? LOL,btohqsg
It is ok la  you have fun. Lunch time is over. lol,btohqsg
No shouldn‚Äôt you depress the brakes? Lol,btohqsg
At first say drive by wire  then say ecu controlled throttle kicked in due to failure? Lol I think you the fun one leh,btohqsg
thanks will take note of this suggestion,btohqsg
It is ok  you are taking things out of context. have fun.,btohqsg
There is a small motor that can give minor steering angle adjustments but the motor cannot out power you hand strength.Same thing  so many modern cars have auto park ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Good afternoon Mr Xun!!! I was actually greeting Mr Hannsum but I'd like to wish you a very good afternoon now too!!!,btohqsg
Like it or not you just don‚Äôt like tesla and try to spread misinformation without doing prior research! Have a good day,btohqsg
I did not  you are putting words in my mouth  mr right.,btohqsg
how to tow a Tesla ah?,btohqsg
Weather report time: It is 1:57pm and temperature is 31 degrees celsius. Humidity is 64%.,btohqsg
You may not know this but1. In the past  the throttle pedal is a cable linked to the throttle plate. When stepped on  it pulls on the cable and opens the throttle plate  more air rush into the air pipe  the maf detects the flow and adjusts the injection and ignition accordingly2. Drive by wire replaces the cable with a 5v pedal. When pedal is depressed  it goes from close to 0v to 5v. This in turn   turns the throttle plate based on the throttle senseAlmost all modern cars use this concept of Drive By Wire - electrical wire lol,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt confuse him lah. The steering can auto lane change. Maybe got genie between the wheel and the rack,btohqsg
Please remember to use your 6 drops of sunblock from me.  Otherwise your smooth long legs turn tan.,btohqsg
Put in tow mode. But it is recommended against towing with wheels on the ground. So flatbed or dolly. Same with any rwd awd car,btohqsg
no like tow using a tesla,btohqsg
the tesla is the strongboi towing,btohqsg
i like tow using a tesla,btohqsg
Got towhook in front and there are hitches for towing behind,btohqsg
this is hot  just like the weather. Please drink more water to keep yourself hydrated,btohqsg
thank you. i sense everyone should take a deep breath and go drink some water.,btohqsg
"For context  The ""tesla failure"" I am referring was this.I am no super expert but that does not give you any rights to passive aggressively insult other members.Have fun.",btohqsg
Well I‚Äôve had screen freeze before. The brakes and steering still work. Just telling you the facts but you might not be keen to listen as it‚Äôs too unsafe lol,btohqsg
feels like 40 degrees today sia,btohqsg
