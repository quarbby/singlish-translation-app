No you’re not the doctor  if you’re going to needlessly turn things nsfw you’re Tharun,btohqsg
Have you ever read Asterix in Switzerland?,btohqsg
Unfortunately unavailable in the library I am panic borrowing in,btohqsg
After I finish my assignments and exams,btohqsg
Why the hell do I still need to worry about these in a pandemic,btohqsg
not with your bunk mates ah,btohqsg
becuz if u dont ur graduation gonna get delayed,btohqsg
at least u not worried abt ur livelihood or how to pay the bills how to support ur family during times of high unemployment,btohqsg
It doesn’t if I die in this pandemic because I need to go out to get my resources,btohqsg
u could die anytime anyday doesnt mean u stop ur life completely and live in fear or whatever,btohqsg
best advice to those going through an existential crisis,btohqsg
hehehe i can finally transcode 4k movies in real time after upgrading to ryzen 7 8c16t,btohqsg
but actually i realised no need for that because my tv has the ability to do it,btohqsg
wanna pull a big birthday thingy,btohqsg
my main comp is a r5 2600,btohqsg
then my plex is on a i5-2320,btohqsg
but hey at least i has the POWAAAAAAAAAA,btohqsg
ok my plex is on an i5 4690k,btohqsg
which is not nearly strong enough,btohqsg
so i run another plex on my windows machine just for 4k stuff,btohqsg
do u figure an i5-6400 would be decent enough,btohqsg
i got a spare 6400 lying around lmao,btohqsg
u mean even with a 6400 I can't play 4k smoothly?,btohqsg
if you have a gpu you can do it easily,btohqsg
but for plex to utilise gpu encoding you have to pay,btohqsg
but 6400 by itself is a no ah,btohqsg
it works well on like a single movie on 4k,btohqsg
everything else just stutters and lags,btohqsg
so on my i5 4690k server i have samba shares to my movies  then on my windows which is on ryzen 3700x i map the network shares to the 4k folder and run a plex server on it to reference that folder,btohqsg
but both are running 24/7 ah,btohqsg
if i really want to watch the 4k movies then i'll manually run the plex server on my windows,btohqsg
but the server is running 24/7 and 1080p no issues,btohqsg
"tbh my tv supports ""plex direct"" so there's no need for any sort of cpu work on the plex server",btohqsg
it just sends the file directly and the tv does the decoding,btohqsg
is that an option that I have to choose?,btohqsg
or isit auto if the TV supports it,btohqsg
i'm using a samsung smart tv  so i dl the plex app on it,btohqsg
then it just works out of the box,btohqsg
so what os are you running on it,btohqsg
doesn't seem like it's working. CPU is still pegged at 100% but it ain't lagging,btohqsg
(also it's in MKV  maybe that's why),btohqsg
Hmmm when you playback the media file on your tv  you find the info buton,btohqsg
Yeah my files are mkv too,btohqsg
Under the info button there should be a field that says direct enabled or not for the playback,btohqsg
Are you now a certified command line guru,btohqsg
"it does say ""transcoding - dolby digital""",btohqsg
soooooo maybe that's a sign? LOL,btohqsg
Ok that means the audio stream is being transcoded,btohqsg
no HAHA desktop  I got a monitor at the side for it,btohqsg
Still way better than using windows any day lmao for these kind of services,btohqsg
