Over the weekend  I received a question from a viewer seeking my opinion on whether his CPF strategy is good. Usually I don't take up such requests because it is personal finance advice (which I am not qualified to give) and secondly  it takes up my time to think and respond.Nevertheless  I try not to give personal advice 1:1 as I want to benefit everyone instead of a personal advice  and also I am not your financial consultant. But since  he/she has taken the time to write a long input  I took some time to read it and give my comments on that in this group,btohqsg
Aim:1) Before 55; to hit FRS.RSTU-SA $8K/year for 5yrs = $40k. Subsequently  stop RSTU since RSTU $ is reserved for RA and cannot be used for investment and will serve to meet the $40k minimum SA needed before excess SA above $40k can be used for investments.Hit BHS so that excess mandatory contributions above BHS flows into SA and yearly MA interests above BHS flows into SA.Keep 1st $20k in OA to earn 3.5%; base 2.5% + bonuses 1%. Excess OA above $20k invest into Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500 and/or OA-to-SA transfer.End result  my SA will have only $40k worth of reserved RSTU SA top-ups while the rest of the funds in my SA is unreserved and can be used for shielding.My response: The thought process is correct  but optimally is less than $40K because of the compound interest effect. In fact  if you're age 30  only need S$16K at 30 to compound to $40K at age 55,btohqsg
2) At 54yrs 11 mths; shield SA  meet FRS (BRS + Housing pledge)Keep minimum $40k in SA (made out of my reserved RSTU anyways); invest the rest into Nikko AM Shenton Bond Fund  1 mth before turning 55.Liquidate just enough Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500 back to OA to meet BRS. Remaining amount to meet FRS can be met with housing pledge.My response: CPF SA shielding understanding is correct. You either hit BRS or FRS  but it's only important when you want to withdraw money out of CPF (above the FRS or BRS).,btohqsg
3) At 55; wait for RA to be formed and let CPF do it's thing. Doesn't matter if never hit FRS 'coz hitting FRS only unlocks ability to withdraw funds above it  if I don't intent to withdraw  then it's alright.My RA would have met FRS i.e. 2x BRS where (BRS made out of $40k SA and remaining from OA) + BRS shortfall met with housing pledge.My OA would be $0 with the rest shielded in Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500.My SA would be $0 with the rest shielded in Nikko AM Shenton Bond Fund.My response: Yes  correct.,btohqsg
4) 1mth after 55; resetting my CPF OA & SA.Unshield SA funds in Nikko AM Shenton Bond Fund back into SA to earn interest.Unshield $20k from Endowus CPFIS-OA S&P500 back to OA to meet the minimum $20K requirement for investing.My response: Correct. but don't have to wait 1 month. Can do it immediately after your RA is formed (Birthday),btohqsg
"That's all for now. This viewer has several strategies after age 55. But I do not want to discuss that because:1) To me  this age is very far away and policies/strategy has to adapt and change over time2) It involves something called ""Double Shielding"" which is beyond my knowledge and understanding.I'll let this viewer ask the question to the group if he/she still needs the answer. But I guess CPF is very complicated and my understanding for now is sufficient from Step 1-4. In future when I'm reaching that age (long long later)  then we can discuss more.",btohqsg
Now got 1 app called ugift  they giving out free $5 grabfood voucher for new signups,btohqsg
But becareful if you share their referral code  it shows your hp no.,btohqsg
just my take on cpf shielding  we never know when/if this hack will ever be removed. if it does  it will cause a whole shift in our plans. thus  i do not want to put much emphasis on this for *my own* planning,btohqsg
they may close off this loophole to save the 1.5% as more and more people are learning about it - just a thought,btohqsg
no worries  CPF rules will always change.It use to be after 55  both OA and SA can be withdrawn in sequence  now u can only start withdrawal from SA followed by OA because the SA interest rate is higher.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I saw your video on transferring ETH from FTX to Hodlnaut. However when I tried it  ftx Pro says I can't transfer to my own address. Can I check what I should do?,btohqsg

Not sure if they already blocked this hack as I have not been doing it recently,btohqsg
Oh there's a much simpler way now,btohqsg
Select subaccount transfer  then choose from main account transfer to ftx app. No fees and instantaneous,btohqsg

Hi  I did a lum sum CPA OA to endowes investment  it went well. And the other day I did another 1 time investment from my OA into the same goal. But I was charged $3.61 for access fee.,btohqsg
Do anyone know what is happening?,btohqsg
Looking to invest my SRS fund. Any recommendation which platform charges lowest fee?,btohqsg
Access fee is what Endowus charges you quarterly. The usual $2.14 or $2.68 is CPF-IS Bank fee,btohqsg
So how do I pay them?,btohqsg
How is the Endowus Access Fee paid for?CPF/SRS are charged in the following order:If you have available access fee credits  we will first deduct the fee amount from your access fee credits.For the remaining payable access fees  we will charge the fees by redeeming from your investment holdings.https://endowus.com/support/360000515273-what-is-the-endowus-access-fee-how-is-the-endowus-access-fee-calculated-and-paid-for#h_01F77WBVJKF0Q9601WGRV9Y62D,btohqsg
