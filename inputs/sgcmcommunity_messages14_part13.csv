Different consumers  different levels of comfort,btohqsg
"Searched ""used car escrow singapore"" and found this onlinehttps://diycars.com/Not related to them in any way but its interesting that they listed $100 000 escrow service. Not many in Singapore do this.",btohqsg
I would scrap warranty but would recommend where to service or fix lol...that's where chat group is important,btohqsg
"Actually not that hard as more and more workshops have access to obd tools to read car ECUs and access information. Alongside this  a lot of ""authorized dealers"" themselves have been caught Rolling back miles around the world. One such example is Ferrari dealers and Porsche dealers  and they are able to do so with pretty much all their cars  old or modern.For the older cars  it may be harder to detect if anyone has tampered with the odometer however if you go to a specialist workshop to conduct your PPI  they are able to tell this by using other methods of physical verification",btohqsg
Valid point. But I guess it depends on the scale of the business. If you are not looking at quantity and doing it to fill a gap  then I think it might be possible.,btohqsg
Yupp  can be possible. If you know your car's and products well and can make the customer trust you  anything is possible,btohqsg
Yeah a lot of planning to do. Do support little bro me then üòÇWhat holding costs are there btw? I can think of road tax  insurance  parking  petrol etc. Any costs relating to the business aside the car? Licence fee?,btohqsg
I've personally seen both types of dealers  those who really know about every car on their forecourt even though most used car dealers don't. And also those who just say  see here is the car  you want or not?,btohqsg
As consumer I see it as additional costs  but if the warranty is tamper proof I would buy such a car,btohqsg
Petrol isn't that big a cost as you wouldn't be driving around that much. Many dealers do keep their cars uninsured as well  that's why if you go by to try and test drive  they say carpark drive only. The other hit you would probably take is the actual depreciation on the car as the longer you hold it  the more money you are losing,btohqsg
LoL I myself also addressed a white elephant earlier about merchants that mark up no. of sales. Let's be honest here and point them out for the admins to look at and address them. Else it's just a chat group for grumbling and lobangs,btohqsg
I think you got most of it but you will need to consider company/business name  accounting  GST  advertisement costs and yes  licence fee. Don't know what  who or how this license works.,btohqsg
Transfer count is also a misconception that devalues a good car,btohqsg
They are mainly a community forum and platform sir. Biz need to run their biz for their investor returns too. I do agree let‚Äôs try to reduce grumbling and encourage more factual talk. Lobangs are ok bah‚Ä¶ helps readers save money?,btohqsg
LoL I'm that type. If ask me about the car's performance  I would say do your own research cos I find it's pointless to ask when it can be bs by the dealer,btohqsg
And to be realistic  all things mechanical can and do fail and the risk is there from the first engine turn. Important i guess is how the seller works with the buyer to resolve issues.,btohqsg
Oh I see  uninsured is allowed if dealer,btohqsg
But I'm referring more about dealers not knowing about what they have at all like the car  what it's known for  what spec is it  etc. So they don't know about the car  don't know what could be broken before they buy and then they proceed to sell without allowing for PPI,btohqsg
So those are some dealers that I liked to stay away from,btohqsg
I think a responsible dealer would have it checked by the workshop then understand from their technical point of view  the rest lol is such chat group,btohqsg
Sometimes their workshop no good as well,btohqsg
Cannot cater to all cars  so one must really look into the car and the dealer before buying if they're trustworthy or not and how easy it'll be to resolve disputes later,btohqsg
Maybe can have a rating system by dealer‚Äôs customers. So potential buyers know what to expect. The industry can also get rid of rotten apples.,btohqsg
Have  Google reviews. Easy to manipulate though,btohqsg
Reviews on sgcm also but again  reviews are always easy to manipulate,btohqsg
Some bad 1 is because of customer issue   some good 1 are fakes,btohqsg
Then  gentlemen  we have not yet found a feasible  practical and trustworthy rating mechanism. Work in progress,btohqsg
Rating mechanisms will never be completely trustworthy due to human input and emotional factors influencing them  however they can act as mere guides,btohqsg
I seen too many time barbaric customer demand for ridiculous request and did not get it   and give 1 star,btohqsg
you are in a good mood today!,btohqsg
Cause I slept on sofa yesterday,btohqsg
always nice to have a peaceful night without having to fight for the blanket.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why recently as Singaporean we need to review this notion  ‚Äúcustomer is always right‚Äù and ‚Äúcustomer is King‚Äù. Customers these days are really out of hand,btohqsg
Hello. I‚Äôm driving an e200.Dashboard is showing that my tpms is not detected. The tpms is the original one. Can provide some advice?,btohqsg
Tyre sensor battery might be dead.,btohqsg
all four at the same time?  could also be battery as eric said and not sure if they are sealed units without possibility of battery replacements unlike some of the 3rd party ones.,btohqsg
Thanks guys. I googled based on ur reply and highly likely is the tpms battery!,btohqsg
That why working in service industry is really tough haha,btohqsg
