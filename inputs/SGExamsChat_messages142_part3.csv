Chem easier than physics for me,btohqsg
But got some chapters i hate a lot,btohqsg
Vector diagrams are a pain in the ass,btohqsg
I like waves and thermal properties,btohqsg
Esp got the pressure distance graph for the wave,btohqsg
Just see the positive and negative displacement,btohqsg
HAHAHA thrs like a song for it,btohqsg
I learnt it in sec2 till now still canmot understand,btohqsg
Isnt that for displacement time graph,btohqsg
Real radiowaveMan microwaveIn infraVietnam visible lightUse ultra violetXtra X rayGun gamma ray,btohqsg
The visible light got idk how many colours so he came out with this,btohqsg
R redO orangeY yellowGive greenBirth blueIn indigoVietnam violet,btohqsg
Arent those the colours of the rainbow,btohqsg
Cuz when thr is dispersion of light,btohqsg
Each colour of light have different wavelength,btohqsg
Wah idk i never learn that,btohqsg
My cher only said the spectrum and shit,btohqsg
You can check out youtube for videos,btohqsg
can someone help me w maths,btohqsg
I believe this should be posted in the A or O/N levels chat groups,btohqsg
With the question and your attempt,btohqsg
sorry where do i find the group,btohqsg
hii  anyone has tips on how to do well for chem prac? iâ€™m always failing it :(,btohqsg
Memorize test reactions and study/memorize all experiments illustrated in textbooks,btohqsg
Study your notes and practical assignments done in class too. You will come to realize the same principles and things tested always repeat themselves. there is a pattern one,btohqsg
Bro 30 aug today. U have at least 1 more month. Go study now. With 500% focus. GO.,btohqsg
Tbh it's ok if u do badly for pracrical,btohqsg
Practical doesnt hold a big weightage  and the main area u must score should be paper 1,btohqsg
Cos u literally write letters ABC D to get tonnes of mark,btohqsg
Not saying that u shouldn't study for it  but it's meant as an additional help to ur overall grade  not the main determining factor,btohqsg
For me no matter how I study for pracr in sec sch  somehow always lose 10+ mark,btohqsg
I only can give tips for titration,btohqsg
But I compensate it with Paper 1 and paper 2,btohqsg
Also  my teacher also kept telling me,btohqsg
About the mark ratio or smt,btohqsg
Like ur 1 mark in MCQ,btohqsg
Give u more percentage in ur overall,btohqsg
I just take everything for chem srsly,btohqsg
So for titration the volume usually used is abt 20 cm cube to 30 cm cube so at your first titration shoot out all the liquid in your burette into the conical flask containing the indicator,btohqsg
Also notice if the liquid in the conical flask takes a longer time to change its colour to its original colour  it is hinting you to do dropwise.,btohqsg
A word i haven hear for long,btohqsg
For the pipette  everytime you wanna get the last drop of liquid out but the teacher told you to hit the tip against the conical flask to get the last drop,btohqsg
Cuz your red thingy on the top of your pipette  inflate the thingy and squeeze it hard and it will force the liquid out,btohqsg
For the graph my teacher uses this format to mark which is SCAB,btohqsg
S means scaleC means coordinateA means axisB means best fit,btohqsg
my colour change always wrong leh  like the colour is always too dark (?) then i always need to redo. :(,btohqsg
Hmm you will probably get the white tile,btohqsg
my hands fat la  slow reaction ya HAHA,btohqsg
++ for titration  need to take 2 readings that are similar right? my readings are always quite diff de. should i redo or jus anyhow choose a number,btohqsg
Like what i just said do a rough titration,btohqsg
