Not really as there may not have any due diligence conducted on those hired so as not to waste resources to check on their creditability. Maybe and Unless something happens  then they conduct checks to find a valid reason to fire them.,btohqsg
Problem is many are working in the garment sector and no checks are conducted. You are absolutely right. Garment hire and MoM no need to check. If found out  garment will be embarrassed then.,btohqsg
