iirc is submit to the sch then they help submit,btohqsg
ok i mean like the boy i told u guys about he also on our team then he throw the ball to her and its a very easy ball to catch but she still couldnt catch itand its not his problem cause he throw to other people all can catch but for some reason she alone cannot catch,btohqsg
Wait in sec sch guys also incline pull up ah,btohqsg
The size of what.. your hands or like height?,btohqsg
Oh the teachers like me one cuz I don't slack,btohqsg
ok then u should be fine ig,btohqsg
wait are you a student athlete,btohqsg
I'm literally the least fit in class but I tired so she usu leave me alone üíÄ,btohqsg
ik tm doesnt have but for us boys and girls play tgt,btohqsg
for games we play together but fitness is like separate gender,btohqsg
Maybe i alr dl her so every little thing she does pisses me off,btohqsg
Wow for mi it's normally separate but uk for certain  pe activities we just mix,btohqsg
i mean if can choose team the 5 guys in my class usually band together,btohqsg
if can choose then i would def play with my friends and not owngoaler,btohqsg
My sec sch is also by gender one so,btohqsg
Teacher: Ok guys find a team  we going to play basketballStudent: I have no teammatesTeacher: You can pair with the wallüíÄ,btohqsg
no shit what her class quite active one,btohqsg
I mean in sec school and even poly  the pe Teachers like there for the sake of being there üíÄ,btohqsg
One of my sec school pe Teachers was headmaster,btohqsg
oh uh the prev DM is it,btohqsg
he actly q nice in person,btohqsg
ngl i feel bad for the kids who get ostracised but if can choose i think the owngoaler has her own friend group,btohqsg
so if the owngoaler play with her own friends they happy i play with my friends we happy then its win win,btohqsg
Had a teacher that was nice to guys only  it was a female teacher,btohqsg
Literally birch ass attitude to the girls,btohqsg
Constantly give side eye  constantly scold them for seemingly minor mistakes but every time come to guy  can ‚Äúhold hand‚Äù‚Ä¶sayang them  motivate them with small words of encouragement etc,btohqsg
Wah if a teacher were to do that wah i want sia,btohqsg
do you think she is creepy?,btohqsg
I mean based on what he said  personal boundaries seemed to be outta the qn,btohqsg
All I‚Äôll say is she don‚Äôt act her age,btohqsg
Btw to the others  it not the overly sexual chem teacher I‚Äôve mentioned countless times here before,btohqsg
I rmb in the class grp chat  when she interact with girls and boys also very diff.When she talks to girls  literally be like the strict no nonsense kind but talk to guys is like ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù ‚Äúbaby‚Äù‚Ä¶everybody was like wtf,btohqsg
‚ÄúSweetie  report the class attendance to me tmr by 10‚Äù Eeek,btohqsg
Fun fact: none of the guys like her. My class had like 20+ guys,btohqsg
Anyway sorry to interrupt but i rlly need help finding my friend  i actually made a post alr everywhere but just asking if anyone knows how to find him if idk his name üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Imagine being a female teacher and hated by 20 guys in a classroom‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt rmb the last time that happened. Even the worse of auntie Teachers don‚Äôt kenna so much hate,btohqsg
Idk his name? What you finding with then,btohqsg
Exactly man thats the worst part cuz it makes everything so hard,btohqsg
I know his sec sch and his course in poly now,btohqsg
And a lot of other specific details just not his name üòµ,btohqsg
So you know him by face is essentially what you are saying,btohqsg
Yea kinda but not exactly  cuz i have some pretty good descriptions of what he looks like but ive never rlly seen him before,btohqsg
No I can sense that off the bat. Don‚Äôt know his name but know his physical description,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like finding a unicorn in a sea of horses,btohqsg
I got a feeling this other person don‚Äôt know them ngl,btohqsg
We‚Äôve been talking for almost a year alr,btohqsg
So online friend and now you want to find him irl,btohqsg
But then last week i accidentally ended the chat so im trying to find him does that make sense,btohqsg
YES i dont even have to find him irl i just need a contact or a name or smth,btohqsg
Your clues to finding this person is as good as this person right now,btohqsg
Okay yea i see what u mean,btohqsg
Small group of individuals would only know who he actually is based off traits or things he could have done to make him unique from the rest  sadly that group of individuals is not here,btohqsg
This guy in this discord is the definition of ‚ÄúDelusion: The one that got away‚Äù,btohqsg
I mean i did try asking the temasek poly reddit so hopefully that works,btohqsg
That tele grp is dead I thought,btohqsg
Wait what theres a tele grp for tp,btohqsg
I just posted smth at r/temasek poly,btohqsg
Meanwhile my poly grp  someone joined and posted a link to a sex vid and my poly admin thought it was a rape awareness video üíÄ,btohqsg
Oh I thought they meant the one from last yr,btohqsg
Oh how do u find that,btohqsg
Do u have a crush on that person,btohqsg
Nah I bet they are like that discord person ‚ÄúI want to find cause funny‚Äù,btohqsg
Yea i want to find cuz funny üòî,btohqsg
imagine if the person is right here,btohqsg
It just sucks when a good friendship gets ripped out from under u uk idk man,btohqsg
Ah ok so what‚Äôs the purpose of finding out his real identity? Cause you are curious and just for fun? Like what I‚Äôve basically said,btohqsg
I guess i just rlly wanna talk again,btohqsg
Cuz we‚Äôd been talking every single day up till last sunday when the chat suddenly ended,btohqsg
huh whats gg on can u tldr,btohqsg
Basically im trying to find my friend whom i lost contact with last week and i dont have his name ü•∏,btohqsg
These two people are basically our reaction to your sit,btohqsg
BRUH yea i see that üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Wait no im quoting the person who sent it,btohqsg
I think they are laughing cause they realise their sit of finding their person is as hopeless as this person‚Äôs in the discord,btohqsg
Ngl but I thought when they don‚Äôt reply you in 1 week..that‚Äôs alr ghosting?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs literally what I‚Äôve sense  they want to find the person but they donot go csi mode. Prob just curiosity kills the car type of situation,btohqsg
Dm me don‚Äôt send here if it‚Äôs a face,btohqsg
Okay so teletext is some random bot i found last year when i wanted to find someone to kick me in the ass and make me motivated to study for exams  then i matched w him and we just continued talking till last sunday  but then the chat suddenly ended,btohqsg
Like it doesnt make sense why it would suddenly end when we were talking just fine minutes before,btohqsg
Oh bruh it‚Äôs one of these,btohqsg
Wait they lasted a whole yr?,btohqsg
Yea i was a bit hesitant to show but idk how else to explain,btohqsg
Yo kuro I may have just found the luckiest or unluckiest anonymous chatter,btohqsg
Thats very reassuring to hear ü´†,btohqsg
I‚Äôm speechless  someone spent 1 yr texting someone else on a anonymous chatting bot,btohqsg
You do realise this is like going to the Omegle chat function and talking to that one person for 1 yr,btohqsg
It‚Äôs insane y‚Äôall kept it up for 1 yr,btohqsg
Does ur friend happen to be my friend üòî,btohqsg
Yea but its more insane that we didnt bother asking for names,btohqsg
I mean honestly after a yr  he still did not reveal his Identity. It‚Äôs a door closed alr  yea it sucks to loose a friend like that but you will learn to move on eventually,btohqsg
Least you look like a stalker so better to be safer than sorry,btohqsg
Then maybe ill just be delulu and hope that hes trying to find me too üíÄ,btohqsg
I‚Äôve had to just delete several Skype chats cause the other party was like a dead fish  some of them we had fruitful convos for like Months  life move on it‚Äôs happens,btohqsg

Tea make me more awake than coffee actually,btohqsg
And I actually prefer tea to coffee,btohqsg
Actually these days I also don't drink a lot of tea,btohqsg
People like me is more of drinking coffee like probably once per month,btohqsg
Or even once per 3 months that type one,btohqsg
Actually drinking tea is good for me when I'm drunk,btohqsg
It helps to keep me sober very fast after drinking it,btohqsg
Im trying to avoid reliance on it,btohqsg
So i mainly only drink during exam study period,btohqsg
Yeah caffeine only works if u don't take it often if not your baseline would be the caffeine.,btohqsg
