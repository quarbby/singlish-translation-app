kia is good but the resale value is shitty,btohqsg

but th safety features and fuel efficiency all good ah,btohqsg
Kia started the Korean Jap car revolution with their conti design for mass consumer,btohqsg
Japanese dont believe in luxury for the masses thts y they have Acura  Lexus,btohqsg
Mazda is the best bang for buck in terms of interior quality,btohqsg

I see some western website says Mazda 6 expensive to repair. Is it true in sg too? I know that mazda 3 is cheap cause many phv using  but never heard the same for Mazda 6.,btohqsg
That time when I was looking for 2nd hand car  one of the car dealer was telling me Mazda sky active engine some of the older model have engine oil leaking issue  dunno solve already or not,btohqsg
See mileage and whether pistons overworked boh..,btohqsg
Repair what? Does it mentioned petrol or diesel?,btohqsg
I can no longer find the article now  but I remember the article mentioned it was back when Mazda have partnership with ford. It says that ford completely left Mazda from 2015 onwards  some of the older model (pre 2015) uses old ford parts which is not known to be reliable. Some of these parts are also hard to get  hence increase the cost of maintaining the vehicle.,btohqsg
It's water under the bridge. Wondering why the interest. Mazda fared much better on its own without Ford.,btohqsg
Wah!! How come have the M buttons! Which model are you driving sir!,btohqsg
F30. learning to install these small pieces,btohqsg
At that point of time  those are the cars that I can buy. So all those info are important to me. Just like how Hyundai and Kia still have bad connotation due to their bad past  buyers will still be worried,btohqsg
I doubt kia and Hyundai has such stigma now compared to the days of Hyundai pony. Just like how many are buying LG TV knowing how bad the quality were during Goldstar era,btohqsg
Ya la  but at that point of time as a first time buyer I rather choose something safer than a brand with a bad connotation to it,btohqsg
And it doesn't help that the seller I went to also reinforce that idea the engine oil leak,btohqsg
So immediately strike it off at that juncture,btohqsg
Can I stack this two together and get 15%?,btohqsg
Unfortunately  Mazda was overshadowed by Mitsubishi during tht 90s 00s period,btohqsg
The Mitsubishi Lancer n Toyota Corolla/Altis was the first choice over the 323 or M3,btohqsg
Ppl only know Mazda for the MX5,btohqsg
The sales of M3 picked up in e 2010s,btohqsg
Between cat A hybrid suv kona  Niro  yaris cross  s-cross  which is a better choice?,btohqsg
Super watered down by PI. And Borneo unit also look hideous inside,btohqsg
The Jap r just lacking behind,btohqsg
I dun really like 1 pedal drive 😂😂😂😂😂,btohqsg

I would go for the Niro or the s cross,btohqsg
Same I do Niro for its futuristic outlook and European interior,btohqsg
Interior wise  Koreans r way ahead,btohqsg
But still better than Yaris cross,btohqsg
Korean cars are definitely better in terms of materials used and designs,btohqsg
I oso 2 pedal.. but I got pedal shifter.. does that count ?,btohqsg
So me 4 pedals ? 🤣,btohqsg
Niro for the cabin space and PHV DNA. New Kona for the look.,btohqsg
