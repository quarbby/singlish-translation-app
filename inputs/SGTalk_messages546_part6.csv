Up to you lor HAHAHA see what matters more to youâ€¦ and if you know where to look instead of going to the store to get it as it is quite expensive,btohqsg
No rice? Lol all covered by the liao,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not about the price or item itself that matters most  itâ€™s about effort and intention that matter far more. Also theyâ€™re more likely to remember and associate you with that item you gift them and speak a lot of good things about you even when youâ€™re not around. Ultimately  when you gift something  it has to be out of willingness and love.,btohqsg
Then thatâ€™s a learning experience and avoid it next time and probably do more research. Itâ€™ll be even better if you buy it from somewhere you bought before and trusted lor,btohqsg

A simple hand made card > flowers bought from some shop on V day . I value effort more than gesture of $,btohqsg
I agree it's the small things that matter,btohqsg
Not about the size/value of gifts but the effort worth more ... my personal feel.,btohqsg
Im not sure ... but sometimes over doing may turn people off also. Down to most basic level i think it still boils down to whether the girl like the guy or not.,btohqsg

Someone ever use money note to fold heart shape for me or use grass to fold grasshopper,btohqsg

The grasshopper is so sweet.  But for me i hate those money note flower gifts ... 100% will get turn down by me,btohqsg
Yup. If u like the guy and he put in tiny miny effort  u will also appreciate.,btohqsg
well if a person can do both  makes the time for both  plans the date night  why not,btohqsg
If u donâ€™t like him  no matter how much effort he put in  u will not appreciate,btohqsg
If he can plan the date night amidst his busy schedule  i already feel loved.,btohqsg
