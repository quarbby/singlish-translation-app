My uncle offered me a modeling job üòÇ,btohqsg
"i had the same ability too  but the side effect is ""62.5 rank points""",btohqsg
Connections are important when you are useless at studies üòÇ,btohqsg
I have a feeling y‚Äôall are thinking very not good things,btohqsg
I just wore a short shirt for cny la,btohqsg
Technically he‚Äôs like my cousin twice removed or something,btohqsg
But I call him uncle cuz he old,btohqsg
what do u guys think of the,btohqsg
i said that but in less chim words,btohqsg
in fields that u can go in self-taught,btohqsg
I shall bless this chat with the wiggle,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say that it doesn‚Äôt matter  what matters is that you execute well over what qualifications you have,btohqsg
i feel its super hard to be a successful self taught,btohqsg
It's super hard to be successful. Period.,btohqsg
There are some things you'll only learn self-taught because schools/uni don't teach. There are some things you'll more easily learn in uni/school  but anything you can learn in uni/school is possible to learn outside of school too  tough harder.,btohqsg
Yeah because society desires like a written proof that you are indeed competent instead of finding out on their own cuz they could lose money,btohqsg
yeah to both of u :-/,btohqsg
A competent person would have some level of self-taught  and supplement that with some level of school-taught.If you only have one and not the other  you will stall at some point.,btohqsg
have both academia & industrial mindset,btohqsg
ideally imo  companies should just have a blind test that test for knowledge and skillsets that their job scope need  without regard for formal educationbecause ultimately  the cert is just a piece of paper that tells the employer you've learned and understood the content/skills to a competent extent,btohqsg
but it's more convenient to just sweep through thousands of potential employees by looking at their qualifications,btohqsg
I'd imagine you'll have to be a really competent self-taught individual who has achievements in their portfolio  to even be considered compared to ordinary degree holders  for the most part,btohqsg
and also to proof that you're sorta a mentally stable adult who can go thru with 4 years of high commitment to something,btohqsg
arguably  committing to self-taught for 4 years shows mental strength beyond going through 4 years of uni though.,btohqsg
you wont take 4 years to learn the same things alone tho,btohqsg
correct. most employers  because too many applicants  will filter by academics and grades unfortunately.if you somehow can get a competent self-taught no-degree person  beside a degree person  it will end up coming down to the quality of their work. and the value of the degree really doesn't show up as much.,btohqsg
so the magic sauce is...if you don't have the degree  but are competent and self-taught  how do you get in the room with the employer? networking (in the non-gross  non-cocktail bar way) is super super impt.,btohqsg
wouldn't it be an unfortunate scenario where even if the quality is the same  the self-taught individual would be paid disproportionately less compared than the degree holder?,btohqsg
so the degree would be there just to arbitarily inflate one's income,btohqsg
"i've had this conversation with my HR because my manager wants to pay me more  but the HR say ""how can  his qualifications not at that tier"".",btohqsg
if your portfolio is good  can demand higher charge,btohqsg
i told them i honestly don't give a shit how much i'm paid cus i more keen to contribute quality work. the longer i debate and talk about crap like that  the less good work i can do.,btohqsg
got the higher pay in the end.,btohqsg
you seem like an earnest person  otherwise that would have been employing some high tier reverse psychology or whatever the correct term is,btohqsg
im simplifying it a little. but there's negotiation and tactics to play. in the end its really the job of the hiring manager to help nego. you have no power as an employee.,btohqsg
lesson learnt  always invite HR to coffee & treat them meals ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
HR generally don't know much one la  esp in sg. they're just administrators. They don't really care if you leave or stay  beyond the fact that it's extra paperwork for them.,btohqsg
What you really need is your hiring manager and working team to value you and your work. They will fight to say that the team is more effective because of your presence. But this is all also dependent on how valuable you ACTUALLY are haha.,btohqsg
The more time/energy you spend fussing over paper  the less time/energy you have to level up your hard/soft skills.,btohqsg
as a HR practitioner im triggered,btohqsg

Smh my head people acting irrationally,btohqsg
They think ah DORSCON orange means wuhan,btohqsg
Does it mean I have to avoid J8 now? Since RI is quite near Bishan,btohqsg
Maybe should avoid Bishan and Marymount MRT also,btohqsg
Actually scratch that. Just avoid the entire circle line.,btohqsg
Let's not forget that the VJ teacher who contracted the disease had visited j8 as well.,btohqsg
You‚Äôve practically offended over 4000 students,btohqsg
i live in bishan and i hang at j8,btohqsg
^ heard RI students like to hang out at J8,btohqsg
As someone who visits J8 occasionally  I can confirm that.,btohqsg
Avoid RI students at all costs! ü§£,btohqsg
Please refrain from making such statements please.,btohqsg
Honestly heres the facts u r not dafe anywhere so u dun have to avoid anywhere and they are sanitising the places where infected people have gone so u dun have to avoid the area (eg. today ri school break cause they are sanitising the school) and if u gna avoid ri student jus cause one kid has u might as well avoid all singaporean cause a singaporean got infected the logic dosen make sense right?? And like if u gna avoid might as well jus stay home. U cant do anyth about outside so just wash ur hands regularly practise personal hygeine and jus dun touch ur face and honestly.the fatality rate is so low and sg healthcare is so good honestly no need panic lol,btohqsg
I believe in our duty as citizens to prevent the further spread of meaningless hysteria.,btohqsg
its quite rude to keep saying avoid this kind of ppl that kind of ppl,btohqsg
In light of the current situation confronting us  we should be supporting each other as one Singapore family. Notwithstanding this disappointment  I am heartened that@fxliciaaand others have stepped up to offer your support and encouragement to fellow Singaporeans who need it.,btohqsg
Why must the person be from an elite sch,btohqsg
too bad I also dw talk to u,btohqsg
we just want to know why specifically elite sch,btohqsg
it's not a condition people usually make when they want to talk to other people,btohqsg
Actually on the contrary  you are the one with prejudice for them  for preferring them,btohqsg
let's not throw assumptions around just let him explain himself,btohqsg
Guys stop dissing him and let him speak.,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs just a sch,btohqsg
It could jus be because hes in ite so like his frnds circle could be more of from ite and other similar schools so like he said elite cause its a part thats like not much of his social circle?? So yall dun have to be so picky abt it,btohqsg
I mean  elite school ppl are definitely different,btohqsg
The only thing me and elites got in common is ITE,btohqsg
"verb1.give rise to prejudice in (someone); make biased.""the statement might prejudice the jury""",btohqsg
You actually can be proud of where you study,btohqsg
Honestly lets be honest wen u grow up nobody cares abt what sch u from,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt that more of a personal thing?,btohqsg
As a YI student my school is a dump,btohqsg
If u have a good attitude then yay if u have a bad one even.if u frm ri nobody gives a shit,btohqsg
That‚Äôs because you choose to think that way.,btohqsg
So stop seperating urself and wasting time over these useless fights mot worth it lol,btohqsg
Elite people have so many opportunities and much better facilities,btohqsg
True but one example where sch is considered is like tuition assignments sometimes they ask for the tutor to be feom a good jc,btohqsg
as a Chung Cheng but for retards  my school is a dump,btohqsg
Every school is a good school,btohqsg
depends on who u want to mix with,btohqsg
Thats true but thats why u take jobs that are more advantageous for u usings ur strengths,btohqsg
Slacker on the outset closet mugger at home,btohqsg
But thr are also some jobs whr u just have to start from beginning and learn everyth,btohqsg
True but when a level results come out die alr,btohqsg
My school has practically 0 opportunities unless you want to enter engineering,btohqsg
Other schools have a med society,btohqsg
Hey hey I mean your batch is not bad,btohqsg
Im speaking as a yijcian who got top 5% for prelims and improved in As but still my results is not so good,btohqsg
I would‚Äôve joined that in a heartbeat,btohqsg
And like jus becuase u frm bad sch dosen mean u shit lol cause nobody judges u on grades we dun make frnds based on grades but their character so meh,btohqsg
I have friends who got 13 points and still chose YI,btohqsg
Context  this statement was made when comparing local schools to most public schools overseas.,btohqsg
Where our D  E students can actually score A  B,btohqsg
Lol im scared forr AS I dun wan go,btohqsg
Thanks tho it made my classmates question why i chose the sch,btohqsg
It differs from person to person,btohqsg
And olevel chi my chi fricking shit,btohqsg
There are many factors like distance,btohqsg
I had no choice but to enter YI,btohqsg
Sometimes jc isnt good either way? Like poly has a more specialised streams,btohqsg
Mm i guess so im planning to try for sit,btohqsg
It‚Äôs alright u can still score better than people from better schools,btohqsg
Like I have frnds who are damn smart but they want go poly cause it has their streams,btohqsg
Bc it is so much harder to enter by poly,btohqsg
u basically got all distinctions or dist for most of sub,btohqsg
Distance from yi to my houze is like 1.5h by public transport,btohqsg
True but u can waste 2 more yrs and in the end realise u dun wan do meds,btohqsg
I have a direct bus to sch,btohqsg
Tbh i anyhow chose my jc,btohqsg
I‚Äôve wanted to be a doctor since primary school,btohqsg
btw how old is everyone here?,btohqsg
I have a personal reason for it,btohqsg
I 3 stops to sch lol,btohqsg
I just got to JC 1,btohqsg
Nobody wants to be in YI,btohqsg
Eh for medicine  yes jc more likely  but more poly opportunities have been opening up. Or rather  more poly students have shown capability for it,btohqsg
I mean I do vut I dun,btohqsg
But I dun wan leave sec sch,btohqsg
I prefer jc learning style anyways,btohqsg
"lmaooo while it might be true that elite schools have more opportunities on average  it is not through that neighbourhood schools are devoid of opportunities. Also  you are only seeing those who got the opportunity in the elite schools. Who would advertise ""we have ABC opportunities  but for every 10 person that get it  100 dont get it  come be part of the 100!""",btohqsg
O nice I have a friend there,btohqsg
The JC style of lectures lets us adopt the back block position.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt really like Jc learning style that‚Äôs why I chose to study at SIM,btohqsg
I know a few people from asr,btohqsg
ANYWAY THATS IF I FUN RETAIN LOL HAHAHA,btohqsg
and many the 100 that didnt get anything elite sch would have got something from neighbourhood sch,btohqsg
At least you‚Äôre not in the dumping ground of people who wanna go jc,btohqsg
Interestingly I'm not even talking about that back block.,btohqsg
"Good for you  and that's your path. As long as you're clear that it's what you really want. If it is  you should be aiming  working  getting the grades you need. Without complaint because you signed up for this tough road.I just wanna challenge you on ""not social"" because a doctor needs to be extremely socially skilled. And they won't teach that.",btohqsg
honestly  JC is just 2 years nia,btohqsg
It was ok i Guess... but I wasn‚Äôt really coping hahaha. I took H2 Math and i was practically failing lol...like lmao I got 2/65 for my Ct,btohqsg

Dear Juniors A word of advice: JC itself is useless in the grand scheme of things  it just serves as a ticket to get to Uni. Instead of sulking about which JC you are stuck in  the time could‚Äôve been better spent to ensure you make it to your desired course in your desired Uni. It might feel shitty not getting in your desired JC  but if you do not get into your desired course in Uni  that will not just feel shitty  but pave the way to a future that you may not like.Make of it what you will Peace out,btohqsg
OMG I READ THIS AS 6 YEARS IN SEC SCHOOL,btohqsg
