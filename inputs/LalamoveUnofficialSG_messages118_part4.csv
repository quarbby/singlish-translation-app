I ownself also carry more then 8kg items,btohqsg
The weight is 1 thing but sometimes the items are way oversized. When I was doing grabexpress some ask to deliver baby stroller and even fan and all that.,btohqsg
So now I have a habit of contacting the customer to double confirm on the items before I even proceed to the pick up location,btohqsg
Or else waste of time and petrol to travel to pick up point end up get surprise,btohqsg
For LLM can we cancel the order if let's say upon accepting order we try to contact customer to confirm order before going over but customer is uncontactable?,btohqsg
Unless you saying oddle  startaster all those Don need call actually,btohqsg
Ya I know for all these restaurant and those clinic kind no need to call. But other than that normally I see if no details I prefer to call and double check but if uncontactable can we cancel?,btohqsg
Yea you can.. but service quality will be affected..,btohqsg
Today i kena again   unit 06-25 but building dont have . Called them n being fussy . Atleast   give proper address n unit on notes .,btohqsg
Okay la  from 3 improve to 3.6,btohqsg

Treat the customer like vip can alr,btohqsg
Why each time called customers   they record our convo ?,btohqsg
Today they speak to me in malay .,btohqsg
I record it for safety tbh,btohqsg
It's okay.. traffic all those have to explain nicely,btohqsg
No i called them   they are the one recording .,btohqsg
Firstly   i apologised to them for being late .,btohqsg
Eventhough they speak to me in malay .,btohqsg
Cause im from bedok going to mdis .,btohqsg
In case they want soot you  just wait for llm to say something can le,btohqsg
When they send you the late message just explain to them,btohqsg
Almost all the one i called when taking order is   recorded .,btohqsg
I called bro not msges .,btohqsg
The system will give you a message to write a form explaining why you late,btohqsg
Ahh i come early also problem,btohqsg
Maybe for them you late  but llm alr given you a 1h grace period.. so it's okay,btohqsg
The one morning always pick up now . Bt timing not given . That one how ?,btohqsg
I can take but speeding kills ?,btohqsg
Can take but do it safely,btohqsg
I do slowly n i arrived to end points . They all was opening door for me .,btohqsg
Then just ignore and move on le,btohqsg
If its muti stop you have 30 mins extra for each stop so you can slowly do,btohqsg

Last time displayed almost everything  then changed to partial display + more. This week onwards dont even display any items for oddle,btohqsg
Makes the pizza places eg. Shakeys or yellow cab very dangerous for me to take cos the sets comes with heavy drinks.,btohqsg
Hi guys newbie here  trying next week. Already looking at orders through the on duty part. Just curious  those driving cars  do you all bring like say a ikea bag(maybe abit smaller bag) along as i see that some orders don't state what item is it.Some advise are trolley but is it necessary or just happened to kena those suay customer,btohqsg
Is it as much as possible ppl avoid orders from the oddle/Chinatown (Âîê‰∫∫Ë°ó)rest anyhow key end destination/kerala eats as I've been reading through the past chats,btohqsg
All can take only 159 novena dont take,btohqsg
For food call the restaurant b4 u go cos sometimes they 4get n also to ensure they preparing n ready by the time u rch so u can stack,btohqsg
Trolley depend on luck sometimes really need sometime dun need but customer think heavy for them is equal heavy for u. U wun know till u c the item. So usually juz bring,btohqsg
Usually if nv state trolley or wadi juz collect in person haven met shit yet. But most of the time I deliver food,btohqsg
Just saw 1 $260 car job 14 location damn,btohqsg
