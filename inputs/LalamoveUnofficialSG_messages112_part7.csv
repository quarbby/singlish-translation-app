I said already otw n will reach b4 7pm.Again ask me to go pick up now .10 mins after I pick  the order  call n said customer chasing for food n ask what time I reach.I reach woodlands in 25 mins  ask the customer if they call LLM  they said no. They just place the order on line .  N did not complain hungry or wanted food urgently,btohqsg
After I drop off the food  I send message said food already delivered in less then 30 mins..Then this Shanna vega person give me a mobile n ask me to call him/her .,btohqsg
