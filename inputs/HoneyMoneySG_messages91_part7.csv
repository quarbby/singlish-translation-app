Other than shielding idk many people who invests with SA,btohqsg
ya la.. this is actually morally / financially correct.the shielding is all along a hack and we really should not be too upset it has been patched,btohqsg
For those who were planning to use SA as a HYSA  depending on when youâ€™ll hit 55  if thereâ€™s a high interest environment like we had the past 18mo  then it doesnâ€™t make any difference  just withdraw and put in banks.Itâ€™ll be an issue if at that time  only equities offer above 4%,btohqsg
Anyway probably those in their early 50s/late 40s should be concerned? Younger folks relax  so much time left the rules canâ€™t stay the same that long,btohqsg
I fall under the 49 cohort and this changes a lot of cash flow plans haha.  But not really catastrophic  itâ€™s not like they increased mandatory lock up of funds.We still can wdraw excess of frs  just need to find >4% liquid instrument by the time we hit 55,btohqsg
Yeah  for younger folks  who knows  cpf might change again favouring shielding like mechanism in the future.Just plan for several scenarios and move on.  Kinda waste of time worrying about things we canâ€™t directly control,btohqsg
Hi  can i check..if im above age 55 but still working  the SA still close? So contributions all go into OA and MA?,btohqsg
CPF video say liao..go into RA first.. RA hit FRS liao.. then OA.https://youtu.be/bAXSvLAOXnI,btohqsg
Thanks for the vidYup for those whoâ€™ve met FRS already you actually have more flexibility with your OA esp if you still have a sizable mortgage,btohqsg
My mum is above 55 and still working. It goes to OA SA MA. Not RAâ€¦,btohqsg
The change wonâ€™t occur till next year.,btohqsg
Cpf SA shielding Nerfed by govt,btohqsg
maybe will change bah (as implied by CPF video),btohqsg
If your mom already hit frs already then next year her cpf will be split to Ma and oa only just like anyone already hit frs under 55 now,btohqsg
"seems the RA will be the ""new SA"" for those after 55",btohqsg
Why not start put in next month instead of this month  so the waiting time is shorter  correct?,btohqsg
As in notification? Or still use app but to get otpI've gotten notifications but everytime I click in nothing happens on the app and I end up opening the app otp to key in,btohqsg
So if hit FRS  the SA / RA allocation will flow to OA?,btohqsg
As per the YouTube video ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Good question. I want to know also. I supposed if you have hit FRS in RA for by 55  then your CPF monthly contributions will go into OA and MA not RA and MA. Then it's up to you if you want to transfer money from OA to RA,btohqsg
If you can put into other investments that gives you >2.5% then donâ€™t have to transfer into RAYou can withdraw from OA and put into other investments that yields 3-5%,btohqsg
Does it means that no more shielding ?,btohqsg
Basically what was discussed just earlier.,btohqsg

I Found the CHEAPEST way to Invest SRS for S&P 500https://youtu.be/o29BpVD7tho,btohqsg
If I buy SGX ETF for CPF using POEMS Cash Plus  won't have dividend handling fee too  right?,btohqsg
Should be same treatment since it's held in yoursrscpfis bank account,btohqsg
CPFIS  but yeah understood. I've been using FSMOne since it's flat fee but thinking of DCA my OA funds and POEMS Cash Plus is more worth for less than $10k investments,btohqsg
Depends items in your ocbc 360,btohqsg
Yes but you need to fulfill the uob one  criteria for getting high interest. And you need to consider when and how much to take out the excess amount from ocbc 360 to minimise the loss from opportunity costs (your ocbc 360 bonus interest for save criteria),btohqsg
For those who want to pledge their property and opt for BRS instead of FRS  does it mean that they will be withdrawing from RA?,btohqsg

Question on the new SA rules:If we have SA money invested (eg in Endowus) when we turn 55  are the investments forcibly liquidated to be put into the RA  or do the assets move to be under the OA investment scheme? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Do you know if I book a hotel using atome  will it be under atome mcc 5999 or travel mcc?,btohqsg
Probably not forcibly liquidated  but then you do liquidate (whether by choice or by natural timing)  the monies will go to RA if you havenâ€™t fulfilled FRS  to be consistent with how they would have been if they werenâ€™t invested,btohqsg
"Sorry  regarding TBills (6months).Auction Date: 1 Feb 2024Question: As long as the unit price is above the unit cost  I should sell instead of holding it for 6 months  since I have received the ""interest"" upfront. Am I right? Any other considerations?Thanks.",btohqsg
