They need to be profitable if not will wind up just like shortlive jipay.,btohqsg
Chris  any explanation on all the new fees of Amaze? Thanks,btohqsg
‚ö∞Ô∏è  wah this one  ancient name,btohqsg
Hi bosses. I topped up VCMA $8k  reflected in filing  but income tax NOA doesnt include it.Called IRAS hotline  they say VCMA tax relief only applicable to self-employed individuals.Can anyone confirm..?,btohqsg
When did you top-up? Did you top-up before 31 Dec?,btohqsg
for tax relief on personal  should be under RSTU to SA provided u have not yet reached prevailing FRS,btohqsg
It should reflect under Total CPF Cash Top-up  CPF Cash Top-up for Self and/or by Employer,btohqsg
VCMA also qualifies for tax relief.,btohqsg
i think you should censor off your NRIC,btohqsg
Lesson learnt.. next time top-up correctly..,btohqsg
It should be eligible for tax relief,btohqsg
"It is. Just that I didnt' select the ""Member"" option when topping up. It was the pre-selected ""Self-employed"" option instead.",btohqsg
Ah. Ouch. Well on the bright side u will reach BHS earlier to supercharged your SA,btohqsg
Anyone know if HSBC Revo on kris+ tour agency provides us with 4mpd?,btohqsg
No. HSBC revo excludes hotel and travel agency,btohqsg
So if paying for meals with Kris+ and UOB KF    is it 3mpd on Kris+ and 3mpd on Krisflyer?I have lady‚Äôs card on dining as well,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see it In the exclusion tho,btohqsg
But then revo says 4mpd on all online purchases‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt that include kris+ (any shop),btohqsg
Since when they give 4mpd for all online purchases? There‚Äôs a whitelist and your transaction MCC must fall within that whitelist.,btohqsg
Do you happen to know the mcc for tour agency on kris+?,btohqsg
Very dangerous. I think almost all the tour agencies using kris+ are not Uob lady travel Mcc.They are tour attraction Mcc,btohqsg
Mcc for tour agencies shd be under 4722 which was taken out from hsbc revo whitelist wef 1 jan.. to be safe  use another card instead to get bonus rewards bcos its likely that hsbc is just going to award only 1x pt (0.4 mpd) instead of 10x pt (4 mpd) if the tour agencies fall under 4722,btohqsg
So best is UOB Krisflyer as mention by someone above.? Cause all kris+ payment awards 3mpd uncappedAmirite?,btohqsg
Question on this webull referral reward‚Ä¶ for the first friend  if they subscribe to 100k usd moneybull and fulfill all the holding requirements‚Ä¶ does that mean first friend referral reward is 800usd nvda?,btohqsg
Hmm might be.. i think it feels safer to use uob krisflyer bcos you know you'll get 3mpd uncapped which will make a huge difference in the rewards earned,btohqsg
I thought UOB lady travel mcc is for non kris+ transaction tho,btohqsg
Can u rephrase. Don‚Äôt get u.If the merchant under Kris+ has Uob lady travel accepted Mcc it will get 6mpd.But so far most reports from people using Kris+ to pay travel agent don‚Äôt seem to get 6mpd unless they appeal,btohqsg
From my understanding  UOB lady card is one of the card which allow travel agency to award 6mpd assuming we don‚Äôt pay via kris +But it‚Äôs a different story if paying via kris +,btohqsg
Without Kris+  MCC is most likely 4722. With Kris+  MCC most likely changed to 7991. Both MCCs will not get 4mpd with HSBC Revo. To make your life easier  just use UOB KF with Kris+.,btohqsg
I think big travel agencies will all be 4722 if without Kris+But the smaller ones at China town. Not too sure‚Ä¶ haha,btohqsg
That‚Äôs sounds like an easy uncapped 4(3+1) mpd,btohqsg
Yeah after 1st April. Uob lady can move aside for Kris+ plus Uob kf for travel agencies.,btohqsg
Did you guys see the updates on Amaze card ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
100+ messages and one pinned message üòÇ,btohqsg
Use amaze + empty wallet test safest.,btohqsg
Dear all credit card expert  is American express true cashback card exclude utilities payment such as SP Group?,btohqsg
Opss... Then have to find alternative. Thanks.,btohqsg
This OCBC360 guide is so golden. Really grateful for your gracious share.üëçCan we discuss the strategy more?I understand that we shd clear out salary bank in asap so we wont unecesarrily blow up the ADB for the month (anything above 100k is not profitable). But how do we account for the bonus bank in from ocbc every month? It easily adds up to $300+  shdnt we clear it as well as soon as its in.. again  this means there will be more and more observation/intervention days to keep track of..Any one have a effective one off single day action to set the ADB accurately to be slightly >$500 at month end?,btohqsg
No  it is AMEX True Cashback Card,btohqsg
You will get their cashback on the statement,btohqsg
U mean utilities payment is qualified for the cashback?,btohqsg
1). Point 2. Transfer out the bonus(monthly interest) on the same day. Preferably before 6pm or 9pm.2). You need to understand how MAB works n how soon it reflected on the web portal. Once you master this skill  you will be able to do incremental $500 at month end using one big lump sum.The simple guide is for newbie. Once you are master on this  you can use whatever strategy that benefits you.,btohqsg
Yes  for amex... only government services are not qualified i think.,btohqsg
Wow  that's good. Thanks for pointing out. Someone just replied said it's not qualified just now. Lol.,btohqsg
Hmm i just thought it through also.. a single large incremental at last day of month also meant at start of next month need to withdraw that.. üòµ‚Äçüí´I am still trying to think through the strategy.. hope i can solve this math problem,btohqsg
Wah Lau. Ocbc 360 so complicated one ah. Luckily I never use it. Hahaha,btohqsg
SP Group payment is qualified for cashback but Senoko payment is not qualified. Strange.,btohqsg
Hi  is there a way to utilise shopee coins apart from shopping in  shopee app?,btohqsg
not even if pay for uob amex card?,btohqsg
"No choice.. the easy ""one"" (pun intended) is already maxed out. Now looking at the next option.. üòÇ",btohqsg
