Last time morning assembly when singing the national anthem/school song I keep wanting to fall,btohqsg
Oh btw my ct say we are too quiet in terms of singing,btohqsg
There was once it was only week 3 and i was like SHIT i alr 4x late,btohqsg
My ct said my class late coming is ridiculous,btohqsg
We used to play amogus together,btohqsg
It was only in july j2 that it wined down lol,btohqsg
I need the 6.50 bus and sometimes it comes at 7 or later,btohqsg
In my sec school there was once the boys had 80% of attendance  in the last minute 80% of the girls in my class turned up. The year head held back those girls for briefing,btohqsg
That is so opposite of what i would expect,btohqsg
Like literally out of 17 girls at 8:29  only 2 girls was present,btohqsg
8:30 everybody is told to stand,btohqsg
My class only had 8 guys,btohqsg
The guys were always the more obedient ones in my class  even the worst of guys turns up with 5mins to spare,btohqsg
I remembered in j1 they showed the top 5 late coming classes,btohqsg
And my class bar chart was the highest,btohqsg
I cant sing so i will not sing too loud,btohqsg
The only person signing was my principal everybody else literally kept their mouth shut,btohqsg
The teacher entered by the back door,btohqsg
There was once i wanted to do tt but it was locked,btohqsg
Walking another few metres v tiring,btohqsg
No it is coz i do kinda hv low bp,btohqsg
Every JC should be have both 2 years and 3 years and features POA and MOB,btohqsg
I cant imagine mugging for 3y,btohqsg
i mean make both 2 years and 3 years for every JC,btohqsg
Long long long ago  there were 2 three-year centralised institutes: Outram Institute and Jurong Institute; they merged into MI,btohqsg
That was … 20 years ago?And there were even more CIs besides those two but were closed,btohqsg
if failed J1 transfer to 3 years class,btohqsg
Nah not all. But I agree that commerce stream should be expanded to a few JCs at least and not just restricted to MI,btohqsg
If the students in RI and HC can get like 30% 90rp they’re coping fine  it’s just that moe should tighten the requirement for JC,btohqsg
What I mean for the 3 years is if failed J1 transfer to 3 years class,btohqsg
We can see what a shitshow yi is,btohqsg
last time commerce stream is not offered in jc is cuz there were too many accountants,btohqsg
what i mean is if failed J1 transfer to 3 years class,btohqsg
i mean thats abit extra no?,btohqsg
Wdym? I thought commerce stream was in JCs more than 20 years ago but moe made all JCs stop offering it around the same time MI was established,btohqsg
So that’s why I think YI should be converted to a 3 year institute and then moe lowers the l1r5 entry score for jc to like maybe 17,btohqsg
Oh wow so from more than 2 3 year institutes to one,btohqsg
In 1987 the Ministry of Education set up the first institute  Outram Institute  to offer three-year pre-university courses on a centralised basis. Outram Institute prepared students for the GCE 'A' Level Examinations. Initially  it concentrated on commerce subjects and had only the commerce stream. The arts stream was later introduced to the school. In 1989  Outram Institute was the first pre-university centre in Singapore to offer theLondon Chamber of Commerce and Industryexamination  on top of theSingapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Levelexamination.,btohqsg
I’m not sure if people are willing to make an admission that they had been “wrong” or “too idealistic” about the max L1R5 for A level track all these yearsMoreover  decisions are made in the spirit of allowing multiple pathways of success (although the unintended outcome could be pathways of delulu for many),btohqsg
Had the only commerce stream as of 1987? Then I suppose if my JC teacher was right  commerce was eventually expanded to JCs for a while cos she said her JC had commerce stream,btohqsg
It was stopped even before MIA few batches my seniors had Commerce and MI hasn’t happened by the time I cleared my A level,btohqsg
Seletar Institute(Chinese: 立德高级中学) was established in January 1988 as Singapore's second centralised institute.Jurong Institute(Chinese: 裕廊高级中学) was formed in 1989 as Singapore's third centralised institute.Townsville Institute(Chinese: 城景高级中学) was the fourth centralised institute established in Singapore to offer a three-yearcurriculumleading to the Singapore CambridgeGeneral Certificate of EducationAdvanced Levelexamination.,btohqsg
Yeah  but tbh a 3 year pathway to the same exam is not very much different. By retaining the requirements for the 3 year centralised institute(s) but tightening the one for Jc  absolutely no one is being restricted from taking A levels in Singapore I guess,btohqsg
Wow  so it went from 1 to 4 and then back to 1 really quickly,btohqsg
It says OI only had one stream at the start,btohqsg
Closure of Townsville and Seletar InstitutesWith a fall in demand in three-year pre-university courses in favour of two-year junior college courses  Seletar Institute witnessed a rapidly falling enrolment  to 130 students in 1995. In November 1995  the Ministry of Education announced the closure of Seletar Institute and Townsville Institute owing to the rapidly falling enrolment  from 3560 students in 1993 to 2328 students in 1995. Both institutes ceased the intake of first-year students in 1996  and ceased operation in 1998 with the graduation of its final batch of students.On 26 July 2003  decision was made public by the Ministry of Education on the merger of Outram Institute and Jurong Institute to conglomerate the sparsely organised three-year pre-university institutions into a single entity.[2]This move was to allow consolidation of expertise and teaching resources of the two institutes  and provide students with more customised programmes and facilities  thereby enhancing the delivery of the three-year pre-university education programme. As a result  Millennia Institute was established on 3 January 2004.,btohqsg
I think the decision makers have the data they need regarding popularity for 3-year institutes as well as overall number of students who qualify and want to go on the A level path,btohqsg
I’d like to think they made data-driven decisions,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately we don’t. But we can see the students in yi clearly aren’t coping well because the results are worse than MI  despite MI students having worse o level results,btohqsg
