Which rn is redistricted to include Sengkang,btohqsg
Ya but the heavyweight team need not to have included himself,btohqsg
He said he suggested to party leadership to send a better team there,btohqsg
Suggest is one thing send who is another,btohqsg
Ya la. So that’s why I said they did not take up his suggestion in the end which was why they lost Aljunied again,btohqsg
He legit in Punggol cuz they fucked up,btohqsg
the lee dynasty is coming to an end,btohqsg
Some of the ministers could’ve left their safe GRCs to go Aljunied,btohqsg
Anyway it’s too late for them now,btohqsg
If they want to get back Aljunied  it’s definitely not happening during the next GE,btohqsg
I just imagined Lee Bee Wah in Aljunied,btohqsg
Well she’s one of the more well known ones so would’ve worked better than the team they sent in 2015 anyway. They were full of unknowns. And it didn’t help that Kahar Hassan was pulled out from Kaki Bukit right before the GE for unknown reasons,btohqsg
they got cooked into chicken rice. 47-9,btohqsg
their defense is legit non existent,btohqsg
i sub with the girls score 50 points liao,btohqsg
Isit AC basketball not very good or smth,btohqsg
Not to shade like genuine wn,btohqsg
is nan chiau high sch a brand name sch?,btohqsg
Yes although the students take o levels instead of ip system,btohqsg
wonder how he survive so long,btohqsg
actually right  what is 1 term of PM?,btohqsg
There is no such thing here rly  based on the Westminster system we inherited from the British. They just need the confidence of the majority of parliamentarians. Technically LHL can rule for life as long as he has enough MPs to support him,btohqsg
since independence there was only 3 pm,btohqsg
Why h2 physics got formulary sheet  h1 dun have,btohqsg
said all the anti pap people,btohqsg
Lhl took over goh as 3rd pm in 2004 Goh won the 1991 1997 and 2001 elections which allowed him to stay till 2004,btohqsg
There is no such thing as this,btohqsg
She’s asking about the role of PM not how long one parliamentary term is,btohqsg
h1 also have  just that much shorter cause only show the formulas relevant to h1,btohqsg
i am asking how long one parliamentry term is,btohqsg
How come I dun remember having one,btohqsg
Maybe it is early onset dementia,btohqsg
PM is prime minister not parliament..Anyway one parliamentary term is up to 5 years and the prime minister has the discretion to dissolve parliament earlier and call a snap general election,btohqsg
If it happens this year  means PM Wong would’ve decided to call one earlier instead of waiting until the end of 5 years,btohqsg
Role of pm? Bruh that can be googled  the parliamentary term can't. You need to do maths because goh was brought in to become a pm as a emergency,btohqsg
it’s ok u pharm student  give yourself medicine,btohqsg
the boys are good  they won a div last year,btohqsg
She said PM by accident instead of parliamentary term which was why I was confused. Cos there’s no such thing here as a fixed PM term,btohqsg
BUT NO OFFENSE THE GIRLS CANNOT PLAY BASKETBALL  they're damn horrible,btohqsg
2 days ago they got DEEP FRIED AND POUNDED INTO TERIYAKI CHICKEN  92-6,btohqsg
A parliamentary term can last up to 5 years  starting from the date of the first sitting following the General Election. Once Parliament dissolves  a General Election must be held within the next 3 months.From sg parl website,btohqsg
huh i said pm  i tot got term like president,btohqsg
So I don’t get what you’re asking now. If you’re talking about Pm  there is no such thing as a fixed term,btohqsg
They just need the confidence of a majority of parliament members to continue,btohqsg
cannot defend paint  cannot hustle for ball  cannot rebound  cannot even run,btohqsg
For president  6 year terms.For parliament  up to 5 yearsFor the role of PM  none. Just like in the United Kingdom (from Wikipedia: No directly set terms; however  they must maintain the support of theHouse of Commons which has a term of five years),btohqsg
me and my friend will cook them bruh,btohqsg
spending too much time with the boys cos they can actually win a championship,btohqsg
Also because the Pm simply just needs the confidence of a majority of members  midway through a parliamentary term they can keep changing PMs. (Cough UK cough),btohqsg
they're actually horrible and I'm not even good at ball,btohqsg
