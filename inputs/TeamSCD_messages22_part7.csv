Many years ago when I buang someone's bumper  I remember just exchange photo of ic  phone number and photos of the carplate plus damage. Then at workshop repairs I paid  then sign an agreement form that it has been settled.,btohqsg

What's important is the settlement paper signed,btohqsg

Never driven one  I heard the engine is different from the fd2r and euro r,btohqsg
I do like the look of the car,btohqsg
Or next year sell and buy,btohqsg
Nxt Yr change x70 also can,btohqsg
Still a type r  but not the most desired type r,btohqsg
I wanna buy this so badly,btohqsg
And just change engine to 4g93,btohqsg
Also it's easier to find videos of the fn2r then the euro r,btohqsg
Which is faster euro r or fd2r,btohqsg
Haha only can do in jb,btohqsg
Same engine  but the fd2r is lighter and has shorter gears,btohqsg
It also has a better intake manifold,btohqsg
U ever driven 4g93 wira b4?,btohqsg
The ratios can be changed to match  but the euro r is a heavier car. That one can't change,btohqsg
Also fd2r is a newer model,btohqsg
Euro r came out in 2003 if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
Which is better proton satria neo or perodua myvi,btohqsg
Both probably got gtr engine ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Satria neo is the one with lotus engine right,btohqsg
Proton managed to make a 1.6 na engine with lotus during 2009 which produces 126bhp and 150 nmt,btohqsg
Iâ€™d still go with a satria neo,btohqsg
Yes  my grandmother had a gen 2,btohqsg

She had switched from her charade to that gen 2,btohqsg
