I think F1 cars use CVT.,btohqsg
Actually they are stand alone now. Tom Tom is no longer in use. For sure they got a fair bit more to catch but it will get there eventually,btohqsg
Mr Pete is irreplaceable don’t bother trying 😉,btohqsg
Which map supplier does apple use,btohqsg
No one. Their latest maps are all self done by Apple.,btohqsg
I see. Is it accurate  I got to try them,btohqsg
Apple used to work with Google map  but dropped Google map long time ago and now their map is managed by themselves,btohqsg
So it is not as detailed as Google Map.,btohqsg
It does have some weekness esp in looking up places for reviews. And some places are still missing.,btohqsg
But it is perhaps the BEST looking map. For driving it recently got lane assisted directions too for Singapore. So it has gotten a lot better,btohqsg
Oh and Look around is perhaps more updated than Google street view. And it is 3D,btohqsg
Out of this world. Literally!! 😅😅,btohqsg
Still prefer to swop gears yourself?

The timing of this message couldn't be any better,btohqsg
Admins really making live edits to what they post hehe nice,btohqsg
You chose the regular WRX 👀👀👀,btohqsg
I see you that you prefer the scream of NA engines as well👀,btohqsg
vtec is king but boxer is life,btohqsg
careful for what u ask for,btohqsg
safe to say yes but no,btohqsg
love it man  any NA engine makes me happy,btohqsg
even my 112nm that cant even go up flyovers,btohqsg
safe to say  i have never seen roadlegal sequential manual in my life before,btohqsg
Okay give u an NA engine car with CVT transmission. See you happy or not🤪-R,btohqsg
Is it even legal to put in a car here in sg🤔,btohqsg
1. because its probably illegal2. its expensive3. its super loud4. its jerky asf,btohqsg
i mean if it goes i guess?,btohqsg
it should be la  even if its not it doesnt make sense to put it in a car in sg,btohqsg
The closest you can probably get are dog boxes,btohqsg
Hahaha but at least it moves right?-R,btohqsg
Like the one in the abarth 695 biposto,btohqsg
tried chasing the xc40 in the swift... couldnt even keep up at 90,btohqsg
the moment it becomes an uphil... gg,btohqsg
Don't know if anyone remembers this,btohqsg
Admin should keep track on how many names we call them,btohqsg
What a waste of ur petrol sir😂-R,btohqsg
Thank god to the great FC of the swift,btohqsg
Not a big hole in Mr Xun's pocket,btohqsg
russell how often u pump petrol,btohqsg
about the same as the XC40 in fact,btohqsg
thankfully no... if not the paddle shifters will be for decoration,btohqsg
wah so russell drives decently fast car eh,btohqsg
quite funny tbh  seldom see both cars drive out tgt,btohqsg
You will be surprised at the benefits of  paddle shifters-R,btohqsg
i put RS badge tho  plus 50hp,btohqsg
No la  sometimes heavy foot/drive out a lot/never go expressway as much-R,btohqsg
so what car you drive russell?,btohqsg
got people here that drive proton but poke other ppl,btohqsg
put dual motor at the back now?,btohqsg
if i see you on roads ill thumbs up u and let u know in the chat hahaha,btohqsg
but i felt tht the swift more worth,btohqsg
i think one year before the fl,btohqsg
Naise. FL depre signficiantly more than pre-FL even tho 1 year diff only,btohqsg
initially wanted opc because didnt really need it during peak hourz,btohqsg
Must be due to the bodykit all-R,btohqsg
4-5am leave house 9+pm then come home,btohqsg
Wahhh  your fc must be like 6 to 10 km/l at max,btohqsg
Or you drive a lot/have a super small fuel tank,btohqsg
No la my FC is like 16-17km/l🤭 now petrol expensive you know hahaha-R,btohqsg
on days we chase the XC40 8km/l,btohqsg
Naturally  older cars FC won’t be as good. But you can try usingliquimoly injection cleanerto improve your FC. I used it after my servicing and my FC improved by a little.-R,btohqsg
i see  will try thanks for the reco,btohqsg
so when will sgcm review ur car!,btohqsg

Hey guys  have anybody bought those 2nd hand display cars?Those that 2nd hand dealers sell  say only have 40km mileage cos display set and have 2.5 years of agent warranty.Is it advisable to buy those?,btohqsg
dosent hurt anyone leh  see we troll R for a quite awhile then he say,btohqsg
we tryna make friend with the admin,btohqsg
Everyday didi ask admin wad car u drive .,btohqsg
mine irritate less people only 🤣,btohqsg
Yes ive bought one before. If you are okay with the fact people have tried all their bs singaporean antics on the car then okay ba,btohqsg
Haha what you mean by Singaporean antics,btohqsg
Hahaha its all good fun sir. The admins don’t mind being asked that qn again and again😆-R,btohqsg
try to slam the door  see how heavy.ur boot and door hinges probably open and closed like some pre sch toy.Press the leather seat and slam it see how comfy...alot of things one la,btohqsg
Paintwork will be especially fked honestly,btohqsg
thats why i sold it after 6 mths cos my eyes cannot take it😂😂,btohqsg
but if you are not so particular about those minor details like me  it should be fine,btohqsg
Oh cos of paint work eh. But inner works should be ok la,btohqsg
Unleash@shaneeeeeeeeeeeee. Ok u r given permission to keep asking,btohqsg
its like a phv but everyday ppl go and try and shit,btohqsg
then they will move and shuffle their butts,btohqsg
Inner works as in engine parts etc? Or you referring to interior of the car?,btohqsg
make sure they replace one battery for you please,btohqsg
They leave the car running on its batt 24/7 then drain it all the way down  batt life will be gone case,btohqsg
if its those events cars i am fine  wont buy a display car imo,btohqsg
I just don't want later is they put the problematic car on display (look good  but inside cui),btohqsg
worse is the test car  everyday kena redlined to 7000rpm,btohqsg
no la all should be fine,btohqsg
"but it will be ""well used"" lor",btohqsg
As in what is test car,btohqsg
bro u try car never redline one meh,btohqsg
like speed till damn hiong  not so good for engine,btohqsg
i think if u buy those 40km shld be not driven yet so either display or events carp,btohqsg
which car you looking at leh,btohqsg
Oooo. It's a big discount from new set. But is from 2nd hand dealer,btohqsg
should be fine just new batt plus maybe new tires,btohqsg
see how long ago the car was reg,btohqsg
this can be nego in terms of price,btohqsg
But if the tires look new?,btohqsg
sure. if the price is a steal,btohqsg
uhh if car not moving  the tires will harden,btohqsg
how much the disc over new,btohqsg
u btr buy now before other ppl come steal,btohqsg
are you sure 60k discount? from a demo car?,btohqsg
Definitely better than other 2nd hand right? My other choice is an Audi Q5 2018,btohqsg
The issue is i see got about 10+ cars on sgcarmart with similar specs,btohqsg
u see which one u like better,btohqsg
Got so many display sets meh,btohqsg
Q5 bigger and better equipped imo,btohqsg
Display sets is it usually at BMW showrooms only? Or have other places also,btohqsg
sometimes have at shopping malls etc,btohqsg
-60k is not issue at all,btohqsg
Like is there so many display seys?,btohqsg
As long not scam can alr,btohqsg
display sets could be demo car,btohqsg
i think it’s really not bad,btohqsg
had the 2018 20i for awhile,btohqsg
it maybe the reason. difficult to sell,btohqsg
but u ask me choose Q5 vs X1 i choose Q5,btohqsg
i had one i really feel is a good car  decent legroom  bootspace and 190hp more then enough,btohqsg
but ya i still think q5 interior better hahahahhaa,btohqsg
Was thinking changing after 3 years. Do people normally buy cars that have about 3 to 4 years left on COE?,btohqsg
people will see badge and buy,btohqsg
Oooo. Even if left a few years,btohqsg
Badge you mean the brand right?,btohqsg
haha i know of someone who wanted prestige and bought a scirocco with two years left,btohqsg
I prefer the Q5. But the 60k discount on X1 seems like a steal 😂😂,btohqsg
i kid u not within a week it broke down,btohqsg
could be the employees drive home some haha,btohqsg
ive been doing this for the past few cars. Buy 1 or less year old and then sell exactly at 3,btohqsg
i think it’s a perk in some companies,btohqsg
you will lose the least money,btohqsg
and still have enough to downpay the next car,btohqsg
I see. Do you do that every 2 years?,btohqsg
i sell and collect every 3 years on 1st april😂😂😂,btohqsg
idk why also but alw april fools,btohqsg
come back w diff car people think i joking with them,btohqsg
Idk if u trolling or not🤨-R,btohqsg
i dont mind show you my old car listing,btohqsg
Do you go to same 2nd hand dealer?,btohqsg
nope i buy from wearnes new,btohqsg
haha wah i think for the price diff between the 20i  the 20i MAY be more worth,btohqsg
but that’s only if u want the extra oomph when u drive haha,btohqsg
Wait  what do you mean by reg and collect? Paiseh i new to 2nd hand cars,btohqsg
basically he bought new from the dealer in sg (wearnes),btohqsg
Oh really? Hmm...thats why got 60k diff,btohqsg
usually will take 3-4days after signing paper to prep and collect the car,btohqsg
no la the price diff in ur case is because it’s a display car,btohqsg
but on the used market the price diff between a 18i and 20i is actually not too bad considering there is a 50hp diff,btohqsg
but i do miss that car tbh😂😂,btohqsg
if yall have any volvo to review and need presenter you know who to call... can help you make 2hr long documentary,btohqsg
S60 and S90 used to be very popular on our roads. But I seldom see them anymore-R,btohqsg
got alot nowadays leh  but the real rare ones are S90 inscription,btohqsg
they turn my head more times than supercars,btohqsg
I seldom see leh…or maybe its because volvos don’t turn my head😂-R,btohqsg

Depends.Last year Oct/NovCartimes/Vince has two 2yr old BMW 216GT management unit.Still under agent warranty 3 more years.,btohqsg
Show us the sgcarmart link to ur chosen car,btohqsg
Then I can give better feedback,btohqsg
management unit  is the staff drive one,btohqsg
regularly serviced and checked on by PML/wearnes/cnc for example,btohqsg

Help me fund my 370z please,btohqsg

or buy a older gen mx5 :D,btohqsg
Stop scolding bad words lah omg,btohqsg

on a very good day 9l/100km,btohqsg

and if my car is lagging  19l,btohqsg
eh y’all don’t come cancel me say use phone while driving all. it’s my passenger take hor,btohqsg
why u use phone while driving,btohqsg
Why u spoil my used car posting for tmr🥲-R,btohqsg
Great minds think alike i guess,btohqsg
Wow 99k for 6 years. Sounds like a steal,btohqsg
Can try posting cars that are old but 1 owner!,btohqsg
let say coe car that is 1 owner,btohqsg
Ya this one quite reasonably priced,btohqsg
i find those pretty cool and a good buy,btohqsg
Think cause the road tax also chor,btohqsg
Been keeping tabs on it for a while,btohqsg
this is it😂😂 good find HAHA,btohqsg
Haha yes indeed a gem and a sleeper too,btohqsg
Just slap on a 640i badge,btohqsg
4400cc somemore. N coe. The road tax is so expensive,btohqsg
Arbo u buy m6. Also 4400cc,btohqsg
Seems like a pretty good buy imo-R,btohqsg
Get m6. 650 n m6 r 4400cc. Might as well get m6,btohqsg
Haha think of it as last hurrah before going ev,btohqsg
Road tax cheaper than a tesla m3p for now.,btohqsg
u buy 650 will regret not buy m6 1,btohqsg
I think so too. Price has been stagnant for a while.,btohqsg
I like the way you think-R,btohqsg
Technically its the same engine with a few upgrades on the m6 but the m6 gc is asking for 26k-27k depre.,btohqsg
If u want value for money the f10 m5 is only 18k depre. Same 4.4 v8,btohqsg
Great difference. 650 use n63. M6 use s63,btohqsg
Yes but the main difference is the turbo only,btohqsg
And m6 top speed is 330,btohqsg
Honestly launch control  nobody ever uses it,btohqsg
M6 side mirrors look very cool,btohqsg
Hahaha by the time you engage  the other car might be miles(or kms) away,btohqsg
Yes thats true. But i always prefer a sleeper anyway,btohqsg
Oh thats nice. Mine takes i think 5 secs lol. Not that i have tried anyway,btohqsg
With launch control  B4 car move  the rpm already 6k,btohqsg
Wow 6k is really high for launch control,btohqsg
Ppl see ur badge m6 also balls shrink,btohqsg
Ya the Ms do get much better stuff  but at a premium,btohqsg
Not sure im willing to pay another 8k per year for that. Definitely not over the m5,btohqsg
i got a friend that got a fresh 10yr 650 at 145k,btohqsg
Hahaha ask pete. I've never seen one,btohqsg
Yeah it has. But in recent times  this unit price hasn't moved. Or at least not by much,btohqsg
Maybe because the 650i is very niche. It makes sense to get the m6 if u got the moolah. Or the m5 if u got less moolah,btohqsg
personally will go with the 6,btohqsg
F10 reputation abit fked from those yp,btohqsg
anyway for anyone whose interested all launch control does is limit torque throttle and gear to ensure maximum acceleration from standing start... not as some joker claim,btohqsg
6k rpm can wheelspin till 3rd gear if you get 4.4 V8 turb,btohqsg
ikr  but cannot let misleading comments go,btohqsg
I think everyone here is dying to know  maybe u can tell us what car is it so we can learn a thing or two,btohqsg
im curious tho  uk what is 650 competitor or does it not have a direct competitor,btohqsg
0 to 100 kph - Yes,btohqsg
No idea  not my league hahaha,btohqsg
but for 650 coupe dont have leh,btohqsg
Bro get either 640 or m6,btohqsg
I dont think the sl came with the sub amg variant,btohqsg
yeah thats what i thought too,btohqsg
Will let u know when i get one,btohqsg
Bro after u get the 6 series u need to zhng a lot of things,btohqsg
HiPeteplease don't be so bad. Everyone has to learn somewhere. We would like this channel to be that 'somewhere' without people judging them for their lack of knowledge,btohqsg
Maybe u can teach me to launch,btohqsg
The idrive  instrument cluster n steering wheel r ancient. all need to change,btohqsg
Nope. Just a simple admin for a humble channel,btohqsg
would be better if it was a 200 but 1.6 is fine too,btohqsg
The idrive must change to id6. Abt 3k+.,btohqsg
Lol i drive somrthing that is older than that. Even my kid says my car is lousy,btohqsg
Damn. If a 4 year old tells you your car is lousy  that's gotta hurt,btohqsg
any chance you adopting? i also wan sit 650,btohqsg
What car you driving now sir?-R,btohqsg
last time when the CLS first came out i wanted one so badly,btohqsg
sat in the CLS350 and fell in love,btohqsg
Hahaha if i ever buy one  i might be shamed in this chat. But i'll hit you up,btohqsg
You won’t be shamed sir  trust me😊-R,btohqsg
Haha just a 14yr old car.,btohqsg
HEHEHE no la whatever car 640 650 M6 is good alr la,btohqsg
i drive 1.3a swift with fking 112nm of torque,btohqsg
No shaming. Don't worry. The fact that all of you have a car to drive in Singapore means you put in quite a significant amount of financial commitment for it. Mad respect for everyone who can afford to own a car in Singapore. -J,btohqsg
hahahha never to late to slip that qn in eh,btohqsg
better than me i only Bus Mrt Walk,btohqsg
rmbr to get the turn signal/ indicator option,btohqsg
Its more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slow.,btohqsg
LOL. My car from kimchi land,btohqsg
Not like if buy m6 u get to drive 330kph,btohqsg
soon la going to buy GR86 liao,btohqsg
back then clearing carbon was a monthly sometimes weekly affair,btohqsg
Id 6 is the best original idrive upgrade for ur 650,btohqsg
Receiving bad rep now cuz of that dumb mother n son duo,btohqsg
True that. The govt certainly does not cut any slack,btohqsg
Ceratos are good till 8th year onwards,btohqsg
i love ceratos so much man,btohqsg
i drive 1.6 subaru and often clown myself about it’s reliability don’t worry hahaha,btohqsg
I have many years left then!,btohqsg
I spent more than 5k on my koup  the FB group members also raise a lot of issues,btohqsg
wah new one too! even better,btohqsg
Just did my first inspection 2 months ago-J,btohqsg
Well  i drive a bmw  so unfortunately i also know a thing or two about reliability hahahah,btohqsg
However I love my koup  cheaper than other 2 doors,btohqsg
hahahaha 14 years meaning 08 right,btohqsg
i also think its a good car  just bo lat,btohqsg
No need shy one. We love cars of all sorts of engine capacities. From 660cc cars like the copen to 6.5-litre cars like the Aventador🥰-R,btohqsg
Ok le  I drive in n out jb,btohqsg
Bro how long hv u not driven bmw?,btohqsg
Now I love koup  eyeing to get 1 Scirocco,btohqsg
wah be careful when choosing hahaha,btohqsg
a lot of them got underlying issues,btohqsg
I met a guy who was selling xv told me sirocco is his fav car,btohqsg
Can consider the 2.0-litre scirocco R. Heard got lesser underlying issues as compared to the 1.4-litre one-R,btohqsg
Don't get stuck between a roc and a hard place - J,btohqsg
the scirocco R is a good car too,btohqsg
Thanks all bro for the advice,btohqsg
Same dq250 trans as the 2.0L. Which is also not spared from the deadly mu,btohqsg
Why sad. If i were to get a scirocco  i would get the 1.4. Super fuel efficient,btohqsg
Buying the 2.0L is like buying the 650i. Some will say its dumb,btohqsg
With all the gabra bimmers hogging the headlines now vw owners safe liao,btohqsg
I know of someone that drives the 1.4-litre rocco. He changed his mechatronics unit twice during his ownership. And yet  he says his rocco is one of the pretty “not bad” ones.So see if you brave enough to buy🤭-R,btohqsg
Coz I never try vv b4 I researching which model is best. Come down to golf Vs Scirocco,btohqsg
Scirocco. Because golf price is skyrocketing for the gti and r,btohqsg
Both the 1.4 variants of the golf and scirocco uses the same platform tho-R,btohqsg
Golf better for family  roc better for xmm,btohqsg
https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1110246I think the passat wagon seems pretty good for a family car too😍-R,btohqsg
Street rep not as bad as the f10  but cant say the same for reliability,btohqsg
640 can already. No need 650.,btohqsg
If want 650  go for m6,btohqsg
Car times? Move on with life better...,btohqsg

im talking abt sequential manual in cars,btohqsg
1.4Litre MU repair Ard 1 500 😂👍Ask him change golf R. MU repair 3500😜,btohqsg
"Ya I know😂Same  quick shift ma😂👍It's costly for manufacturer to put in.Like you said Anything has ""race use"" modifications will not be allow on street used I believe 😀",btohqsg
Don’t know how many have been bought by broke bois that cheap out on repairs,btohqsg
YOLO 😂1.4L not expensive to repair,btohqsg
What is your definition of “not expensive” sir,btohqsg
i only see volvo catch on fire twice,btohqsg
Not sure if its illegal but lta does entertain request from changing the teans from manual to auto  and vice versa. And i know people who had it done.,btohqsg
But there was a manual car that installed a sequential shifter  and was quite well known  so it could be legal,btohqsg
Haha my circle not so atas. My friend changed his 135i auto to manual,btohqsg
manual to seq manual v hard,btohqsg
i heard only gtr do in sg,btohqsg
Thats so troublesome  why not get a auto one instead lol,btohqsg
because seq manual will have less drivetrain loss  faster shifting and sounds cooler,btohqsg
all those GT3 cars in FIA racing series use seq manual,btohqsg
I mean like why mess with the gtr gearbox unless its going to be a full blown race car. For the sound  you can install aluminium bushings for the transmission  should get a similar whine,btohqsg
Even road legal prosche GT3? Also comes with seq shifter?,btohqsg
Porsche? U ask him Suzuki swift ok la.,btohqsg
Then he will talk abt swift until got dragons n tigers,btohqsg
Straight cut gears makes the special whining sound on the sequential box,btohqsg

Hi guys just hoping some advice on ceramic coatings pls- after coating i dont need to wax/polish anymore? Next time just go petrol station car wash can already?- if kena bird droppings i wash off can alr or need to apply touch up coating?- whats the diff between ceramic coating and diamond coating?Thanks in advance for all your advice!,btohqsg
1. Polish before Ceramic Coating. You will still have to maintain the car after the coating. I honestly hate petrol kiosk washing cos they dont wash properly plus their cloth is probably v contaminated will cause alotnof swirl marks. Preferrably wash at home or bring to a proper car wash that uses pH neutral soap.2. Kena birdshit just wash  dont wait too long. Birdshit can permanantly stain the car paint3. i have no idea... marketing gimmicks maybe???,btohqsg
Just imagine ceramic coating as a sacrifficial layer. It will eventually wear off as time pass,btohqsg
im very particular about small details like paint etc so i will always wash at home to ensure that outside car wash dont bring it swirl marks etc,btohqsg
I did my ceramic coating and weekly I just spray water and wipe it dry. That's all. I don't send to petrol station. As the cloth they use will cause scratches. I've a separate cloth for Rims and Body.As for bird shit. Have to remove it immediately. If not it will definitely leave a mark.Don't scratch to remove it. Usually I'll just place a tissue and pour water over it. Leave it for 5 mins and wipe it off. Comes off easily. And doesn't scratch the paint.Ceramic or diamond or whatever they call it. I suppose is a marketing gimmick. I'm no expert. So cannot really advise.,btohqsg
The diff coating (ceramic/diamond) refers to the finish and hardness.Common one is 9HThere’s also self healing coating in the market now adays. Not fool proof  only works for certain level of scratches,btohqsg
Nope but planning to. Diff mounts are due for a change,btohqsg
Only bird droppings need wipe immediately  so always keep a pack of ph neutral wet wipes haha,btohqsg
Graphene Nano CoatingCeramic is the past.,btohqsg
Have a bottle of QD in the car. Spray QD liberally and wipe off the droppings as soon as possible.,btohqsg
Woah… you guys are so high level. What car are you driving sir? I feel it’s like one of those M cars lidat,btohqsg
Wait . What’s QD! I always get bird dropping on my rickshaw and sometimes on my head too at work,btohqsg
many choices to pick from  last time RS3/4/6 was the choice then got v90  which is still lovely now as a middle point between everythingbut end up with newer cars being released  m3 touring takes the cake,btohqsg
hahaha short term drive worth la,btohqsg
Any bro got experience with XF?,btohqsg

So nothing out of the blue right..?,btohqsg
