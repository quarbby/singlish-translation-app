https://www.fongkim.com.sg/product/hks-exhaust-system-new-honda-vezel-1-5l/If you read properly it does not limit installing aftermarket systems. Just the noise that comes with it. As long as they meet the UN spec for sound and emissions you can. This why still have HKS exhaust for many jap cars still you just need to find and go through the process. Like this newer vezel still have.,btohqsg

Hi anyone had deal with miracle motosport before,btohqsg
as long got ECE approved exhaust lta will approve,btohqsg
but now lta approval is car by car basis,btohqsg
not blanket approval  (eg approved before rest sure approve),btohqsg
Cars after 1 April 2023 don't need to think,btohqsg
not true  my friend 2024 m340i also put remus lta approved,btohqsg
yr car no approved exhaust doesnt mean other cars dont have,btohqsg
So a Remus on a M340i can pass sound test but a HKS super silent on Vezel RV3 cannot pass sound test,btohqsg
I'm very sure the dB is louder on e Remus,btohqsg
inline6 stock already loud so have allowance lor,btohqsg
