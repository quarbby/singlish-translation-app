tiktok is better  nobody goes insta to find tuition 💀,btohqsg
hard for me to trust private tutors on tiktok either,btohqsg
feel like for a lot of them it’s more about showing how cool their tutoring is and not how effective,btohqsg
i only get intrigued by those who go thru qns on live,btohqsg
tiktok is jst ppl doing lives on pri sch math,btohqsg
there are ways to sell it that way to teens,btohqsg

does anyone have pdf copied combined chem/bio tys papers  thank you. js dm me,btohqsg
or u only got lame ass physics,btohqsg
Israel claims they didn't and provided evidence though. They claimed the hospital was hit by HAMAS rockets accidentally. I try find the source hold on,btohqsg
And apparently 500 people died from such a small crater.Facts are blur from both sides. We don't know who did it for sure until more reports come out. But if we look at it from a wider view  Israel doesn't really have an agenda to bomb the hospital and get more flak from the international communityTake everything with a pinch of salt and draw your own conclusions,btohqsg
playing with fire ends in fire,btohqsg
That's why HAMAS will be destroyed,btohqsg
Fr...yall rmb this? this was a martenity hospital in ukraine...bombed by russia,btohqsg
Yeah and what happened to their 3 day war now lmfao,btohqsg
Israel is heading for a two-front war,btohqsg
mood im just too heartless to care (sorry),btohqsg
This and also because Israel counters the influence of Iran and Assad  both enemies of US,btohqsg
the problem is the US laready has two strike groups stationed near Israel...If israel is about to open another war  its very likely biden will act,btohqsg
us got a lot of companies based in Israel,btohqsg
Information is still fresh so we won't know for sure but both sides make logical arguments.,btohqsg
tbh in a war I wouldn’t trust info,btohqsg
US said they won't get involved unless another nation intervenes against Israel. The 2 CVs are there mostly for symbolic reasons,btohqsg
lebanon is about to become that 2nd nation,btohqsg
Delta force too but they are prepped for hostage exfil,btohqsg
Many Lebanese don't support Hezbollah though but they can feel free to try.,btohqsg
Because Israel wants blood in revenge.,btohqsg
🚨Foreign citizens killed/missing in Israel:🇺🇸 USA - 9 dead🇨🇦 Canada - 1 dead  2 missing🇬🇧 Great Britain - more than 10 dead or missing🇫🇷 France - one dead  several missing🇹🇭 Thailand - 12 dead  11 missing🇳🇵 Nepal - 10 dead🇩🇪 Germany - number of unconfirmed/missing deaths/HOSTAGES🇷🇺 Russia - 1 dead / 4 missing🇰🇭 Cambodia - 1 dead🇨🇳 China - number of deaths/casualties not confirmed🇧🇷 Brazil - 3 injured🇵🇾 Paraguay - 2 dead/missing🇺🇦 Ukraine - 2 dead🇲🇽 Mexico - 2 prisoners🇮🇪 Ireland - 1 injured🇹🇿 Tanzania - 2 injured🇦🇷 Argentina - 4 dead  5 missing🇮🇹 Italy - 2 MissingNow you see how terrifying Hamas is and why they are a cancer being left alive?,btohqsg
This was on second day only,btohqsg
nah HAMAS isn't out here to reclaim Israel. They literally killed and targeted Muslims from Sri Lanka  Bangladesh and India. They don't care whether your Jewish or Muslim. As long as you are a human  they kill or kidnap you.And when you goal is to kill people  you aren't rebels or freedom fighters but a terrorist organization.,btohqsg
so many countries are getting involved,btohqsg
Nah the amount of retards and woke people supporting HAMAS...,btohqsg
Wait till you join a pro HAMAS tele chat and you will know what's the definition of stupid,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA thats so messed up bruv,btohqsg
Same like the Russian chats. Man that shit is cancer lol,btohqsg
i was just scrollin through reddit and look what i found,btohqsg
And then with both sides accusing each other of child killings. The discussions get heated sometimes,btohqsg
Guys  a intresting question is..Do you support the Us in destabilising the middle east after 9/11?In my eyes i do  simply because...They were there to act as a deterrent against terrorism..Plain and SImple,btohqsg
Yes Saudi joined against Israel before.Now they have a symbiotic relationship because both hate Iran,btohqsg
Afghanistan was justified. Syria was more about ISIS than Al Qaeda. But Iraq was dumb as fuck,btohqsg
US supporting everyone except Americans 💀💀💀,btohqsg
Assad was the bastard using chemical weapons on civilians on more than 20 occasions. Assad should die along with anyone who supports him Including Russia.,btohqsg
you should readup on the 1993 world trade center bombing...where a iraqi intelligence operation was carried out to bomb the world trade center,btohqsg
Nah but Iraq 2003 was a failure. The power struggles that followed was a failure of the US military. Killed more people than needed,btohqsg
A Jewish state surrounded by Muslim countries 💀,btohqsg
US spends more on Israel than they buy from US. Israel donestic arms industry is big enough where they don't rely on Us weapons,btohqsg
And for Afghanistan  US didn't care about Taliban monkeys. They wanted Al Qaeda and Osama but Taliban didn't want to give them up.I understand the war there but continuing to fight for a decade after Osama was dead is stupid asf,btohqsg
From an Iranian channel btwTw blood,btohqsg
the world defeated isis is a worse lie than my dog ate my homework,btohqsg
bud thinks isis only existed in syria...,btohqsg
As an ideology but not as a state. Only lone wolf attacks now and then from radicals but they aren't organized like before,btohqsg
ISIS is long gone. The remnants don't make a state anymore and many have been assimilated into other groups like boko haram,btohqsg
Also there are a lot of other terrorist organisations will come soon,btohqsg
Yeah ISIS doesn't exist as a state anymore that's what I meant. Still as an ideology but they aren't as organized as before. Previously  they even had a damn capital and governmental system.,btohqsg
terriost is a very commonly used term tbh,btohqsg
Anyone whose sole purpose is to kill is a terrorist. For example HAMAS since they go after anyone  Muslims and tourists included,btohqsg
at this point   i will even consider ISREAL a terrirosts,btohqsg
any country who partake in war and retaliate is a terriosts,btohqsg
war is a 2 person game not 1,btohqsg
and the hamas and isreal issue is a very complicated issue,btohqsg
this is probably the dumbest shit I have heard,btohqsg
war is and itself is a issue alr,btohqsg
bec you are harming lifes on both sides,btohqsg
neither palasteins and isrealies civilinans chose to enter a conflict,btohqsg
maybe we should put all those world leaders who want to have war at the Artic and let them fight it out among themselves,btohqsg
france did that in ww2....they fell to germany in 6 weeks,btohqsg
yeah   hitler was a mad man,btohqsg
in comparison...it took japan 2 months (8 weeks) to take malaysia,btohqsg
tbh   I foresee with so many things going on I see in the next 20 years tops we  are going to see another hilter like person and we will see ww3,btohqsg
"we wont lmao...before this ""hitler"" wannabe even start to rise  here comes drone attacks  self-driving tanks  self-driving warships",btohqsg
hitler was never stop in conquest to power,btohqsg
so yall liked my freediving? 😏,btohqsg
ya lor I only have Physics hardcopy,btohqsg
if u stay far or >30mins away,btohqsg
i feel its not worth it,btohqsg
i hate tp with a passion,btohqsg
im not even gonna go grad ceremony,btohqsg
i thought there are only 3 polys,btohqsg
if u want me to say why sure,btohqsg
also amath is very impt esp for engineering courses,btohqsg
H2 Maths very importantF Maths will help even more,btohqsg
Someone should interview the English LC voice actors  some of them have been doing this forever lmao,btohqsg
I'm actually curious who they are now,btohqsg
i’m going to tp next year 💀,btohqsg
the only ppl i know that went to TP other than distance is bcos they wanna do law or psych,btohqsg
Maybe I should email mothership and ask if they can help  curious because so many people hear them every year and we don't know who they are,btohqsg
any1 think article cming out tmw,btohqsg
don’t want to see that piece of shit sch ever again,btohqsg
I seriously like can’t put into words,btohqsg
the hate I have for this school,btohqsg
Thanks for reminding me I shld go kekw,btohqsg
thank god im halfway done with ns,btohqsg
why do people just insert themselves into othe peoples business,btohqsg
imagine something ur not even involved in,btohqsg
u bring urself in and now u have to pay,btohqsg
but srs woman why u insert urself,btohqsg
ya she damn extra sia now she got fked,btohqsg
at first i tot she is the girl or sth,btohqsg
I mean I get that it sucks on her part,btohqsg
but she has not relation to the guy,btohqsg
of all place she go stir shit on linkedin also funny,btohqsg
then she go a play play with the law,btohqsg
even if that guy fucked up,btohqsg
honestly she had no right to call him out in the way she did,btohqsg
she’s not directly involved and isn’t even in the same campus,btohqsg
the fella was running was running for ntusu uncontested when they dug up a scandal on him that they say was hush hushed by the sxh,btohqsg
this lady here just called him out on linked implying that he’s a sexual assaulter or smth without proof and then he got a lawyer asked her to apologise and now has escalated the thing to a court case,btohqsg
that's a quick and clear summary. Thanks,btohqsg
for a prospective lawyer and a law student that’s kinda…. ironic,btohqsg
