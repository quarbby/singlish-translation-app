But UOB 1k spend each month = $33.33.. it is better right?,btohqsg
only if you spend exact $1000. if you spend more it's less percentage,btohqsg
I normally use HSBC advanced after 1k.,btohqsg
to summarize/ add on a little of differences between Uob visa signature & uob PPVUOB PPVboth local and overseasmobile contactless transactionswill qualify for 4 mpd  capped at a maximum of S$1 110 percalendar month.UOB VISA SIGNATUREThere is no such restrictions for the UOB Visa Signature. You can either tap thephysical card or use it via a mobile wallet (mobile contactless)to earn 4 mpd.This is subject to a minimum local spend of S$1 000 per statement month  and capped at S$2 000 perstatement month.üòä just to take note,btohqsg
Whats the best credit card for big ticket spending on gym equipment (around 5k),btohqsg
Hi about uob one when I call them to ask about the cut off date for the card it say 12th every months but when I go to internet banking unde uob one bank account activities it says10th,btohqsg
It say combined spending from card as. Of 10 Dec,btohqsg
So does it mean mine uon one cutoff day is 10th of every month to earn the extra cash back - interest,btohqsg
If you talking about min $500 card spend to clock for bonus interest on uob one account  it is by calendar month. I believe you started the uob one account on 10th Dec? Subsequent month will be 1st to end of calendar month.As for quarterly rebate on the uob one credit card it is based on statement month. If your statement date is 12th  then spending posted between 13th to 12th next month is counted to a statement month. It may take a few days for transactions to be posted so should try to make the spend earlier. Need to clock tiered spending and min 5 transactions in all 3 qualifying statement months to get the quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
Still puzzling so I follow the uob one cut off date at 12_13th tfo enjoy the quarter rebate right so mine last day to spend is 11th & if spend in 12th it will be considered as next month?,btohqsg
Then the uob one bank acc min $500 spend ti clock bonus interest I can ignore?,btohqsg
Hi all  any clue if i use Amex tcb > Grabpay > AXS for credit card bill  will I still be able to get the 1.5% cashback?,btohqsg
Couldn't I call in to ask uob to adjust both the bank acc & uob one statement cut off dates to match?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure  but I think I read it before on hwz somebody tried before.I might be wrong.My dates also don‚Äôt sync but I just live with it  I think it‚Äôs negligible for me,btohqsg
So I need to try to Match spending $500 before the 10th of every months for the extra interest?,btohqsg
U are referring to UOB ONE savings or UOB One CC?Both works different,btohqsg
I'm trying to see if can earn both,btohqsg
Dunno how to match it as both diff date,btohqsg
Unless I call on to ask to change the uob one cc to change to same date as the UOB one savings,btohqsg
Do share your findings? I would be interested to know too if there‚Äôs a successful precedence  then maybe I can try my luck too üòÇ,btohqsg
If I don't call in to askMaybe u suggestions I try spend $500 before 10th of every month and after 12th is consider next months,btohqsg

"Could i ask if we use DBS WWC in some restaurants that has ""QR code"" menu and payment via apple pay on the spot  would it be considered ""online spending"" for 4mpd too?",btohqsg
I think can just direct use the card if using shopeeBut do check  taobao might have Cashback for Instarem if it‚Äôs foreign currency spend.I‚Äôm not into taobao so I‚Äôm not very sure,btohqsg

What a healthy hobby. Financial prudence screw it lol... We'll never know!If you legit own a business  charge them all to the SQ HighFlyer Card - if they accept Amex. Or ask if they accept PayPal even if it means you spend to pay on Amex. 1.8 mpd I think?If you haven't hit the min spend for automatic fee waiver  you might give OCBC or Maybank credit cards a go.If not  just use any 1.2 mpd or 1.6% card lor.,btohqsg
