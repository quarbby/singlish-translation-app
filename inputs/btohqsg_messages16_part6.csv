Ya actually is quite funny the fact that gov wanna ask us to get married and have kids earlier but yet bto for full time uni student is so hard,btohqsg
ESP if upcoming may bto  serangoon confirm hot spot also,btohqsg
and waiting time so long also  else i would earn money and apply later and still get a bto in my late 20s,btohqsg
Ya lo because of the waiting time  that why me n my bf want to apply earlier but Haix,btohqsg
Agreed  but I wanted to make sure have enough if nt we are the one is gonna suffer if ever we managed to get it,btohqsg
we all apply  then after actually get the q number and book flat then wonder how to pay off â€¦,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ but if got full time job then still okay la,btohqsg
if letâ€™s say we take loan from bank to pay downpayment  does it affect us signing for housing loan? Just curious,btohqsg
Student can apply for deferred income assessment no meh?,btohqsg
Best is one working one studying Grant Gao Gao 80 kBook one woodlands bto maybe 220+ k can get Liao,btohqsg
It doesn't affect. I'm under bank loan from the start and have signed my lease agreement during my second appointment.,btohqsg
You just need to be aware that when you take a bank loan  your downpayment is 5% cash and 20% CPF/cash,btohqsg
If you are under staggered downpayment scheme  your second appointment you pay 10%  out of which 5%mustbe cash.During third appointment you pay remaining 15% downpayment using CPF/cash.If not under staggered downpayment scheme  then5% must be in cash and 15% CPF/cashDuring third appointment you pay 5% in CPF,btohqsg
This one shld be for applicants under the age of 30,btohqsg
Can't seem to locate the document... What is your question ah?,btohqsg
I was asking this!But if letâ€™s say we take loan from bank to pay downpayment  does it affect us signing for housing loan? Just curious,btohqsg
Cause students donâ€™t have any grants yet to be received to pay for downpayment,btohqsg
This is if Iâ€™m taking a loan or ?,btohqsg
Doesn't affect. But you need to be aware of these costs.If both of you are students or have not been working for more than 12 months  then you are automatically under Deferred Income Assessment.,btohqsg
Ok i go check it out thanks a lot,btohqsg
Yes. It applies if you are taking a bank loan.,btohqsg
My bf is in NS and Iâ€™m studying Uni but working part time,btohqsg
Then can I ask if letâ€™s say I apply housing loan from hdb  is it still the same as compared to outside bank loan?,btohqsg
Not counted. As long as you're a full time student  you'll be under Deferred Income Assessment.Got ppl try before liao,btohqsg
Can you elaborate what you mean by same as compared to bank loan?,btohqsg
Bank loan means like I take a loan from outside bank like example Maybank or DBS etcThen if Iâ€™m nt wrong  I rmb we can take housing loan from hdb itself. But Iâ€™m not sure if housing loan can be immediately to be disbursed to be use for downpayment?  Or the housing loan is just for future,btohqsg
You going for BTO or SBF?,btohqsg
Bank loan need proof of income if not they won't lend to you.Most likely you are auto Deferred Income Assessment (DIA).Meaning your HLE and EHG will be assessed nearer to key collection.Please read up on how DIA works.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/booking-of-flatPlease also note that even if you are under DIA  you are still required to pay the option fee during first appointment  and 5% downpayment (assuming you are under Staggered downpayment scheme)  buyer stamp duty fees and HDB conveying fees during your second appointment.,btohqsg
I also got a bto flatâ€¦ i paid 10% downpayment with my ehg,btohqsg
You took bank loan or HDB loan?,btohqsg
And selected a unit on Jun 2022,btohqsg
Ok then just follow this. Just budget and prepare the option fee and the second appointment payments. After that should be nothing to pay until just before key collection,btohqsg
I got a 2 room flexi unit,btohqsg
Yours is how many room flat,btohqsg
From August 2023 onwards  first-time homebuyers who register one non-selection will be relegated to second-timer status for a year. If they then still decline to choose a flat  they will be blocked from HDB sales exercises for a year. The change will also apply to the Sale-of-Balance-Flats (SBF) programme.Second-timers have much lower priority and fewer opportunities to book a flat. Almost all â€“ at least 95 per cent â€“ of BTO flats are reserved for first-timers.The non-selection count will be waived for those with 10 or fewer BTO flats to choose from at their flat selection appointment  or five or fewer SBF flats to choose from.,btohqsg
Choose or lose your BTO spot: HDB tightens rules on flat selection,btohqsg
Bank will not loan you cash if you don't have full time employment records,btohqsg
If financial no issue 2 is better coz your cash went into asset while in 1 it goes into depreciating liability (car),btohqsg
u looking at ulu pandan 4 room or 3 room?,btohqsg
Agree. Just apply first coz by the time build and near key collection easily 5 yrs from now by then uvwill draw good full time salary. I hope by student u mean final year not first year,btohqsg
How did u apply for the HDB Loan? Can perhaps full time uni students or NS ppl apply if ever get a slot for selection?,btohqsg
Understand! How about the HDB loan that you guys have been mentioning?,btohqsg
That is part of hdb application process where they will only assess your income near the end of whole long process. I guess the thing to ask hdb now is to give u a clearer timeline given X project u applying for,btohqsg
Is there an email address or ?,btohqsg
u can just call them directly,btohqsg
they can answer basically every question you have,btohqsg
Today I good mood I spoon-feed u.,btohqsg
I saw this that day for the staggered downpayment scheme and this deferred income statement thing,btohqsg
So find a good stable job and choose unit wisely don't waste your one time chance and all the best.,btohqsg
But was just concerning regarding if letâ€™s say idh enough cpf  so my only option is to pay the remaining by cash right?,btohqsg
