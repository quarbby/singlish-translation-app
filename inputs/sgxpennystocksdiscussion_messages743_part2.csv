ðŸŽ‰Pika World Daily Review â€“ 9 December 2022ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ¢A relief comebackðŸ’ŽIt was a tough trading day as we swung up to down and backed up again. Eventually  the S&P 500 snapped off a five-day losing trend as investors warmed to the latest economic data. The S & P 500 is working on consolidating at the 3900 level.Investors appeared to have some reservoir of trust and confidence that the Fed is almost in its final sprint of a rate hike  but caution is still advisable.ðŸŽ¯Initial Jobless Claims sparked relief  and next is PPI day!ðŸŽ²The jobless claim stood at 230 000  higher than the prior result. It is good news because it portrays that the labour market is cooling and possibly helping inflation to tilt downward.Beyond this data  we will receive the Producer Price Index today. If we see companies facing rising costs at a much slower rate  they can give a breather to raise prices slowly  which can help provide fertile ground for inflation to decline. And on that note  it keeps alive on Fed's pausing rate hike narrative again.ðŸ§®Threading on a fine lineðŸ”‘Any piece of news now appears to have both sides of the analogy. It's similar to a contrarian play in most situations. Ultimately  investors hope to see signs of economic growth waning but at a moderate pace such that it can avoid recession or a soft landing. The bond market is signalling such a situation as a tall task as the yield curve had inverted long ago.Hence  the question remains whether we can arrive at a soft landing pad and ride out the inflation decline to prepare for a more normalized macro environment.ðŸ“®What's on the menu today?ðŸ“–At 9.30 pm  we will have the PPI for MoM data which we expect a moderate growth of 0.2%  similar to the prior period.At 11 pm  we can expect the Michigan Consumer Sentiment  and we can expect an uptick to 56.9 from  56.8.It is 9 December  Friday  at 8.55 am in Singapore and 7.55 pm in New York. It is the week's final trading day  and we wish everyone a safe and prosperous week ahead!,btohqsg
