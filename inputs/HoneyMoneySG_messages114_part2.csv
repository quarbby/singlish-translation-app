You can xfer this month as well tho? Why need to wait for next month,btohqsg
My app does not inform me anything. Just that when I check my interest credited the amount is not correct,btohqsg
Hi  for Giro setup to make other bank credit card payment via EGA  i have to use the manual Giro forms from the respective individual banks? Thanks,btohqsg
The website does. You can login and check,btohqsg
Said wrongly. I meant for the month of June,btohqsg
You can check on the ocbc web  it will say how much salary was credited. Did you not receive the salary interest? Or which interest did you not receive.It‚Äôs either you get or you don‚Äôt get. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúamount not correct scenario‚Äù,btohqsg
Yes. You also need to setup signature with HSBC at the branch before you submit any forms,btohqsg
Do you meant the bank will inform me if I login through ocbc online banking via PC instead of mobile banking?,btohqsg
I see thanks. I usually checked via mobile banking. Mobile app doesn't tell me anything,btohqsg
Anyone knows if UOB Krisflyer Credit Card annual fee is waivable?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone here investing with bigfundr? Can share how legit and if satisfy ?,btohqsg
Using Maybank fnf card for bus/mrt a few days. The fare doesn‚Äôt show up in app or in Apple Pay even though 2 weeks alr,btohqsg
You can check SimplyGo app and bank app (after posted).Transactions for MasterCard contactless (like Maybank F&F) will accumulate for 5 days of trips/$15 of fares  whichever earlier.Transactions for Visa contactless will accumulate daily.The accumulated transactions will only post after 3 days  which will take another 3 business days (based on experience) to reflect on the bank app.The longest for MasterCard contactless will be about 11 business days from the first trip.,btohqsg
Hey. Did you received your interest? I‚Äôm tempted to try with them as well. Will be happy to hear your thoughts. Thanks,btohqsg

Need to add Sui to that group to balance it üòÇ,btohqsg
So far Is Heymax pretty accurate ?.. trying to check some restaurants that hsbc revo giving bonus points,btohqsg
For the most of it yes (since HSBC Revolution is VISA)  but not as accurate and reliable as empty Amaze wallet method.,btohqsg
This chat group is my place to talk rubbish whenever I‚Äôm bored hence I also changed my name for this purpose so my friends in real life don‚Äôt laugh at me.,btohqsg
Touch√©  but again final decision by the owner of this public group chat. Certain rules need to be observed. üòÖ,btohqsg
Back to mourning for UOB EVOL card and finding next best alternative.For those who have left UOB One account can look at SCB Smart Credit Card for 6%-ish cashback.1. Reward ispoint basedinstead of direct cashback (need to redeem üëéüèª  but can rollover üëçüèª)2. Can be considered as semi-general spend card asbonus pointsare awarded only for'Qualifying Merchants'  but base points are still awarded for non-'Qualifying Merchants'3.No annual feeperpetually4.No minimum spendrequired (but take note on how points are awarded)5.Base pointswill be awarded based on1.6 points per $1 on each transaction(data point)6.Bonus pointswill be awarded based on17.6 points per $1 on total accumulated 'Qualifying Merchants' transactions(data point)7.Bonus pointsis capped at14400 pointsperstatement month(base points no cap)8.Points redemptionscan only be made inblocks of 3200 points($10 cashback)9. With the bonus points limit in place  the max optimised spending amount is $818.2  which clocks 15710 points (will not be so accurate best to track on Excel)10. With 15710 points  you can redeem 12800 points for $40 cashback (familiar number?)  but with leftover 2910 points (which you can accumulate another 290 points on the following month to redeem $10 cashback)Other information like exclusions and 'Qualifying Merchants' can be found on t&chere.Always read the t&c first before committing to anything.Appreciate Oscar's efforts to help correct any errors found.,btohqsg
Hi guys  let's say I've setup IRAS personal income tax GIRO payment plan to debit from account A.Can I amend the GIRO plan to debit from account B instead of account A?,btohqsg
When I see terry  I stop reading the chat and come back few hrs ltr,btohqsg
Maybe change to a new nick?,btohqsg
Read until point 3  which is wrong: ROUND(1.6*X 0) is the formula. $0.90 will earn base 1 point.,btohqsg
Yes. Just apply for a new GIRO application and it will override the old one. Note that non DBS/UOB/OCBC bank account need to use mail  and no BRE provided.,btohqsg
He can start a new YouTube channel too üòÉ,btohqsg
Point 6 is wrong  not in blocks of 3600 points. It is redeemed in blocks of 3200 points (=$10).,btohqsg
Well I'm just basing off t&c. The rounding is on the points and not on the transaction spent. You need to remove the cents before you multiply by 1.6.The formula on Excel should be =ROUNDUP(FLOOR(x 1) 0).But if you have the card  you can send a screenshot of the 90¬¢ transaction with 1 base point awarded as a data point.See:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/207507?single,btohqsg
Before lowest bus fare became $1.09 I got my points. My expected and awarded points show my formula works perfectly. My experience vs your TnC interpretation,btohqsg
And this one is from Milelion article,btohqsg
Does FAVE fall under shopping for DBS live fresh?,btohqsg
All DBS cards exclude Fave from earning rewards,btohqsg
Nice but it doesn't tally with t&c. =ROUND(167*1.6 0) gives 267 instead of 268 on t&c. Maybe is =ROUNDUP(x*1.6 0) instead?Actual data point:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/207507?single,btohqsg
Anyone have amex highflyer exclusion list ?,btohqsg
Latest update  freedom of speech lolüòÇ,btohqsg
Oh gosh. What is this guy trying to do?,btohqsg
probably will see anh inside too,btohqsg
talking to himself using different phone üòÖ,btohqsg
