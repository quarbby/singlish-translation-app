For HSBC Revo + EGA   am I right to say that you are able to earn 4.5% cashback by :2.5% -  cc eligible spend1%  - EGA reward1% - payment of cc under giro,btohqsg
guys first time i unsure how to pay my hsbc CC,btohqsg
Wait for statement to appear  then pay via AXS app/machine. Balance should clear in 2 to 3 days,btohqsg
do i pay on the final due date? or 2-3 days before,btohqsg
Pay 2-3 days before to be safe,btohqsg
would it be better if i just pay directly using the hsbc app,btohqsg
Suggestion is pay 2 days before due date. If u r paying your bank issued credit card over the issuing bank ibanking using your bank account  u can pay on the day itself.,btohqsg
If I were u  I would setup a post-dated payment so that I don't pay too early or miss the due date 2 days before due or the due day itself depending on the above.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  does anyone know whats the rough monetary value for grab rewards points? And also if its worth redeeming/what should I redeem. Was thinking if I should redeem points now or continue holding on to it  have about 90000 grab rewards points,btohqsg
Not correct. HSBC EGA won't activate 1% to HSBC Credit card payments,btohqsg
500 pts = $1 without promo  check if Grab still has Flash Sale available where you can redeem mall vouchers at 15% off,btohqsg
I tot they mentioned all giro 1% ?,btohqsg

Range from 1.67% to 4% cashback,btohqsg
