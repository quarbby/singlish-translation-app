UOB solitaire. Best if u can split payment,btohqsg
Is there any card besides solitaire ?,btohqsg
You can use general spending cards such as Vantage/Uob prvi,btohqsg
Ah okay so u suggest 2k on UOB solitaire then the remaining 8k on vantage if i dont have the option to spilt payments right,btohqsg
How long it took for all your Giro Arrangements to go through to hsbc?,btohqsg
Technically can. Just don't arrange too far from premium payment date.,btohqsg
3 working weeks from GIRO application date,btohqsg
Can't rmb... 4 to 8 weeks?,btohqsg
Wah they nerf Revolution gaogao and come with stunt bring in this to take over EVOL spot,btohqsg
Suddenly all the Revo nerfs made sense. Revo is just a stepchild of HSBC. Liveplus is the new bae in town.,btohqsg
Revo had its time in the sun... Now time to give way to new card,btohqsg
But no extra 1% cash back for giro credit card payment..,btohqsg
Must fulfill whitelist plus 600 per month for 1 quarter. Like uob one plus hsbc revo combine. Quite a narrow whitelist  prefer maybank fnf more,btohqsg

600 minimum spend per month for 3 months 🤔,btohqsg
It's one of the lower spend req already. Evol  365  live fresh all need 800.,btohqsg
I read is like 500?Charge a minimum of SGD500 in Qualifying Transactions from Card Account Opening Date to the end of the following month.Read through the T&C. They exclude the qualifying spend for cardup and ipaymy.,btohqsg
What is the real cashback rates?,btohqsg
Monthly $450/500 (can't remember now)  paid for 5 years  maturity at 10 years. Projected maturity $61k  get $55 385.,btohqsg
seems to be by whitelist MCC  based on the tnc. This is for the HSBC LIVE+ CC,btohqsg
Tot have some cap earlier. But seem like the limitation is whitelist,btohqsg
"""Those fixed dated maturity plans have a terminal bonus which is based on projection. Dependent on the previous year’s performance  as such this gets affected "" this is OCBC RM reply. I.bought through bank.",btohqsg
cashback cap at 250 per quarter,btohqsg
Ya got 250 cap for cashback  which is 3125 a quarter at 8% or 5k a quarter at 5%. Way above monthly 600 spend.,btohqsg
Whitelist mcc very little and must hit consistently for 3 month,btohqsg
i think its the standard eating and shopping mcc looks decent,btohqsg
So can spent like $600  $600  $2000,btohqsg
Seems decent  here’s my thoughts.Pros:- relatively high 8% cashback (due to +3% promo) for dining/shopping/entertainment  decent 5% for petrol- no cashback cap by category- high cashback cap of $250 by calendar quarter- follows calendar quarter so less confusing (ahem UOB One)- Dining includes bakeries (rare for dining cashback cards which typically only cover 5811  5812  5814)Cons:- shopping MCC not that wide encompassing (e.g. missing 5399 which is a common MCC for e-commence platforms like Qoo10)- need to fulfil min spend of $600 for all 3 months within a quarter (similar to UOB One). Miss any month within the quarter and u’ll only get 0.3% cashback. Exception given for 1st quarter (min spend of $1000 within the quarter instead of monthly min spend).- cashback credited as late as 2 months after end of quarter- may revert back to 5% after 31 Dec 2024,btohqsg
The cashback 2months after quarter is annoying if you want to cancel the card. Need to make sure u get ur cashback first  use it up (take another month) before cancel.,btohqsg
Yup  that’s a risk. Timing can be tricky.,btohqsg
Oh well let see user datapoint after they get the card and use for 1 quarter to see their feedback on the usefulness,btohqsg
5311 is ok. Problem is that ecommerce platform can use a range of mcc,btohqsg
5732 (apple/istudio) is not included. Cannot use to buy iphone 16. 🙃,btohqsg
no not really   shopee and lazada don't think so. But may be hit or miss depending on range of MCC,btohqsg
Ya that why haha  must go brick and mortar,btohqsg
This card has no annual fee right? Can't see anywhere.,btohqsg
but brick and mortar expensive compared to laz and shopeee,btohqsg
Link the card to heymax. Buy and check mcc. if not 5311  cancel 🤣,btohqsg
Annual feeWe'll waive your annual fee for the first year  starting from the issue date for your credit card. From the second year onwards  we'll waive the annual fee for your card if you spend more than SGD12 500 with it per year.,btohqsg
should have  if not why will they say first year fee waiver,btohqsg
How long for the new giro arrangement to be effective? Need to fill up form thus subsequent month? Or can most institutions able to do online? Thks.,btohqsg
"Hey guys for the OCBC 360  do you think the criteria of ""Increasing average daily balance by 500"" is feasible? Just wondering as if your salary is uusally credited to you end of the month  wouldnt it make it quite difficult to achieve that criteria?",btohqsg
deposit 500 to 530 on first day of each month then keep the amount constant,btohqsg
does this mean i need prep transfer out 500 every end of the month to prep for next month i/r?,btohqsg
Crmc direct recurring with giga can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
average balance must increase by 500 each month. excess transfer out. deficit transfer in,btohqsg
isit wise to use it as your main savings bank then? it seems quite troublesome,btohqsg
yea its abit of work to optimise the interest,btohqsg
would you recommend just using uob then? 3% only but much lesser work,btohqsg
