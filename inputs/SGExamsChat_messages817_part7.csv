Yes there are meetings in Japanese company,btohqsg
And want to see results happening,btohqsg
Don't like to idle too much,btohqsg
Either way Japanese companies are progressing in general,btohqsg
Hahaha OT pay.. doesn't rlly happen in SG in my experience,btohqsg
One of our clients are now implementing a no meeting week,btohqsg
If u get OT pay means some shit rlly did occur cuz 1.5 times the rate employers damn stingy one,btohqsg
Usually need to fill in like 2-3 more forms for finance  hr to cover their ass from MOM,btohqsg
That's why I tell you man,btohqsg
Singapore companies really love to cut cost,btohqsg
But lunch is lunch 12-2 u come office macam ghost town,btohqsg
They are good in cutting short term cost but usually that will incur more long term cost,btohqsg
Cuz we really don't get any protections in our employment contracts,btohqsg
So the moment we get to stretch ambiguous shit like lunch out ppl just do it,btohqsg
Is there ever good office culture anywhere?,btohqsg
Yeah. Not going into office daily,btohqsg
I think depends on department bah,btohqsg
I mean the company can be sucky,btohqsg
No it's standard all need to come office daily,btohqsg
But if your manager and the team are good I feel that can be a plus,btohqsg
Most SG companies mandate that lmao,btohqsg
Actually coming office daily is not a deal breaker for me ngl,btohqsg
It's fine if it's more productive,btohqsg
I mean even if its unproductive,btohqsg
I still get paid being unproductive,btohqsg
Tbh I just get bored if that's the case,btohqsg
Well I mean its the company's money,btohqsg
Thing tho there is still the element of direct surveillance in office,btohqsg
At home I can literally turn off,btohqsg
Japan is an open office concept,btohqsg
At unproductive times its the art of looking busy sometimes,btohqsg
So I am very used to the direct surveillance liao,btohqsg
But that shouldn't be a problem for me,btohqsg
Actually what do u do in those times,btohqsg
What's your go to action of busy but not really hitting kpi,btohqsg
My supervisor actually cares more about if I actually deliver what I need to deliver,btohqsg
So sometimes during downtime maybe just do leetcode,btohqsg
Or maybe do some adhoc stuff,btohqsg
Same but still have to look like u doing something either for sanity or just looks,btohqsg
Maybe read what other people are doing and all,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I do for now tbh,btohqsg
Sometimes I even slow down what I am trying to do,btohqsg
If sleepy probably do some stretching,btohqsg
Isn't it like 2am in Japan now,btohqsg
And I have no work tme,btohqsg
Probably gonna catch up on some school work,btohqsg
Me catching up some school work?,btohqsg
Ngl that is probably a bit pointless for me,btohqsg
I probably will catch up if its required for my work,btohqsg
Btw what made you choose to work in Japan instead of Singapore,btohqsg
