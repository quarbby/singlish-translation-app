Valerie ill drop u the location ah,btohqsg
aren't they normally spamming this chat with their brainrot material shit,btohqsg
Rea u coincidentally have the same display name as the whatsapp name i have of you,btohqsg
Btw isnt it cause its my name,btohqsg
Heya  new to this place  where can I ask people to rate my nus application chance lol?,btohqsg
i wonder y she nvr start shittalking on ite,btohqsg
Maybe make a post on r/sgexams reddit,btohqsg
i actually kinda agree with that retarded poly part tho,btohqsg
i rather she shittalk on ite rather then jc poly mi,btohqsg
Also if you are intl student  i think the benchmarks for local and intl student is diff. So maybe can ask admissions counsellor for more specific advices. Good luck,btohqsg
ya thts cuz u r inside  she isnt,btohqsg
but I heard CDE is the dumping ground of NUSâ€¦ right?â€¦ (I hope so),btohqsg
Unpopular opinion but engineering degree is not that useful,btohqsg
ever since i recommended that book you've been just obsessed with it,btohqsg
i dont know what shit you are talking about,btohqsg
Nvm I guess we donâ€™t cancel here? I hope. As long as we are not Josh we should be able to agree to disagree,btohqsg
How did they score with one less player?,btohqsg
Once she leaves idk if her replacement will be as good,btohqsg
Wait which user is josh again,btohqsg
As in we donâ€™t do stuff like deliberately not talk to her if she sends a msg just let it be business as usual,btohqsg
I met josh irl if i remembered correctly so,btohqsg
i swear is it called bunbun,btohqsg
Tbh I also still donâ€™t think in the sg context all schs are good schs. That all schs are good schs tagline is just some euphemism. I still think yi is in a terrible state  and it would continue to be unless sth drastic happens. Like leadership change  more funding  else it would just continue being the jc which accepts students with the worst results. And itâ€™s possible for a low tier JC to improve  just look at srjc  and ny improved from being a mid tier Jc in the 2000s to a top one.,btohqsg
All schs are good schs on paper only so,btohqsg
As long as he doesnâ€™t surprise come here during April fools I guess weâ€™re good,btohqsg
thing is criticism is fine  but not what wtv that was,btohqsg
I can try to find that msg where matcha summarised the shit that happened,btohqsg
Wait is the disc and tele run by diff ppl,btohqsg
Seems like 2 different factions  those who get pissed off here go to discord to rant,btohqsg
Ngl i only found out the existence of sgexams from dekita ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t expect that there would be so much drama in the SGE comm when I rejoined this chat lol,btohqsg
But I guess with how boring my NS life is got to preoccupy myself with sth,btohqsg
I joined then left then joined then left then joined again,btohqsg
i mean is ran by the same ppl,btohqsg
wait so dekita is js owner and doesn't do anything and everything is done by adminsÂ¿,btohqsg
But the ppl inside arenâ€™t rly the same,btohqsg
No comments idk what's going on,btohqsg
If its abt their topic then,btohqsg
ig 5k is decent enough for fresh grad,btohqsg
high by ite and maybe poly standards,btohqsg
but by uni standards its decent ig,btohqsg
but finance bros make crazy amts in intern if they super good,btohqsg
It also rly depends on the course and uni,btohqsg
Some courses can have 5-6k as normal starting pay,btohqsg
I think nus BBA starting pay is quite high  unlike ntu bba,btohqsg
Then again those are self reported isnt it,btohqsg
But after rereading again I also donâ€™t get why Josh wasnâ€™t punished by the admin on discord for saying that expletive,btohqsg
As in the juicecogens can suck thing,btohqsg
Huh I thought heâ€™s still sending messages on discord,btohqsg
