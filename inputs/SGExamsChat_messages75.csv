U sound very knowledgeable about phone,btohqsg
Yea because you pay with providing the CCP your data,btohqsg
Where's da evidence to back up ur theory haha,btohqsg
How many thousands of dollars is a budget iphone,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt disagree with this  I feel like it applies in general to Apple Products  especially recently  they don‚Äôt innovate anymore  but I feel like the SE line truly has some usability considerations.,btohqsg
I mean u think about it. They sell a wireless earpeice for 200dollar. I'm sure there are many other alternative or wireless earpeice that cost much less,btohqsg
Go for a company that makes money off hardware  not your information,btohqsg
In fact I bought the TWS i12s  only 5 dollar  but as good as a airpod,btohqsg
You might want to re-read this,btohqsg
I bought Jabra Elite 75T for cheaper and better quality,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt deny that to a certain extent you pay for the brand name  I also don‚Äôt deny that Apple‚Äôs innovation has plateaued.But you can‚Äôt deny that there are *certain* Apple Products that are very durable. You also can‚Äôt deny that Apple is still leading innovation despite it having disappointingly plateaued.You brought up the example of AirPods. I personally don‚Äôt use AirPods  but based on what I heard  I wouldn‚Äôt stand behind the actual quality of AirPods  AirPods may truly be those products that you pay for the name.Then you highlighted the cheaper alternatives to AirPods. This may prove that Apple is charging for the brand name  but think about it. Do you see AirPod alternatives in the market before AirPods became a thing? No. Bluetooth Earpieces existed but they don‚Äôt look like AirPods. Where are the traditional Bluetooth earpieces now? They seem to have mostly adopted the AirPods design. This shows that Apple is still leading innovation in the market.Though  I‚Äôll be the first to say  removing the headphone jack is not an innovation.,btohqsg
Totally agree   what subjects do u take,btohqsg
U will do very well on lit  not kidding,btohqsg
haha this guy will do well in ell and gp*,btohqsg
He will do well in everything la,btohqsg
Is doctor writing an essay for rebuttal too,btohqsg
yup mad effort for an essay on Apple products,btohqsg
I kind of agree on most of the things there except the way others design their earpieces like Airpods.I have a feeling just like Apple's bathtub notch  they follow it to make it look as premium as an Apple product  when it's not really feasible in everyday product usability,btohqsg
He‚Äôs been arguing his whole life,btohqsg
He will win trophy's there too,btohqsg
Yea  I saw so many people when they walk  the airpods drop,btohqsg
That will be my forever regret.,btohqsg
erm lol I wasn‚Äôt even competing in WSDC,btohqsg
I use these instead of Airpods  and their design is better for intense activities like running  gym (and even swimming if you buy the sports version). In terms of the earpiece department  Apple charges way more for way less,btohqsg
Even if they say it's water resistant I wouldn't trust and swim with it,btohqsg
Just shy of a recruit's pay,btohqsg
But water damage is covered by warranty soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I love the sport  I hate the nature of the circuit.,btohqsg
They hold far too little charge to electrocute a person hahaha,btohqsg
Got one guy slept beside his phone while it's charging with power bank,btohqsg
Than he died due to electrocution,btohqsg
This sounds like those anti-electronics chain messages old people always send,btohqsg
Define tutors and define in here,btohqsg
U forgot to block him on discord,btohqsg
managed to borrow phone dron my dad,btohqsg
Y do u think i listen to such songs,btohqsg
At least idk a way to do that,btohqsg
is that a google key board?,btohqsg
no idea my spoiled phone is an a8 2016 this one is an s8,btohqsg
the user interface is totally different I not used,btohqsg
on google key board thats in the floating option  than u can unfloat it,btohqsg
hey guys  what a word for a period of time that must be achieved,btohqsg
like if I register for tuition then I must commit to it for a certain period of time,btohqsg
ü§î I don't really get the question,btohqsg
D U M P L I N G,btohqsg
what's the period of time called,btohqsg
nono is like a commitment period,btohqsg
like if u register for tuition  then must continue for a period of time if not forfeit the deposit,btohqsg
Kueh  if you getting bullied  blink twice,btohqsg
Deposit will be used to offset the fees for the last month of the year  which is around october this year,btohqsg
Hard to say without context lol,btohqsg
Can't wait for my finals to be over,btohqsg
does this mean the deposit will be forfeited,btohqsg
Thing is don't know how they calculate the fee cycle also,btohqsg
Last time I attend tuition no deposit one,btohqsg
Teach 1 month pay 1 month,btohqsg
It means Deposit fee = October fees in advance but not necessarily the entire Oct fee,btohqsg
did someone just add me to some education collaboration grp or smth,btohqsg
Someone has been scraping this group for members,btohqsg
Nothing we can do about it except to remind you to change your privacy settings,btohqsg
welp seems like im the valued member they need huh üòè,btohqsg
I think this grp is even more useful by 5 million times more,btohqsg
No where near useful for us,btohqsg
However the efficincy is only a million times more coz jay tan is here,btohqsg
But anything multiplied by 0 is still 0,btohqsg
1k ppl inside but literally dead chat,btohqsg
That's because all those people he added are those inactive users,btohqsg
There is no students in that group,btohqsg
Why are you even talking about it here,btohqsg
You‚Äôre not fooling anyone  let‚Äôs just say,btohqsg

their welfare package isn't enough to actually give people the option of staying at home instead of working,btohqsg
But then infection rates will rise,btohqsg
ya but that's the trade off they made,btohqsg
for some states they don't have enough resources to provide for all the people on umemployment/can't work because of coronavirus,btohqsg

It‚Äôs not that they are incompetent,btohqsg
"Oh look using ""suicide"" as an excuse. Jfc  don't use that shit as a form of showing how horrible your situation is",btohqsg

I advice you to take a step back to plan  not relax if you really can‚Äôt relax.,btohqsg
And I can tell because I know them,btohqsg
Why? Don‚Äôt they have a stake in this project too?,btohqsg
