Where is the best place to park money got around 200k ? Any good promo for April?,btohqsg
depends you want FD or flexible. if FD and if you have 250K can consider Citibank 4%  if you want flexible can consider HSBC EGA,btohqsg
EGA I park 100k last month,btohqsg
If I top up do I need to sms to reparticipate ?,btohqsg
EGA is 4 month cycle  you can park for 4 months straight or alternate with another account like OCBC 360,btohqsg
just need sms at the start of the 4 month cycle,btohqsg
This month promo different from last month though,btohqsg
I believe is 4.55% or something,btohqsg
yes almost every month has 1 but lesser interest compared to last month,btohqsg
So just top up in will do? They will calculate daily interest credit interest monthly?,btohqsg
You didn't check with the banker there,btohqsg
once you enrolled in EGA  just keep there for the 4 month cycle  and do 2K and FAST out x 5 every 2 months will do,btohqsg
Oh online didn't show how much,btohqsg
last month EGA personal should be around this  normally will suggest download the TnC for the cycle you in to be safe,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Atome 3 parts payment is eligible for cashback on evol?,btohqsg
