Hi all I‚Äôm pretty new to the CC rewards scene. Done my due diligence but appreciate some kind input from the veterans in this telegram space.For larger payments  eg insurance  taxes  OCCASIONAL flight tickets  household items / electronics   ie 1-2k and above.1. What are your recommendations? Either as singular card or combo. Open to both miles or cashback  although I personally have not played the miles game before.2. I have came across UOB Absolute cshbk many times and I am aware of the GPMC and UOB nerf  wondering is it still worthy  at 1.7%Any advice is much appreciated  thanks!,btohqsg
Using liquid pay with uob evo entitled to 6.6 percent cash back ?,btohqsg
Agree with dbswwc for ur circumstance,btohqsg
The UOB One Debit Card offers the highest interest rates on the market. These interest rates vary depending on the amount of money that is deposited into the bank account associated with the debit card. It requires you also to credit your salary or make three GIRO debit transactions. In order to achieve the highest interest rate  an individual must maintain an account balance between S$60 001 and S$75 000. It is important to note that even with the lowest minimum balance  cardholders still earn more annual interest with this card than with other debit cards on the market.,btohqsg
So as long as you do any of the 2  you‚Äôll get the highest interest rate?,btohqsg
No  highest interest rate is with the condition of salary crediting.,btohqsg
if I‚Äôm self employed  what is a recommended card to use?,btohqsg
Credit card bills accept grab pay card?,btohqsg
Nope it doesnt  i went on to google and found that it doesnt accept haha,btohqsg
Imagine paying credit card bills with credit card,btohqsg
think most banks would try to stop that haha,btohqsg
Is physical kopitiam card still valid  or has it gone fully digital with the fairprice app?,btohqsg
I used it yesterday. It's working fine.,btohqsg
do i need to top up liquid pay with citi rewards to use it or just scan?,btohqsg
Just add your citi card  scan store qr code and select the card to use it,btohqsg
can if the merchant agrees. u making 1 big transaction in whole month?,btohqsg
Combo is the way to go. Better to get more than 1 card.Electronics: Mostly OCBC Titanium Rewards Card (in store or online) or Citi SMRT card (only if bought online)Flight tickets: DBS Altitude (if bought online)Insurance and taxes: Citi PayAll if applicable  UOB Absolute if Amex is accepted,btohqsg
Maybe u can share what is your spending style first.,btohqsg
Need some verification  when I use ShopBack  liquidpay and FairPrice app to do payment. Do I need to link my CRMC to amaze first then use amaze to pay? Or I can just link my CRMC to those app.In order to earn those miles.,btohqsg
link your card to the app,btohqsg
No need. You will still get your 4mpd linking CRMC directly as purchases count as online,btohqsg
can both link or not link to Amaze,btohqsg
btw if l using kris+ on android phone need to use Amaze+crmc on googlepay linked to kris+,btohqsg
If it is really occasional big spend can take Amex kf card since the sign up miles is not bad.,btohqsg
To add on a little bit more context.I‚Äôm using DBS live fresh for everything else : food  groceries  public transport  small ticket items and retail purchases. Considering to change this to OCBC 360 to combo with my existing OCBC savings account.But havent quite found the solution to big ticket items as posted in the earlier message : insurance  taxes  occasional flight tickets  big ticket items like electronics  furniture. Thanks guys so far for all your suggestions üòÅ,btohqsg
For travel related maybe can consider HSBC Revolution card  4mpd,btohqsg
