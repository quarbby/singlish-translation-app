I know  so if you pass ot fail as PES F there isn't a difference as well,btohqsg
Some people have conditions that aren't dangerous to others  but get PES F. Military and civilian life is vastly different,btohqsg
Oh i never know this chain existsOnly heard of popeye chicken,btohqsg
I don't buy it. I know many people that have PES F.,btohqsg
How about taking time to build up on ur confidence n preparation?,btohqsg
I'm not threatened by them. They don't harm themselves,btohqsg
When u cannot move forward  take a step back first and recharge ?,btohqsg
Yes  but people may not be able to hold a rifle but can work and be successful in other ways,btohqsg
How do they decide the grade for pw?,btohqsg
Okay... But there are other conditions that people are just born different but they aren't harming themselves or others,btohqsg
Okay  danger to themselves. People can be blind  deaf  born with a mental or neurological conditions. I don't consider that a danger to anyone  including themselves,btohqsg
they see what sch u from,btohqsg
then set a percentage based on how good ur sch is perceived to be,btohqsg
those lower end sch be like,btohqsg
Huh? How on earth did that happen? It is in a different year from the 4As getting 250 right?,btohqsg
like do u think yjc pw is rly that bad,btohqsg
So if I fire a gun  I might faint. As long as I avoid firearms  that isn't a danger to myself.You are just adding conditions to make it work.,btohqsg
never heard of this happen but,btohqsg
I got ABBD and got 194,btohqsg
It really happen to one of my good friend,btohqsg
Cos A* is 91 and abovr,btohqsg
U seem to be in a more competitive year haha,btohqsg
If I get 70 for all 4 subject,btohqsg
My T score will be 210,btohqsg
I only same class as them in P3,btohqsg
It usually does not happen. They will always say such things to make themselves feel better only,btohqsg
And they tuition all the way to P6,btohqsg
That is the worst answer you could give. Conclude that I'm trolling when you can't even properly respond to me. What a joke,btohqsg
Ya i have finished my pw üòÇ just asking,btohqsg
I'm not sure but it certainly seems that way,btohqsg
it's no coincidence that the distinction rate for pw correlates almost perfectly with the cut off point of JCs,btohqsg
I think their parent tiger mom,btohqsg
Whatever. If you really want to  you could analyse them one by one.,btohqsg
Haha means 1 jc is an anomaly,btohqsg
Yeah the PW system is the most unfair system ever,btohqsg
I've seen some really stellar stuff from serangoon jc,btohqsg
not to say serangoon is good and dunman is bad,btohqsg
but there seems to be quite a bias,btohqsg
It's designed to keep the elite elite,btohqsg
I would agree with this honestly,btohqsg
Tbh the reason that jc does well,btohqsg
Is that more JJC style or PJC style? With the merger which school does the new JPJC follow more closely?,btohqsg
Just curious how the whole merger thing played out,btohqsg
1.25 rank points wouldn‚Äôt be that huge a difference imo,btohqsg
Yes that‚Äôs right  now give me your undeserved 1.25 RP,btohqsg
JJ PW is worlds apart from PJ,btohqsg
Advice for PSLE ^^ tbh I scored the worst in my class since p6 cause I came from overseas and I no idea what was going on  but I still got 2nd in the level,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs possible to score much higher in a few months,btohqsg
üõç Scientists at Nanyang Technological University have found that single-use plastic bags are more eco-friendly than cotton and paper single-use bags when used for only one time.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3lHXz3p,btohqsg
Do u need research for this ...,btohqsg
