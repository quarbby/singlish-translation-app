It is up to the tutee to make use of it,btohqsg
Wow u can do tat. Haha,btohqsg
Go NUS ask those that have potential to excel ah,btohqsg
If the tutee doesn‚Äôt care then no amount of tuition helps,btohqsg
Then tutor laughing all the way to bank,btohqsg
More reasons why tuition should be banned,btohqsg
More reasons why tuition is a predatory industry and should be banned,btohqsg
thats like saying why all ACS students should be executed,btohqsg
Nooo I actually need to be tutored  have mercy,btohqsg
y?  They so cute and innocent,btohqsg
Why do you need tuition?Answer: Teachers in school not good enough/not enough Teachers,btohqsg

i had a friend who did that,btohqsg
Just spend time then get salary,btohqsg
Nono I‚Äôm just not good with school schedules cuz I‚Äôm not good at having attention:P,btohqsg
And you think a tutor would be able to do better than a teacher in this case,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the second scenario: not enough teachers,btohqsg
Yes that‚Äôs the first scenario: Teachers not good enough,btohqsg
im a good tutor but sadly different course,btohqsg
thats basically every other industry also,btohqsg
i pity my current student in sch who has a chem tutor who milks his tys as practice,btohqsg
Means the tutor uses TYS questions to help the tutee practice,btohqsg
basically he/she utilises his TYS as practice for every single lesson,btohqsg
when thats supposed to be for sch use,btohqsg
Why not hire good tuition teachers and give them higher pay,btohqsg

It is rather difficult to match pay in the private sector,btohqsg
Mhmm but if they can guarantee much better results,btohqsg
Create a telegram group  6 speakers each take turn to write an essay,btohqsg
Honestly I think you pay for the ratio more,btohqsg
Like my school for one of my subjects I had a ratio of 1 : 6,btohqsg
I doubt the tutors are any much better than MOE teachers in terms of quality,btohqsg
