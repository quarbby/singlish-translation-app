To add: 4.55% p.a. (with 1% bonus interest) will be higher than UOB One account 4% (top tier) in May 2024,btohqsg
Depends on whether you are comfortable with money market funds,btohqsg

Buy trade = 1 US stock or ETF or US options buy trade within 30 calendar dayshttps://www.webull.com.sg/ko-yield/1711623783312-08dbeb,btohqsg
HSBC revo still good for several categories  depends what you usually spend on. Can always use both  they‚Äôre not mutually exclusive,btohqsg
Fair enough. Don't really travel much so its not too helpful. But can't confidently use it for dining anymore,btohqsg

Someone from milelion group was informed by CSO that 1% rebate on HSBC CC will be removed on 2 May. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
The hsbc rev 1% rebate?Or the hsbc giro pay bill 1% cashback?,btohqsg
According to him it‚Äôs 1% revolution rebate  not giro,btohqsg
From 02 May  spending with HSBC credit cards will no longer be eligible for the 1% cashback.Also  GIRO payments to any financial institution and trading platforms  relating to crypto-currencies  stock exchange and trades  will be excluded for GIRO bill payments.,btohqsg
As long not giro bill cashback haha,btohqsg
SCB Bonus$aver nerfed wef 1 May 2024. 4.13% / 4.88% dropped to 2.88% / 3.68%.https://www.sc.com/sg/important-information/deposit-interest-rate-revision/,btohqsg
The banks have working group to coordinate this ah,btohqsg
No lah usually changes are announced on the first of each month what,btohqsg
Cannot find this on their website yet :(,btohqsg
HSBC CSO replied regarding the changes in TnC from 2-May-2024. The change was announced in HSBC website  but there were no details,btohqsg
Anyone in moomoo sgd cash fund didn't receive any returns today? Or is it just me..,btohqsg
OCBC 360 account nerf most likely to start in Jun. They have an ongoing account opening promotion to 2x salary and spend bonus and specifically put 2% and 0.6% additional on t&c. It'll only end 31 May.,btohqsg
take it as a sign to put more in ssb this and next month I guess,btohqsg
Mine didn't. Not sure if it's cos my 60 days ended yesterday.,btohqsg
Even when you go into ‚Äúrevenue details‚Äù  there‚Äôs no entry for today? Sometimes the midday notification doesn‚Äôt come through but the return is there for the day,btohqsg
Hi any good strategies for saving acct because mostly of the bank are nerfing the interest rate,btohqsg
Yup nothing at all. First time like that.,btohqsg
Wait for all the nerfs then re-evaluate.,btohqsg
So do I try to put 150 into uob1 first.?,btohqsg
Make use of EGA CNY promo before it ends next month,btohqsg
If i withdraw from Ega  wait a day before i deposit the funds back into Ega  does that count as Fresh funds?,btohqsg
Yes and no... Yes because it is fresh funds  but no because your ADB actually doesn't drop (significantly),btohqsg
I think they will wait a while and capture some customers who move out of UOB One first before nerf.,btohqsg
I'm confused... I thought the LNY promo was for March and April?,btohqsg
The file name same  the file content different.,btohqsg
credit card payment will be excluded?,btohqsg
No but like if I participate in the LNY promo  I still can get the interest rate for that promo for April right? Otherwise I will move to esaver,btohqsg
I hope not. utilising a lot of that right now.,btohqsg
depends on when you send the registration SMS.,btohqsg
check your confirmation sms reply from HSBC,btohqsg
Hoping not too  but if it happens I'm terminating my HSBC Advance and moving to DCS ultimate,btohqsg
hi all  do i really need 120k to get UOB lady solitaire CC?,btohqsg
credit card payment for HSBC advance all along no 1% I thought?,btohqsg
YMMV  UOB has been varying in its strictness,btohqsg
