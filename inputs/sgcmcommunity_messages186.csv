Hi guys Im going to test drive at a couple of dealerships next week. Im going with my cousin as this is my first time looking at cars irl. Can anyone share any insights on what wil happen,btohqsg
They will pressure you and say better sign up now because next bid sure go up. Better take some time and think through probably and not buy a particular car because of extra 1-2k voucher.,btohqsg
I see. How long will the test drive be,btohqsg
you dont have to worry about this. you will be strictly guided on the test drive just ask them,btohqsg
please spend your time thinking about things that actually matter like how much you are willing to spend  what you want exactly in a car. so you dont get duped into a sale you didnt actually want,btohqsg
That pretty much sums up what's gonna happen lol,btohqsg
Yah  and remember they dun put such breakdown that you need to pay one:1. Down-payment2. Insurance3. Road tax4. 1st instalment5. Licence plate (I think $100?),btohqsg
So you really gotta do the maths  if need to squeeze  then go for other brand or model,btohqsg
I think it depends on whether the showroom is crowded,btohqsg
Hahahaha won't buy used one given the hype 😂,btohqsg
Insurance make sure free towing  loss of use/replacement car. I kena scam by my dealer  never fight for these stuff for me so quite sian when accident,btohqsg
This one can just join AAS,btohqsg
Have fun! 😂 dun sign immediately,btohqsg

Suzuki swift 1.2L DUALJET engine ? Good ? Haha cheaper of all new cars.,btohqsg
but after i drive mk7  i have to say no fight la,btohqsg
i own suzuki sport for 1 yr btw,btohqsg
i do not know other cars  mk7 vs suzuki sport  has to be mk7,btohqsg
Swift sport got a relatively big motorsport following in sg,btohqsg
A lot of people use it to track,btohqsg
Looks fun to drive on track but... I think not for big sized drivers,btohqsg
I drive the Suzuki Swift 1.2 Mild Hybrid; it's decently light and quick due to the weight  but it's quite underpowered. Not so great in hard acceleration  but it's smooth drive makes it quite good for Singapore roads. Can even go on Norrh-Sourh Highway  but stick to Lane 2 and Cruise Control at 110km/h. Can't compete with some of the faster driversIt's pretty cheap to maintain: fuel consumption is about 18l/km  road tax is $500 a year. Does a good job in ferrying my family (myself  wife  2 small kids) for family outings. Not very spacious,btohqsg
Serves its A to B purpose,btohqsg
I perfer my civic at 2xxkm/h on the nshw,btohqsg
Fuel consumption is alr out of the mind when we decided to mod n tune,btohqsg
Undertakers also prefer cars doing 2xxkmh on mshw,btohqsg
Wud like to just say balance both,btohqsg
If WS offer front wheel balancing only  is it sufficient?,btohqsg
Good job sir . I like also :),btohqsg
?? who the in the right mind wont do all 4,btohqsg
probably WS want customers to topup,btohqsg
The WS quite good rep one. I also surprised when I was quoted,btohqsg

Hi I am new and noob on car. Got a curious question with recent huge drop coe why the car drop little example coe drop 20k but car with it drop 10k. Duno what I missing,btohqsg
because VES rebate decreased and some cars got bumped up a VES banding,btohqsg
I told mg sales guy coe didn't drop 20k 😂 he stunned and ask why I said that,btohqsg
I said coe drop 20k  but ves cut 5k liao and gst up 1% liao 😂,btohqsg
Anyway dealers also scared cut too much then next coe up too much,btohqsg
Agreed cause if they cut too much and up again they expose their bottom,btohqsg
Bottom good for business for some too,btohqsg
The Dec one the sales guy said many kena the coe and collected car...if their rebate is set at 75k lol. Every car they compensate 10k,btohqsg

I private car want to convert to PHV,btohqsg
Then i phv want to convert,btohqsg
Or peg to prevailing respective Cat,btohqsg
Not surprised if phv come under taxi and pte owners cannot register their car as phv...my speculation going by what cht says,btohqsg
I think will be a seperate quota,btohqsg
U can reg 1000 PHV. But will not eat into current COE supply,btohqsg
But u pay the COE for tht bidding,btohqsg
So the COE still stick to car regardless,btohqsg
Give up the coe lolz but subject to criteria but anyway taxis also used as personal transport like my uncle lolz,btohqsg
Or replace taxi lol or combined as a group e.g. Public transport vehicle  I.e. no more phv scheme,btohqsg
This one u will see big cut in phv drivers,btohqsg
All the part time drivers using own cars all rush to convert back normal scheme,btohqsg

Where the article? I can't find it when googling,btohqsg
need to improve your googling skills 😆,btohqsg
? All of us are affected by COE,btohqsg
"""As at November 2023  the total number of PHVs hit 79 921  far exceeding the total number of 13 622 taxis.""",btohqsg
Wa I didn't know got so many,btohqsg
u stand on the street for like 10 minutes,btohqsg
if 10 cars drive past  maybe 3 to 4 is PHV,btohqsg
every logistic  supplier  delivery  businesses  manufacturing uses Vehicles to transport shit  so yes coe affects everyone. regardless of whether u have a car or not,btohqsg
eg parking fees also affect the non-car driver.,btohqsg
I see the article like hinting at the possibility of allowing phv to do street hailing . He don't deny the newspaper question if next time phv can do ride hailing or not,btohqsg
moving forward  i think its a good move,btohqsg
so prolly the application itself need to be able to set the route and location,btohqsg
Yeah  let's see how it will end up. Most likely the review will be released near election,btohqsg

Time to score brownie points. If vote for them then change 🫣,btohqsg
I think having company PHV on a separate category and reducing private owner PHV loan quantum to the same as regular cars is sufficient to solve the problem,btohqsg

can play with the online insurance quote filters like fwd  directasia etc then u will know,btohqsg
bruh why the premium so ex for a evo 10,btohqsg
Then the selections all choose the cheapest. Indicate u have 10 years driving  40 yo  married  etc,btohqsg
huh but im neither of that though,btohqsg
Sports car. All sports car fetch a higher premium,btohqsg
It’s ok just choose cheapest selections n buy first,btohqsg
2 door  sports car  soft/hard top cab... Instant up premium,btohqsg
wouldn’t they verify in the event that i actually want to buy it?,btohqsg
so 8-15k is what i should be expecting ah,btohqsg

Then u can nego with them,btohqsg
Then report u to police for cheating,btohqsg
If u have the money and dont mind throwing into a car then pay lor,btohqsg
Correct me if I’m wrong  but it’s possible to buy under ur parents name (provided they hv valid driving license) and put u as named driver to  build up ur own NCD and have a lower insurance premium. My info might be outdated so put as disclaimer first,btohqsg
then add named driver to lower excess,btohqsg
having said that  shud anything happen to the car  they need come down sign paper one,btohqsg
so its really up to you,btohqsg

oh YES LIVE A LITTLE THAT'S RIGHT,btohqsg
in here for a good time! not a long time,btohqsg
whats the difference between 1.5 and 1.6,btohqsg
Other than road tax pricing  are u comparing 1.5 NA and 1.6NA? Turbocharged? Narrow ur variables for comparison. It’s too vague a qs,btohqsg
Lets say a 1.5 vios vs a 1.6 Civic (2018+),btohqsg
arent the specs almost the same?,btohqsg
R u the one last time talk very long abt buy car but never buy?,btohqsg
yeah but not really in a rush to buy car,btohqsg

thanks for the list bro haha,btohqsg

Can take a look at Golf 1.0 actually. Low road tax. Turbo charged. Zippy and torquey car. Maintenance pretty straightforward.Don’t be scared off by VW cars.,btohqsg
Ahh I see. Any idea if I have to renew with same insurer to maintain NCD?,btohqsg
Don’t need. NCD is transferrable btwn insurers. Bt usually ur insurer will give u a renewal discount to keep u with them.,btohqsg
Bt of cuz  do ur due diligence to check thru the terms before renewing. Don’t be blinded by the price alone.,btohqsg
Ya. Comprehensive insurance also more costly,btohqsg
Will have to assess to see if there’s really a need for it,btohqsg

Aiyo  some people wife drive better than some men out there la. Is the driver not the gender,btohqsg

See if you can use a parent as the primary driver,btohqsg
Then hop in as named driver under them,btohqsg
Speak to an insurance agent not the online sources,btohqsg
The websites always over quote for such cases and the more expensive or exotic cars,btohqsg
Some don't even offer quotes  eg. Many of these like ntuc  fwd  budget direct don't insure Porsches and don't provide quotes for them  even if it's the brand's SUV,btohqsg

Hihi  is alignment necessary to add on during minor servicing?,btohqsg
I only do standard rotation + balancing,btohqsg
only need do alignment if you see very uneven tyre wear/you hit a pothole or kerb,btohqsg
one way to know for sure is if your steering wheel does not return to straight or the car doesn't stay straight after you let go of steering wheel,btohqsg
but still a good idea to do alignment once every 1-2 years,btohqsg
My heart sinks each time it goes over a pothole or those manhole which are sunken,btohqsg
i drive slow this past few weeks especially in residential area where keep have road works,btohqsg

even the GLA feels abit bigger,btohqsg
The GL series is for people who wanna drive merc but don’t have the budget. I really don’t understand why they sell  they’re crap cars. Buy C series better,btohqsg
Let your tail come out.Feel the weight balanceCounter Steer,btohqsg
See the price of the GLC,btohqsg
Sorry noob question.. these prices are Coe inclusive right?,btohqsg
if without COE they will mark one,btohqsg

Only wide enough for one car,btohqsg
anyone knows wat is the website where u can search the car numb plate up and see the reliability test  accident and all and specs,btohqsg
we need a full series covering this,btohqsg
i vote for Lido car park. Not the worst but complete garbage. it is literally impossible to park 3 cars side by side with anything larger than a mini (while still being able to get out of your car). plus the layout of the carpark is confusing trash,btohqsg
the old golden mile car park was horrendous too. the kerbs and pillars are full of damage from clipping cars. Some of the kerbs looks like the leftovers of an artillery attack with entire chunks missing LOL,btohqsg

Can I check what is the interest rate for bank loan for car few years ago…?I see online now is about 2.9% ish. My friend told me she bought hers with loan at 2.3% when COE was 35k. Just wondering what’s the market rate for bank interest rate pls,btohqsg
When COE was 35k in 2019 bank interest was low,btohqsg
Last 2 years fed interest hikes that's why loan interest increased,btohqsg
Which Cat COE? New or used car? Bank or in-house loan that she got?,btohqsg
Cat A used car.. bank loan..,btohqsg
Yes that why I feel weird cuz the diff not veri big,btohqsg

I was chatting  happily with the car sales man.,btohqsg
The moment I mention   I do not want to take loan   the sales man seem to be not happy sia .,btohqsg
Keep asking me to take loan for 10%,btohqsg
Also ask me if I want to trade in my car instead,btohqsg
Then the so call promotion free gifts also no more 😅😅,btohqsg
Loan I feel should only go with the external financiers. In-house loans usually many T&Cs and not as transparent,btohqsg
They have a list of financial like DBS   UOB   HL to choose from.,btohqsg
But car comms still have some,btohqsg
Why earn one comms when u can earn 2 comms,btohqsg
But I do not want to take loans,btohqsg
Find one salesman who dont want comms lor,btohqsg
My friend bought 2 cars for himself and wife . Also full payment,btohqsg
U shout at the booth say full payment,btohqsg
If your investments returns can cover the interest rate  why pay in full?,btohqsg
See which sales person entertain u,btohqsg
Can change car anytime   take car loans   got to pay the penalty .,btohqsg
I have 2 cars for trade in   but need to bring wife along . She the finance minister in the house,btohqsg
If on set u say no loan  they will adjust price to max without discount to make up for the lost in comms,btohqsg
If they calculate for u based on 60/40  then u say full payment  they cannot increase the price,btohqsg
My friend says must see the short fall . Then decide whether to continue to proceed . I learn something today from a friend .,btohqsg
From the start   just talk as per  the sales of the vehicle . Then later on inform no loan . Then see the gap   from there negotiate the deal to get the best deal .,btohqsg
Or u just tell them cut their crap,btohqsg
Dont need loan no loan price😂😂,btohqsg
Dk why buy one car so mafan,btohqsg
My friend says buying without loan also must get some decent discount . Cost saving .,btohqsg
I mean u pay lesser interest amount shud u do full,btohqsg
Some dealers just say no loan penalty 2 or 3k?,btohqsg
2 to 3 k loan   let say 3k . Monthly for 7 yrs only $36,btohqsg
I think an insult to the financial companies,btohqsg
Maybe the paper cost more than the 3k,btohqsg
Is normal  some AD also quote us the price with the assumption that we taking their in-house loan and insurance,btohqsg
Then when you say you will find your own insurance and won't take loan  they will mark up the price,btohqsg
do you know how much they will mark up?,btohqsg
always see promo price alot of T&C's at AD,btohqsg
But it all depends on. If the sales man is far from his quota   and it is a confirmed deal . He may want to secure it,btohqsg
Some will indicate in their brochure. They always quote us the lowest price but if we don't follow all the prerequisite  will have the rebates removed,btohqsg
You can get 2.28% currently from hyundai. Eir around 4.5%,btohqsg
