I have 1 that cost 1.6k,btohqsg
1 more broken one my other guitarist donated to me  i lazy send go restore,btohqsg
but once restored shud be worth maybe 1.5k?,btohqsg
It's a vintage made in korea epiphone,btohqsg
500 to 600 can get a very nice guitar,btohqsg
just stay away from anything 200 to 300,btohqsg
yeah am looking at at least close to 1k,btohqsg
dam more ex than my phone,btohqsg
then after that i just nvr look alr when got time and money then i look againHAHA,btohqsg
They are more like to scam parents that sent their kids to study in yamaha,btohqsg
you dont see musicians actually rocking yamahas,btohqsg
i dont intend on going for classes anyways they just a brand ik so i go look there loh,btohqsg
Some guitar brands have their premium brand and cheap brand,btohqsg
Fender: 2k onwards Squier by Fender: 800 onwardsGibson: 3k onwardsEpiphone by Gibson: 800 onwards,btohqsg
But i generally also stay away from those unless you're loaded.,btohqsg
For very value for money  there'sSchecter USA,btohqsg
ESP also very good  but they are quite ex  Their cheaper brand is ESP LTD,btohqsg
600ish can find a nice one,btohqsg
Ibanez also good  but their cheap units are quite trash.,btohqsg
I will recommend ESP and Schecter,btohqsg
bought and sold a few alr,btohqsg
Just dont look at ESP japan  the prices on those are insane.,btohqsg
bruh is it all in the us?,btohqsg
When you free  can just go Peninsula walk walk,btohqsg
o they sell left and right handed dam i didnt know that,btohqsg
Yaa ken block died in an accident,btohqsg
his daughter can carry his legacy ig,btohqsg

its a sign 2023 aint gonna be any better,btohqsg
car culture now a days getting more n more bad rep,btohqsg
the electric car movement aint helping also,btohqsg
hopefully hydrogen or artifical fuel becomes a thing,btohqsg
cause tbh eletric car nto sustainable,btohqsg
yeah i heard they giving rotary one last try,btohqsg
You have to find specifically got headphone jack one. Have to ask the salesperson.,btohqsg

It will happen  but in the form of hybrid,btohqsg

but the new civic  ic is like half aggressive half not,btohqsg
mine is the fk2 or fk8,btohqsg
but i heard alotta fake vents,btohqsg
I like the way it looks  but i hate the whole BMW bullshittery,btohqsg
I'm talking about the BMW internals of the supra,btohqsg
dont know how reliable they are  prices of spare parts etc,btohqsg
tbh what u expect now companies like owned ontop of companies,btohqsg
in thr end u basically buyiny from the saw person,btohqsg
or rather toyota owns other people,btohqsg
for your application shud be enough,btohqsg
since you dont want it loud,btohqsg
bigger watt is bigger and louder,btohqsg
so am looking at ard 800 total,btohqsg
i dont need anything else rgihit?\,btohqsg
i mean usual cables  picks and straps,btohqsg
those you buy just ask them give you free,btohqsg
They should normally just give you free,btohqsg
o i thought they came with HAHA,btohqsg
they nv say  you must ask,btohqsg
so i ask if they can give for free ah,btohqsg
but even give also the very cheap ones,btohqsg
you can push your luck and ask for tuner also,btohqsg
if not you have to buy,btohqsg
or just use phone apps to tune  but i hate them due to ads and inaccuracy,btohqsg
bruh i thought tuning is by listening one,btohqsg
online looks ok tho like 5 6 oni,btohqsg
Otherwise better to use a tuner,btohqsg
got cheap ones and ex ones,btohqsg
It'll be a pain in the ass,btohqsg
how often u gotta tune tho,btohqsg
cause ik can go out of tune one,btohqsg
When the guitar sounds out of tune,btohqsg
some guitars hold the tuning better than others,btohqsg
isnt it progressive tho? so u wont rllt notice,btohqsg
If you listen to a song  suddenly it goes half a step down,btohqsg
You make me wanna play my guitar again,btohqsg

Hi guys need some help. I drive a 2016 Citroen Berlingo. My rear left signal light has blown and I'm not able to find a workshop with stock for the bulb.,btohqsg
Went to a Citroen specialist and they couldn't help me either. Anyone know a workshop preferably central area that has stock to replace?,btohqsg

it's rarely to hear bulbs cannot be found,btohqsg
Did you try going back to the dealer,btohqsg
