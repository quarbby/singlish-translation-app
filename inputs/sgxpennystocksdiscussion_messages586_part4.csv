🍎Apple Shining Again🔦JP Morgan had raised its target for Apple for 2022 to $210  which is a climb from $180. It helps push the tech company towards a $3 trillion market capitalization. As we had talked about often  the services revenue for Apple is robust  and iPhone 13 appears to have decent sales.📱Budget 5G Phone🗝There is a growing expectation that Apple will also launch an affordable 5G iPhone for its SE model that can help to motivate a large group of people to upgrade to the new model and potentially attract Android users. It is expected to be released sometime in the first half of 2022.Indeed  the product cycle will give Apple a good edge as the SE model helps capture the mid to low end market segment  which is currently almost untapped. The opportunity is enormous as analysts expect Apple to sell 30 million sets of iPhone SE model during next year launch  bringing home around $10 billion in revenue.With an AR headset a possibility in 2022  there is a lot baked into the stock and market participants are giving the blessing for Apple to keep rocketing ahead!We hope you enjoy this read!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

"Another bullshit news  ""no evidence of spreading"". Then how the airport staffs infected with omicron.? Now those 1st line staffs all kana swapped everyday for 7 days... 😢",btohqsg

🪄Pika World Data Check🩺At 9.30 pm  we will receive the US Producer Price Index (PPI) for the month-to-month result. It will be crucial information for us to understand the depth of the inflation roaring into the market.🍹What is PPI?🥂The PPI is a metric that measures the degree of a change in the price of goods that a manufacturer sells.💡Why is it so important?🔦Pika World sees this as a leading indicator compared to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).Essentially  PPI accounts for a large portion of the overall inflation in an economy. Think about this. When PPI is high  retailers tend to pass on some increases through the prices of their products to consumers.Hence  this fuels price inflation for consumers. As such  PPI is seen as an essential piece of data to get a sense of the underlying inflation pressure looming in the economy.🎉The Expectation🏋We are looking at the PPI for the month to month to moderate to 0.5% from 0.6% in the prior period. Any reading above the estimate suggests a continuous heating price pressure in the economy.We hope you enjoy this read! If you find it useful  do share it with your friends  as it helps us reach out to a larger audience.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

I think most ppl don’t expect medical to go back to peak profit.  For example UG in new financial year can earn 40m net profit I think consider not bad oredy.,btohqsg
Just let medical stock continue to still earn profit and grow its NAV and fundamental.,btohqsg
Just get consent from sgx. Not new news,btohqsg
$40m profit for UG already considered very good when u just based on Q3 x 4. Q4 likely weaker given TG results.,btohqsg
