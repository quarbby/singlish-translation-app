which lvl of education you're in?,btohqsg
and my study place becomes a mes,btohqsg
si suck at being neat man,btohqsg
I read that as ‚ÄúI suck at beating meat man‚Äù,btohqsg
Lol no  just dirty minded only üôÉ,btohqsg
You have to be neat every single day,btohqsg
So every day if you‚Äôve moved something  move it back,btohqsg
If you‚Äôve taken a thing out of your file  file it back,btohqsg
is it weird that I'm super neat and organized in some aspects of my life,btohqsg
and yet my room is always super messy,btohqsg
The inconsistency is what makes you the way u are ‚ú®,btohqsg
and i‚Äôll make notes and file it in,btohqsg
i used to write notes on notebooks,btohqsg
and my study space like small,btohqsg
i put com and one book barely any space left,btohqsg
i try to organize once a week cause if i don't  my mom comes and makes everything perfect and my dad will guilt trip me kek,btohqsg
i mean those are my pencils but,btohqsg
like i dont got room for anythhh,btohqsg
You should see my life when exams approach :v,btohqsg
wa the month before a levels  i sat down for an entire sunday and sorted my stack of papers,btohqsg
I‚Äôd get like a new organizer  throw out old books and notes from like primary school or something,btohqsg
(Cuz I have a strange problem of hoarding those),btohqsg
Are there any engineering poly kids looking for group like during exams cuz I feel like I could probably use some good influence of studious kids,btohqsg
I personally kept everything in files and file cases,btohqsg
And then threw them into a cupboard,btohqsg
It's not messy if you can't see them,btohqsg
According to this guy memory is freehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbipJUJLzpE,btohqsg
That's actually pretty neat compared to mine HAHAHHA,btohqsg
Same but I not engi kekeke,btohqsg
I like the way you think,btohqsg
If so why not make it more permanent,btohqsg
Either burn or shred your stuff,btohqsg
Then you don't need ever see them,btohqsg
Just in case I need them lol,btohqsg
You know that junior who asks you for help with a math question two years after you graduated,btohqsg
And then you already forgotten everything,btohqsg
i threw out quite alot liao,btohqsg
but like my jc notes still need keep,btohqsg
but idk what i rlly need to keep or not and where man üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Guys do lemme know ah? :),btohqsg
If you're in CS  you do CS research,btohqsg
What's likely is that given the current market  you do machine learning / AI,btohqsg
If your profs are highly technical  then you do specialised CS research (I'd say quite rare),btohqsg
CNYSP  research is part of the curriculum,btohqsg
i think u pick 1 easier,btohqsg
I'm assuming if you do CS research  you'll look into Deep Learning/neural nets,btohqsg
CNYSP either sponsor the flight  or you ownself will fly over because not every Tom Dick goes to NIPS,btohqsg
Anyway no one here can tell you what 'benefits' are the best,btohqsg
You need to structure your questions so that they have objective outcomes and/or advice can be given,btohqsg
Err...benefits are to mankind? Because you research and develop new methods and applications of science and tech?,btohqsg
