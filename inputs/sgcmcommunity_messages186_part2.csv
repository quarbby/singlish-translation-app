Suzuki swift 1.2L DUALJET engine ? Good ? Haha cheaper of all new cars.,btohqsg
but after i drive mk7  i have to say no fight la,btohqsg
i own suzuki sport for 1 yr btw,btohqsg
i do not know other cars  mk7 vs suzuki sport  has to be mk7,btohqsg
Swift sport got a relatively big motorsport following in sg,btohqsg
A lot of people use it to track,btohqsg
Looks fun to drive on track but... I think not for big sized drivers,btohqsg
I drive the Suzuki Swift 1.2 Mild Hybrid; it's decently light and quick due to the weight  but it's quite underpowered. Not so great in hard acceleration  but it's smooth drive makes it quite good for Singapore roads. Can even go on Norrh-Sourh Highway  but stick to Lane 2 and Cruise Control at 110km/h. Can't compete with some of the faster driversIt's pretty cheap to maintain: fuel consumption is about 18l/km  road tax is $500 a year. Does a good job in ferrying my family (myself  wife  2 small kids) for family outings. Not very spacious,btohqsg
Serves its A to B purpose,btohqsg
I perfer my civic at 2xxkm/h on the nshw,btohqsg
Fuel consumption is alr out of the mind when we decided to mod n tune,btohqsg
Undertakers also prefer cars doing 2xxkmh on mshw,btohqsg
Wud like to just say balance both,btohqsg
If WS offer front wheel balancing only  is it sufficient?,btohqsg
Good job sir . I like also :),btohqsg
?? who the in the right mind wont do all 4,btohqsg
probably WS want customers to topup,btohqsg
The WS quite good rep one. I also surprised when I was quoted,btohqsg

Hi I am new and noob on car. Got a curious question with recent huge drop coe why the car drop little example coe drop 20k but car with it drop 10k. Duno what I missing,btohqsg
because VES rebate decreased and some cars got bumped up a VES banding,btohqsg
I told mg sales guy coe didn't drop 20k üòÇ he stunned and ask why I said that,btohqsg
I said coe drop 20k  but ves cut 5k liao and gst up 1% liao üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyway dealers also scared cut too much then next coe up too much,btohqsg
Agreed cause if they cut too much and up again they expose their bottom,btohqsg
Bottom good for business for some too,btohqsg
The Dec one the sales guy said many kena the coe and collected car...if their rebate is set at 75k lol. Every car they compensate 10k,btohqsg
Any comments for e new Sienta?,btohqsg

Good effort but the decreased rebates from the revised ves and eeai for 2024 doesn't apply to most of MG's electric vehicles if you do the math,btohqsg
Sales guy cannot trust too much,btohqsg
Many people say it look ugly  some think is ok. Very practical but almost like van.,btohqsg
