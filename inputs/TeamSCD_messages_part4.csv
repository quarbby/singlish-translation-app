Using bc br... Previous car bc v1. So far ok for me. No real complains,btohqsg
Waiting for u add ur frenz in or promote in ur car group,btohqsg
My car they complain car too loud rather then uncomfortable üòÇ,btohqsg
But so far no one ever mentioned about comfort,btohqsg
The bc br for me feels better,btohqsg
Ya for drivers no complains from my end too,btohqsg
The v1 last time I used on 09 cerato when new  damn hard. Took about 2 months before it became softer,btohqsg
U all early morning talk abt vroom vroom alr,btohqsg
The br came with my current car. So already seasoned.,btohqsg
But when it was hard  the car felt faster for some reason. Just that those small humps damn rough.,btohqsg
Mine that time  after a week I had to go back workshop tighten the coilovers. So if you hear vibration  is the spring start to season then it become loose. Need to go workshop tighten.,btohqsg
Also my bump stopper had to remove.,btohqsg
Got ppl mention bc v1 less harsh,btohqsg
The others say v1 will oil leak,btohqsg
I think car weight also play a part,btohqsg
V1 I used less then a year  then sold,btohqsg
Similar someone also had isses with v1 being squeaky,btohqsg
But think ur advise was good,btohqsg
Yeah... I feel I got a bit more dampening on the br. But I think is because the accord is much heavier then the cerato,btohqsg
the car can‚Äôt even start up,btohqsg

Not all is euro R variant,btohqsg
The new accords 1.5 turbo no idea why no 2 litre,btohqsg
