What's the minimum amount to start depositing for this ?,btohqsg
How did the banks even find out in the first place that you stopped working??,btohqsg
They just said based on their records/assessment,btohqsg

Hi all just to check. I kinda need to use my UOB KF card today but it hasn't arrived. Does adding it to google pay mean that it is considered as online spend (coz to earn 3mpd should be online spend)  or is it considered as mobile contactless?,btohqsg
Tap machine using card is contactless.Tap machine using phone is mobile contactless.Paid using gpay is online.Mobile contactless won't show as gpay  it will show up as how you do it using card to tap on machine.,btohqsg
No idea. Like that means retirees will loose their cc,btohqsg
The annual fees still there when check online,btohqsg

Posb everyday card on recurring bills for utilities only. So the first month i wont get the cashback?,btohqsg
if add to gpay and tap on contactless machine is mobile contactlessif add to gpay and use on website/app is onlineknown ways to convert to online is use the card via Amaze card/shopback/fave  or buy vouchers online,btohqsg
hi guys  i use amaze plus citi reward to place order in amazon US...  strangely in instarem app  it shows mcc is 5942 under education....doea it mean i am not eligible for citi 10x rewarding?,btohqsg
What do u mean? Didn't you asked for credit limit increase to $5000 on your trust card and told the bank that you're not working? Ownself self pwn then come here act blur?,btohqsg
You said so yourself bro. Maybe you forgot ? 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Hi guys  is buying voucher on shopback consider eligible online transaction for dbs live fresh card? Thanks,btohqsg
Do they keep have access to our cpf and iras?,btohqsg
Well Trust and Stan Chart are related but not related so congrats you literally picked the only 2 banks that have some form of link,btohqsg
Bcos you inform trust bank and stanchart are related with trust bank. That why.,btohqsg
Only communicated with Trust. Have not contacted Stanchart for few years,btohqsg
Then bank have breach customer data in a certain sense coz they share data between different entity,btohqsg
Maybe there's fineprint that allows Trust to share customer data with Stanchart,btohqsg
FYI  Trust bank is powered by SCB.,btohqsg
when i apply for SCB card  they are asking me how much credit limit do i want to transfer over  or split accordingly.,btohqsg
https://trustbank.sg/legal/general-terms-and-conditions/Seems big enough  lots of SCB mention here and there,btohqsg
Does topup Grab Wallet using UOB One Credit Card counts towards UOB $500 CC spending?,btohqsg
So did U do something to let trust or scb know u are unemployed.Granting them access to SingPass data which contains employer / cpf contribution / Noa is a sure way to sabotage yourself.Always read what they are pulling from SingPass before u say yes.,btohqsg
Had used new Trust function to request for credit limit increase and selected Not working option,btohqsg
One last hope / chance for uDo u have investment income be it SSBs or tbills or rental or fixed deposit.At least show something. They can still give u a minimal credit limit.,btohqsg
Oh wah legendary granny here also,btohqsg
If you ain't working  chances are you will get lesser credit or no credit limit  think of it as a loan. Banks need some form of record to show that you have a way of paying them back (or rather  a proof that you can pay your CC bills),btohqsg
That will be a secured credit card  if I really need one from them.,btohqsg
Yes because that's the only type of credit card you are eligible for,btohqsg
There are banks flexible enough to deem investment income as regular income. Provided u can meet $30k per year consistently.,btohqsg
So@malemanX  do you fit this criteria instead?,btohqsg
Hi guys  quick check compared to SYFE Guaranteed 3.8% why would anyone opt for UOB’s previous National Day and new Christmas ProMotion where pledging $50 - 200k is necessary but only getting 1-2% monthly return over 4 months?,btohqsg
I paired my Citi rewards to Amaze  paywaved using physical Amaze card but I don’t see the points reflected on Citi bank app  does it take a while or it will only reflect only per transaction statement?,btohqsg
wait 1-2 business day after transaction posted,btohqsg
cos this cashback is in addition to the 5% interest on uob one account for $100k balance  3% on uob stash,btohqsg
In other words  it would not make any sense for someone to put in or pledge more than $100 000 in either account technically is that right? 😅,btohqsg
Nope. I'm invested but not enough high returns,btohqsg
Yes  unless you don't mind 0.05% above 100k lol,btohqsg
So sad  I just applied the previous promo,btohqsg
hi - new to Atome and i am considering BNPL for credit card strategy - If i put my credit card in ATOME  atome wlll just charge the instalment to credit card right? and I won't run risk of late payment with ATOME  is the understanding correct?,btohqsg
