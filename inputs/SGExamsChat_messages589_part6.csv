orchard area usually pay high fr pt,btohqsg

there are economic reasons for not having a min wage,btohqsg
I think I read it in one of my eoy exams' case study,btohqsg
there are a lot of unintended consequences of min wage,btohqsg
Time to brush up on my econs,btohqsg
min wage also like kuro said gets absorbed into prices,btohqsg
ever increasing skillsets needed.Those who want to remain in comfort zone  don't want to upskill and work more  will be marginalised,btohqsg
not to mention most of people that would benefit from min wage are foreign workers on temp work passes,btohqsg
like the kind of jobs you‚Äôre thinking pay too little isn‚Äôt even close to the bottom,btohqsg
minimum wage increases costs of low value jobs so there's incentive to push for productivity and automation,btohqsg
i mean some foreign workers don‚Äôt even make 1k a month,btohqsg
imagine all of those simultaneously shooting up to wtv min wage,btohqsg
The feeling when pt earn more than full timer,btohqsg
I was working at this warehse and got full timer tell me they earning $1k++,btohqsg
How would u feel if you as a full timer getting paid lesser than a 16 yr old just finished n/o lvls,btohqsg
Sure is just for less than a month but definitely sucks,btohqsg
Coz that time i work during sch holidays only,btohqsg
But still‚Ä¶ i two weeks equals to their monthly pay,btohqsg
part time means no cpf no leave no medical no nothing,btohqsg
I seeing now ex moe teacher can go as high as $80/hr,btohqsg
Yeahh but if u went to legit agencies they will give u,btohqsg
u want stable then of cos u get less,btohqsg
I work before one that gave me cpf even though its a day job,btohqsg
I specifically asked to give me full amount but no,btohqsg
Coz the one i went  they gave me cheque only,btohqsg
And they take quite big cut iirc,btohqsg
Ya so protip is find the big daddy,btohqsg
Or work directly for the part time job,btohqsg
But this one legit need find,btohqsg
High chance is they willing to pay u than agency,btohqsg
I think out of the worst i went was the lan job one sia,btohqsg
Same but I've got to pay cpf now lol,btohqsg
