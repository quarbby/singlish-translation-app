you can push your luck and ask for tuner also,btohqsg

Hi guys need some help. I drive a 2016 Citroen Berlingo. My rear left signal light has blown and I'm not able to find a workshop with stock for the bulb.,btohqsg
Went to a Citroen specialist and they couldn't help me either. Anyone know a workshop preferably central area that has stock to replace?,btohqsg
wow not sure what kind of special bulbs citroen uses,btohqsg
it's rarely to hear bulbs cannot be found,btohqsg
Did you try going back to the dealer,btohqsg
dont think urs is LED right? if halogen  shd be most ws shd have de... standard item leh,btohqsg
unless citroen have proprietory bulbs  which is very stupid,btohqsg
doubt so.... shd be T20... unless they like Apple,btohqsg
Then just go autobacs or what,btohqsg
Maybe I'm just unlucky that the places i went to don't have. Will go search again another day. üòÇ,btohqsg
