is it like to boost portfolio?,btohqsg
then what else can we do to boost portfolio,btohqsg
ya brah either this or med the last id choose is  business in nus,btohqsg
sec 4 cannot get internship right,btohqsg
IW YO BUT MY PARENTS DONT LET??,btohqsg
WHY UR PARENTS SO WHAT ONE,btohqsg
mine is if i want then their ok,btohqsg
most internship ask for min a lvl cert/dip,btohqsg
Ya gg I was finding but no avail la,btohqsg
I suppose is they dw me like dream big then get disappointed,btohqsg
my parents js say do wtv that interests u,btohqsg
isnt there a stereotype of the asian parent wanting a lawyer/med child,btohqsg
but wtv la I got dreams for myself  altho i eae iw get scholarships that's why I work hard for olvls bcz my mom was like brah chill man you go eae onl) need 26,btohqsg
Err if u got connections plus u hv knowledge of the work like u study outside for the course u probs can find,btohqsg
my parents are totally fine w me pursuing towards the media side,btohqsg
i eae-d without my parents' knowledge,btohqsg
if i do well might appeal to pharm sci bcz nyp dh biomed,btohqsg
Err I heard there was one snr frm my sch long long ago got an internship,btohqsg
i surprised them on that day,btohqsg
yes we know u pulled the biggest card,btohqsg
biggest gamble of my life man,btohqsg
idt i wld do it again,btohqsg
Basically he studied for the thing ya plus I heard he did well in my sch/jc,btohqsg
cannot  switch course after sem1 is only within the sch outside abi the mafan might be rejected bcz also high demand,btohqsg
ur eae set in stone alr,btohqsg
ya olvls I meet the cop for the course then ya,btohqsg
ya but u must complete sem1 first,btohqsg
common sci programme only applies in y1 sem 1 wot no meh,btohqsg
idk why they even created that for tbh,btohqsg
that program sounds exactly like common engineering in NTU,btohqsg
idk bc np wanted more ppl to join,btohqsg
ya it's y1 but isn't it sem 2 den dispatched to own specialty,btohqsg
not much ppl in np meh?,btohqsg
those who dk wat to pursue in then sem1 they give brief idea for each course,btohqsg
i mean the program makes sense for some people,btohqsg
and helps you not make a choice without properly knowing what you're getting into,btohqsg
ya I get to choose  but I can't choose to go for common sci prog bcz I alr eae-d and if I were to eae and want to switch courses I am forced to still study sem1 in my eae-d course.. and also I think I can only change courses within the same poly so in my case nyp   doesn't have biomed similar to np so the next closest is prolly pharm sci,btohqsg
yeah i've been seeing that ever since i followed np,btohqsg
so even if I wanted to switch courses and im alr in nyp  I still need to meet the o level  cop for the desire course,btohqsg
and pocoyo js bang his head on the wall.. ouch.,btohqsg
i like how you just swap from first person to third person so easily,btohqsg
yea Bedok asking the real questions,btohqsg
no there's cracks now ouh no,btohqsg
what a sudden change in topic guys üëèüèºüëèüèº,btohqsg
anyway after O/As  the brain probably benefits from hitting the wall,btohqsg
meanwhile me tmr crying over physics mcq,btohqsg
bcz nyp is the only one who offers a so called media related course under business sch if I want to pursue business in uni  I can do so  same goes if I want to pursue in media.. so I wld say it's a 2 in 1++ considering business is very general and it's q likely to be hired w a business dip/be able to apply for business sch in uni,btohqsg
oh yes oke  road to 90 ah,btohqsg
oh wow thats something that i did not know,btohqsg
den u think I apply for fun ah,btohqsg
bro outdo himself everyday in the gym it's fine,btohqsg
what's there to study for bio mcq im q done w eveything js the definitions Istg son of a bitch,btohqsg
I taking digital law next sem wanted to gain some insights,btohqsg
the only reason why I get 19/20 for Tys is bcz of definitions,btohqsg
definitions in pure is so little haizz,btohqsg
pretty ironic how I study bio but js don't memorise definitions,btohqsg
i fucked up one definition qn in bio ppr,btohqsg
I still got 64 other marks toLose,btohqsg
OKAY OKAY WE SEE NEXT YEAR OKE,btohqsg

my sch sec 3s first batch of p hist students,btohqsg
Bedok is L he sees a bunch of bedok viewan and refuse to find the pocoyo supporting bedok viewan bcz he doesn't want to be associated,btohqsg

We yearn to be free one day,btohqsg
