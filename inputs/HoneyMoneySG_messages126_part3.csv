Hi gurus  example if you have 100k saving and you want to transfer out to another bank to earn better interest. Do you guys transfer all 100k and pay the fall below fee or keep the minimum balance to prevent paying the fall below fees?,btohqsg
does fall below fee outweigh the interest? or does interest outweigh the fall below fee?if fall below fee is $2 and the interest is $3 then put in the bank for interest and pay the fall below fee,btohqsg

Would the ding-dong strategy or transferring between OCBC & HSBC account monthly trigger warnings from the banks?,btohqsg
For the ding dong strategy (hsbc & ocbc) to work  we must transfer out exactly on the 1st of the month ?I’m not too sure if hsbc to another hsbc account works cause the T&C says “funds originating from any existing account with the Bank” since both are from hsbc,btohqsg

No. Should be 12 Aug (Mon) - being the 7th working day of the month,btohqsg

No.. I mean for the strategy to work  do we need to ding dong on the first of every month?Cause hsbc say 30 days before not counted,btohqsg
Just withdraw on 1st and deposit on 1st of each promotion coz most bank count by average daily balance,btohqsg
System check at what time everyday? Isit 12 am?,btohqsg
If 1st fall on public holiday and weekend u need to plan more,btohqsg

I am just waiting for someone to go email/chat HSBC to ask for black and white on how the 30 days works.. kekekekeP.S. this is of course being sacarstic.. please don't do that.,btohqsg
Low key think all these promotion won’t last past September after interest rate drop,btohqsg
just make hay when the sun shines.,btohqsg
but the right way to think is..do not assume all these high rate savings account tricks/promos will last forever...one day will drop back below 2% p.a. one,btohqsg
Definitely  every SG resident 18 years old and above  should max out the SG benefit first... $200k into SSB.,btohqsg
