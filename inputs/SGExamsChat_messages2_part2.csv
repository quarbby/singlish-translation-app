i can try to expand on them right,btohqsg
they want to test your creativity,btohqsg
not die die must be a viable solution,btohqsg
its a business leader enrichment programme,btohqsg
@AshyGFriendwhat do you think about Smart Bins? i.e. bins weigh the different sorted rubbish people throw into the bin and give points for every bit of rubbish. These points can be accumulated to exchange for vouchers etc.,btohqsg
points can be collected in the form of QR codes,btohqsg
The point system is interesting  but I personally would re-consider the idea of using weight as the determining factor,btohqsg
Sounds like people might game the system,btohqsg
Like add water or some stupid nonsense  people will do anything to game the system,btohqsg
do we have enough technology to scan proportion of whatever was thrown into the bin HAHAHA,btohqsg
like if we can scan a certain % of water then the guy is wasting water and thus he gets 0 points and an unhappy face :>,btohqsg
mhm idk how expensive it would be to implement those 'airport scanning' technology onto smart bins,btohqsg
then depending on the % of type of rubbish thrown in the recycling bin  points will be given accordingly,btohqsg
and even then  we wouldn't know the type of material,btohqsg
I didn’t take any philo mods but what are your questions  I can forward to my philo major friends,btohqsg
I’m not advertising. I’m just sharing my resources....,btohqsg
All the best for those still in JC!!,btohqsg
no advertising. if he wants to help people  there are plenty of people who needs help in the A level study group that he can help,btohqsg
Ppl will find out abt him,btohqsg
.................................. advertising right after the mod say not to advert,btohqsg
No student not end of the world,btohqsg
I can recco u one guy even more power u want?,btohqsg
"do we denote number of moles as ""N"" or ""n"" in calculations",btohqsg
I was taught the former in sec sch and the latter in JC,btohqsg
Without knowing jack abt H2 Chem  I believe they say “When in Rome  do as the Romans do”.Lmao that was what my Pri Sch Eng teacher said when I complained about my Sec Sch preferring something that would’ve been marked wrong in Pri Sch despite the format being the same.,btohqsg
I'd say n. I would use big N for number of molecules (so avogad * n),btohqsg
Let T be the number of moles,btohqsg
Let X-hat be the no. Of moles,btohqsg
I just wanted to ask if they have to purchase the actual source material for the various philosophers and the specific philosophical works (e.g. Beyond The Good And Evil)  and if so  whether they have a catalogue for itBecause I'm planning to read for my own interest during my NS days  and I want to make full use of my money if I'm going to buy the books,btohqsg
thanks for the help in advance!!!,btohqsg
hi for NTU biz/acc double degree hor  is there a specific grade I must hit? or what are the requirements for it?,btohqsg
“It depends on which area he is interested in  but I can forward to a philo group hahaMost prof do make compulsory text accessible”He also mentioned that you usually don’t have to buy source material at the lower levels.,btohqsg
Usually for DDP it's quite difficult to get in unless your A Level grades are pretty good,btohqsg
Most of your texts will be given to you by your prof,btohqsg
ok then I won't waste my first choice on it kek,btohqsg
Since when you take philo mod,btohqsg
Even if you have to source for it yourself  NUS libaries has a collection of research papers that you can download for free  which you otherwise would have to pay,btohqsg
Minimally is you should definitely be able to enter both courses in terms of rank points  but that isn't really enough,btohqsg
Doesn't NTU have a separate slot for DDPs/double majors?,btohqsg
idk it's part of the 5 choices I have,btohqsg
Ah ok I can't really remember since it was a year ago,btohqsg
Not to mention we just libgen everything anyways,btohqsg
But tbh you can list it first choice if you want,btohqsg
The curse of NUS Libraries having almost everything is when your something is the rare few that are left out.,btohqsg
nah idt I got a chance anw,btohqsg
"Listing a harder to get in choice below something ""easier"" to get in doesn't make sense",btohqsg
Libgen not everything have either :/,btohqsg
I mean so far the math textbooks I want haven’t been hard to source for,btohqsg
yea but I think I'm better off not putting ddp at all and just leaving that extra choice for another course,btohqsg
ddp not worth it bro  single is enough to drain your soul already,btohqsg
