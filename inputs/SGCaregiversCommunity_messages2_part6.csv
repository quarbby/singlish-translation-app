I would help by offering my stacks of notes but for all the chim english. I simply refer to 1 ancient chinese books: ÁöáÂ∏ùÂÜÖÁªè. Or the yellow emperor classic.,btohqsg
To be fair  what we are facing still have to goes back to school syllabus... a lot of it is not practical or applicable to daily life compared to the olden days e.g. home economics  social skills or moral education. Plus. We have a outsourced culture to maids  teachers etc. So it is a structural issue as a result of modernisation that does not align with human development. That just the price of leap frog forward in 50 years of city development.,btohqsg
For example in the 70s or 80s... there used to be chinese education such as Xinyao or emphasis on religion education/ËÆ∫ËØ≠.  But it was subsequently removed...   actually these subjects are important for the positive youth development in the holistic sense,btohqsg

Hi It is our wish to elevate communities behind caregiving so that we can reduce societal costs driven by caregiver burnout.Our vision is to develop a solution that can best support Caregivers  such that they can integrate caregiving into their lifestyle more effectively  without the need to compromise on self care and family planning.In order for us to do this  we wish to seek your valuable inputs to lead us in the right direction as we develop the solution that will add value to Caregivers. In the link below  you will find a short 5 minute survey.https://forms.gle/t3jqaCoAt6pjXAbdAWe will also like to invite you to be part of the pilot study  where we can also share with you some of the general insights that we gather through the surveys and future studies. If you are keen to be part of the community  do leave your Name and Email in the form for us to reach out to you.Thank you!,btohqsg
I believe the survey should include questions for caregivers who have retired from working as some of the questions were directed to believe that all caregivers are working and being employed . If this survey is targetted at caregivers who are working   then it should be addressed that there is a target group that the organisation wish to address to .,btohqsg
Thanks for the valuable feedback. The targeted caregivers are both working and retired. Will review and reflect that with better accuracy in the survey.,btohqsg
Thank u and much appreciated that feedback has been acted onüòä,btohqsg
hiHere To Serve  can you declare which org is requesting for this survey participation? There isn't any mention in the survey form either.to protect our caregivers in this community  i will have to remove it if there's no update on this. Thank you for your understanding.,btohqsg
Hi  we are not affiliated to any organisation  just a group of friends who has the intent to want to explore doing something for the caregivers community.Totally understand if there is a need to remove the post if it infringes anything. Will respect that.,btohqsg
No  not for any school projectEach of us have various work experiences with the special needs and elderly community  and as we were chatting  decided to bring some of our ideas together and explore the possibilities,btohqsg
Perhaps u have a Facebook or Instagram to showcase your group that the community can know more about what u are doing etc?,btohqsg
notedHere To Serveas long as the survey doesnt ask for personal particulars  good luck with the research and thanks for doing it,btohqsg
We don't have any social media for the group. We only got together for this idea recently.,btohqsg
We will ensure to keep the name and email as an optional field  such that we could share the survey findings as well as to share the updates of where we might further develop the idea intoDo advice if it is preferred to remove the abovementioned (optional) name and email questions. I can make the changes accordingly.Much thanks üôè,btohqsg
As a person who formerly work in Ah Kong Research Office. May I suggest that you declare your name  IC and date of birth? These details are sensitive in nature and we do not know how these datas are stored or secured? What are your due dilligences? Are you above 21? Do you have a Bach Degree with modules in Research Studies?,btohqsg
We do not know who you are. Anyone can state a false organisation or group. There are a lot of cyber scammers solicting personal data for own interests.,btohqsg
Do be aware that individuals can press charges if the studies are misused  leaked  hacked or told to others without informed consent face to face with translator.,btohqsg
Do present your research credentials firsy,btohqsg
P.S as a ËøáÊù•‰∫∫ and former Â∞èÂÆòÂëò  be truthful and honest because this is a safe  sacred and honourable space for a vulnerable community. There are laws  ethics and mores to abide esp if it is about asking for research studies related,btohqsg
Are you Singaporean  Singapore PR or Foreigner? Foreigner under what pass?,btohqsg
As in you and your team,btohqsg
Who is the We? Where? Names  location  ID?  Why use the word infringe? Has this happen before?  Intent?  You mean latent and explict? What happen if thing goes south. Will you and your team be responsible under civil or criminal law?  Because you are gathering personal data by yourself. No organisation or school representation neither company ACRA registration,btohqsg
In the 1st place  the sample size here is too small for your studies to be validated. It raise eyebrowns.  Wont it be better to ask the streets? How did u get to know this grouo?,btohqsg
Thanks so much for sharing the valid worries and concernA lot of questions here  so I do hope I can answer all of it the best I canI wouldn't go so far to say that it is a research  it is more of trying to validate some of the thoughts and assumptions we have.We are approaching the channels and means we know how  do advice if you know of a better way for us to go about it,btohqsg
I can only say for myself  as for the friends  do forgive me that in the same name of privacy  I shall not mention them hereMy name is AugustineTotally clueless with social media. Learned about telegram a week ago and we thought it could be a viable platform to share the surveyI used to teach swimming for the special needs community with a swim school for the past 10 years. Currently not with the company  but pursuing a program to be certified as a leadership coach and trainer,btohqsg
