Coilovers i always have 2 very important things need ask,btohqsg
1) How long will it last? Bilstein and Tein and KW  those atas brands  can last 5 to 6 years. No leak no squeak. So can last long without rebuild.2) if the coilovers known to not last  like BC racing or many other taiwan brands. 1 to 2 years. The coilovers can rebuild?,btohqsg
If rebuild is done in SG for how long downtime? Or need send back to Japan/Germany for months to rebuild.,btohqsg
And most importantly rebuild how much? Is it worth to rebuild or buy new coilovers sua.,btohqsg
Yeap! The rebuild part they should have answers.Reliability  how long they last  better to check online for reviews,btohqsg
