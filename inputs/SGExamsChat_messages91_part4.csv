NUS Website is in need of a spring cleaning,btohqsg
This website says DDP DHP cs + math requires 208 MCs,btohqsg
this website also gives a link for single honours DDP for cs + math,btohqsg
But the link goes to this which is for a double honours program,btohqsg
"holy fuck do I need to email them just to ask ""sorry ah how many MCs I need take ah uwu""",btohqsg
Such good website  reflecting very well on the school of computing aint it,btohqsg
I mean looking at the solutions the prof gives and the recent exam results,btohqsg
Math and computing have huge overlap horh,btohqsg
That's cos I'm not doing it,btohqsg
I mean like the shitty website  reflects bad on their own IT team  and yet they wanna teach computing. I know it’s not the same I’m just being snarky.,btohqsg
The entire NUS site is trash,btohqsg
been in the sch for 2 years didnt know lol,btohqsg
They dont teach optimisation in computing sadly,btohqsg
i was gonna declare cs minor next sem,btohqsg
only good for grooming future sexual predators,btohqsg
then why the fk am i still virgin after so long,btohqsg
It’s one thing to not update the site regularly  it’s another to not put a “Last Updated:” on their site  at least when there are conflicting info  ppl know which one more recent.,btohqsg
You’re either the predator or the prey.,btohqsg
U need to wait to be predated on,btohqsg
but the predators wouldnt be virgins too,btohqsg
Bold of u to assume that. John is a birgin,btohqsg
The concept of virginity doesn’t apply to John,btohqsg
This is actually a valid conclusion,btohqsg
Joke explanation...: I’m implying he’s the prey  because if he’s a predator he’ll lose it by now.,btohqsg
Anyone knows the the benefit of advance placement credit,btohqsg
Can be exempted from that mod lorh,btohqsg
No need to take that mod,btohqsg
So if I take the advance placement means I have lesser module,btohqsg
But the apc test is notoriously hard,btohqsg
You need to calm down im using android 😔😔😔,btohqsg
Did anyone of y'all try taking it?,btohqsg
Apple > whatever the fk nokia runs on > android,btohqsg
U can see sample papers online,btohqsg
no its apple > samsung > oppo > huawei > nokia,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure u can only take the test once u enter,btohqsg
All your > should be <,btohqsg
But may as well try to get those advanced placements,btohqsg
Is worth only if they complements,btohqsg
But that's is BA in Art,btohqsg
So what's your rationale for taking psychology,btohqsg
Can't be your girlfriend taking it then you take right,btohqsg
woah mw has a gf :o,btohqsg
Go double deg comb bio and cs,btohqsg
Can u even do comp bio and cs,btohqsg
But can also do a double degree right,btohqsg
Is like saying i want do cs+IS,btohqsg
Lol I thought this was xd,btohqsg
I think u can take any DDP combination in NUS?,btohqsg
So double Degree or double major if want to do life science plus psychology ah,btohqsg
@junghon3709I need ur wisdom and wise opinion Mr Jung hon,btohqsg
