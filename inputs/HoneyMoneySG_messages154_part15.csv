It's like too complicated. I thought 3% welcome interest for 3 months could be a good options,btohqsg
3.05% EIR I think have better places to put elsewhere ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
To be fair thatâ€™s how banks offer it. Convenient solution wonâ€™t be the best.U want the best deal u got to work for it. And do things not everyone can do.,btohqsg
UOB One is what I am considering but I have issue with credit card minimum spending  inconsistent.Currently I have UOB Stash account which I rotate for the quarterly promotions. And also OCBC 360 with credit card paying tax via CardUp.I used to rotate with CIMB FastSaver  SCB eSavers and Tbills.,btohqsg
Right.But I already have OCBC360 and UOB Stash (With quarterly promo).Seems like interest rate decreasing and not much options.I also subscribed for SSB this month to lock the interest close to 3% but only allocated partially.,btohqsg
Hi  want to check  does paying for education using UOB Debit card counts towards the UOB One $500 spend?,btohqsg
Yea I only parked for this month since Feb has least days.But I also test parking some at Fullerton Short Term Interest Bond 30 days ago  gotten slightly above 5.1% / annum.On the other hand  HSBC Ultra Short Duration Bond earned me 4.1% / annum for the same period 27 Jan - 26 Feb.,btohqsg
If my assumption is correct:Mar: 300 000 x 3.85% = 962.50Apr: 300 000 x 3.00% = 750May: 300 000 x 3.00% = 750Jun: 300 000 x 3.00% = 750Welcome Cash Rewards = 688Total interest (4months) = 3900.50E.I.R. = 3.9%,btohqsg
What's the best way to pay insurance?,btohqsg
To enjoy the uob savings promo  which day should i wipe out my stash account? And which day should i deposit the funds back?,btohqsg
UOB one account cc spend is actually easy to hit. UOB one credit card can use to pay SP utility. It's a decent chunk of 500$ spend. Pay insurance also counts for bonus interest min spend.,btohqsg
1st of march. And deposit in apr  ideally April 1.,btohqsg
U need to consider u are forced to keep $200k in month 5 n 6 too.,btohqsg
Thank you. Interest is credited on 1 march if im not wrong. So will withdraw after interest right? I only register for the promotion after i withdraw right?,btohqsg
Yes. Empty everything. The deposit back and register for q2 promo in April.,btohqsg
The current promo will end on 29 March. Does it mean im not in time for it?,btohqsg
The current promo looks at Dec MAB so you are already very late to the party,btohqsg
Ohh. The Q2 promo is not out yet right? So to withdraw on 1 march means i cant see how attractive the promo first then decide whether to withdraw and participate right?,btohqsg
"It's the ""risk"" you need to take. If UOB follows same pattern  q2 promo will use march MAB. You wait til promo is out  it's too late to clear ur UOB acct already.And rmb the promo is on top of UOB normal rate so you will get decent amount of interests regardless.",btohqsg
Wat card is best for grab gojek and normal expenses,btohqsg
Hello  Iâ€™m paying for Reno. Not sure which cash back credit card should I be using for Ipaymy.,btohqsg
User~wrhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no random link,btohqsg
If based on t&cs:Mar: 1.05% p.a. = $267.53Apr: 3.05% p.a. = $752.05May: 3.05% p.a = $777.12Jun: 3.05% p.a = $752.05Welcome rewards = $688Total interests (4 months) = $3236.75EIR = 3.24% p.a.,btohqsg
Then new version for what. Lame HSBC,btohqsg
They restructure the t&c.. but wording same..Maybe got new guy take over the previous guy job... So now more onz.,btohqsg
I'm still in the same boat ðŸ˜¢ digital card with physical card applied but hasn't arrived. Can't pay on AXS despite trying every other day since the launch... Chose credit card (other banks)  sufficient funds in account,btohqsg
Gd morning  what charges are immediate posted to credit card ? I still has a gap to meet min spend,btohqsg
Thank you so much for your help!Then probably I should only deposit to EGA on 31 Mar.I might deposit to SCB eSavers first for 2.9%.Btw  does HSBC practises the 10:30pm+ / Sunday / public holiday cut-off timing for like OCBC/UOB/SCB?30 Mar is Sunday and 31 Mar is public holiday.,btohqsg
think should deposit on 29 Mar morning,btohqsg
Depends on which bank your card is from. Then find a shop where the terminal is also by the same bank. High chance but not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Thanks!You are right. I am considering whether it makes sense to pay the $50 fall below fee instead.Btw  is HSBC EGA for Personal and Premier Banking the same? If I terminated the Premier relationship  do I still hold the same EGA account?,btohqsg
I see. Even though the TnC stated the last day for funding is 31 Mar,btohqsg
Hi all  for IRAS tax payments  I understand we can only set up a GIRO with bank accounts.So to use cardup / chocolate finance to pay for it  do we just set the payment to be minimum 2 weeks before the actual GIRO deduction date?Meaning there won't be double deductions in one single month  right?Thanks!,btohqsg
Maybank family and friends monthly 800 min is based on spend date or posted date? Can anyone advise?,btohqsg
Hi. Can I check if buy fairprice vouchers using UOB one card  is it consider under $500 spent?,btohqsg
Anyone with experience using the chocolate finance debit card? It was working when I linked it to HeyMax and it deducted 0.01. But when I tried to use it at my church website  it was declined. Anyone have issues with card with certain merchants?,btohqsg
some card numbers have issue. choco finance aware of this issue,btohqsg
Would you know does this mean my card cannot be used for anything at all or only at certain merchants?,btohqsg
Well I called Chocolate finance and they told me that their Visa debit card does not allow transactions  from social service agencies and churches ie anything under donations. I keep hearing we earn max miles points for Charities etc. so now I am confused,btohqsg
Hi guys random question usually UOB one account promo will come out every starting of the quarter right? If i want to be eligible for next quarter i.e. Q2  do i put the money elsewhere for at least 1 month first? Then put it back when the quarter starts to eligible for freshfund?,btohqsg
I think they bluff on this. Some dp on heymax chat for churches and I used mine for donation myself.,btohqsg
Yes. Withdraw money on mar 1 for q2 promo for example.,btohqsg
Looks like itâ€™s trial and error.. will try other places.,btohqsg
Understood  thank you  any indication if the Q2 bonus will be better or worseâ€¦? Or should i just load it for the current lunar new year pot?,btohqsg
Was your Dec MAB low/zero? If not  you already missed q1 condition.,btohqsg
Yea i have 2 accounts to alternate  another account never use before  so i can either put in the funds now in new account  lock for 5 months  or wait for Q2 promoâ€¦,btohqsg
In this env  I doubt interest rate will go up.,btohqsg
I will like to purchase PIMCO income fund. What is the lowest cost platform or broker to use? Any recommendations?,btohqsg
Mari Invest Income is offering it. Under maribank app.,btohqsg
What will be the rate like? I saw this in Tiger as well. But not sure of the cost,btohqsg
