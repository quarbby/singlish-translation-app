Still though don‚Äôt you feel that COP will definitely cause parents to feel mad,btohqsg
Tbh EJC is the newest (?) Jc and cop is beyond the government‚Äôs control  it does take time for things to settle,btohqsg
And I assume most wun apply to EJC knowing it houses 3 IP schools  which explains the COP as well,btohqsg
Most other jcs only houses 1-2,btohqsg
My rp only confirm eligible for the last course,btohqsg
But I js apply for those that are like higher,btohqsg

Indeed when SCGS  CHS and SNGS received their first batch of IP students  it was already known that those students would be entering the same JC. It was termed ‚Äúgovernment JC‚Äù at that point because the JC name was not decided yet,btohqsg
If the mix of student background is of concern  a more objective assessment is to look at ratio of number of IP students vs number JAE students and not simply the number of schools feeding the JC?,btohqsg
