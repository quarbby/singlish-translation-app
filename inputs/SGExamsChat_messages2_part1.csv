But you gotta admit though they gave you a useful index of scholarships available,btohqsg
I got shitty A level grades how do you expect me to get that hahaha,btohqsg
At least you dodged a bullet in some sense,btohqsg
I know of someone who's an LTA scholar,btohqsg
If they really treat scholars like shit,btohqsg
He's not gonna take it well lol,btohqsg
Scholars are destined to enter the leagues of the upper management,btohqsg
So they’re different from the regular pawns working there,btohqsg
Only if they stick long enough,btohqsg
Lol his grades must be quite good,btohqsg
Those who want to make more $,btohqsg
I guess it depends on department  but either way I expect your scholar friend to have other gahmen scholar friends then they can compare notes,btohqsg
Isnt the best scholarship an unbonded one,btohqsg
What is this nus bot thing,btohqsg
I though gov scholarships r the worst unless u want work there,btohqsg
A bonded one at least you won’t be stuck in the “got any experience?” Trap,btohqsg
If you don’t want to work anywhere yet  yes. But if you are really passionate about a certain career path then I think it’s great,btohqsg
Bonded scholarship isn't always a bad idea,btohqsg
I wouldnt want work for gov,btohqsg
It practically guarantees you a place to work,btohqsg
After seeing saf scholars in action in army,btohqsg
Even if there's a recession they ain't gonna retrench you after investing tens of thousands into your education,btohqsg
I wont degrade myself to be a gov scholar in saf,btohqsg
Working for Govt upon graduation does not mean working for Govt for life,btohqsg
Nah my dignity worth more than that,btohqsg
I wont comment on other stat boards haha,btohqsg
I suppose you think yourself above them,btohqsg
I didn’t wanna get bonded because I think most of us are still too young to decide for ourselves what we want,btohqsg
There’s a high degree of brain drain in the Civil Service  it shows you how employable those ppl are.,btohqsg
Yea cos i wouldnt work for the saf,btohqsg
So who would you work for,btohqsg
Tbh that's kinda putting down quite a few people,btohqsg
SAF may not be the place for you but it pays decently and stable,btohqsg
He's not the first of his kind  he's not going to be the last.,btohqsg
ok but u rly shldn't say that it's a degrade it's p rude lol,btohqsg
Does he care if he is rude LOL,btohqsg
You can't tell people that they are rude and expect them to change,btohqsg
Tbh sounds like someome tio mono infantry in 3 sir,btohqsg
Very hard to respect saf scholars,btohqsg
I was mono but not infantry hehe,btohqsg
No la  clearly this guy posted HQMINDEF can see all the scholar make big buccs and sit and sleep on their work chairs/s,btohqsg
Do yall know anyone taking philosophy in NUS/NTU atm? Need to ask some simple questions,btohqsg
I think@Hamsomy3is in FASS and might know something,btohqsg

In light of the push towards becoming a smart nation  the government has tasked you to come up with a business plan to innovate in any one of the following sectors: healthcare  transport and environment. Provide a business model that outlines the fundamental problem  and the solutions your proposed business is addressing.,btohqsg
just a question and answer thing,btohqsg

wifi on buses (transport)  portable CPR devices (healthcare)  dustbin that turn plastic into useful tools (environment),btohqsg
