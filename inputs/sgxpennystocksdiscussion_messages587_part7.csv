Not really  the last time UG and MT fly during the Omicron reveal  it does not need RS or TG to lead. TG and RS is more like a cap on how much they could go up or down. To put it simply  if UG need to go up to $0.70  then RS need to go back to $1.30 and above. Their price move in tandem in regards to that.,btohqsg
