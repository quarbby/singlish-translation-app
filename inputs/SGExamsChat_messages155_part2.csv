Tbh i dont think nsfs will give the students much to look forward to lol,btohqsg
Are you saying you didn’t like doing saikang for 2y,btohqsg
There are just too many factors involved that could mean an E at prelims and an A at A levels. Even U --> A is possible.I don't want to judge people based on their grades at prelim. It is so not indicative.,btohqsg
I'm not suggesting that. That's extreme...,btohqsg
What actually are the chances of U to A? Higher than the chance of the student studying?,btohqsg
5 mcq gone in uni means A- and below liao,btohqsg
Non-zero. And if it is non-zero  which it is  then please don't just try to generalise  particularly when the language is coarse.I'm not angry or anything. I in fact enjoy talking to you,btohqsg
My point is  if you want prelims to be an accurate reflection  then don't talk to me  talk to MOEHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
The probability of all the gas molecules in your room suddenly moving to one corner is also non-zero,btohqsg
I know  but you don't need to be part of it or make it even more coarse,btohqsg
But I believe there are far more examples of people getting U --> A. I don't know the exact number  but it is possible,btohqsg
I never said prelims were an accurate reflection,btohqsg
Typically for math and science subjects a jump of 1 grade in the actual exam can be reasonably expected,btohqsg
i jumped 5 grades for o’s,btohqsg
I said 'want... to be'. Otherwise why do students can suddenly get much higher grades in A levels,btohqsg
I'm just telling him to wake up his idea,btohqsg
I know. But in my case  battling depression even to this day  I can fail and get A on different days. Mood swings are horrible. Sometimes I can't bring myself to do an exam while in an exam.That means  I can get U-->A with no extra study,btohqsg
It really depends on the person. The word depressed often doesn't come into your mind. You just feel so terrible,btohqsg
Similarly  A--> U in an instant. Bear in mind how close A and U can be,btohqsg
Why is this a topic of contention,btohqsg
Russian guy just used a slightly harsh way of saying buck up,btohqsg
Well  what I'm saying is that don't generalise. That's it,btohqsg
People get U  E or whatever for all sorts of reasons. Some don't study and get A,btohqsg
Plus he can't even read Russian (or at least from my knowledge he can't read it). He's not Russian,btohqsg
How should I refer to him then?,btohqsg
I thought you can @ him  comrade John? Hahaha,btohqsg
Then I’d have to tag him every time I want to refer to him,btohqsg
Okay  he's the Russian guy then,btohqsg
Depends on how much ur midterm weightage,btohqsg
Better be one shot one kill,btohqsg
15 mark midterm but average score be like 13,btohqsg
You are bringing something entirely different,btohqsg
This username is from very very long ago  before this group was even created  and I haven't bothered to change it yet,btohqsg
What do you mean? I'm just elaborating on this one possibility that someone can get A from U  because I know it first hand,btohqsg
Why have it in Cyrillic then?,btohqsg
because it is cool and very epic,btohqsg
Are we supposed to type Chinese,btohqsg
Also I'm honestly not sure how many people really require or run on grades  because the skill of doing exams is literally only used in doing exams,btohqsg
I was on a global chat group,btohqsg
I am assuming the absence of such issues,btohqsg
Are you expecting me to reply “Yo  are you depressed?”,btohqsg
Can't be superior if it's not GBM,btohqsg
I laugh until I threw my younger sister out of the window,btohqsg
Me laughing as I catch her and elope to a faraway land where we marry and live happily ever after,btohqsg
Disney gonna make this into a movie,btohqsg
bye guys it was a fun 1 month journey in this group,btohqsg
But why have a Russian name when he doesn't know Russian?,btohqsg
I have a Chinese name when I don't know Chinese,btohqsg
I believe he was referring to my telegram name being in Chinese.,btohqsg
Hi can I share a meme here,btohqsg
