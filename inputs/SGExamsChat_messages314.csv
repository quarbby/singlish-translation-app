Hi can I ask if I retake ss/geog and pure bio without tuition  is it possible to improve my grades to an A2,btohqsg
But you needa pay extra for those Cambridge doods,btohqsg
Somemore you need to take bio lab,btohqsg
old men do be charging $80 for a piece of paper,btohqsg
How you gonna get practice for that? I rather you move on,btohqsg
If you meant DAE  it's still possible even if English is E8,btohqsg
But you want to push to a2 for what,btohqsg
Is Ok if there's a change of syllabus this year there will be two choices I can make to retake paper,btohqsg
I heard this year math failing rate is very high..15% e8&f9,btohqsg
1 o level pass 99.8% sia.,btohqsg
They nvr say if math was included uk@alvinmath,btohqsg
Anyways  regardless of your results  we are all very much proud of you  O Level Kiddos!,btohqsg
Dont let some bits of ink from an expensive paper dictate your life. It should be you who dictate your life.,btohqsg
uh guys yk the form A if it says I’m eligible for some poly course but my pts is like no where near the courses they say I’m Eligible for,btohqsg
Yeah.. but uk  it will be difficult for you to get the course,btohqsg
All the courses they say I’m eligible for is like no where near the points I got😭😭,btohqsg
but I mean if jae fails I can appeal to that courses right?,btohqsg
it’s courses like architecture and interior design,btohqsg
I think u will surely get into one of the course,btohqsg
I feel so dumb I got 20💀,btohqsg
Have you looked at the booklet and see what course are available with 20points?,btohqsg
Cuz with 20 still got q alot of courses,btohqsg
But it’s 16 pts in tp,btohqsg
I mean you can try at rp,btohqsg
yeah but I’m restricted cause of emath💀,btohqsg
What course in particular in CIP?,btohqsg
Yeah but it’s my third choice I’m gonna appeal if jae fails,btohqsg
Cuz if u apply jae cannot dae,btohqsg
no cause in the booklet they said after results is jae unsuccessful you can appeal directly to the poly,btohqsg
Anyone here knows abt EEE for rp,btohqsg
So I want to go to ri  but compared to nyjc it is kinda expensive  and I know ri is usually for those who wanna go overseas uni but I'm still not too sold on overseas uni again because  again  money,btohqsg
Like it's not that money is a problem area  it's just that it doesn't feel right spending so much just to go overseas even for the experience,btohqsg
But if I don't go overseas uni after attending ri then going to ri feels wasteful,btohqsg
What do you want to do in the future?,btohqsg
If you got a goal in mind you won't rly bother about the money,btohqsg
Should I go ri or nyjc,btohqsg
You can't choose btwn ri or nyjc?,btohqsg
If u got a course in mind go poly,btohqsg
But I want to go uni?,btohqsg
huh first time im hearing of this,btohqsg
But have you thought about the consequences if you cmi As?,btohqsg
i dont think theres a pressure to go overseas,btohqsg
OK yeah rereading that now looks dumb,btohqsg
Even going to IB doesn't feel like there was pressure to go overseas uni,btohqsg
ya i did IB also never really felt the pressure to go overseas,btohqsg
I don't think I'll cmi As?,btohqsg
even tho alot of my peers did,btohqsg
Then why would u think u would waste money then,btohqsg
i guess i just felt more comfortable staying local at the end,btohqsg
tbf if u can scoree well enough for o's to go ri,btohqsg
a's prob wont be that much harder,btohqsg
not saying it'll never happen but you can always collapse due to competition,btohqsg
Ri is rly good for 2 types of ppl,btohqsg
Suddenly I see the very gaping and dumb hole in my argument LMAO,btohqsg
1. Overseas gunners who are talented2. Nerds who are smart and wanna chill,btohqsg
Yeah that was stupid to think about,btohqsg
3. u want SAF overseas scholarship,btohqsg
I think I'm 1 or 2 ngl,btohqsg
Unis sometimes sponsor u so cost shouldn't be too big of a worry,btohqsg
No leh safos can go anywhere,btohqsg
I saw the RA programme and suddenly got heart eyes LMAO,btohqsg
Among the general cutoff range bah,btohqsg
wasnt there like an article saying how most safos recipients come from ri and a few other schools only,btohqsg
my year Idt got any ri safos,btohqsg
I rmb hwach and nyjc sent some,btohqsg
Ri is hands down best sch in sg for them,btohqsg
Do u like project or exam kinds,btohqsg
Then the people who struggle in ri,btohqsg
Are people who compare too much or ppl who are more dreamy than their capability (there's no nice way to say this yikes),btohqsg
U mean RA? Idk I'm OK with both,btohqsg
the pressure of competition can honestly get q real,btohqsg
idt ill underestimate the prevalence of that,btohqsg
ra very good for overseas apps,btohqsg
The math and science hardcore training one lul,btohqsg
If you go ri just apply for it,btohqsg
I just saw it and thought it looked cool,btohqsg
I grad alr so major regrets not doing those stuff ahahha,btohqsg
I didn't rly feel it tbh I think ri is not a very competitive sch outside the top 100,btohqsg
Anws if you wanna go to ri (for overseas uni or future outcomes) gotta be ready to grind,btohqsg
If not gg to ri doesn't help that much and heading somewhere else for the envt is probably a better call,btohqsg
Since u got 12 choices then just put ri nyjc chem eng n etc lor,btohqsg
Nah. JC is pain. Thou i only can go ri arts haha,btohqsg
But the ppl who are v competitive for oversea programs sort of find jc very doable,btohqsg
I dont hate ny haha. I dislike jc as a whole,btohqsg
I think statistically Raffles will put you at a better stead for scholarships as well if cost is an issue so that's also something to think about! But yes while the individual does matter I think you should speak to Raffles and NYJC seniors to see their thoughts on their respective ECG departments,btohqsg
Statistics doesn't = outcome! Ri is this weird school where your chances of getting stuff is either a lot higher or near zero,btohqsg
I know one guy from there with safos man's q upz,btohqsg
If u have qns abt ny i can try to answer. Thou its gonna be hard to gauge compared to ri for me,btohqsg
Wasn't from RI but was from ACSI and I think the ECG department of your school does matter alot in terms of information readiness and access to opportunities,btohqsg
So regardless of which you eventually choose do find out about whether their ECG dept is good,btohqsg
Ya. The unis come to ri and hwach and prolly acsi to hold admission talks and shit,btohqsg
Japanese uni came to ny for the weebs ok?,btohqsg
yep i remember having a few uni talks and a uni fair during my time in sji,btohqsg
oh yes waseda uni came to sji also HAHA,btohqsg
That one was the one first to be out of slots,btohqsg
Also for eg the good thing about being in a sch w alot alumni in overseas uni is that ecg will usually have mentor-mentee pairings,btohqsg
If u wanna be minister  go RI,btohqsg
I'm not sure if ri does that but maybe I j a bad student LOL,btohqsg
Thou some ministers say lousy sch,btohqsg
or you can just sign up for sgexams' ecg programs,btohqsg
Imo i feel the biggest diff is that RI has IP students and ny doesnt,btohqsg
"Also RI mayy have more access to science comps (you have to go search up tho)? But the thing is that I realise for """"top"""" schs often the reality is that it's really like 20 ppl in the whole sch winning alot of shit for the sch HAHAH",btohqsg
Ppl always say ri offers oppourtunities,btohqsg
THEY never consider who gets said opps,btohqsg
R there a lot of scholars in ri?,btohqsg
Like in acsi there were theoretically alot of math comp opportunities but like no one really went for them  in the math team I was rly like one of two Singaporeans and the other 10 were  frm Vietnamese Indo or China,btohqsg
So I shld assume RI is the same,btohqsg
Our batch the mit admits were not from sg,btohqsg
All the top 100 students are scholars++ lmao,btohqsg
They need 10A1s to enter ri and hc,btohqsg
I mean fking smart scholar kind,btohqsg
We had 2 in my class,btohqsg
They q smart like average aaabb every exam,btohqsg
I thot u said the smart people from overseas,btohqsg
And one ivy but he converted to sg :),btohqsg
Like the mit guys ahThose guys built different,btohqsg
Oversea scholars who are toptop smart like intl oly isef smart are few,btohqsg
But those guys stand at the top of the academic pyramid,btohqsg
Oversea scholars who are j frigging hardworking are more common,btohqsg
I feel it depends on what kind also like there's the smart as in those MIT Physics kind vs smart PSC Oxford PPE kind,btohqsg
Idt we have a honor roll we have some acad award kind of thing and most of them go to local geeneesus,btohqsg
3 kinds of smort imo1 is the ivy student who gets 70 for every exam to clutch the a1 is the uk econ student1 is the mit or uk stem student,btohqsg
I kinda wanna go overseas but not those top uk/us ones haha,btohqsg
I feel if you can afford it thats the best case uh,btohqsg
If u haven't take prelim alr try to score well for it,btohqsg
The uk unis that ain't the top 4(?) Very accepting to singaporeans,btohqsg
meanwhile im too lazy to go overseas,btohqsg
Germany I think just make your German v gd,btohqsg
germany u get free education if u speak german right,btohqsg
And when u grad u can work there,btohqsg
Issit one of their trade schs,btohqsg
Ik they are known particularly for their engi stuff and hands on stuff,btohqsg
Some of their programmes damn interesting,btohqsg
One lets u work and study so when u grad u have 3 years of exp,btohqsg
I have a friend who went there but on MFA scholarship but she studying history,btohqsg
Are u gonna go back to sg after working there,btohqsg
Hmm i wanna work overseas cus i like sg but def not the humidity,btohqsg
literally why i applying overseasg too hot,btohqsg
If they can build air conditioned giant dome around the bloody island  id prob be happier,btohqsg
I think Germany is q solid,btohqsg
Tbh i dont care abt being like the top and all just give me decent living standard im happy haha,btohqsg
i probably will go overseas for postgrad if i ever decide to go,btohqsg
Then i have less pressure for scholarship as well,btohqsg
I think for most ppl it's really the funding issue that's the main problem,btohqsg
I think usa is q generous with funding,btohqsg
Its way cheaper and at the same rank as ucl,btohqsg
Although getting in is a noghtmare,btohqsg
8 in the wrld but rankings not always trustworthy,btohqsg
And fees are like 1k a semester?,btohqsg
U dont need learn german too,btohqsg
idt they have postgrad in what i wanna study tho,btohqsg
Yaaa most places masters in english,btohqsg
cos i studying comms in uni,btohqsg
so postgrad the popular options are like CMU  LSE  university of amsterdam  USC,btohqsg
The only worry is if i come back sg i scared my degree not recognised,btohqsg
Yea but the unis i aiming lower than ntu nus,btohqsg
Tbh if yours is sth like engineering or computing I think your exp matters more,btohqsg
I think if you go to schs like zurich,btohqsg
But if its humanities then yea abit worrying ig,btohqsg
Oh i thinking of econs/biz haha,btohqsg
Got one YouTube channel guy from there,btohqsg
Anyway if i can learn german  i can apply to belgium  switzerland and germany so why not haha,btohqsg
i would go straight to japan if they had any sort of competitive postgrad programs but they dont,btohqsg
Better to have the options open to u,btohqsg
Yea its q unconventional so nervous,btohqsg
Ask your sch ecg on what the German unis look out for,btohqsg
Bruh they dont even know unis there are free,btohqsg
I can go look at them once my uni cycle over,btohqsg
I want to get away from the heat,btohqsg
Fk columbia asking for 2000 words,btohqsg
I think if econs and biz then might as well stay in SG over Aus,btohqsg
so he recommends u move to a country where every living thing is trying to kill you,btohqsg
Isnt foreign work experience imp for biz haha,btohqsg
Cus he pr there so he biased,btohqsg
I think its more that aus unis aren't that prestigious in sg? Idk,btohqsg
i mean some of the better aus unis are not bad,btohqsg
but imo if can go local then just go local over aus,btohqsg
Yeaa there's that impression but I think if you market yourself I think it shld be okay (?) Another thing to consider is how much of biz is intertwined with tech rn,btohqsg
Tbh if people from malaysian unis can get hired in sg  i think a citizen with a foreign degree stands a good chance too,btohqsg
Which is why our local unis are shilling this intersection between biz and computing so much,btohqsg
But ofc if u wna stay aus long term then ofc getting a degree there is the best,btohqsg
im sick of that term being thrown around HAHA,btohqsg
It's not just a sg thing,btohqsg
Yea its best to study in the country u wanna live,btohqsg
Every uni throws that shit arnd,btohqsg
But i might wanna get pr in another countru,btohqsg
ok cyall gonna go japan bb,btohqsg
But I do think one huge benefit of our local unis is the cost and how they're p generous w unbonded scholarship,btohqsg
I alw hear horror stories from US about the debt crisis and stuff,btohqsg
I think debt to go uni is rly no joke,btohqsg
studying now ah but honestly no course in japan really interests me for uni,btohqsg
Some overseas uni are free so i still debating,btohqsg
i plan to do student exchange tho,btohqsg
Unless there's specific requirements to hit,btohqsg
Well u need to know tue langauge,btohqsg
"tbh sg is just ""score well for as""",btohqsg
And well i have 2 years of national privilege before then,btohqsg
if all else fails  sign on,btohqsg
Ns good to buff apps.... if you play the pes game,btohqsg
don't you want to have a career filled with adventure,btohqsg
ya these 2 years i feel my life just hit a stasis lol,btohqsg
hello as a div hq personnel i am offended,btohqsg
Mine not keng ah but I had to do eye operation half way for some shit then auto down pes to E,btohqsg
When my turn come help me pls,btohqsg
I thought the lower sides more saikang,btohqsg
Im planning to rent my room during ns,btohqsg
ya but generally div hq q nice ah,btohqsg
i get stayout and i was on alternate day wfh the past 7 months,btohqsg
all that and i did nothing with my life,btohqsg
If you're lucky enough with pes you can even throw tgt a usa t30 app just from your time in ns,btohqsg
Yea time to rent out my room,btohqsg
I mean depends whether u have conditions ah,btohqsg
If you got nth then uh,btohqsg
faking it is always harder then having it legit,btohqsg
If i do that plus the time im in uni  i can pay off the living cost already and more,btohqsg
I think keng is actl quite hard,btohqsg
and MOs are q used to seeing chao keng ppl,btohqsg
Unless u say depression and stuff,btohqsg
they can tell who keng who legit,btohqsg
If i say put the rifle in my mouth and threaten suicide will i pes down,btohqsg
But idk whether this one got further ramifications,btohqsg
Yes but you may go to DB because that is disobedience of orders,btohqsg
uh they send u IMH lor,btohqsg
Yeah my office got alot of ppl like that ah,btohqsg
i got legit general anxiety disorder i almost went to imh i had to beg the MO to not send me there,btohqsg
Well at least im paid 600 dollars :/,btohqsg
But aiya I think go in then try to have fun as far as possible first,btohqsg
I went through combat BMT before Down pes,btohqsg
just hope u end up in a good place,btohqsg
my bmt was terrible but my voc course was fun,btohqsg
fun in the sense i do one time have fun and never again,btohqsg
firing gpmg and m203 was the highlights hands down,btohqsg
If your section is nice and cool it really helps,btohqsg
i dont think many people have chance to fire machine gun and explosives,btohqsg
And if you not like mono intake,btohqsg
And if you get welfare company,btohqsg
Bmt is usually more fun than unit life,btohqsg
nope LOL as i said it was a do one time and never again thing,btohqsg
the shagness is part of the exp in unit u kena numb until dunno what,btohqsg
I think your section really makes a huge difference,btohqsg
but u go the chiong sua one have fun,btohqsg
Like the individual people that are with you,btohqsg
You just go read the NS reddit,btohqsg
The only thing u can control is your pes and even that one cannot rly control that much,btohqsg
Actually uk whats another gd reason of working overseas? No need reservist haha,btohqsg
just become clerk and don't promote to CPL can alr,btohqsg
I think ns is an exercise of learning how to roll w life,btohqsg
I'd have kept my nice pes status if you knew thay,btohqsg
Clerks in general rarely get called up,btohqsg
ya if u ord as PTE/LCP vv unlikely u get reservist,btohqsg
usually if they have to call up clerks,btohqsg
i half wanted armee scholarship then,btohqsg
cuz i saw the gaurav guy talk,btohqsg
Yea now i rmb why i was looking to study overseas. To escape reservist,btohqsg
Like that's the reason why I didn't down pes earlier,btohqsg
then i go into ns and realize ahahahhaha no but too late liao,btohqsg
If u get army scholarship dont u have to continie ur privlege for 5 more years,btohqsg
my OC in my previous unit before i downpes serve his NS as E9 then he uppes after ord and sign on,btohqsg
The point of army scholarship is to become gennerel I feel and then transition outside thay,btohqsg
i have a portrait of umbrage man in camp,btohqsg
No ah I feel like if you do it for that reason you'll legit hate your life,btohqsg
Because nonetheless you're spending 20 years at least in the army still,btohqsg
I mean hes the model army scholar is he not?,btohqsg
Like not the sole motivation la,btohqsg
But smth to keep in mind,btohqsg
but end up still a clown,btohqsg
I thot army suppose to make u mature?,btohqsg
Dude u know the best thing is,btohqsg
He was heading NOL when it crashed then when it was acquired,btohqsg
Then suddenly it made profit in the following year,btohqsg
Some logistics or shipping MNC acquired it,btohqsg
I thought that one had some extenuating circumstances,btohqsg
Make it as inefficient as ns,btohqsg
imagine thinking gennerels can ceo sth they have little subj domain exp in,btohqsg
I mean.... idk man but ok maybe one time is unlucky ah but now w SPH also..,btohqsg
wait hold up does the time of submission of your jae form affect your chances of getting in like first come first serve that type of deal,btohqsg
U can put it off to the very last min if u want,btohqsg
thats my plan but i think my mom was fearmongering me bcs her friends’ children all submit alr,btohqsg
Anyway i think u can change after u submit,btohqsg
Not too sure can someome pls correct?,btohqsg
Its been a year so not too clear abt it,btohqsg
My brother went into army and became EVEN MORE autistic,btohqsg
Even the most trivial matter will annoy him,btohqsg
HELLO it's so late but if anyone sees this  can you please send me the syllabus for this year's o levels? yes i'm retaking!,btohqsg
hello i was wondering if anyone knows a person in sji? i’m q sure that i want to apply but have a few questions,btohqsg
i was from sji  graduated in 2019  can msg me ba ill see how i can help,btohqsg
but ib syllabus has changed q abit since i grad so acads wise i cant answer everything,btohqsg
yoo personally for me in an ib sch its like every year people say the syllabus change,btohqsg
point is the alumni wont be very very accurate,btohqsg
and yea at least for clb ik that the syllabus change sm like fewer topics etc,btohqsg
in my year past year papers from like2013/2014were still quite relevant,btohqsg
only after i graduated they made some significant changes to a few subjects,btohqsg
of course the main topics are still in,btohqsg
yeah depends per subject but even the ones that change the most don't change every year,btohqsg
probably like once every 3-4 years,btohqsg
bruh every year since i was sec one people been saying ib chinese B change,btohqsg
ok u see the thing right about ib chinese B,btohqsg
is that its basically lower sec chinese standard,btohqsg
math also change from 2 years ago,btohqsg
oh but they added in LC recently i heard,btohqsg
ya they took out cuz covid,btohqsg
well lets just say that ibo has been clowning a little these past 2 years,btohqsg
this year maybe got LC in that case im screwed,btohqsg
given that its ibo im frankly not surprised if by july they suddenly say oh we have LC now,btohqsg
idt they want to extend the absence of LC anymore,btohqsg
the syllabus changes as of late took away alot of the fun acads stuff imo,btohqsg
sciences and econs no more paper 3 which is the free marks paper,btohqsg
EL&L they took away the fun coursework,btohqsg
my year i did like a presentation in texting linguistics,btohqsg
another one was like analysing some donald trump satire thingy,btohqsg
my submitted coursework was an article about twitch emotes,btohqsg
i think now only HL L&L got coursework,btohqsg
they called it WA in my day,btohqsg
IA was for econs  sciences  math and a few others,btohqsg
yeah the terminology abit wack LOL,btohqsg
the only skill i really took away was how to bullshit,btohqsg
because you write so much that at some point you have to start bullshitting your way through to finish the essay,btohqsg
tok  ee  langlit  IAs all can,btohqsg
that's why i want to take BM,btohqsg
econs is kinda memorize how econs works go exam and vomit everything out,btohqsg
sji didnt have BM so i dont know much about it,btohqsg
I wonder what’s the d rate for el,btohqsg
el was tough for our batch,btohqsg
my friends all came out of the exam hall swearing lolol,btohqsg
guys if i retake o then i can still apply eae right?,btohqsg
my teacher said have to check with the poly courses if they accept o retake so idk what to do also,btohqsg
Hi   I’m interested in cjc but everyone on Reddit seems to hate the sci department there … anyone from cj in here who had a good experience and good RP (80+)  .. could you share your thoughts.,btohqsg
bc a lot of people who I’m talking to or even the Reddit posts say jpjc sci > cjc sci,btohqsg
Yes still can but if u got an offer this yr then you need to call sch to double check,btohqsg
u want extra terrestrial also have@imindomie,btohqsg
i'll send u to space la,btohqsg
u can be the next guy to go mars,btohqsg
@IcedMilomeow mi don't nid mtl right,btohqsg
this one not sure eh soz,btohqsg
but u can always call the sch to ask,btohqsg
but if u failed mt u need to take basic mt,btohqsg
Cuz my kohai  didn't turn up for mtl cuz mc,btohqsg
Then dk if can go mi,btohqsg
Pretty sure its a requirement for all jcs/mi,btohqsg
If you never sit for the paper,btohqsg
Do they just count it as f9,btohqsg
Hmm...maybe im misinformed  but yeah as rachel said  no harm calling the school,btohqsg
So if they just count it as f9,btohqsg
They will just make him/her take basic mt,btohqsg
imagine if someone sick and vr their chinese,btohqsg
take clb like a funny joke ah,btohqsg
Stats wise  each batch has 10-20% of students scoring >80rp with majority of them coming from the arts stream. Do note that proportion of science students is significantly higher at least 4-5x as compared to the proportion of arts students,btohqsg
As much as we like to hate on cj  its also the students' fault for not prioritising their studies first,btohqsg
Right so in ur opinion does cj live up to its reputation as in all the Reddit posts or is it better than that ? Esp it’s sci department.,btohqsg
So what do they prioritise? Hm,btohqsg
While reddit does exaggerate on alot of points  there is some merit behind it i suppose,btohqsg
Ofc it has too be true to some extent but considering the student is ready to work hard are the Teachers willing to help … I’m rmber seeing a post where they claimed that their teacher often grey ticked them and wouldn’t reply to ever help. There were a lot of problems such as biased dsa towards ignite students or even girls.,btohqsg
I understand that every school has its problems but cj seems to have q a few more problems than other jcs,btohqsg
Overall would you recommend cj to someone who wants to go to the sci stream. Possibly PCMe ?,btohqsg
or do u think another school would be a better choice ? :),btohqsg
Is it the nearest to ur house?,btohqsg
not rlly but there’s a direct bus frm my house to either cj or jpjc which are my two options rn so distance isn’t a problem,btohqsg
Tm/asr/jp are better choices esepcially science stream. Cj has underperformed in the alvls compared to the jcs mentioned  even for jp with a higher COP yes,btohqsg
so jp sci > cj sci ?,btohqsg
Asr would be better for phy i suppose,btohqsg
i don’t meet the cut off fr asr too bad n tm is too far fr me,btohqsg
so it’s either jp sci or cj sci fr me 😢,btohqsg
anyone got eae to rp  electrical & electronics engineering?,btohqsg
R u nearer to jp than to cj?,btohqsg
I am from np if u need any advice u can dm me :),btohqsg
was the pee meme nee ann or np,btohqsg
I would say it’s decent but don’t bet on np for food choices,btohqsg
I barely eat in school anyway,btohqsg
How is the walk up the hill ?,btohqsg
Not that far I’m from business my school is the closest,btohqsg
22  English A1  which ngl I'm happy with considering I had to cram and self teach 4 yrs worth of education in 10 mnths,btohqsg
I remember taking shuttle bus inside sp,btohqsg
My friend takes like  15 minutes to walk frm his block to the enterance,btohqsg
Thanks :D All hail EAE for saving my ass,btohqsg
Im in my final semester liao HAHA,btohqsg
The Iggy people meets each other,btohqsg
Guys y’all think I can get in😣😣,btohqsg
If it's like the the cut off then can,btohqsg
You think I can get in?,btohqsg
I dunno if first 2 can but I know last 3 shud be able to,btohqsg
hii uh can dae aft jae?,btohqsg
is anyone here in hlfm in np :),btohqsg
or like sch of DE in general,btohqsg
Hello yk dae phase 2 is it for those who couldn’t go through JAE?,btohqsg
Hi can I ask whether there is a change of syllabus in this year's Os subjects,btohqsg
They say they will accept a net aggregate of 11,btohqsg
net aggregate is net gross aggregate - cca pts,btohqsg
Is “aggregate” 12 and “net-aggregate” 10?,btohqsg
Oh so they just did not include right? I though they forgot or something,btohqsg
U can check the private candidate web uh,btohqsg
actl I not too sure  never seen this before  you can calculate ur L1R5 on your own then - 2,btohqsg
But if you are taking POA or A math,btohqsg
Then it will be the new syllabus,btohqsg
It's for those who didn't get the course via JAE (it's up to the best of my knowledge),btohqsg
Can someone confirm “net aggregate” is the 12-2=10 and what they show “aggregate” is not they think is 14-2=12?,btohqsg
u cannot calculate ur own l1r5 meh,btohqsg
But I scared the system think is 14-2=12,btohqsg
my bad this one i can't help you  but you wait for other O level candidates to reply you bah if theirs is the same haha,btohqsg
If got problem I need to call them up,btohqsg
Opp but right  the aggregate there should be before minusing CCA :>,btohqsg
because those are considered under bonus points,btohqsg
hi guys can submit both dae and jae? or only can one process,btohqsg
hi guys asking for a friend but  does anyone know if a raw score of 21 can enter YIJC with its cut off point of 20 even with -2?,btohqsg
is there any point in appealing if so?,btohqsg
If anyone is exploring DAE  feel free to drop me a text!,btohqsg
R u not going to MI,btohqsg
eh guys for bcme  should i go acjc or njc? i live much closer to ac tho (30 mins difference travel time one way) but i heard cme depts in njc are very good,btohqsg
Any guy here in SMU ?,btohqsg
yooo thankyou for this link  helped me out alot,btohqsg
Just passed by BTT today. Anyone knows how come my BTT records are not reflected in my SSDC account ?,btohqsg
If you passed BTT go to traffic police website go apply for your pdl,btohqsg
And when I apply my PDL…using ENets than they say payment failed,btohqsg
Oh the traffic police website fucked,btohqsg
Have to try a few times,btohqsg
It took me like 5 tries to get it to work,btohqsg
Try 2 times and have to wait for 30minutes haiz,btohqsg
Iirc paying by credit / Debit card is faster,btohqsg
I didn't bother with tge 30 min nonsense,btohqsg
i second this just try aft 5min or smth,btohqsg
Wah shit I tried 5 times applying the PDL and still cannot work,btohqsg
hi my raw score is 15 but after -2 is 13is the raw score of 15 considered first or  13 when moe is allocating a course for me,btohqsg
ooooo are you going to poly or jc?,btohqsg
i got results last yr HAHAHA,btohqsg
Hey guys  just clarifying is the person who submit the quickest going to have a priority over the last person?,btohqsg
Thats not how it works right,btohqsg
No as long as u submit on time  it makes no diff. They consider ur nett score  then citizenship and then raw,btohqsg
I don't think I've experienced such an episode of anxiety and pfessure since O levels,btohqsg
O I thought it was raw first. Is it not? :0,btohqsg
Keep trying until u get it,btohqsg
Poly isn't stressful if your aim is 1.0 CGPA/j,btohqsg
no wonder i never see u stress before,btohqsg
My gpa can buy chicken rice ok,btohqsg
I'm going into poly soon and I rly want to be that perfect gpa kid :'),btohqsg
It's possible but v hard lor,btohqsg
is spamming tys a valid study method for olvls,btohqsg
spamming and reviewing  most likely yes :),btohqsg
ok will do that thanks so much,btohqsg
From my experience  yes :') spamming is like daily life for a lot of Os students apparently,btohqsg
"if you wanna do well for like school exams can spam sch exams papers too + prep for some ""tougher"" style qns",btohqsg
spam tys usually ppl do like nearing Os :>,btohqsg
so i spam diff things at diff times,btohqsg
i guess... anyways tys quite fast can finish if you hardworking,btohqsg
can probs finish in like a few wks,btohqsg
Alternatively  can do the topical tys now  then yearly one nearing Os,btohqsg
yeah i was planning on doing topical tys first cos my yearly one havent arrive yet,btohqsg
but for now i just relying on my notes,btohqsg
go ahead  as long as your reviewing your content and practicing  that's basically how most students study anyways :>,btohqsg
yo  is geog/ss considered 1 or 2 subjects (exam-wise),btohqsg
Ngee Ann mass comm graduate here. Message me if you want comments on the course or connection with lecturers and students in MPP  FSV and MCM.NUS NTU Mathematics and Philosophy students  message me if you're free. I'm looking into your course :p,btohqsg
Happens maybe once every half a decade,btohqsg
Depends on what you want. 4.0 in an examless  project heavy course is statisticlly impossible. Plus  your mental health and industry experience is more vaulable than an abitrary grading result.,btohqsg
Ah damn. What's the equivalent of A in GPA points? I'm trying to set a realistic goal for myself sry for all the questions :'),btohqsg
The full grading scheme and GPA formula can be found at your respective polytechnic websites,btohqsg
Is it possible to write a school with cut off 2 points below my net?,btohqsg
chance V low right? Any incidence might cause them go up,btohqsg
but still i would say almost impossible,btohqsg
even if it goes up its far more likely go up by 1 point than 2,btohqsg
no chance for acjc cop to drop right 😭,btohqsg
i mean like instead of 8 nett it becomes 7 nett,btohqsg
8 pointer but have an incident,btohqsg
