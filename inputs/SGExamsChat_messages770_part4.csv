I put chs first but no news still,btohqsg
When others with lower rp alr got,btohqsg
Chem is a common degree programme in chs right,btohqsg
that means bedok got either high 70s or low 80s,btohqsg
For courses with no interviews  if you are above a certain percentile of applicants  u will automatically get it,btohqsg
Is it you have to declare major and you select chem,btohqsg
But they dun necessarily go in rank point order to offer if I’m seeing it correctly,btohqsg
I think it could be because I stupidly didn’t declare my preferred major,btohqsg
I wanted to do Econs as 1st degree and polsci as 2nd but didn’t realise I should’ve just wrote Econs,btohqsg
I feel so stupid now Hais,btohqsg
Erm unlikely to be the case coz most ppl under that system only declare after at least 1-2 sem,btohqsg
Hearsay those who don’t tend to get their offers later,btohqsg
If common degree shouldn’t be too hard,btohqsg
So they start with the common curriculum first?,btohqsg
Yes so now chs y1 and 2 has got some pre-allocated common modules spanning both science and arts…even if u declared whatever btw,btohqsg
It kinda replaces the older ‘general elective’ sort of modules,btohqsg
Ah ok I thought both the modules under the courses I declared and the common curriculum runs simultaneously,btohqsg
Not something like the first 2 semesters common curriculum only,btohqsg
But it is not really a common curriculum  o guess what people do is to take some time to do modules towards the major u want / most likely  the rest can be considered under unrestricted electives,btohqsg
I shall send this again the day of the a level Econs paper,btohqsg
Oh so it’s like you can choose any modules first without declaring what major you want?,btohqsg
That’s like very flexible isn’t it,btohqsg
phys the only gd thing is mcq,btohqsg
U actually have up to 2y to declare lol,btohqsg
I think it is meant to be? And u get to plan ur curriculum as well,btohqsg
wah if econs got mcq i want sia,btohqsg
So if I’m wishy washy or indecisive  I have lots of time I guess,btohqsg
Last year Econs had mcq for Singapore a levels was 2006 lol,btohqsg
I do not understand the question,btohqsg
Oh if it’s Econs should be A,btohqsg
I’m happy I did not take h2 phy coz I wun survive the practical,btohqsg
Seeing how my chem practical gg,btohqsg
My prelims would have lost an A if my theory was not 92% lol,btohqsg
I got D for chem practical  my cher no reaction,btohqsg
This sounds like someone in my class too,btohqsg
I really do not understand these people,btohqsg
Everyone has access to everyone’s grades,btohqsg
I can't tell if you're holding a grudge or what bro,btohqsg
"it's like u going "" once upon a time"" like kuro",btohqsg
I actually top my class in 3/4 subjects consistently but this dude chose my chem to be salty about,btohqsg
The funniest thing in my class was this same dude  she said if she is my mother  she will be pissed with me…when the cg chair ask me write teacher day card and I said wait coz I was doing some revision,btohqsg
Mine is the contents (chem  math  phy and sometimes econs)  I dun have energy to deal with GP,btohqsg
Bruh then the whole class witnessed us fighting,btohqsg
This was before the cher walked in  else my reputation will be ruined,btohqsg
The only violent thing I did was to snatch my notes back,btohqsg
wah shout back at teacher not bad ah,btohqsg
No no  it was my classmate,btohqsg
This one is a ticket to detention already,btohqsg
got ppl piss in class before bruh,btohqsg
cuz her fren jealous of her results mah so both of thwm fight in class,btohqsg
