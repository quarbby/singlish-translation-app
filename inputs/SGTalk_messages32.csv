Just another reminder that vaccines do NOT prevent u frm getting the virus  but it does prevent  somewhat  from deaths or severe symptoms. Efficacy  as always advertised  is UPTO 95%  but doesn't mean it's always at 95%. 5%  in the medical world  is quite a huge risk still. Plus  read on. Deaths or no deaths  article still supports the vaccine though. It just reminds everyone that the vaccine ISN'T a full on tank against the vaccine  more like some infantry that may  or may not  ward off the virus  because in the end  and this is the most important part  the vaccine only TEACHES your immune system to fight. The fight is done by YOUR immune system  not the vaccine.,btohqsg
The problem now is vaccine breakthrought. 4 115 fully vaccinated are hospitalized or died!,btohqsg
Your math fail? 4115 out of how many millions vaccinated?,btohqsg
Dun bother la bro.. ppl believe what they want to believe.U can confront them with all the facts n data n they will still think tt the data is wrong.,btohqsg

Is this sh talk similar to the one that was close recently,btohqsg
The news reported yesterday was very bad.  According to OYK’s answer to reporters  they can collect about 100 KTV customers from TT data and contact tracking. Among them  43 cluster cases were announced (not including early cases)  so those who were tracked  50% positive rate.  If 20 Vietnamese women entertain 4 people per night  from June 29th to Jul 14th  there are 80 people per night  which is about 16 days  so the number of contacts may be 1 280.  The positive Covid among them can be predicted to be 640 (50%)  and then if the secondary infection is 2 cases per patient  we will add 1280 cases  plus the primary cases  we expect that there will eventually be 1920 to 2000 cases.  It's best to stay at home obediently for the next 28 days and do not roam around unnecessarily.  ( fwd),btohqsg

Agreed . SPA is next target 🎯. This 2 industries KTV and SPA are closely link in culture . They tend to cluster nearby each other .,btohqsg
*LATEST COVID MEASURES  - WHOSE FAULT??*1. KTVs abusing pivot to F&BGovernment tried to help everyone under the ACRA classification of Nightclubs  Bars  KTVs to pivot.These outlets were all forced to close since April 2020.As long as you fall under this classification  you could pivot and build a kitchen (even apply for grant if they qualify) and allowed to continue operations. It’s a streamlined way of offering help  so people can get help fast.Some people abused it  pretended to serve food  but operated vice instead.Police try to close them  but it’s hard when people are determined to play cat and mouse.The vast majority of law abiding operators I am sure are grateful for the help.Now everyone has to close.2. Vietnamese coming in on sponsored social social visit pass.Since April 2020 many couples have been separated by border closures.It’s already hard enough for legally married couples.It’s even harder for people in long term serious relationships who are not married.The Government exercised compassion and allowed Singaporeans to sponsor their unmarried partners in.Some people abused it  but how to check?How do you force people to prove that their relationship is bona fide?We give the benefit of the doubt. But some abuse it.Now it’s all cancelled.MORAL OF STORY : Government tries to help. People abuse it. This is not a loophole.Stop blaming the Government.Stop blaming foreigners.Blame the people who abuse privileges and aid  who cause problems for all of us.This is a pandemic  situation is in flux worldwide.Stop complaining.Most of us are trying our best.Thank you.,btohqsg
Totally agree. So true! Thanks for putting it out!,btohqsg

*President Xi Jing Peng of China said:*As a small child   I was very *selfish*  always grabbing the best for myself.Slowly  everyone left me and I had no friends. I *didn’t think* it was my fault and I criticized others.But my father gave me 3 sentences to *help* me in life.One day  my father cooked 2 bowls of noodles and  put them on the table. One had an egg on top while the other bowl had none on top.Then he asked me to choose a bowl of noodles.Because eggs were hard to come by those days  I chose the bowl with egg!I was congratulating myself on my wise choice/decision and decided to wallop the egg. To my surprise  I saw that my father's bowl of noodles had *two* eggs at the bottom beneath the noodles!With much regret  I scolded myself for being too hasty in my decision.My father smiled and *taught* me to remember that  *what your eyes see may not be true*.He added that  *If you make a habit of taking advantage of people  you will end up losing*.The next day  my father again cooked 2 bowls of noodles: one bowl with an egg on top and the other bowl with no egg on top.Again  he asked to choose the bowl I wanted.This time  I felt smarter so I chose the bowl without any egg on top.Hmmmmmm to my surprise  there was not even a single egg at the bottom of the bowl!Again  my father smiled and said to me  *My child  you must not always rely on experiences because sometimes  life can cheat you or play tricks on you*.Never be too annoyed or sad  with situations  *just treat experience as learning a lesson that  cannot be gotten  from any  textbooks*.The third day  my father again cooked 2 bowls of noodles   one bowl with an egg on top and the other with no egg on top.He asked me to choose the bowl I wanted.But  this time  I told my father  *Dad  you choose first. You are the head of the family and you contribute the most to the family*.My father was very happy and he chose for me.He chose the bowl with one egg on top. But as I ate my bowl of noodles  to my surprise  there were *two* eggs at the bottom of the bowl.My father smiled at me with love in his eyes. He said  *my child  you must remember that when you think for the good of others  good things will always naturally happen to you*.I always remember these 3 sentences of my father.Xi Jing Peng_As we continue on the journey of life  think for the good of others. Put others first and your joy will be complete._Thanks 🙏.,btohqsg

Comments from Ho Ching:Yah  we can joke about hosts and hostesses.But seriously  folks  instead of blaming others  let’s hold the mirror to ourselves.When the familial lane was open before March this year  Vietnam was a low incidence country.So folks who came in on whatever pass have been in Sg for a while.If any one of the visitors have covid  they are likely to have caught the virus from someone among us.Don’t demonise others.The Delta virus is highly infectious.The pandemic this year is not the same as the pandemic last year.We know Delta is much more infectious.It may also transmit faster and more efficiently as an aerosol  compared to last year.They could come in via arrivals  or they could come in via fishing vessels delivering their daily catch.And they could hop  skip and jump to anyone anywhere.All it takes is one super spreader to seed a huge cluster and cause a large community outbreak with the potential to overwhelm.So don’t demonise folks who get infected.Just focus on lessons learnt.One important lesson:Don’t bar hopDon’t doctor hopDon’t socialise intensively.If we wish to eat with others  don’t just eat with different groups every day just bcos the rules don’t forbid it.Keep a separation of at least a week between events or groups  better still keep a 2 week separation or even a three week interval.Do so until daily unlinked cases drop below 1~2 daily  and the linked but unquarantined cases drop below 5 daily.Don’t play play  bcos this can kill many innocent folks.Yah  we can throw a tantrum and get upset about sudden changes in rules.But the virus doesn’t care about our tantrums.If we cannot work together to eat and play safely in these 2~3 weeks  we will be whacked like any other country which had gone through desperation and despair when hospitals are overwhelmed.The virus doesn’t care whom we try to blame or demonise.They just do their hop  skip  and jump to light fires faster than we can immunise our folks.So get out of our pampered tantrums and whining blame game.Hunker down and be serious in protecting each other and helping each other.,btohqsg

Yup have go for the inspection test and its been passed. But i heard the fine will come in a week time.,btohqsg
I heard - forced you change to origin exhaust…. than go inspection than certified. ( some joker will change it back again lol 😂) hide and seek . Anyway   you did not ask the model your bought is approved by LTA ? Some vendor went to get LTA approval before selling to consumers.,btohqsg
There is another way - get your MP write for you . They have a team trained to write template letters to different agencies,btohqsg
I just said im not sure abt the pipe and muffler lol like i dont know abt the pipe market sizes be it loud or no sound at all,btohqsg
Then the LTA guy escorted me to STA,btohqsg
I see. Normally I will ask for LTA certificate approval stamp .,btohqsg
But he never ask me any documentation,btohqsg
Wah 😩. Sorry to hear that .,btohqsg
They Cisco trained to see which model .,btohqsg
Just say to me BOSS UR PIPE IS LOUD I NEED TO ESCORT U TO STA.. got letter stated wrong size muffler and tyre size,btohqsg
The LTA guy took photo of my muffler and tyre only,btohqsg
And reach LTA get inspection letter only,btohqsg
Did you buy this bike from second hand buyer !,btohqsg
That is why i say i dont know,btohqsg
But i did change the muffler tho bcoz my legal one is damage so temporary use other muffler which i dont knw that is illegal,btohqsg
Pls keep the purchase receipt or photo bike  in the shop … proof you bought it due ignorance.,btohqsg
Just get MP do the job for you . Must be a PR or Sporean see MP,btohqsg
Do write that show you are honest - planning to change later . It might help .,btohqsg
Years ago I kn call to LTA fir interview . Video looking at me like as if I in a CID case . I was honest to tell them by problem.,btohqsg
Act 1 scene 1 - do show them photo and receipt - story flow correctly .,btohqsg
I heard ppl from housing estate also can complain this issue then LTA gv letter to ur house come for inspection,btohqsg
Wah piang all this i get to know frm others at STA just now,btohqsg

You uds but you still tried to punish him for it isn't it?,btohqsg
"Theres no ""what if"" cuz it didnt happen",btohqsg

Tell the French this is a ROMANTIC activity  and tell the Germans this is the LAW. Tell the Japanese this is an ORDER  and everyone will be sorted out.”The stewardess remembered the flight had some passengers from India and Singapore too. “What about them”  she asked.The captain laughed. “Easy. Just tell the Indians this activity is FREE.”Can i convince the Pakistanis ???Yes dear  just whisper  ""This is a suicide mission""“And what about the Singaporeans?”  she persisted.The captain  taking a deep breath  patiently explained -“You need not tell the SIngaporeans anything  my dear.

I had waited for a while with the librarian  ayoung attractive single girl  then one thing led to another and I ended up sleeping with her”. The man stoppedtalking but kept weeping.""Well don't cry  it's a sin but it is not that bad. You shouldsay 5 Hail Marys and it will be forgiven”. Said the priest.“But it doesn't end there” the man kept sobbing. ""a fewdays later my elderly neighbor asked me to help her withher computer. Her husband was hospitalized and shecouldn't send an email to her son. I went there and fixedthe problem  but when I was about to leave  rain startedpouring down. It was really stormy and I had to wait. Onething led to another and I ended up sleeping with the oldlady"" the man cried.""Oh dear well that makes it harder indeed  but still - youshould say 15 Hail Marys and you will be forgiven"" Saidthe priest.""Oh I'm afraid the worst part is still ahead"" cried the man.""Yesterday I went to the barber. I was his last client thatday. As soon as he finished and was about to close theshop rain started pouring down so intensely  I had towait with him. One thing led to another and I ended upsleeping with him as well"" the man cried.“Oh dear  it is indeed worse than I thought” said the priest.""So what should I do father?"" the man asked.""Well” answered the priest  “you should get the fuck outof here before it starts raining!"".",btohqsg
