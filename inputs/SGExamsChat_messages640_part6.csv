maybe thatâ€™s why. not saying u bad or anything but sasmo is the lowest tier of math olympiad,btohqsg
Idk wht the other one is called,btohqsg
Attendance not equal to u did well,btohqsg
what i heard is sasmo is catered to top 40% of national cohort,btohqsg
when he was taking O Level most people probably just stop studying after secondary school yet he still cannot make it and still dare to make this comment ðŸ¤¯,btohqsg
Uk ejc doesn't change the aptitude test for fmath,btohqsg
People raging cuz they got 6 and never go ejc,btohqsg
ejc cop sci 6  art 7,btohqsg
Oh bruh then where u go,btohqsg
Even though they accepted another 100 more students compared to last yr,btohqsg
Ejc all the while cop q low,btohqsg
bruh cjc sci dropped to 12,btohqsg
Yeah but they accepting more students,btohqsg
last year is ejc is art 8  sci 6,btohqsg
my sec 2 classmate smart went combine sci to aim for ejc,btohqsg
Oooh that's gd to hear?Â¿ Lmao,btohqsg
Like between my batch and the current j2 batch,btohqsg
You can't take FM here btw,btohqsg
how op get the data lol,btohqsg
Only other jcs allow for that,btohqsg
cant be the reddit comments right,btohqsg
TJC remains the sch with the best value add,btohqsg
Wait idg why is NYJC arts 6 or isit just all loopholers,btohqsg
i was the one who compile the table last year by literally calling every jc lol,btohqsg
One of the worst in SG,btohqsg
maybe i will do the same this year cos today i boliao also,btohqsg
I just hear they don't do well for a levels,btohqsg
I would like to check the O level score needed to enter NUS Computer Science.,btohqsg
Or they have high distinction rates cuz low student profile,btohqsg
that one based on a level rp la,btohqsg
altho i think if u go in by poly  o level a math got min grade iirc?,btohqsg
ok just checked  if go in by poly dip  min B3 for a math,btohqsg
I know a friend with a O level score of 20-38  but no Diploma or A level cert,btohqsg
She's currently in NUS Computer Science  with a GPA of more than 4.91,btohqsg
Ye I think NY had the highest distinction rate in sg for geog in 2022 but that's cuz they had like 20 students,btohqsg
what is 20-38? he took singapore o level?,btohqsg
As in her O-level score is 29  with a standard deviation of 9,btohqsg
what since when o-level score got std dev,btohqsg
Since never  but every time she tells us her score it changes,btohqsg
If she's in a bad mood it's 38  but 20 if she's happy,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s strange  I thought JC intakes were supposed to fall after the 2018 intake when the mergers occured (which is also part of the reason why COPs rose significantly in 2018  and have fallen since 2018). I guess maybe after ejc moved into the new campus they found that they can accommodate more students.,btohqsg
But they took in more to kinda balance it out,btohqsg
The additional intake in one school is smaller than the cut in overall vacancies islandwide after the merger happened,btohqsg
Oh ok  the sch must be quite crowded after they let more of them in then,btohqsg
Smth smth we supposed to have similar capacity as RI and HCI,btohqsg
Itâ€™s probably just that ejâ€™s case is an exception,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think any other schs wouldâ€™ve increased their intake since 2018,btohqsg
I think TJâ€™s intake might have shrunk because their holding site is smaller than their previous site. But their intake may increase again after they shift back to Bedok South,btohqsg
Oh yeah  tpjc campus should be smaller than former tjc since tpjc was originally built for just JC1 and 2s,btohqsg
