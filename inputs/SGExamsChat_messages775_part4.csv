Im alr pressing the EJ cher,btohqsg
at most I just tell my student to scan everything and send me,btohqsg
Maybe I’ll just send the syllabus doc and circle that part,btohqsg
Ask if she can send me the notes where that part is covered,btohqsg
@whatisgrassdo yall have this part in the notesBecause of the mutually exclusive nature of sustainable development (as exemplified in the concept of trade-offs)  it raises a salient point that sustainable development can never be fully achieved → Sustainable development has to be seen more of a process rather than an end state  no society can ever be fully sustainable  but countries can be more sustainable than others and can continue to work towards being sustainable.,btohqsg
i need see what to remove,btohqsg
Ok ya she said can’t cos of copyright reasons,btohqsg
Okay I will create my own notes,btohqsg
and it will be better than all the schools,btohqsg
I will get a 100% distinction rate for H1 Geog (I only have one student and shes already getting A),btohqsg
6 people were taken to hospital after a 6-vehicle accident on PIE last evening (Apr. 22).➡️https://bit.ly/4b7kwqeFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
Why are some people blaming the white car and the motorcycle in this video?,btohqsg
yes indeed speculation and assumptions..nobody will ever know how absurb the saab driver would have reacted had he struck or not struck the white car..but given this scenario  no matter what angle you look at it from. the chance of the saab speeding away never ever decreases,btohqsg
"The fact it never decreases means something has to have made that a definitive increase or stagnantation with the game of probability. That ""something"" was the GLC's whether intentional or not strike of the saab",btohqsg
That's why the GLC is being blamed,btohqsg
In the future you can become a full time moe geog Cher liao,btohqsg
So is that in ejc notes or that was what you wrote,btohqsg
whoever blame the motorcycle need to get their brain checked lol.,btohqsg
motorcycle too poor to afford better car. If he had better car then people wont die/s,btohqsg
i saw there was a post from the white GLC driver on SGExams but i think deleted,btohqsg
isnt that what most people think,btohqsg
thats what my parents told me ystd,btohqsg
They thought my malay friends were giving me drugs or smth,btohqsg
and thwats why i didnt go home for 3 nights,btohqsg
Oh yea btw this one was another news that came and went,btohqsg
Oh I thought that was for that portion from the new syllabus that you were confused about,btohqsg
Hopefully your other Cher gets back to you I guess,btohqsg
Like you intend to go back to teach so I don’t see why they shouldn’t send,btohqsg
"they roped me in to ""mentor a J2"" externally for free through some mentorship programme",btohqsg
but they dont give me the resources to mentor,btohqsg
I think if you complain they’ll take action,btohqsg
There was a faster accident but not as quick as the Ferrari vs taxi that caused a death as well,btohqsg
I can't find it on reddit ah but this was SS from a friend's story,btohqsg

But not teaching SUD when thats the focus of the whole thig,btohqsg
Now i need to think should i even teach sud,btohqsg
it got taken down  dunno why the person go post on sge tho,btohqsg
cuz it would help? But its not explicitly tested,btohqsg
Most likely he tried to post on sg reddit but post was taken down,btohqsg
Ya it’s not an expressway  no need to keep left unless overtaking I think,btohqsg
If motorcycle wants to turn right or sth he can always stay on the right line,btohqsg
