we have to be..if we aren't then..what can we offer to the world?,btohqsg
No but unironically hes probably like,btohqsg
we cant just be a country that constantly seeks donations from other more wealthy countries can we?,btohqsg
q valid enough to have this opinion,btohqsg
eh fair enuff but wldnt more competition for resources further raise the cost of living,btohqsg
like its q hard to doubt his professional expertise and skills in urban planning if he says its possible its like 70% chance possible,btohqsg
he just has no weight in influencing gov opinion,btohqsg
raising the cost of living is a byproduct of societal progression,btohqsg
you dont want to accept that reality...then you are living in delusion,btohqsg
yes it's possible to increase to 10m  but is that what the govt wants?,btohqsg
humans already progressed even more than we give humans credit for...we made self sustaining electricity...appliances that have a shelf life for 100 years 40-50 years ago,btohqsg
its sustainable alright..that goes without saying. its just who is going to be part of that sustainable bubble? the rich or everybody,btohqsg
omg very reliable news source the independent 👍,btohqsg
its the second most reliable news source,btohqsg
bruh the figure 40%- singapore- foreign is literally heavily quoted everywhere,btohqsg
the only other news source that is in competition with the independent,btohqsg
"""Singapore's most reliable satire news source: we uphold the highest standards of journalism""",btohqsg
idk if i should go pick on the difference between 40% and 45% but whatever,btohqsg

kuro how does it feel to be in the 40%,btohqsg
i honestly dk what point who's trying to make,btohqsg
my pr fren wants to live in us for sum reason,btohqsg
do you not know how math works?,btohqsg
Sir  economic and workforce restructuring is never painless. But  we have to do what is necessary.We are certainly in better shape today. In the past three years  manpower growth has slowed from an average of 4% to 1%  while productivity gain has grown from 0.4% previously to an average of 1.8% over the past three years.Having transformed from 4+0.4=4.4 in 2012 to 2014  to 1+1.8=2.8 in 2015 to 2017  we are now much closer to our future growth strategy of 1+2=3.Sir  1+2=3 is not a rigid formula for future growth. It is a framework to remind us of the need to become more manpower lean and more productive  if we want out future growth to be more sustainable.,btohqsg
he was from bangladesh then his dad had to either stay in sg or saudi for work n his dad choose sg,btohqsg
i need to figure out a computational implementation of my calculations,btohqsg
i never said we are not in better shape or anything regarding that matter,btohqsg
im an econs student and i approve of this 1+2=3 growth strategy 👍👍👍,btohqsg
I mean... our current foundations in modern day physics is based on mathematical analysis of empirical observational data,btohqsg
most of it flew over my head. i approve👍👍👍,btohqsg
i js realised none of my classmates have my insta except for one mf i blocked back in 2021,btohqsg
Bro this is a direct quote from Lim Swee Say's 2018 COP speech.,btohqsg
yea but i still have the acc,btohqsg
which is inactive since mar 2023,btohqsg
fyi  prs dont make up 6 million,btohqsg

anyways all these politics is not my ally...i just wanted to share whatever info i have,btohqsg
wtf at first i thought this is some copypasta from some parliamentary debate or smth 😂,btohqsg
Just saying technically is a mix of maths too to ensure the validity of experimental data,btohqsg
"ah no shit..you think im going to migrate to a country that lies in my face that i have ""free healthcare""..then proceed to take that money or even more i would have spent on healthcare by way of taxes?",btohqsg
It is lmao just search up quick maths by Lim Swee Say,btohqsg
i was replying to another person caused they ask about what birth rates and its implications..and basically im telling them that..birth rates dont matter to singapore for the most part,btohqsg
i learn smth new today 😂,btohqsg
all the incentives for birthrates in sg is just small money talkto show ppl the govt is not fully ignoring the prob,btohqsg
Today  the Singapore workforce of 3.4 million is made up of 2.3 million locals (2/3 of total workforce) and 1.1 million foreigners (1/3 of total workforce). 2/3 local + 1/3 foreign = 1 Singapore Workforce.With slower manpower growth into the future we need to maximise the potential of our 2/3 local  1/3 foreign so that together  we can maximise the potential of our Total Singapore Workforce. We must strive for 2/3 + 1/3 not just = 1  but > 1.,btohqsg
cause some ppl still believe the govt actually cares that the birth rate could be a issue,btohqsg
yea and they gonna start increasing the retirement age?,btohqsg
U do know that the retirement age raise is beneficial to us rite?,btohqsg
is it? i rmb france riotted over increase in retirement age,btohqsg
