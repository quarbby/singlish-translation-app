We meet at Hive outside 2026 Convocation,btohqsg
i mean mine kinda depends on my prof feeling iâ€™m ready to defend,btohqsg
Go to your defense dress in chain mail armour and wield a sword,btohqsg
doesn't matter. What matters it survives 10 hours of battery life without charging. lol,btohqsg
the nightmare of waiting a laptop to charge.,btohqsg
You tell me the defense depends on the prof????,btohqsg
Only Thinkpads were the best options for Engineers. back then. Swappable batteries. why they get rid of them,btohqsg
I thought it was just a date,btohqsg
i mean standard is 4 years like thatâ€™s how long my scholarship is valid for but,btohqsg
if i take an intern leave its technically extended and yet i could work on my research simultaneously if i wanted to,btohqsg
so then my grad would be either same year as you or one year after,btohqsg
Or are u on track right now,btohqsg
also defending in april vs july would change the convocation year,btohqsg
i need to discuss with my prof about the intern thing but iâ€™m planning to still grad the same year,btohqsg
he says i just need one more project done,btohqsg
Wyatt don't leave me to grad alone in 2026 convocation,btohqsg
our sessions wouldn't even be the same,btohqsg
Doesn't matter i will wait for you for hours if needed,btohqsg
I will do the same for u too bitch so graduate with me 2026 Convocation,btohqsg

Sure thing i am in NTU then for FYP bb,btohqsg
and ah gong is giving out money this month,btohqsg
guess where it'll all go to,btohqsg
do you know where to find the document that states this?,btohqsg
damn i was digging for you,btohqsg
mostly due to some random university senate policy?,btohqsg
or just a final Pass or Fail results?,btohqsg
just by your company saying pass or fail?,btohqsg
Pass/fail for those matriculating before ay 2023,btohqsg
For those in ay 2023 and onwards  is letter based,btohqsg
would rather Pass/Fail ones. because some company work culture is toxic lol,btohqsg
especially those who like to abuse interns lol.,btohqsg
Hmmm this one should be admin info ba. I know of this because I precheck and personally had my admin soundness check my study plan one,btohqsg
I contacted my CAO admin wayyy before my intern to confirm and liase one,btohqsg
U can try to shoot em an email and ask or there are information sessions,btohqsg
I basically murdered them by asking why they did not approve me doing intern in y2.,btohqsg
Cus by right is done in y3,btohqsg
But i brought forward in y2.,btohqsg
Oh I am even worse... I did it in Y1..,btohqsg
