Ohh shit means I need retrofit bigger ones,btohqsg
Just buy clips one lor if the cost is too high,btohqsg
I never see a need to use them so I never install  don’t ask me about it haha,btohqsg
Dont need just double-tape the paddle shit extender,btohqsg
I sometimes use it cus need upgear or downgear fast,btohqsg
Then Now hor some cars de stick up is up gear some is down is upgear,btohqsg
Haha bro  you drive dsg then you will know,btohqsg

There are many enthusiastic  bro.. Indeed it is not my car..,btohqsg
Only for the rich  the wear and tear gonna burn a huge hole,btohqsg
Not really  but if I intended to drive long... Why not..,btohqsg
pay so much to make a slow car ‘quick’ to their standards only for it to be unreliable 😂😂,btohqsg

Simply well deserve for a troll like you,btohqsg
Maybe you should change your character then no one will insult you  take a look at everyone else  anyone insult them?,btohqsg

Alot stopped to ask if I was okay,btohqsg

Nah I can't drive auto. There is an incident that I drove and felt asleep behind the wheel of a Prius in US. No more auto car for me.,btohqsg

The Infiniti Q50 is skyline lo 😂🤣,btohqsg
Every car is a manual if you just flick the shifter to the left,btohqsg
I wanna be this level of rich,btohqsg
I will stick to paddling kekekek,btohqsg
Very weird to send like that but you do you,btohqsg
Paddling + MRT is faster than driving to my work place near bugis.,btohqsg
Like iron man color scheme leh gold and red,btohqsg
Oh ya.. I saw somewhere they show this,btohqsg
Hahahahaha. Mercedes engine .. funny one,btohqsg
While it is cool... still inside is a GTR leh.Somehow I still think European super cars can retain value better,btohqsg
You would think reliable cars can retain value better but noooo,btohqsg
For sure lo.. I seen a GT2RS before at bugis,btohqsg
But then again GTR still kept its price high after all this years mah,btohqsg
Classic Beetles and Mini hold their value very well despite being an everyday car.,btohqsg
Was the corolla back in the 60s days,btohqsg
Mini not so much now bah,btohqsg
Either that or minis are getting cheaper,btohqsg
No lor SCM mini asking more money than beetle lol,btohqsg
mini being Mr bean's mini  not Bini ah,btohqsg
RX7 infiniti ah fast sia that one,btohqsg
Isn’t infiniti the luxury brand of Nissan?,btohqsg
I rarely see if nowadays leh,btohqsg
But QX80 honestly looks quite nice,btohqsg
Singapore rarely have those big SUV one  looks like VIP,btohqsg
So most stick to cayenne  x7  GLS etc.,btohqsg
Polestar 2 yea  I did consider but ended up not going for it because EV,btohqsg
I liked those type of SUV ever since I saw the Ford Everest in camp,btohqsg
Technically can charge at BlueSG lot at my house haha,btohqsg
But then you dare to leave your car beside BlueSG driver?,btohqsg
All the Koyak driver will scratch your car tryna park,btohqsg
I already kena once bumper gone,btohqsg
Like that A4  A6 also close,btohqsg
lol back then in the 1980s cars also look similar isn't it,btohqsg
I’ve never seen irl la but you don’t feel the body looks same same meh,btohqsg

Ooof okay when you put it in numbers yea got gap,btohqsg
Cannot go into airport carpark also,btohqsg
You go lowest height on the air sus,btohqsg
I still can't tlll whats the diff with Velfire and Alphard,btohqsg
Hehe the jewel that thing floating bar thing ah,btohqsg
My car go high speed can touch sia  scary sht,btohqsg
Jewel is still 2.0/2.1 I think but the bar not correct place cause there got bump also,btohqsg
Just take left lane if your car high or you aren't gonna slow down to under 30kmh,btohqsg
Yea ever since that incident I totally avoid jewel,btohqsg
There's a reason the speed limit in that lane 40,btohqsg
But now my A4 can imagine la  cuz got spaceship sound,btohqsg
You just need to slow down or use left lane,btohqsg
Now the best looking one in my opinion is  Kia carnival leh,btohqsg
With Toyota Vellfire  you’ll find a 3L  16 cylinders engine under the hood that produces 167 horsepowers. On the other hand  Toyota Alphard houses a 4L  24 valves  and 6 cylinders engine that can produce an excellent 276 horsepower. As far as performance is concerned  the latter is definitely a winner.,btohqsg
This one taken in vietnam district 1,btohqsg
new kona looks like robocop car,btohqsg
Palisade and telluride selling very well in north American market,btohqsg
Sadly not the same traction in Singapore,btohqsg

Even if upbadge  his car is already something to brag about,btohqsg
Even Z4 body shape also not so sexy,btohqsg
That's why no need to upbadge what,btohqsg
I will still upbadge my car if one day I buy my A7 kekeke,btohqsg

Who was the one that asked about this,btohqsg
I don’t like TT and coupe R8 design  abit roundish,btohqsg

No Tucson is for cool kidz,btohqsg
You know why is uncle car anot  because old already,btohqsg
If you buy MX5 then is not uncle car,btohqsg
the newer one damn cool bro,btohqsg
I personally love older cars anyways,btohqsg
An mx-5 is much lesser of an uncle car,btohqsg
i'm thinking of selling alr kns,btohqsg
Me love any car as long as cool tech is there,btohqsg
I cannot deal with the new tech 🤣🤣 that time I rented a C180 from getgo,btohqsg
When you bought it you committed to having impracticality for a sexy nice ride,btohqsg
sell first then go test drive ba,btohqsg
It's all about getting used to it,btohqsg
I’ll stick to just simple things HAHA i am not a technology guy at all,btohqsg
GetGo now a lot of nice ride Sia now you mention,btohqsg
@Chinese_spy_balloonwho the guy that was telling me his golf today ah,btohqsg
i found out Get-Go is owned by the dealer that i bought my car from,btohqsg
the salesman say oh  the boss son started get-go  then now they own LCR,btohqsg
They have A5 and 5 Series  now driving them like not very satki alr,btohqsg
But most of them broken or off the app soon because people don't know how to drive,btohqsg
For this coe  it is cheap lah,btohqsg
U minus the coe  it is cheap… compare to when coe was lower,btohqsg
no wonder so c0cky at times,btohqsg
Then you see how they got good control over COE,btohqsg
Just FYI did you notice Motor-East inside the office got LCR counter LOL,btohqsg
They started by taking ssangyongs that were unsold for getgo,btohqsg
Then buy cars they were getting for LCR,btohqsg
Then they pickup from the used car side,btohqsg
I mean if I rent a sports car I’ll whack one mah,btohqsg
Got one rental coy very yuck one  rent out Porsche but set speed limit,btohqsg
Fair but the entry point on getgo too low,btohqsg
And people don't realize the excess,btohqsg
End of the day they don’t earn from rental etc,btohqsg
last time they offer me 180 leh,btohqsg
I used to know the people who started Shariot  they told me they earn money from people who bang up their car and also those that kena accident,btohqsg
I dun rent cars cus u scratch abit,btohqsg
If u cant afford a car  u cant afford the excess. Honestly,btohqsg
Not true  if GetGo they have the excess waiver so it’s not as badOutside rental also have CDW for long term rental,btohqsg
Just so you know  if you buy CDW renting outside long term  your first waiver is $200 excess  then $500 and so on,btohqsg
But everyday you pay like $2,btohqsg
I rented car before for grab  you don’t declare of even if you didn’t daamage it  they will find something to eat your depo,btohqsg
Nowadays if I type something long I make sure I copy first before sending,btohqsg
I very lucky never kena anything like that before,btohqsg
You need to be careful with what you rent,btohqsg
I rent short term or a few days if car in the shop,btohqsg

Prestige rental co.s work on very different sop,btohqsg
I mean sometimes i see the damage,btohqsg
Then Idk why they keep running red lights,btohqsg
Wa okay back to my statement,btohqsg
If u cant afford X per Min  u are better off taking public tpt,btohqsg
Sometimes renting BlueSG more expensive than grab,btohqsg
Idk man some people are cheap,btohqsg
That’s why they rent BlueSG mah,btohqsg
Cry papa cry mama for help zz,btohqsg
Own up to ur own mistakes,btohqsg
Most driver have the mentality that they won’t,btohqsg
And when it happens then too late,btohqsg
If u messed up just say so. Dont spread ur story online then whole world laughing at u,btohqsg
Haha but they want sympathy mah,btohqsg
Maybe get kickstarter money or smt,btohqsg
i dun sympathise. when u rent  u agree to the  TNC alr,btohqsg
