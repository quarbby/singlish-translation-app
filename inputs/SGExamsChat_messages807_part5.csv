And with T5 in the horizon  it's going to play an even bigger role in our economy.,btohqsg
Ngl but cabin crew is prob the golden job at airports,btohqsg
Freight followers idk if that what you call them have the best job in aviation,btohqsg
Nah  the tech bros working on ops research probably have the highest pay packets :),btohqsg
I'm a tech guy  so probably not.,btohqsg
Basically someone that is employed to follow freight in the belly of a aircraft from one country to another  something like logistics but you have to bring you passport 24/7 but every trip pays in thousands,btohqsg
Ah  like a loadmaster in the air force but better paid,btohqsg
Heard one of my father's friend  he said that no matter what she was doing  she had to fly then and there within 1hr,btohqsg
She could be having dinner with friends or family  she had to leave Singapore within 1hr+,btohqsg
Follow expensive cargo across the world  she quit after 5 yrs. Sounds like a literally dream,btohqsg
But the reason why it's so lucrative is because you can't be hired through any agency or website or even as a job,btohqsg
It's a word of mouth adhoc job,btohqsg
Then it's not something musician is looking for  she probably wants something non-adhoc,btohqsg
Would i look stupid if i grad fr pharma and go into working for singapore airlines or cag,btohqsg
No  you won't be the only one,btohqsg
True but yes just saying that,btohqsg
Coz tbh i got interested in aviation industry aft i started travelling again post-covid,btohqsg
Better get a pharma degree and work for them straight away rather than wasting time in pharma for a few years and end up working for them in a entry level job anyway in 5 years,btohqsg
Got people doctorade become sec school teacher,btohqsg
There's like so many different jobs u gotta be specific.,btohqsg
Again  most pharma people in SG quit pharma,btohqsg
I got a friend in pharma now  he's trying to venture out to other parts of the industry like radiology,btohqsg
A lot of ppl just say eh I wanna go into this industry but like what kind? For example finance got the analyst  executive or sales,btohqsg
So it is btr to start entry level elsewhere  rather than do pharma then quit and need to start entry level again,btohqsg
Tbh i kinda like customer service,btohqsg
But idk if it is paying well,btohqsg
Ngl this incline and the fact you said air stewardess makes me believe you want to do something related to interaction within the airline industry,btohqsg
The fact you also want to eventually overcome your social anxiety gives this probability even more weight,btohqsg
Im not gonna not believe that coz i experienced it,btohqsg
Any customer or client facing job u have to be ready to get fucked/harassed daily cuz it's part of the job,btohqsg
But somehow i like to be in the frontline,btohqsg
Yea and needing to know how to face unreasonable customers,btohqsg
When you getting your pilot license,btohqsg
Just basically taking it in and saying sir I understand how you feel,btohqsg
Or you can be the flight engineer,btohqsg
Actually i ever thought of becoming an air stewardess,btohqsg
But too bad i dun qualify,btohqsg
I think Alot of girls do,btohqsg
Most flight schools have a height requirement for ATPL,btohqsg
I mean idk what to say,btohqsg
Like I think air stewardess is one of those jobs that most girls yearn to get,btohqsg
So sadly that is not sth in my choices now,btohqsg
Oh is it  i tot it is just meðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Paid to travel the world even if it's for a few short hrs or days at a time,btohqsg
Overseas airlines accept 1.57m for female pilots though,btohqsg
Look at how many applications for stewardess compared to steward you know alr,btohqsg
You can always work for SIA in management trainee or similar roles,btohqsg
ANA steward is not even on their planes  they deployed as ground staffðŸ’€,btohqsg
It's ok  maybe can be flight engineer ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Flight engineer is no longer a thing after fly-by-wire,btohqsg
