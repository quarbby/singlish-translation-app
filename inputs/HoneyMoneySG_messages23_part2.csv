Hello  Honey Money Fam! I heard from a friend that he transferred all his savings into Trust Bank App and he is getting about $80 returns from the app every month based on his $60k savings. My question is... is this the best app to get returns monthly?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anybody knows why I'm not able to use my SC smart card overseas? It failed in Vietnam and now Thailand. Extremely frustrating and a little embarrassing. Card is activated and I have more than enough available limit.,btohqsg
What did your bank say regarding the declined transactions?,btohqsg
Seems like your friend is just earning the base 1.5% rate. SIF GoSavers account has a base rate of 2.5% for first $100k.,btohqsg
Say if I only have 5k to save  will you suggest that I go with Trust Bank then?,btohqsg
If u are a salaried worker  wouldn't going to any of the mainstream banks be way better now? E.g. Uob one and ocbc 360,btohqsg
I would suggest GoSavers as long as you can maintain at least $1000 in the account,btohqsg
i will go with trust bank  and with 5 tx/ or ntuc member u get up to 2.5%vsother local banks that require u to have salary crediting + credit card spending + insurance + home loan + investment etc etc etc,btohqsg
assuming you're not willing to jump through any hoops to earn higher interest,btohqsg

I placed wz RHB 4.1% already. Singapore Deposits Insurance Corporation insured up to S$75k.(1) Apply online for a Savings Account first (2) then Apply for the F.D.The whole process took approx 2 hours.All notifications via email.,btohqsg
is it a safe one to park the money ?,btohqsg
I donâ€™t know ðŸ˜‚I relied on the SDIC insurance up to $75k,btohqsg
It is not easy to get a licence to operate a bank. Should be safe,btohqsg
The sdic insurance is only up to 75k per acc holder for SGD deposit. If you are concern of bank collapse  don't go beyond 75k. If you are concern on FD rates will still increase  then can think of short term FD. Of course interest rate can go the other way. Preferably funds in fd should not be funds that you will need it readily.,btohqsg
