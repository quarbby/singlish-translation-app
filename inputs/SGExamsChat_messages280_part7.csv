Oh my  I was hoping Kanye would take Drake's September 3 bait for CLB.,btohqsg
It's okay  Kid  cry now laugh later!,btohqsg
Im pretty sure CLB would flop like his other albums,btohqsg
"In my opinion  his worst albums are his debut  views & Scorpion. He keeps saying how it's going to be like views - ""underated and hated until later"".",btohqsg
It's okay  Kid  you got this!,btohqsg

JIK was not a good album  I did not feel that Jesus' gospel was preached even if it was christian album.,btohqsg
@raznflameI seriously think Kanye could have released it as 2 separate albums,btohqsg
The initial release date was sometime last year but he siked us,btohqsg
Nah  the whole theme is in sync,btohqsg
Whole album is 108 minsCDs can only fit 80 minsDouble disc makes sense,btohqsg
It is  I am not denying that but it sure feels that Kanye is stream trolling us with that amount of tracks with some of them being practical interludes,btohqsg
The first half is more rap based and heavy,btohqsg
The second half is more Kim & love related,btohqsg
It can be a double album and they both sync well,btohqsg
Its like the outkast speakerboxx/the love below,btohqsg
That is as old as me,btohqsg
You do know that the album (The Love below) is technically incomplete  right?,btohqsg
With hey ya  it didnt need to be completef,btohqsg
