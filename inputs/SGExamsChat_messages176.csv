not the o level ppr ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬,btohqsg
I think is easy to do well?,btohqsg
actually no   almost 50% get A for H2 math,btohqsg
But definitely there will be A1 ppl who struggle h2 math,btohqsg
When people say H2 Maths is hard  they mean school exam is hard,btohqsg
A levels is not hard to get A,btohqsg
I had friends who got A1 for o level englishBut couldnt even pass A lvl english (known as H1 General Paper),btohqsg
So o levels doesnt rly determine how u will fare for a lvls  but it serves as an indicator,btohqsg
i didnt go jc so cant relate,btohqsg
but i see jc ppl in poly sooo,btohqsg
ik transfer course can la but,btohqsg
prolly me if i get posted to kc,btohqsg
If u go chem/phy in uni from a lvls as a BCME student,btohqsg
Be ready to get spanked by physics students,btohqsg
if transfer poly i wonder what they use,btohqsg
i mean some of them r nice,btohqsg
my cher said people get at least 7 for AQ to secure A tho,btohqsg
ye ik its not rlly abt ppl,btohqsg
I nvr trusted my gp tutor,btohqsg
but like if i went jc,btohqsg
Even while i was doing my actual a lvl paper,btohqsg
my pp2 is the one that carries,btohqsg
:/Mine's 34And cos he didnt wanna give me an A for GP,btohqsg
i didnt know how i pass oâ€™s,btohqsg
ur in science so im guessing u did quite well?,btohqsg
My actual a lvl i also didnt even use any atas vocab for english,btohqsg
I was the test subject  and it worked out,btohqsg
thats why my summary keep getting L LOLOLOLOL,btohqsg
"My most cheem word used was ""instantaneous""",btohqsg
Is just how well u can concise ur points in as little words as possible,btohqsg
but eh business means i need to count humanities,btohqsg
P2 carried me hard for gp,btohqsg

my aq always spam singapore is a prgamatic society HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Aq no need so zai one,btohqsg
i thought u were my schmate for a sec,btohqsg
Yeah Jay headed straight for poly after A levels,btohqsg
oh how was ur exp with leila and hamid,btohqsg
If u enter math as a major,btohqsg
I make sure ima take the same calculus mod as u on the same bell curve,btohqsg
but i got the qn right,btohqsg
What if I enter maths as a captain,btohqsg
I want to hit them with the du du du du du,btohqsg
i rmb the fish stonks qns,btohqsg
2019 paper harder than this yr's,btohqsg
If u are LTC i'm LG,btohqsg
How was YOUR experience with them,btohqsg

U all found pure chem o lvl easy?,btohqsg
Nylon shld be org chem what,btohqsg
up to prelims i got f9,btohqsg
If yes  hess law is basically vectors in h2 math,btohqsg
I enjoy watching students suffer every year,btohqsg
It was easier than 2018 databased,btohqsg
2.33 with the dot at 3 can?,btohqsg
This year emath BOTH PAPER 1 AND 2 have vectors,btohqsg
cant wait for some long qn asking me for shortest distance from point a to pi 1,btohqsg
Lol i got vector qns which i guarantee u cant solve at all,btohqsg
We didnt hv to do it,btohqsg
The paper 1 vectors q meant to be killer q,btohqsg
its probably some big brain dot product inside a cross product?,btohqsg
I rmb the qn said 2 dp,btohqsg
i think emath is ez js dont be careless,btohqsg
Ur emath A1 so shld be p good,btohqsg
my sec sch horrors have arrived,btohqsg
there was 1 rijc paper vectors combined with differentiation,btohqsg
guys gonna pop by for a random question that my friend asked,btohqsg
how long does a o level cert/result last for?,btohqsg
Considering ur results are stored in singpass,btohqsg
as in can you use the grades anytime you want?,btohqsg
U can view it for life,btohqsg
5year later want apply for poly/ite can meh,btohqsg
I can literally find my grades even if i lose my certs,btohqsg
ill be satisfied solving the first 2 parts,btohqsg
my oâ€™s chinese results forever haunt me in singpass,btohqsg

All this work just to calculate entropy,btohqsg
It will help u a long way,btohqsg
LOL shes gonna go chem in uni?,btohqsg
U wont see this in y1s1 chem,btohqsg
U will only see it in y1s2,btohqsg
That way of drawing benzene is for babies,btohqsg
But if u decide to go to chem in uni,btohqsg
Most poly ppl are gettin rekted hard on the bell curve,btohqsg
no like as a module this sem,btohqsg
My chem o teacher fking slack,btohqsg
My physics content is also a module,btohqsg
Then he ace his ntu chem,btohqsg
Now the proff ask him to work with him,btohqsg
If they do above average is fine,btohqsg
organic chemistry is fun but confusing,btohqsg
But quite some of the poly ppl i know are doin lower than average,btohqsg
i dont like the way the lesson package is,btohqsg
So they are gettin punished by the bell curve,btohqsg
i still have further chem 1&2 next year,btohqsg
i say its year one sem 2,btohqsg
But good to see some1 tryin for chem in uni,btohqsg
If u want easier studyin life  NTU,btohqsg
watch me take some bio related course,btohqsg
I know my senior also went to sp,btohqsg
Lookin forward to see u wash test tubes when u graduate,btohqsg
is h3 bio gonna be useless,btohqsg
Why i stayed away from bio courses in uni,btohqsg
ntu molecular bio to be exact,btohqsg
If u keen in research and int in bio  it helps,btohqsg
If u are outstanding in ur course,btohqsg
But i saw the course modules,btohqsg
U will definitely get ur dream/ideal jobs,btohqsg
Like the sec sch i was in now,btohqsg
Telegram meets an actual chem bell curve now,btohqsg
washing test tubes seems so weird LOL,btohqsg
how much can the moderation thingy affect our marks,btohqsg
i doubt w perf and cos sci i can go to uni,btohqsg
btw is it worrying if i find born haber cycle difficult LOL,btohqsg
Just like how someone in SP nutrition went to NUS Med,btohqsg
At the start yes  aft a while no,btohqsg
I taught students who cant even draw for 2 wks,btohqsg
Do yall have like anything el British lc to listen to???,btohqsg
im confident to get a rejection letter,btohqsg
I learnt born haber cycle and it was quite ok in chem olympiad,btohqsg
Is like a 90 rp straight A course for A lvl students pharm sci,btohqsg
Need to get my ear to be comfortable with that accent,btohqsg
Pharm sci NUS course is basically as hard as entering NUS Med  just that theres no interview,btohqsg
All the h2 stuff came in,btohqsg
I learnt all the way till quantum chem,btohqsg
thats why im confident i wont get in,btohqsg
I saw a page filled by a 100 carbon organic compound,btohqsg
And they asked me to count number of chiral centres,btohqsg
There was like 46 u sadist,btohqsg
There is also first order second order,btohqsg
easy one once u get the hang of it,btohqsg
Aiyo if u all want learn a lvl chem stuff for free,btohqsg
i regret not gg to jc honestly,btohqsg
Just ask here or in a lvl grp  its free,btohqsg
But fak someone stole my A+ :(,btohqsg
I want to go jc pursue chem,btohqsg
My percentile is droppin a bit,btohqsg
As nice as my current toxic students,btohqsg
And like planes at the same time,btohqsg
my snr in aero engin in sp,btohqsg
i also regret not gg jc,btohqsg
Btw aero is overrated as a course with bright prospects,btohqsg
My cca also youth flying club,btohqsg
Bright prospects is banking and finance,btohqsg
No need for so much aero engineers,btohqsg
theres no real diff between aero and mech in terms of prospects,btohqsg
I not going to be pilot now,btohqsg
i also cant go v good jcs also,btohqsg
and im tired of taking gambles,btohqsg
Doesnt mean need go good jc to do well for a lvls,btohqsg
I took a gamble to go jc,btohqsg
aviation as a civilian career aint coming back any time soon,btohqsg
but im not smart even to begin w,btohqsg
Aish scare to see what lies in my future,btohqsg
the gamble is risky as FUCK,btohqsg
i alr fuming for various reasons,btohqsg
Psps i saw the nett aft that,btohqsg

I mean if turn back time,btohqsg
Content is harder  but academics wise is less stressful,btohqsg
im not looking to take aâ€™s or go jc i rather stay in poly and uk,btohqsg
Poly is a test of consistency for 3 yrs straight,btohqsg
I got 24 for l1r5 for sec 3 eoy,btohqsg
its alrd looking v bleak for me,btohqsg
if i push it hard enough the max i can get is 3.8 by the end,btohqsg

Y1 still can pull up one,btohqsg
LOL im not psycho-ing ppl to join,btohqsg
I think got ppl in my course gonna drop out aft this sem,btohqsg
but like idk i js gotta give up w pharm sci ig,btohqsg
