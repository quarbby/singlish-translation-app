seems to be the common area ppl struggle with,btohqsg
o i thought it was js me,btohqsg
idk when i hear ppl struggle w physics it tends to be the electricity and magnetism side,btohqsg
I feel like it would be better if it was taught in sec 3 and nt this yr,btohqsg
Because chapters like dynamics is p easy to understand,btohqsg
If magnetism and electricity is brought forward then students can grasp knowledge earlier and knowledge frm sec 2 wont fade,btohqsg
hmm but it makes sense to cover all the newtonian stuff early,btohqsg
can we plagarise some paragraphs for argumentative / discussive essay for o’s,btohqsg

only difference between griffiths and jacksons is one your integrals are sane the other they are piecewise functions with discontinuities at specific points,btohqsg
sounds like a job for mathematica,btohqsg
ngl some integrals in jacksons are,btohqsg
??  idk if they are even well defined man,btohqsg
i think mathematica does struggle with some of them,btohqsg
then it’s a perfect representation of my research anyway,btohqsg
