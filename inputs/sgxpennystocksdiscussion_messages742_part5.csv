China Scraps Major Zero Covid MeasuresA statement from China’s State Council on Wednesday revealed the broadest shift away from Zero-Covid policies by scrapping key restrictions on a national level for the first time  including:▪️QR Codes binned: entry to all but a select few types of venues will no longer require proof of vaccinations status▪️Home Quarantine: those with mild or no symptoms will not be forced into government quarantine facilities▪️Lockdown Limits: closing down districts will only be allowed in “high-risk” areas  and lifted after five days of no new casesDomestic travel will also no longer require proof of vaccination or negative test result  while schools will be encouraged to resume offline teaching if they’ve had no outbreak.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
Brits Urged To Heat Specific Rooms As Cold Snap ArrivesUK homeowners struggling with energy crisis costs have been advised to only heat specific rooms to survive sub-zero temperatures  wear several layers of thicker clothing and have “plenty of hot food and drinks.”Overnight temperatures in England could drop to -3°C  and as low as -10°C in Scotland  after a level-three cold weather alert - only used to signify severe health risks - was announced in the UK.Authorities fear many will be left with little choice but to continue cutting energy use even in such harsh conditions.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
Newcastle coal futures  the benchmark for the top consuming region of Asia  topped the $400 per tonne mark  more than 150% above last year's level  on prospects of continued robust demand and tight supplies. Above-average demand from Europe on fears of a shortage of natural gas for power generation coupled with skyrocketing imports of thermal coal from India  as electricity demand increased because of a heatwave and a pickup in economic activity  have been pushing prices higher. On top of that  a seasonal upturn in coal-fired generation during the winter reinforced this view of solid global demand. On the supply side  wet weather and flooding brought to Australia by the La Niña phenomenon have hit coal production for miners  including Glencore  BHP  and Anglo-American. As a result  Australia's thermal coal exports will likely tumble by 13 million tonnes to 183 million this year. In September  coal prices hit a record peak of around $450 per ton,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 8 December 2022🎉🧸No end to fear: It's up to the Fed🗽The equity market continued to slide into negative territory even after a two-day decline as investors were wary and growing concerned about the Fed's monetary policy. However  there is a general acceptance that the Fed may persist in tightening the economy even as economic data weakens.While we expect a smaller hike going into the Dec FOMC meeting  odds are higher now on possible more rate hikes  thus pushing the terminal interest rate to a fresh high  possibly beyond the 5% expected. This fear is ignited by November's job gain and firm wage growth.A breather set place  possibly temporarily  is the bond market which saw yield calming. However  Pika World remains highly cautious in a current turbulent wave as we await the upcoming CPI figure.🍏More Covid-19 easing in China💎The week presents great light on China's Covid-19 policy. After a year of immense business disruption  the world's second-largest economy is prepared to gather steam on its economy with new relaxation on quarantine measures in place.China appeared not to have sufficient ICU beds should a massive outbreak occur. Thus  the government has been slow and made more calculated measures to manage Covid-19 with its existing medical infrastructure capacity. There is a greater drive to inoculate its elderly population as momentum is gaining speed once more.Pika World continues to be hopeful of a modest recovery in the Chinese economy.🚘Carvana: Great distress with debt💣As news of a possible restructuring of its debt broke out  the online car retailer saw its shares dive more than 40%  as the outcome of such restructuring could lead to equity bankruptcy.While the company is on the road towards implementing plans to shift gear into profitability  shareholders and creditors appear to have thinning patience with the company.📮What's on the menu today?📖At 9.30 pm  we will have the Initial Jobless Claims  which we expect to rise modestly to 230K from 225K.It is 8 December  Thursday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a fruitful day and a bon appetit lunch later!,btohqsg
