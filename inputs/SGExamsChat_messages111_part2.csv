I gotten from J1 A to J2 MYE E because of that,btohqsg
Those like u have nvr seen before,btohqsg
If dk how draw  gg liao,btohqsg
Feel like org chem is more suited for bio students,btohqsg
Is like saying physical chem is suited for phy students,btohqsg
Most fun part of chem for sure,btohqsg
Oh no  do more org chem and periodic table practices man,btohqsg
:/I got hard carried by organic in j2,btohqsg
Yes yes!! One of my nus data analytic friend got offered by microsoft. Another from nus computer science is working for google at san frans now,btohqsg
Speaking of chem  still kinda pissed transition metals is removed for A levelsðŸ˜‚ like i get why they do it but still,btohqsg
But tbh chem is actually a super impt subject,btohqsg
Yes la cos it will continue to be relevant,btohqsg
Rly tests u ur understanding of not just chem  but other subjects integrated into chem too,btohqsg
Dont need memorise colours anymore ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Bobian lor  at most their A levels a bit harder to score free marks :),btohqsg
Guys I got a graph traversal problem need help,btohqsg
Hmm itâ€™s a tiny fraction of what they gonna learn in uni.. with MO theory,btohqsg
Huh. I tot organic chem was easier than the whole inorganic chem,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA thats the only thing i know,btohqsg
Tbh   nuclear physics is easier than quantum physics,btohqsg
Idk eh  my current students say organic hard,btohqsg
Hahaha our chem expert is here students! Anything look for him,btohqsg
All the best hope u buck up,btohqsg
No need teach me everything just tell me the solution name I go Google,btohqsg
Go read minimum spanning tree and single source shortest path,btohqsg
Er... I already finished A levels haha  gotten a B  now in NS,btohqsg
I didnt see nuclear but quantum is quite fun,btohqsg
I tot math is for physicsðŸ˜¶,btohqsg
Thou i cant math at all,btohqsg
And for H2 computing and H2 Further maths,btohqsg
I only know Ms Loh Xin Min,btohqsg
Idk her full name so Ms Loh*,btohqsg
Meanwhile im quite curious how much other private tutors earn here ngl,btohqsg
Ya but more or less got fixed range,btohqsg
Mr Lim Wei Jie  with glasses one,btohqsg
Bro what is the different between the 2,btohqsg
Wah all i never hear before one,btohqsg
Single source shortest path is to find the shortest path between a single vertex and ALL the other vertices such that sum of weight of the edges is minimised.Minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges that connect ALL the vertex such that minimum total possible edge weight,btohqsg
Physics teacher Mr Ong Chee wah,btohqsg
My physics tutor is the subject head rn,btohqsg
Then the problem I have is use which one har,btohqsg
And my class canâ€™t understand her,btohqsg
In ur problem i think it looks like minimum spanning tree  you want to go through all the places(vertex) with minimum weight,btohqsg
There are other traversal methods like BFS AND DFS,btohqsg
Who is the head of physics?,btohqsg
shortest path is only from one source to another vertex,btohqsg
I used to rmb the head as Mr Goh,btohqsg
In ur case is more like u want to go through all the vertices,btohqsg
As in single source shortest path,btohqsg
Unlikely you all will have the same teachers since you are successive batches,btohqsg
