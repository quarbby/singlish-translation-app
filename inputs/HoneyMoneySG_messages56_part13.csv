better than having to credit salary and spend $500,btohqsg
"Hi experts  is anyone aware of how UOB handles refund regarding the spending requirement of $500 for One Account or $600 EVOL CC? Let's say the refund happens in next Calendar/Statement month  will the refund ""deduction"" apply to original spend month or next refund month?",btohqsg
Hi  I keep seeing Xnap ? May I know what‚Äôs that ?,btohqsg
Why do you make it sound like crediting salary is a chore üòÇEven if you're doing the fast bank transfer trick it's like a minute of effort  and you can schedule ahead for the next few months.Few minutes for extra $1520 on $100k I'd do it any day.,btohqsg
lol i did not make it sound like a chore  i was just replying to his msgcomparing vis a vis,btohqsg
U can use xnap to pay for hawker that have the sg qr to pay via credit card to earn miles or cashback,btohqsg
So we create $75k pocket then main $0 to earn the 3.48%?,btohqsg
Can. 0.08%. Its already most convenient compared to everywhere else.,btohqsg
Then don't use lah. So simple.,btohqsg
Just a weird design I wonder what's the intention. Is there any guesses?,btohqsg
Hi if I withdraw gxs saving pocket before the maturity date (1 year) do I still entitle to get the interest?,btohqsg
there's no lock in wor.the date u set for target is ownself say ownself song 1,btohqsg
Mean if I deposit ytd and get daily interest today  tonight I withdraw  I still entitle the daily interest which I earned today,btohqsg
dont think so  i think need to lock in the money until 1230am  but i dont really go watch for the mechanicssomebody else might have answer,btohqsg
Are my citi prestige / citi rewards card‚Äôs points saving will restart each first date if a calendar month? Or when does it get renewed evrymonth? I‚Äôve already paid last month‚Äôs bill,btohqsg
I meant I 've reached my cap for miles saving per month; then do I have to wait for 1 Aug to be eligible for miles saving?,btohqsg
Citi prestige  no limit for points.Citi Rewards  by statement date. After ur statement date u can get 4mpd on another $1000.,btohqsg
"Hi I just joined  trying to maximise interest rates and cashbacks  not miles. Currently doing the below:1. UOB one acct: 100K for EIR 5%2. UOB Evol card: 8% for 600 spend- using on NTUC mainly3. UOB One: 2K/mth spend for utilities/petrol etc to get $200/qtr cashback.4. Cash management accounts via robo advisors for the rest: 5%I travel frequently. Still cant figure out which is better.

Hi I got a Highflyer Amex card that give me 1.8 mile per dollar  but most of the merchant hardly accept Amex like rent salary etc so I‚Äôm thinking should I use the ipaymy or cardup to earn the miles  is it worth it? Cos those got around 2.2% charges,btohqsg
Anyone know what stock the $88 stock coupon is referring?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  saw on youtube that for new UOB users I should first get the PRVI miles card and spend $1000 consecutive for 2 months to get the 50 000 miles before changing to the Lady‚Äôs Card for 6mpd right? So after the 2 months can just cancel the PRVI card?,btohqsg
u see if worth it to delay UOB Lady or not loh..UOB Lady 6mpd likely ending End Feb 2024,btohqsg
Can we have uob lady‚Äôs card and lady‚Äôs solitaire card at the same time  so we have 3 categories for 6mpd‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
My refund transaction was tagged back to the original spend month. Luckily it was a small amount and I soent more for that month and it did not affect the spending tier criteria.,btohqsg
Dear all  new joiner here. Wanted to ask for the credit cards with priority pass lounge access. Is it possible to stack the lounge entry benefits with the same priority pass app account?For eg. Citibank premier miles card (2 visits per calendar year) + Standard Chartered journey card (2 visits per year) using the same priority pass account.Thanks in advance!  üôåüèº,btohqsg
One card one account. So if you have two cards  you will need two accounts.Usually cannot stack for entry. The lounge will not allow you to use two accounts to sign in 3-4 pax,btohqsg
Noted with thanks.So if let's say I want to create 2 priority pass accounts I can still do so using the same name but different email accounts during the registration for the priority pass account?,btohqsg
Thank u for sharing üôè Meaning they might even claw back the interest or cash back üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes  that's the risk of using cards which u spend just nice to hit the minimum spend. üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi Champs I am about to apply for the UOB lady's solitaire card. I am male but can I just choose female or gender neutral to be eligible? Or can I just choose male now?,btohqsg

Thanks  do any of you apply for UOB lady's savings' account when applying for the lady's card?,btohqsg
Citi reward. If the other $1k spend is on hotel n airline then DBS Altitudes.,btohqsg
Based on the website  u still need to be a female for the UOB Lady's savings account. Are you? I think most people just pair it with UOB One account,btohqsg
May i know those mcc code exclude cash back still contribute as minimum spend?,btohqsg
usually excluded from min spend  unless there is separate definition for minimum spend in the TnC,btohqsg
Hi  is anyone else also encountering delayed application for GXS savings account? I applied in-app at 12 noon yesterday using SingPass (no VPN) and till now the in-app message remains: ‚ÄúSit back and relax while your application is being reviewed‚Äù.I read that others got their accounts approved instantly via SingPass.,btohqsg
Some people say I can still apply for it. UOB is letting the male customers apply for it now,btohqsg
I think now males can apply for the cardNot the savings account,btohqsg
U can only have 1 dbs women card,btohqsg
You need to be a female to apply for UOB lady's savings account.,btohqsg
But why do u wanna apply for the lady‚Äôs saving account?,btohqsg
Hi Champs  looks like there's only UOB Lady's card link in Saingsaver. Anyone can find a lonk for the Lady's solitaire card?,btohqsg
