Should be hitting our roads soon I think still in LTA/nea homologation,btohqsg
But would sound worse than before..,btohqsg
On the plus side  CBR650R coming to SG with the 650 Inline 4,btohqsg
Usually Ducati prices for the colours extra  your scrambler also you see the different colours all different price,btohqsg
In early videos sounds the same tbh,btohqsg
But would have to hear it in person,btohqsg
Also different specs for the older scramblers cus got urban scrambler and some other variant with road tyres,btohqsg
The desert sled and the regular 1100 you mean?,btohqsg
Yeah. I forgot the specific names,btohqsg
Cause the colour schemes also got names,btohqsg
Some colour schemes got other different things also,btohqsg
But in my fucked up opinion  I'd rather opt for other options than panigale for more comfort.,btohqsg
The r1 and the panigale not as comfortable in terms of riding posture,btohqsg
R1250RT  R1250GSA  Street Glide Special  Goldwing DCT,btohqsg
But I heard 3rd Gen Busa pretty comfortable,btohqsg
More of a sports tourer anyway,btohqsg
But you compare in the supersport category,btohqsg
The s1000rr one of the most comfortable ones,btohqsg
If you tune and put extended swingarm,btohqsg
H2SX also cannot compare cus more for straight line drag speed,btohqsg
But the closest direct competitor to the busa,btohqsg
Also got ninja 1000 which is positioned slightly lower end,btohqsg
But Busa also got one company making 300++hp for it,btohqsg
But also a great sports tourer,btohqsg
3rd gen got the electronics to support also,btohqsg
But a lot of busa lovers,btohqsg
Cause they're too used to the 2nd gen and how raw it was,btohqsg
But this TTS Superbusa 380hp with help of Supercharger,btohqsg
And turbo hard to install for a bike,btohqsg
Rotrex C30-94 counter-clockwise centrifugal supercharger boosts power to 380bhp,btohqsg
Supercharger more compact in certain ways,btohqsg
Show this to a car guy and they'll assume it's a turbo,btohqsg
No car meet near cny period ah,btohqsg
You hosting or Boss Rayyan hosting?,btohqsg
The 90s WRX with long vertical taillight,btohqsg
I think he talking abt the 22b,btohqsg
Because if 22b would be horizontal. If since he said vertical  I assumed Forester STi,btohqsg
The sg one with Subaru wrap,btohqsg
my neighbours WRX   nt the WRC one,btohqsg
Where got too young la hahha,btohqsg

3 aventadors at milenia walk atm,btohqsg
Check out 'BMW M1000RR'  available at S$1 000 000 on#Carousell:https://carousell.app.link/wcUJUZnZEwb,btohqsg
