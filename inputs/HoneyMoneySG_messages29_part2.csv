If itâ€™s F&B vouchers  is it eligible to earn the 10x points for HSBC revolution? Just want to confirm. Thanks!,btohqsg
No not the same rate. It will be the rate on the day you renew your FD,btohqsg
Ya should be ok I think. The MCC for Shopback f&b vouchers is under fast food restaurants,btohqsg
Cimb activation approval took quite long,btohqsg
As long as Iâ€™m still entitled to 4.15% Iâ€™m good haha,btohqsg
Hi. For 5 transactions of HSBC ega singsaver sign up reward  could I simply do a fast transfer to another account. The T&C not quite clear on that,btohqsg
Won't be able to get the card mailed to me before eom,btohqsg
great video was thnking about it the last few days  just wanted to clarify  as my wife does not have CPF  including down payment  based on your video's example for a 4 rm HDB  I should have (5% down payment 20K + 15% Downpayment 60K,btohqsg
+ 20 K 12 mths mortgage in my OA to be safe right?,btohqsg
They not give me fee waiver years ago  so I cancel the card  even premier banking holder,btohqsg
For SC smart card  do you still get the base 360points for non qualifying merchants?,btohqsg
Yes  but of course you don't get base points if it's a non eligible transaction like insurance  tax payments  top ups etc,btohqsg
I love that sound effect ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Any advise on what to spend the $500 on? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Also depends what is the price of flat you bought,btohqsg
I spent on travel  because citi rewards amaze excluded that,btohqsg
I understand that  so technically speaking  until i pay the down payment  i should have at least $100K in my OA  after wards $20K would be more than sufficient  then the rest all go to SA,btohqsg
Not sure for others   never felt the intro music is hard on the ears. Went back to view many intro videos no problem la,btohqsg
Itâ€™s your channel so itâ€™s your callThe most -1 subscriberThe content is the most important,btohqsg
It is your signature eyecatch ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
it also depends on your job security. if ur job security is high  there's more flexibility to transfer some of ur OA to SA first and earn higher interest earlier (if that's what u wan)  since u have around 4 years to re-build ur OA before u collect ur key and pay ur next 15% downpayment.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if it's possible to pay ESSO petrol with kris+ via DBS ESSO card  and earn both cards and kris+ benefits?,btohqsg
Anyone know if pandapay topup counts towards foodpanda for posb everyday?,btohqsg
Don't think it a issue. Maybe more that he or she have a bad speaker on his device.,btohqsg
U can transfer 1k first bro. After the savings account is created  u can transfer the rest. However  what Iâ€™m not sure is that whether u should place 1k as minimum amount to keep ur savings account alive. In simple words  Iâ€™m not sure whether fastsaver can be alive with $0 in it  and $20k in FD*I already got my FD approved but it took me around 2-3 months after 2 calls to their hotline.,btohqsg
Just to inform anyone who wants to open FD in Cimb. What happen to me was my FD was not opened after 2 months but Fastsaver has opened  so I called them to check. First call they said they will speed up the process  nothing happen in 2-3weeks. 2nd call they said my FD activation was way past the deadline and it wonâ€™t activate. However  they guide me to open the FD through Cimb internet banking  and the FD account is created instantly,btohqsg
Hi guys  sorry noob question. How do you verify if citibank/amazeis being considered as online purchase? If I pay in ntuc in amaze for example,btohqsg
anyone invest your cpf money using endowusï¼Ÿ,btohqsg
I use it to invest USA market   think better than let Temasek to invest,btohqsg
I guess you are concern of Temasek FTX lost right?,btohqsg
will usd/sgd go up or down?,btohqsg
No right and wrong. If I rem correctly  60 to 70% of ppl cannot beat OA 2.5%. I invest/trading myself too. Outperform average s&p. But I also treat cpf as a safety net.,btohqsg
If u not a season investor. Better don't invest using OA. Not financial advice. Just talking to myself.,btohqsg
It is not easy to invest being PE  VC or Angel investor. I guess it normal mistake actually. They tend to high risk  high returns.,btohqsg
I'm sure the 5 transactions is for debit card or credit card only,btohqsg
Hi guys  for a 10k spare cash. Whereâ€™s the best place to put now?,btohqsg
With no rewards for using cards to top up Revolut  might as well just use Paynow right?,btohqsg
I encountered the same problem as well. I'm still trying to appeal to them and show them that I had applied for fd account as well,btohqsg
I think 2 pdf (fastsaver + FD) from ur email should be a good proof that u have applied for FD,btohqsg
^ the email containing the pdf is sth like this,btohqsg
Only after they told me that my fd application didn't went through then I realised I online received 1 email for fastsaver account,btohqsg
after I applied for fd online  I waited for ~30mins for an email but never received it. Called CIMB to ask for fd email. They gave me fastsaver email instead,btohqsg
I waited for 1-2weeks for the 2 pdf ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Wow. Seems like CIMB quite slow,btohqsg
I called cuz I thought I entered the wrong email,btohqsg
Every time I call Cimb I always have to wait 30mins then they pick up the phone ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
I see but I think the application usually will be approved after a few days (I think it mentioned somewhere),btohqsg
I heard fron others who applied that they usually got their acknowledgement email instantly,btohqsg
Ok ðŸ¤” isit because they have an existing Cimb savings acc?,btohqsg
But that was back in Nov. Maybe their application volumes increased this year,btohqsg
