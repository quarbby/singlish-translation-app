Now  even before the existing support measure has ceased or the outlook improves for taxi and private hire car drivers  Phase 2 (heightened Alert) has once again hit drivers‚Äô ability to pick up passengers.On the back this  the one-time $27 million additional payout was announced for taxi and private hire car drivers on 21 May 2021. This is worth $300 per driver per vehicle  or an additional $10 a day. As mentioned  this will be for the period from end-May to end-June.As the top-up payout coincides with the last CDRF payout under the existing scheme  taxi and private hire car drivers will receive $750 in June ($450 [Existing] + $300 [New])  or $25 per day.With the announcement on 21 May 2021  it was mentioned that the government will also be ‚Äúlooking into a further extension to the CDRF beyond the current tranche ending in end June 2021‚Äù.There is no need for taxi and private hire car drivers to apply for this grant  as the CDRF payouts will automatically receive the top-up through their operator.,btohqsg
