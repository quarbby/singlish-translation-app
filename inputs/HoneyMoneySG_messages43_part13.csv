I usually check my bank account everyday and the fraudulent transactions just happened out of sudden,btohqsg
My DBS wwmc is relatively new. The fraud transaction is literally 2nd transaction only,btohqsg
This is my friend recent one,btohqsg
1st transaction was just last month to buy Scoot ticket. Direct website not 3rd party.,btohqsg
Duno how can leak info like that,btohqsg
Mine is 2 otp notification on porkbun com which did not g through,btohqsg
Same. I didn‚Äôt receive any notification or otp,btohqsg
I suspect dbs card data compromised. Not our own spending issue. My newly issue card also kena compromised,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think we can prevent fraudulent transactions fully ü•≤ just need to check bank account frequently,btohqsg
It‚Äôs hard to tell where it got leak,btohqsg
My newly issue card havent even reach me yet. That why i suspect is dbs internal leak,btohqsg
SAME  kena 3k on scoot tickets,btohqsg
Maybe their system kena tio hack,btohqsg
Ahh. Prob same thing happen to UOB,btohqsg
Cancelled card the DBS points remained or forfeited?,btohqsg
Damn. That‚Äôs a lot‚Ä¶ did u manage to get refund?,btohqsg
They reissued a new card. I don't think my points will be affected,btohqsg
Waiting for DBS now üôèüèª Hopefully can waive the charge la if not I cancel the card liao. Don‚Äôt know how they can authorise 3k payment to scoot without OTP ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
If cancelled permanently need to withdraw point out first  if  reissue card  the point remain,btohqsg

If it is widespread data breach  u can bring the case to dbs  coz there is evidence it might be their fault leak as you are not the only victim,btohqsg

does citibank waive off annual fee on more than 2 cards?,btohqsg
No suspicious transactions on my wwmc so far,btohqsg
Yes  but depend on your usage on those card,btohqsg
This happened to me too. I am careful with cards and never before had this issue with any other card. Had dozens of cards from different banks. UOB needs to up the security and not let customers waste effort with disputed transactions. Debit card is where its really bad,btohqsg
Hello everyone. This is a great community. I'm new to the UOB One Account. And I'm trying to evaluate choosing either UOB One Card or UOB EVOL card for my $500 minimum spend. Would anyone happen to know if Grab Mart is counted as additional Cashback merchant for UOB One Account? The UOB website says Grab rides and delivery (excluding topups). Grab mart isn't food delivery so it's a bit confusing.,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to ask regarding UOB EVOL. Assuming the merchant is not on the blacklist or UOB$ programme:1. Whether a merchant has a PayWave machine  is it confirm that when you tap it with Google Pay  the transaction will qualify as Mobile Contactless  or is there different kind of machine that may not earn cashback on PayWave with Google Pay?2. Whether all SG QR(Not Nets QR or PayNow QR) are made the same. i.e the moment I see SG QR  paying by scanning the QR code using XNAP will qualify as online spend?,btohqsg
