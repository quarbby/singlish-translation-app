Lol don't give them ideas 🤣,btohqsg
hi all  enrolling amex HF priority pass do i need to key in my existing pp membership number? currently already have citi PM priority pass..,btohqsg
so means need to generate a new membership number?,btohqsg
Their IT must be very busy for keep changing,btohqsg
Yes a new username for the amex hf,btohqsg
Hi guys if i scan kris+ qr using gpay in restaurant to make payment  is considered Offline payment right?,btohqsg
I thought they will use Mar MAB as ref for this promo regardless ? No?,btohqsg
Ok I see what u meant.ok,btohqsg
I thought EIR 4% for $150k not bad.  If empty out in Jun then almost no interest unless got other high interest account... ?,btohqsg
HSBC can give 4.x% for 1 month,btohqsg
You can use trust account where if you fulfil there criteria (100k  salary giro  5 x trust card use  ntuc member)  you will be able to get 3.5%. The good thing is it applies up to 500k. I will use this account to store temporary and deploy my funds in/out.,btohqsg
Hi all  I am very confused on HSBC EGA and I plan to open it on June since the promotion going to end by 31 May.1. how much do I need to deposit for this account? E.g. uob need to hit 150K to get the highest interest2. Does the giro apply to paying credit card bill also?Tq,btohqsg
These videos by Chris will explain everything to you. Watch them in order because of the changes earlier this month.https://youtu.be/iebYTbH8hYYhttps://youtu.be/4SIURs2qZG4,btohqsg
think they are referring to this  for incremental amounts:https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/terms-and-conditions-lny-ega-promotion.pdf,btohqsg
Moomoo 6.8% promo cannot find le. Anyone knows if got xnapped?,btohqsg
Anyone has experience getting NTB rewards from moneysmart/singsaver for AMEX TCB card that was cancelled 12 months ago?,btohqsg
So after upgrading from HSBC premium to Premier with the deposit of $200k. Once the account is open  can I withdraw immediately the the deposit said $198k and left $2k?Then monthly I transfer $15k in and do 5 transactions.This will enable me to get the HSBC EGA (1%) of up to $500?,btohqsg
Anyone participated in Moomoo 6.8% in the previous round from 1 Feb to 1 April? I read the Ts and Cs and it didn't seem to be affected by this new policy  correct?,btohqsg
I don’t think u can since the requirements $200K TRB  actually why not change the requirements to be $15K/month requirements ?,btohqsg

Bros. This is one of the reason miles better than cash back. Bank points earn can be transfer to hotel loyalty programme,btohqsg
Marriot bonvy I feel they have quite good programme . . Give out bonus points for their members,btohqsg
Chris.. so far I can't find any of your clips at YouTube on hotel loyalty programme  miles transfer from bank and it's benefit. Hope you can share one day.,btohqsg
JH  you meant requesting HSBC to upgrade to Premium without topping up and just do $15k and 5 transactions? Is this doable?,btohqsg
Hilton also give out bonus points to their members.,btohqsg
Yes.. I also heard of it .. thanks for sharing,btohqsg
Anyone knows if purchasing Klook gift cards on wogi can bypass the mcc for Klook? Or the mcc still remains,btohqsg
What is your targeted mcc ?,btohqsg
Coz Klook and trip is not whitelisted by revo anymore  so wondering if getting the gift cards on wogi allows me to still get 4mpd,btohqsg
Ahhh so buy from heymax still whitelisted right? Then I just go over to my Klook etc to redeem it,btohqsg
White listed cause 5311  I usually get Klook voucher from there using UOB PPV then any remaining small tiny amount I use AMEX KFA 😂,btohqsg
Just note the redemption site u have to do it in browser,btohqsg
yes  choose the 15k monthly transfer,btohqsg
Any requirements from bank for an account to be upgraded to Premium other than $15k transfer ?,btohqsg
Yes if they still have the promo. You will need to sign a separate priority banking upgrade form with the $15k monthly in commitment.When I did it they claimed it was a 24 month promo only (must topup to $200k subsequently).Not sure if they do enforce it strictly though.,btohqsg
Thanks 🙏. Will check with HSBC CSO on this. As currently my Giro is above $40k. Which premium can’t go above $300,btohqsg
It doesn’t work when we use app ?,btohqsg
The voucher works  just that the redemption page is hard to locate in the app (I always copy and paste the link in the voucher redemption details)- voucher is not applied directly to your booking (works like a wallet basis),btohqsg
I thought they updated through the tnc already?,btohqsg
Yea  but think Chris is checkin w them on the sudden change which is unfair for the customer who sign up prior the change of tnc,btohqsg
I'm will be clarifying the T&Cs and what to do next (as an affected user).Having said that I cannot reverse any change as decision is made by Moomoo SG.,btohqsg
Where to find it in the apps? Thanks!,btohqsg
play store or ios? look for DCS Card,btohqsg
Thanks I already install the dcs apps but can’t find the fee waiver button,btohqsg
Hi  checked with Heymax that smrt cc give 5% for starhub bills. Is it accurate cos not sure if i read somewhere telco bill is excluded?,btohqsg
Go to your card > card management >Request Fee Waiver,btohqsg
