I think will be a seperate quota,btohqsg
U can reg 1000 PHV. But will not eat into current COE supply,btohqsg
But u pay the COE for tht bidding,btohqsg
So the COE still stick to car regardless,btohqsg
Give up the coe lolz but subject to criteria but anyway taxis also used as personal transport like my uncle lolz,btohqsg
Or replace taxi lol or combined as a group e.g. Public transport vehicle  I.e. no more phv scheme,btohqsg

Individuals wanting to own a brand new car but unable to pay 30/40 dp would also full loan then phv  so I wonder if targeting car companies that bid for phv is sufficient,btohqsg
Time to score brownie points. If vote for them then change 🫣,btohqsg
I think having company PHV on a separate category and reducing private owner PHV loan quantum to the same as regular cars is sufficient to solve the problem,btohqsg
Companies dun have an issue with dp as compared to individuals,btohqsg
