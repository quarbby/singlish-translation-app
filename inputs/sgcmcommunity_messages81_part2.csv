Please don't try Jit Poh building,btohqsg
Honestly just keep driving and you will get a hang of it,btohqsg
"If you're unsure and want to ""prepare""",btohqsg
The new ones have digital instrument clusters,btohqsg
But only the 3 and cx-30,btohqsg
Mazda doesn't seem to want to update any of their other lineup,btohqsg
All still stuck on the older infotainment  instrument clusters and older assist tech,btohqsg
y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt tried parking at katong shopping centre,btohqsg
These 2 have the newest offerings from Mazda since late 2018/early 2019,btohqsg
Hiya‚Ä¶those architect who designed the car park does not have any foresight.,btohqsg
They never expect car sizes will expand,btohqsg
the man or the vacuum cleaner,btohqsg
Actually you would be surprised at how big cars were back then too,btohqsg
Just that people were better at driving and had more spaces to park,btohqsg
i wonder how much will it costs to fix it,btohqsg
dajie please go take refresher if u need,btohqsg
i will...just wondering why i love to scratch cars,btohqsg
as long as scratch isnt too deep to rust  shld be fine,btohqsg
its okay we all make mistakes,btohqsg
Hit own car no issues  can fix. But don't hit others,btohqsg
Hit curb  hit wall  hit railings,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt fix .. yet. Collect some more for another 3-6 months then one shot to fix together.,btohqsg
The scars are reminders of lessons you‚Äôve learned,btohqsg
Deeeeep but true. Especially the emotional scars.,btohqsg
"Whenever I go up the ramp  at the spiral I would align my vehicle near the centre of the spiral railing  until i see my wing mirror is ""touching"" the centre wall  at the same time I can monitor the gap between the wall and my rear vehicle body via the wing mirror. Its my hack üòÅ",btohqsg
You just need to hone your estimation skills e.g. when you sit at your driver seat and see the kerb positioned at the centre of your hood  how far is the kerb from your car side body etc,btohqsg
Hey  high 5  that's why I prefer to own a car than rent,btohqsg
Yeah man hahaha buang the wall better than buang that opposite car coming üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I used to try and centre my car  now I just hug the wall closest to me  especially since you never know when you‚Äôll see a car eat into your lane coming the opposite direction,btohqsg
I swear sometimes I shart a little like a deer in headlights when that happens,btohqsg
This reminds me of my BBDC days!,btohqsg
The LEGO Technic McLaren Formula One will be coming to Ngee Ann City as a Pop-Up Experience üòäThe life-sized model is made up of 288 315 LEGO bricks and measures 5.7m in length and 2.4m in width.But please ah  don't itchy hand go touch and make it fall like London Bridge ü§£üëâüèª React with üòÅ if you agree that this is a magnificent piece of art!‚û°Ô∏è Read ithere!,btohqsg
You wouldn‚Äôt want to be the lad to find out.,btohqsg
See the weather  I‚Äôm tempted to sleep,btohqsg

Been there done that  years back when just started in singapore during after race on the track hehe,btohqsg

only the ramp ones with tight spaces..i phobia,btohqsg
and i was very slow cos of the tight spaces,btohqsg
yesterday i was too focus on the front and forgot the back,btohqsg
You always have to just remember to go wide and cut in really close,btohqsg
Otherwise  you won‚Äôt have the right angle  no matter what see you go,btohqsg
ya. shall bring along a giant compass to measure the angle before i turn,btohqsg
thnk i just collect a few more battle scars before i send in for touch ups,btohqsg
and can i ask something? i find the car pick up and response getting lag lately,btohqsg
is it becos of the fuel that i pump or could it be other issues? i only kena scratch but not hitting with other things,btohqsg
This is the best carpark to practice at,btohqsg
the pick up takes around 2 seconds compared to the last time when i first used the car,btohqsg
I‚Äôve‚Ä¶.just valet but self park out front,btohqsg
Shows that you are getting used to the car,btohqsg
