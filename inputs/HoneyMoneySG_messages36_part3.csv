Which card cashback is better for public transport? Revolut or Standard Chartered Smart Credit Card?,btohqsg
I think it's a pretty high limit  around $30k spend per month?,btohqsg
Does using grab card   or grab food charges extra fee when in Malaysia?,btohqsg
Revolut 10% cashback  SC 6%. But SC has no requirements while Revolut has some conditions to fufill first,btohqsg
Or just top up SGD as in Grab wallet?,btohqsg
hsbc rev and amaze +Citi amaze both equally good must see your spendings  and where you spent this 2 cards can spent on most places,btohqsg
contact less  online and public transport,btohqsg
Can I check to have this giro cashback I just need account and maintain 1000 right ?,btohqsg
If you have Grab card you can't pay with GrabPay while in MY,btohqsg
citi + amaze = to online already,btohqsg
example you normal hp internet bills amaze+citi if buying air ticket then is hsbc rev,btohqsg
Every month $2k incremental balance + make 5 transactions per month,btohqsg
i dun think is incremental right just need to deposit $2000 then later take out okie right,btohqsg
I mean I top up money in grab wallet to for grab food n grab car,btohqsg
5 transactions as in transfer of funds to other acc also counted.,btohqsg
Oh this one I'm not sure. Try to ask Grab support,btohqsg
icic.. but only travel n public transport amaze+citi no gd,btohqsg
yupe  i think cruise is different citi amaze get points while hsnc rev dun give lols,btohqsg
Should be able to charge using grab wallet,btohqsg
I think cruise tix and onboard expenses are excluded for CRMC... ie no 10x points,btohqsg
okie check yupe cruise not counted also,btohqsg
like whether citi+amaze cover any area that revo don't? else can default to revo for everything mah,btohqsg
revo give you $1-1point no x10,btohqsg
No. Insta points only for FX spend,btohqsg
oversea use also okie  with amaze,btohqsg
hanoh.. revo for sg(except hp n Internet bill) .. amaze for overseas ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I was commenting that all CRMC + Amaze local spend gives 4mpd. But yes  only FX spend gives 1% Instapoints back,btohqsg
must see you monthly usage also dun have one for all de lar you need to come out with your own example if you always spent over 1k per month good to have 2 mah,btohqsg
if split up hor.. my individual card won't accumulate enuff pts to do anything ha,btohqsg
All will go in your kris flyer what,btohqsg
Just transfer in $2000  and fast transfer out 5 times $400 each time and that's all. In 1-2 days you'll get an sms that you are eligible for rewards till the end of the next monthBut the fall below fee is another question (need to keep min $2000),btohqsg
ocbc min already 3k to be real if cannot have this min balance you 4%5% really doest matter the work right?,btohqsg
I see people say deposit $2K a month is requirement  but you can withdraw or spend it,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I read from others,btohqsg
Did anyone face this problem when opening HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Not directly answering your question;Can try going down to their branch. I went down to the claymore branch yesterday at 4.45pm  close to their closing time. Only one person ahead of me in queue.This morning account ready alr,btohqsg
Oooh Jun Hao this sounds wonderful. May consider going to branch at 2+pm-ish (close to the end of branch closing time),btohqsg
They close at 5pm on weekdays for account opening  check on their website for individual branch timings in case it differs!,btohqsg
ECapitvoucher mcc applied to be excluded,btohqsg
Oooh they open till 5pm for weekdays. Holland V branch closes at 3.30pm though,btohqsg
Hi  do you know if xray scans are excluded as well? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Does anybody know if AXS accepts payment via Instarem?,btohqsg
Use FairPrice app to pay also. Order self pick up for grabfood  use xnap for QR code payment at hawker centre / coffee shop for those that have liquidpay.,btohqsg
Food and grocery - HSBC revoInternet bill + Shopee (StarHub  Disney + etc ) - CRMCPlus those app like Kris+ and xnap  cannot use CRMC   so have to use HSBC.So I think need 2 card. Because problem is CRMC + amaze is only current  you donâ€™t know when Citibank will stop rewarding amaze like DBS  so it still better to use HSBC for daily.HSBC revo + EGA give extra 1% + 4 mpd,btohqsg
Hi guys do you know for TikTok shop what card should I use?,btohqsg
Overseas convenient store purchases- anyone know if they would typically fall under Grocery MCC?  Thanks,btohqsg
Combined with HSBC Revolution for travel related expenses,btohqsg
Sorry just to check when you say HSBC revo + amaze you mean you topping up an amount to amaze card to use? Cause if I not wrong amaze card can only link Mastercard which CRMC is able to do so.,btohqsg
Are you referring to Isaacâ€™s msg? If so  he was trying to say everything use CRMC + Amaze and for travel expenses use on Revo itself.,btohqsg
Do yâ€™all know anyway to earn cash back for paying insurance?,btohqsg
