Yes i am (be warned that you will need to pay an early account closure fee of $30 if you close a freshly opened account),btohqsg
May I know what is your strategy for both accounts? sorry for asking so much hahha,btohqsg
Everything UOB  expected spending put inside OCBC 360 each month till a year later then think again (fall below fees are waived for first year)The only purpose is really to pay off friends via GooglePay for me  do cash withdrawals and to do payments to my credit cards via FAST where applicable (not sure if UOB offers this service)For hitting $500  probably will use it all on insurance payments with AXS (i lose out on the 1.5/1.7 percent via grabpay-AMEX this way however),btohqsg
So your salary crediting will be into UOB  then OCBC is for spending and just to keep the account alive?,btohqsg
if want close i think (this one i haven't really cnfirmed) better to do it after 6 months to avoid early termination tho  but whether this will hurt relationship with the bank  that idk... (or if there's even such a thing) üò¨Cause after a year there will be the concern of that fall below fee,btohqsg
