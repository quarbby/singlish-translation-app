Just wondering  the polyclinic doctor never refer u to hospital meh? I mean if they cant check whats went wrong..Maybe they dunno which dept to refer u to...,btohqsg

They took x ray and since bones ok they think it‚Äôs just over stained,btohqsg
Mine one they oso took xray..Total i went for 3 xray! Waste $ sia..end up is not just the bones.So i even go mri & ultra sound üòÖ,btohqsg
Just curious. What did you do to cause the extensive injuries?,btohqsg
I didnt do anything. 1 fine evening  i was walking to bus stop as usual after workWhile waiting for greenman    my leg go soft n i cant walk well since mid june,btohqsg
After physio  i getting better.. i can climb up stairs n walk more loSo total im seeing 2 to 3 doctors for my leg . Got 2 diff issues..,btohqsg
Usually office workers have posture problem that can lead to leg weakness,btohqsg
so far it is recovering slowly la very slowly but at least sorta no longer affect normal daily stuffs Liao  there‚Äôs still pain and soreness but I just tank through,btohqsg
Ikr! The bills i pay n pay üòÖ,btohqsg
Because of this I went and buy an accident plan so now I‚Äôm covered hahahah,btohqsg
Lol i oredi got accident plan like 20 yrs le,btohqsg
Mine is more like degeneration.. not accident bah,btohqsg
Y let my opinion stop u üòèüòè,btohqsg
because I am wiling to make an assumption that your opinion is well-informed?,btohqsg
Need to take care of body.. like u wont knw what trigger or causes it,btohqsg
If i din go ultra sound.. i oso wont knw i got the issue in my veins,btohqsg
I still want go travel de leh..,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why time to gym ! Woohoo,btohqsg
Can do whatever you want !,btohqsg
Gym oso must knw ur limits,btohqsg
Not everything but at least something ~~,btohqsg
Ya like i no exercise.. due to diet. I dropped 11kg in few mths,btohqsg
as you age your goal generally speaking should be about muscle retention liao  so not chiong-ing.,btohqsg
go gym cannot be too tired...if not  will lose focus and end up hurting yourself,btohqsg
you can't outrun a bad diet,btohqsg
I think the workout part is also for you to build strength and muscle cause as you age  your muscle will slow say bye bye to you every year,btohqsg
Even think of switch to vertical mouse? I switch mine cos last round i have tennis elbow,btohqsg
you're a bit generous but what works for you ig,btohqsg
it happened to non mouse wrist,btohqsg
This one own self know what is push through your limit versus going overboard,btohqsg
ya recently it acts up again...when i lift heavy things,btohqsg
When habe tennis elbow  the physio ask me use a tennis ball n roll on the nervesPress abit weight on when u roll,btohqsg
lifting heavy things maybe a lot to do with posture.utilizing more of glutes and quads will defo help,btohqsg
i did...but that day i was too tired liao,btohqsg
I see a lot of people lifting heavy things using their back,btohqsg
But most people will not bother üòÅ,btohqsg
anyway it was donkey years ago...at least a decade,btohqsg
do what you love and stick with it,btohqsg
but i need to do more cardio,btohqsg
but still gotta do it LOL.,btohqsg
so i am restarting my workout regime,btohqsg
I used to be very sporty kind but then got a low period then got tummy and whatnot  every time finished a meal like food coma until the galaxy and such so I picked myself up and make a change again   it‚Äôs really a matter of give and take I guess,btohqsg
I think gym training or cardio or whichever is the most fair trade you can find,btohqsg
You give how much you get back how much provided you doing the right thing la,btohqsg
