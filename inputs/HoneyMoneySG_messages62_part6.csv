There are really multiple permutations and strategy depending on each person's planning,btohqsg

Hi all. I just got approved OCBC 365. In order to meet the min spend for the Sing saver rewards I need to spend $500. There is an option of adding the digital card to Apple Pay. Can I straight away use and it still clock into my spending or I need to activate physical card before spending to be considered the eligible spend,btohqsg
Maybank credit card application is slow af lol.,btohqsg
Hi... Does hdb s&cc payment and season parking using uob evol count towards uob one bonus calculation?,btohqsg
I believe Uob absolute cashback is the best at 1.7% (uncapped),btohqsg
Honestly if she can split the 5k into smaller chunk  maybe 2k can go to UOB One Card and then the other 3k can go to UOB Absolute Cashback. Or if she don't mind a 3rd card maybe can put some into UOB EVOL before UOB Absolute Cashback also.,btohqsg
May I check Amaze card is it unable add to Apple Pay?,btohqsg

Anyone know when will the interest tracker for uob one for credit salary be updated after my salary has been credited?,btohqsg
the next working day but so far i realise that you have to complete the $500 for it to increase in level,btohqsg
Correct. The first prerequisite is spending 500,btohqsg
Anyway to combine wallet and credit card for spending using Amaze card for same transaction?,btohqsg
Hi  If I cancelled a UOB card @ early feb  am I still eligible for those promotional rewards if I signed up now? Or safer to sign up at September,btohqsg
Check the last update date on the tracker against the posted date of your salary. Your salary must be posted first  then UOB one will update the tracker within 2 business day after salary is posted.For my account  don‚Äôt need to hit $500 minimum spend n salary is updated.,btohqsg
