lets just say my imagination runs a bit wild sometimes,btohqsg
NO I CLEANSE MY BRAIN FOR AMATH,btohqsg
I WILL RMB IT FOR U,btohqsg
Hvnt seen this level of degeneracy since the summer of '95,btohqsg
they were tying their shoelace on the rim then their foot slipped ih,btohqsg
hey anyone here in NIE programme ?,btohqsg
Start meto get the list of commands,btohqsg
Start meto get the list of commands,btohqsg
HAHA idk I saw that message,btohqsg
No  I am Singaporean born and raised.,btohqsg
I just don‚Äôt use singlish. Like ever.,btohqsg
Yeah I don‚Äôt use it a lot either,btohqsg
man. sorry my English not that good,btohqsg
Unless I‚Äôm trying to be sassy to make a point in exasperation or I‚Äôm pissed at you.,btohqsg
THE PAPER ENDS IN A MINUTE,btohqsg
Just ask@BoonXiong. Though  he hasn‚Äôt talked to me since he left our cg a while back. >:(,btohqsg
Why are you guys stalking when the paper ends,btohqsg
I thought it ended at 1615,btohqsg
no I am waiting for the paper to come,btohqsg
This is who we call the walking TYS,btohqsg
are also not allowed to share the paper outside,btohqsg
have to wait for exam end,btohqsg
How are you even going to manage to get your hands on it,btohqsg
from a friend who teach in school,btohqsg
That is true. And even after  the two invigilators on one student need to make sure that she destroys all known copies or sources of said paper  even after its over.,btohqsg
Yeah they have to crush the extra papers,btohqsg
Oh. Wait  they‚Äôre allowed? Isn‚Äôt it sealed?,btohqsg
but because of copyright I won't share the paper over here.,btohqsg
Apparently allowed? since people post the answers with the QP HAHAHA,btohqsg
Define NIE programme cos I know some people,btohqsg
Gwyn sound like a girl name,btohqsg
Right. I just got so excited when teachers gave me scanned copies of exact tys so I didn‚Äôt have to struggle with taking photos of the physical copy to study.,btohqsg
"all these ""show offs"" are just waiting for SEAB to warn them ü´£",btohqsg
i mean youcanalways work it out on writing papers... why do on the paper itself?,btohqsg
showing people you can get hold of the QP,btohqsg
It is when your family members decided that Gwendolyn is too long  and decided to shorten it to Gwyn  but its pronounced  ‚ÄúGwen‚Äù. And then you grow up with everyone teasing you that your parents made a typo with their fat fingers or something.,btohqsg
Idk but I‚Äôm happy they posted it along with the QP last year ü•π,btohqsg
hao ran is A math god.,btohqsg
Do you just have a data base of observations of everyone you talk to,btohqsg
I have database in my brain,btohqsg
He doesn‚Äôt have any data on me so I‚Äôm safe,btohqsg
he is just......... a walking storage... TYS and database...,btohqsg
His username reminds me of the grey‚Äôs anatomy episode where they labelled George O‚ÄôMalley double o 7 of the batch of interns within the first two episode  because he messed up an intern appendectomy surgery.,btohqsg
Antsy for the paper to ruin your brain with the spam that badly?,btohqsg
You think? You‚Äôre not safe from my collective data base of observations of you either.,btohqsg
You‚Äôre not safe from my collective data base of observations,btohqsg
how is your English so good,btohqsg
I do know that you‚Äôre a or at least have been a JC lit student.,btohqsg
But yeah  ur eng is good :)@GwynLim,btohqsg
Wait do you not take Amath?,btohqsg
Yeah I realised that was a dumb question,btohqsg
Used to. But dropped it. Because its impossible to type it out on the phone.,btohqsg
Wait you dropped out because it was hard to type it out on phone o-O,btohqsg
Wait so were u good at amath?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve only heard of ppl dropping cuz their foundations are weak or they just hate amath,btohqsg
Gee  why didn‚Äôt I think of that in the first place?,btohqsg
This world is not ready to handle complex accessibility needs of students,btohqsg
Extensively. My AA is like 73 pages.,btohqsg
Too complex for my teachers to understand,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt exactly hire a scribe to help me do it 24/7.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not exactly at liberty to disclose the exact details  but yes  enlarged prints amongst other things.,btohqsg
use laptop? i had AA student who used laptop to type,btohqsg
some student need laptop to type,btohqsg
Oh I understand why u dropped it now,btohqsg
that why their exam is longer.,btohqsg
I used to use keyboard to type out the solution and it tedious,btohqsg
I have this guy that uses laptop to type got his English paper,btohqsg
Laptops aren‚Äôt exactly the most accessible for me either. I can‚Äôt use my range of muscles that widely and my scoliosis doesn‚Äôt exactly make it easy for me to use any desk.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm waiting to hear about it.,btohqsg
what happen to you  if you dm saying,btohqsg
You have AA to only type out your solutions to questions right,btohqsg
I could‚Äôve used my laptop  but SEAB doesn‚Äôt exactly legitimately recognise software that allows you to remotely control and hack your own device.,btohqsg
Do you have a photographic memory,btohqsg
Did you mean the final answer or,btohqsg
so you exempted from practical also?,btohqsg
even with AA application? that sucks,btohqsg
I was exempted from oral for English,btohqsg
Professionals tried to apply for that AA for other clients  too. Its just not permissible.,btohqsg
oh so u not school candidate,btohqsg
We considered that  but realised that the field of vision is too wide.,btohqsg
for me I can see A4,btohqsg
I started public school for secondary school.,btohqsg
my mom want me to have A3,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt develop the necessary social skills for real life.,btohqsg
But aren‚Äôt you taking the exams,btohqsg
But it's like you have your curriculum,btohqsg
Finally understand why people hate it.,btohqsg
math I have 30 mins extra,btohqsg
Why does that make them a weirdo?,btohqsg
Yeah  but why is she making decisions for your AA,btohqsg
And now it has piqued my curious intrigue.,btohqsg
but I definitely need extra time  for English,btohqsg
AA is the cool kids club,btohqsg
You could just say it directly to address me  you know? I‚Äôm right here.,btohqsg
I need extra time for everything,btohqsg
Can still improve ur English üí™,btohqsg
I just wanna focus on my crush,btohqsg
I learn more about myself and her,btohqsg
Oh  all the best dude !,btohqsg
Yeah. And I tried showing polynomial factorisation by long division during an internal exam by just drawing a table for the space  but I got marked down for it.,btohqsg
oh ya for NA math p1,btohqsg
ensure that you have written down your name,btohqsg
I will now collect the question paper,btohqsg
The invigilators have never said that to me before.,btohqsg
‚ÄúOr I will make sure I make ur life hell ‚Äú,btohqsg
Tell that to my amath department,btohqsg
I will give you a T grade if you talk,btohqsg
They can‚Äôt actually say that  right,btohqsg
I will make sure u get a T grade for every subject and make sure you are never allowed to sit for the exam again,btohqsg
Not really  but I‚Äôm just amused now.,btohqsg
time to reddit it for comments~,btohqsg
So glad that I deleted Reddit this year.,btohqsg
Did you still want to serenade her to be impressed with your extensive linguistic abilities?,btohqsg
Its just the general primary school curriculum. I took the same exact papers as everyone else in my cohort.,btohqsg
And I think that you might‚Äôve just jinxed it.,btohqsg
Might just be the intimidating vibes that come from core literature student.,btohqsg
I totally did not forget how to differentiate and integrate,btohqsg
my English not good in the first place,btohqsg
And another thing is that I initially didn‚Äôt even want to take core literature  but the school didn‚Äôt want me to take core geography due to my foreseeable AA requirements needing to exempt me from more than 50% of the core geography paper.,btohqsg
I need more screenshots of iconic comments  please.,btohqsg
Some people make me laugh like mad,btohqsg
Might‚Äôve been too suspiciously easy for them to let us off.,btohqsg
Because E math was so hard,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know whether you realised that you just indirectly called me insane.,btohqsg
E math last year was hard,btohqsg
this year was not that bad,btohqsg
Except the paper two really set out to kill us this year.,btohqsg
paper 2 E math was easy,btohqsg
Last year‚Äôs paper wasn‚Äôt that bad. I guess. I think.,btohqsg
I mean this year was easy,btohqsg
Just that proving I can't do shit,btohqsg
Wait  I got so sidetracked here lmao. I‚Äôve to go finish up my monthly excel spreadsheets submission  whilst I blast the midnights album lmao.,btohqsg
@walkingTYS@biokhanisttell me when the amath taking candidates chaos dies down.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm running away before it gets too chaotic. And I need to get productive work done anyways.,btohqsg
I really don‚Äôt want to do those monthly submissions in the midst of papers.,btohqsg
Ohh okok  all the best yeye,btohqsg
aren't u the codeday org LOL,btohqsg
a lot of people that went NIE do so with the intention of serving their MOE contract,btohqsg
I swear these are made up,btohqsg
no way olvls makes toilet eat up our dear human beings,btohqsg
the 1.5 hour shitter has inspired o level candidates across the nation to take up creative writing,btohqsg
y'all should make Singapore horror stories,btohqsg
no ask the physics publisher dude to help us publish,btohqsg
curse of the o level shitter,btohqsg
hi lol.. i guess that's me,btohqsg
so first it was the 1.5 hour diarrhoea for emath p1,btohqsg
then elective geog someone's leg fell into their laosai,btohqsg
emath p2 someone had their peripd,btohqsg
now someone's pants were stained with shit,btohqsg
If they step on the toilet bowl with their feet,btohqsg
that sounds like a lot... going on at once,btohqsg
people are going to make conspiracy theories about how seab is putting laxatives in candidates' food to sabo them if this keeps up,btohqsg
whatever they were eating before hand,btohqsg
but i still think it's funny,btohqsg
hopefully these ppl get 24+ for their el paper 1 essay,btohqsg
Yeah very nice of the person to make ppl laugh tho,btohqsg
the megathreads in general are funy,btohqsg
In uni I‚Äôve brought food into my midterm tests before,btohqsg
i thoroughly enjoyed the students sending death threats to chen and zhu,btohqsg
will the A1 mark for Amath be very high,btohqsg
this is the first time i'm seeing mixed reactions to an amath papdr,btohqsg
‚ÄúCambridge so horny even the paper got hard‚Äù,btohqsg
so many people are saying they did very well though,btohqsg
No dude there's still ppl who fucked up,btohqsg
"half of them are like ""SEABabe and Cutebridge""and the other half is going ""SEABitch and Scambridge""",btohqsg
I think some people are worried cuz it was ‚Äòtoo easy‚Äô to moderation might be more strict,btohqsg
Also Reddit not a good rep,btohqsg
Worry abt SS and physics if u take,btohqsg
Sry ah if I sound mean,btohqsg
Someone said that a student went to the toilet with a stomachache but gave birth in the toilet stall,btohqsg
I'm tryna convince myself that too,btohqsg
sorry idk where i was going with that,btohqsg
someone have her period on the E math P2,btohqsg
Unlike me who purposefully has to take laxatives in the midst of papers,btohqsg
lets make predictions on what will happen next paper,btohqsg
Wait till we get a piss one,btohqsg
lets just say the markers will be seeing red,btohqsg
Before they even start marking :),btohqsg
Yeah  I know but I did make that joke yesterday  but what do you mean on the paper 2,btohqsg
someone have her period during E math paper 2,btohqsg
A lot would‚Äôve  but I don‚Äôt get the difference or horror story there.,btohqsg
At least before 2019  I think.,btohqsg
it awkward for a guy to say it,btohqsg
OMG GUYS I FUCKED UP I NEVER GO TOILET BEFORE PAPER SO I HAD TO PISS SUPER BADLY DURING THE ENTIRE PPR. END UP I HAD TO RUN TO THE TOILET BUT I PISSED MYSELF  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL. IT WAS SO EMBARRASING I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH HALF THE PAPER BECAUSE I HAD TO CHANGE ALL MY SHIT. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è YOU ARE WELCOME FOR THE BELLCURVE BOOST,btohqsg
this will be how the story will look like,btohqsg
I DAMN TEMPTED TO SEND SOME WEIRD SHIT NOW,btohqsg
Its only awkward if you make it awkward and don‚Äôt you study biology from your crush?,btohqsg
I mean it awkward of what,btohqsg
Okay  but in all seriousness  I don‚Äôt think that uncontrollable bladder incontinence is something to tease others about.,btohqsg
I need you to rephrase please.,btohqsg
touch somewhere. and discovered in her skirt.,btohqsg
and she just sat down during the whole duration of the paper,btohqsg
she did not went to the toilet I think,btohqsg
then she had to try and wipe it with the scrap paper they give,btohqsg
How do you even know that,btohqsg
Um. Why not just go change?,btohqsg
the comments of the emath p2 rigjt,btohqsg
the person's account is gone now for some reason,btohqsg
Why would she share it then,btohqsg
got to do what you can for that reddit karma,btohqsg
Thank you for revealing to us that private fact of your crush,btohqsg
seeing the success of the throwaway account now everybody want to follow their steps,btohqsg
We usually do? Like  I still don‚Äôt get why she‚Äôd sit there and just watch it drip.,btohqsg
BOD maybe cuz she didn‚Äôt wanna waste time,btohqsg
Either she doesn‚Äôt keep track or hers is seriously irregular,btohqsg
I know period is actually really unexpected,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why we use the theory of in omnia paratus?,btohqsg
I send her about the girl having her period during P2.,btohqsg
And chose to instead waste time trying to cover it up and squirming in discomfort,btohqsg
OK can we change the topic,btohqsg
good price and food not bad,btohqsg
don‚Äôt go in expecting a lot,btohqsg
yeah i think the price is fair for the food,btohqsg
lie 590 for a decent plate of carbonara,btohqsg
i was very surprised when i first saw the prices ngl,btohqsg
but ye their value is good,btohqsg
"at that time i assume all the ""western"" places are very atas and must have at least $7+ for their meals",btohqsg
i used to think carbonara was made with cream,btohqsg
I only like the legit kind,btohqsg
only last year i found out it's with egg yolk,btohqsg
once i saw someone try to make carbonara,btohqsg
i haven't actually tried pesto b4 but a particular foodtuber always sings high praises for it so,btohqsg
basically you grind basil leaf  pine nuts and basil together,btohqsg

at least i'm assuming it's sage,btohqsg
It was an Italian place in I think Switzerland,btohqsg
Italian restaurants in Europe is as common as like cai fan here lol,btohqsg
i nvr go out of asia before,btohqsg
