Ok. Next time I will try . So normally for this u will use your amex for the 1.7% cb?,btohqsg
Previous I use grab now Nerf so. Switch to Amex,btohqsg
If amex nerd I willl go else,btohqsg
Unless they don't accept amex pay then u use grabpay ?,btohqsg
1) only if there is third party payment app like favepay  liquid pay or shopback pay and u linked the citiback cashback+ card to the third party app. Actually can use other cards to get more than 1.6%.2) think live fresh can get 5% under online if linked to shopback pay or liquid pay  but favepay excluded.,btohqsg

1)Which card do u recommend for qr payment to earn more than 1.6%?2)  so by using liquid pay it will change the qr transaction to online payment ?,btohqsg
Because I am planning to get DBS fresh/UOB evol(online and mobile contactless)+ Amex/grab (for insurance n bills and other big ticket items)So I am thinking how to get cashback for those sgqr and paynow qr haha,btohqsg
I think I can link dbs fresh live to paylah and use it from there,btohqsg
But I think it will be consider as otherspending (0.3% cb),btohqsg
Oh dbs pay Lah can link to credit card?,btohqsg
And deduct ffom credit card ? Think points willl be gimped,btohqsg
U also got similar situation as Mine,btohqsg
Eh I think can't . Still checking,btohqsg
Maybe can use liquid pay  but not sure how the cashback works for that one,btohqsg
Iiquid pay the redeem stuff saw review say it's cmi or got issues,btohqsg
Guess is not as established as grabGrab redemption quite smooth,btohqsg
But will get cashback on the card itself? If I use eg dbsfresh ?,btohqsg
I used to pay ntuc insurance no point before nerf using grabU can get point neh,btohqsg
it is just a conduit to get card benefits for linked cards  no need care about what redemption,btohqsg
Can't but u can get cashback from topping up grab using amex card,btohqsg
Citi PayAll : how's the service fee calculated? By per payment? How many % ?,btohqsg
fave/shopback/liquid pay converts to online  can get rewards for online cards; except DBS excludes favepay,btohqsg
U mean DBS exclude fave for eligible cashback ?,btohqsg
If just a conduit u can still use grab,btohqsg
Yup grab still can earn Cashback from amexNow only amex and uob amex can get Cashback ffom top up to grab wallet,btohqsg
https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/benefits/service-security/ways-to-pay/digital-wallets/amex-pay/faq.htmlCorrection non amex issues card can't user amex pay,btohqsg
Oops so long message hahahaha sorry,btohqsg
uh but only 1.5%/1.7%  should use other cards for more benefits,btohqsg
Paywave more common can pick other cards,btohqsg
Meaning if I use dbsfresh to link to liquid pay   those qr payment will be counted as online payment ? Therefore 5% cb?,btohqsg
sGQR usual small amounts lor like hawkers small f&b stalls,btohqsg
I think any card that link to it  similar to amaze ?,btohqsg
Count as what mcc this liquor pay hahahaha,btohqsg
uh answering Vincent query wrt QR  small shops may have QR and not paywave,btohqsg
Yes  concern mostly is about qr . Paywave is quite straight forward  can get 5% as mobile contactless,btohqsg
So I guess I add uob one to liquid pay it will count into its min spending like 500 1000 2000 ahahaha,btohqsg
Hi guys  anybody tried trustbank credit card?,btohqsg
What's your review on it ?,btohqsg
anyone knows which card is the best for stuff like netflix or disney +?,btohqsg
Which card to use for qoo10 purchase?$11101) uob ppv2) dbs wwmc3) citi smrt4) amex true cbDon't really need miles already as hit my quota le so not sure to use ppv/wwmc.Never start wwmc usage before as only 1 year validity...Can hit 12k smrt Cashback in 6 months time with my company ads spentSo not sure what card to use...,btohqsg
U already strike out the card yourself haha. Then use uob ppv,btohqsg
You can consider ocbc titanium if u have one,btohqsg
Basically my rule of thumb to use those with monthly cap for amount within the cap then use other like smrt or titanium (yearly cap) for amount bigger,btohqsg
Will it be better to use ShopeePay or CRMC for Shopee purchases,btohqsg
lol.I don't have ocbc titanium card lol,btohqsg
Yup that why suggest uob ppv,btohqsg
