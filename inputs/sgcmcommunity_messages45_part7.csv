Got one Hiace with R35engine too,btohqsg
When it hits 4K… will have grand lucky draw?,btohqsg
no la julian say he own for five years alr relax hahahaha,btohqsg
decided to buy a 13yo swift,btohqsg
this one is more of a need so just get a cheap one ba  coe drop then buy a better car,btohqsg
Ooooo nice! Enjoy your ride😊 swift got lots of potential to zhng hahaha-R,btohqsg
this is 2nd car so it primarily ferries only 2 ppl so cost and fuel efficient is the goal👍,btohqsg
haha keeping it stock! but will take good care of it  ceramic coating tmr!,btohqsg
Wah so fast you pampering your swift alr. Rmb to make sure the tyres are good too!-R,btohqsg
haha yeah  gonna get contiecocontact 5!,btohqsg
haha wld love to use bridgestone but this swift stock rims come with a weird tyres size LOL,btohqsg
Anyhow have this can sell to me?🙏🙏 Used before one also can as long as still have enough leftovers,btohqsg
My Honda vezel hybrid has a paddler shifter. however I did not even use once. Can say waste of money if u pay for one,btohqsg
Pictures please 😂Xavier😅You meant cruise control?,btohqsg
You zoom in at one of the picture,btohqsg
🤔🤔 apparently rs models don’t have,btohqsg
2017 model and above have I think,btohqsg
Or maybe it was an option when buying brand new but most people never take,btohqsg
But w/o paddle shifters and with cvt,btohqsg
Can’t really make use of it 😅,btohqsg
Hybrid honda is DCT.Only newer version is E-CVTPetrol is CVT. Honda civic/jade/Stepwagon 1.5 turbo is with CVT,btohqsg
Always wanted a vezel when it first came out,btohqsg
so tempted to go add the paddle shifter  make car rides more fun,btohqsg
I suggest just save up the money and change car that has it,btohqsg
Lim Lih Buay  whoever you are   good job.,btohqsg
Yes my vezel is 2016 FL version,btohqsg
The system Singapore has are not ready for EVs.Only micro EVs with the likes of BlueSG,btohqsg
At writing this appeal - yes. Not so good with doing homework before buying the car though 😅,btohqsg
Ya the dual motor only he is referring to is Tesla Model 3 performance,btohqsg
To be honest  and much as I support EVs and all they do  one can’t help but feel a little “cherry picking” here. His argument seems to suggest dual motors does not mean the max power is derived from combination of dual motors but if I understand correctly  that seems to be the case -https://www.tesla.com/en_SG/blog/tesla-all-wheel-drive-dual-motor-power-and-torque-specifications,btohqsg
I mean however it is mind boggling to see a Kona Electric paying more road tax than an Audi A5 currently.,btohqsg
As they are not even apple to apple,btohqsg
tesla is at 400+ kw  PS2 is 300,btohqsg
Wow I didn’t even know in SG got any other dual motor EVs alr apart from these 2,btohqsg
Dual Turbo car also must pay  more road tax 😂👍 using BHP 😂,btohqsg
Wah really? Tough to be in LTA tbh. Policy things arrr really hard to do.,btohqsg
Ya now the Kona EV is about 1.4K aft the adjustment,btohqsg
Singaporeans still need to submit this?,btohqsg
I go read more about this while I sit by my rickshaw awaiting and thinking about accessory mods like@SGCM_AdminMiss Ronaldo.,btohqsg
No logic right. The A5 more polluting but pay less road tax than the Kona,btohqsg
Coz road tax based on cc and power mah. That sounds equitable no? Like drive more powerful car should pay more road tax? Sorry ah… maybe me simple thinking this coz I don’t own car.,btohqsg
If Singapore wants to truly embrace EV  a separate tax system must be imposed rather than using existing tax system designed for combustion engine to try to fit for EVs.,btohqsg
Yay! Hopefully open up more jobs for us in LTA. I apply many times le but they never call me up.,btohqsg
