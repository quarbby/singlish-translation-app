In biz after Asian financial crisis where the YEN skyrocketed we diversified to import from a range of countries using different currencies. If 2 choices to import a certain product we tried to even out our imported source,btohqsg
No choice.. specially SgOther alternative.. India.. hard.. shipping cost.. delivery was time.. not stable..whole container disappeared also able to be happen..,btohqsg
That is why singapore no choice have to be friends with as many countries as possible to spread out the risk sometimes even if hv to eat humble pie lor but I think no one ever expected a global lockdown,btohqsg
As a worker better.. hais.8 to 5 go home. Monthly salary..,btohqsg

Pregnant women at higher risk of severe Covid-19 complications  urged to get vaccinated: MOH“Perhaps this was because of a concern that the vaccine might affect their ability to get pregnant  or that the vaccine would harm the fetus ” MOH’s Associate Professor Kenneth Mak said. “Real world data has shown the opposite.”➡️https://tdy.sg/3CI5kyR@todayonlinesg,btohqsg

Moya Asia ($0.066/0.067)- Possible double bottom reversal set up in the making- Price have touched 2nd bottom $0.062 and reverse back into a more liquid zone (above 0.065) where it closed $0.067 about the most recent red dotted downtrend line- Results for Moya was actually good (extrapolate it  it is about 6-7 PE for FY21) making approx 40 -42 Mil Sgd  but yet threw down to flush from recent $0.073  IMO probably to do this double bottom set up and collect back cheaper from retailers.(Note: $0.062-$0.065 is an illiquid zone where there is no real actual buying or selling)- MACD about to cross up too- OBV divergence evidentIn summary  all research on this one ☝️ is pointing upwards. Flush is over. Its time.Furthermore  we are back to default work from home  which refers to increased market participation.Hence  time to watch this one closely  especially if they break above the neckline $0.072. DYODDPS: Gateway Fund investment costs in this one is about $0.095-$0.10 And they ain’t stupid money 💰,btohqsg

For listening compre.. can’t take prelim results??,btohqsg
Psle 1st paper starting 30th sep. No luxury of time. Those cannot take psle have to use prelim results. Prelim is not national standard exam. Different school different standard. Usually prelim more difficult ... no matter how you moderate  it's still not the same. Also  it's like a sportsman priming himself for competition. Some of the kids at prelim time still haven't reach their peak,btohqsg
I tot have some percentage% if the kid can’t manage It..MOE will do some adjustments.Not matter what MOE will push the students to sec?,btohqsg
I mean can’t go express steam,btohqsg
All red = fail liao lor. No chance o go normal stream also.,btohqsg
Nor matter what still go sec..,btohqsg
Cannot take psle  no chance to fight for normal stream also.,btohqsg
All these really sounds like gov screw up big time... Haizz,btohqsg
The fail also have some issues the kid.. repeat is the worse results..I mean 3 subjects fail..then repeat… others depending wonder can appeal..,btohqsg
supermarket lot of ppl 2day ?,btohqsg
Might need letters from MPs for MOE to take it seriously,btohqsg
Actually if peilm n whole yrperformance. Nowadays all base on A to F..If the kid at sch good in CCA..Also have chance.,btohqsg
As I know  Moe don’t want the kid repeat in primary sch..they have to push to sec..,btohqsg
Mc your kid.. in primary or sec?,btohqsg
CCS must be very angry with OYK now 🤣,btohqsg

This is from yesterday's ST. Govt wait so long then implement HBL  especially when so many cases in the community. Parents also cannot keep their kids at home ... bo pian need send kids to school and kena exposed,btohqsg
How’s the evergrande situation going ?,btohqsg
This if happen so many case can’t sit for PSLE.. moe sure have another plan for kid..Coz as know.. the most repeat at sch.. kid really have health issues or slow learner then max repeat 3 times in pri sch..,btohqsg
This mess will impact the stock market soon,btohqsg
nowadays primary school syllabus very different liao lor. You go google primary school maths. see how many you can solve without using concepts you learnt in secondary school such as algebra.Their primary school science. some of the terms they learnt  i have never heard before also,btohqsg
Coz parents complain pri maths difficulties ma.. then moe take away Olympia Maths..much more easy for the kid..,btohqsg
Model - only for kid cannot ready might it..nowadays using short cut..also can’t apply more algebra..,btohqsg
PSLE streaming is a really big event for the kids... I can understand why parents are anxious over this mess and potential unfairness... Given all the planning and resources poured in over a long period,btohqsg
I think moe will review the scores..So who are pelim good results able to NA.. the 3 sub red .. in between the score.. go to NT..I don’t think repeat again at PSLE.Covid get a mess..So depending the kid in pri sch..Which is express/ normal / Em3,btohqsg
"Repeat 1 more year is the worst outcome for everyone... Most likely MOE will do bell curve to group all the kids... Of course ""outliers"" will be removed...",btohqsg
Sch die die will not let the kid repeat..coz headache.. not matter what will push to sec..,btohqsg

Pri school usually the diff bet prelim and PSLE not as much as compared to O and A levels. For O levels  getting L1R5 half of prelim is not uncommon. For A levels  all red in prelim is common  esp for those top JCs. Wonder how they are going to use prelim results for O and A.,btohqsg
Furthermore  parents may pump in lots in tuitions already  so 1 more year of tuition expenses can be a big sum,btohqsg
Just when CCS thought he got an easy time being the Education Minister,btohqsg
For PSLE  no matter what likely to have a place in sec sch  so I see lesser of an issue. For O levels  results is needed to fight for limited places in JC and poly courses. Worst is A levels  with the limited vacancies in our local U,btohqsg
Hope that those P6 kids affected will be allowed to sit for a 'promotion' exam either early in Sec 1 or at the end of Sec 1  to transfer streams or schools or otherwise.,btohqsg
NowadaysIf NA- results get below 12 Ponit.. the kid able to apply the sit foundation poly.. so the won’t flight got sit to other after take O level.Won’t fight with smart students. Very comparative..They call PFP.. I mean all the kid still have chance..,btohqsg

Oh  I don't know the details  just a general view,btohqsg
Don't think the group will collapse. But shareholders will get back nothing or almost nothing  and the bond/bank will need to take a big cut for the rescue. Priority will go to the public who bought their unfinished properties.,btohqsg

Make it where.. there's no end destination,btohqsg
All stuck in this economic Ponzi scheme,btohqsg
Maybe retire in Thailand or indo with own farm,btohqsg
Surely some people cannot fit into these measurements  and be labelled failure  useless  outliers,btohqsg
There is a conspiracy theory about why gov around the world purposely leave out this 800 pound gorilla,btohqsg
You ask here how many people make money from investment,btohqsg
Investment is just a better name for gambling on the direction of cash flow,btohqsg
How many really understand concept of money and currencies,btohqsg
Only a few things will give you guaranteed returns.. notes/ bonds/ dividends/interest rates. Anything else like putting money into ETFs etc there's no guarantee,btohqsg
Best is be born into rich family,btohqsg
Enough is relative. Need to be contented. Else how to be happy,btohqsg
No choice.. who don’t want  their kid.. better educate..By the end of the day.. the kid benefit not the parents..My view is education so important for the kid future..Some kid is slow learner parents should but more effort..they might not good in pri.. after sec they did very well.. so all have to balance..so can’t blame the kid.. stay positive for the kid as a parents..Also depending individual..,btohqsg
Who is to say SG's focus is good for the kid  or is it more for the country?,btohqsg
Is it worth giving up a childhood for..,btohqsg
Why art and literature not in focus?,btohqsg
Why playing soccer is considered not good for future?,btohqsg
What happens if the kid is ONLY good in Arts or Sports?,btohqsg
SG only recognize Olympic level talents,btohqsg
Do you know.. wanna enter to sg sport sch.. psle.. point.. have to meet the requirements..Moe give a lot f choice depending the kids able to get it or not .. everyone have chance..,btohqsg
So far  no wonder I don't know,btohqsg
How to get in? Based on results or sports?,btohqsg
Psle result n ccaNot easy lor.. need test,btohqsg
Normal school fees or independent schools fees,btohqsg
Not sure .. the swimming poolOlympic size indoor..Even stay there mon to fri..Moe done a lot of things.. just that ppl still complaining..I should said moe done very well ..,btohqsg
Sg JC Toh .. a lot .. coz Student smart think study jc no Ponit ..all now taken up the poly course. Very competitive.. nowadays..,btohqsg
Study so hard in JC just to compete in limited places in Uni,btohqsg
If can finish poly and afford overseas uni education,btohqsg
Can shorten course due to lesser modules,btohqsg
Some of the richer... people I've seen.. after secondary school.. go uni straight. Take bridging course one year,btohqsg
That the reason moe see this happen.. unfair with the NA n NT..So they come out PFP..,btohqsg
And save 1 year some more!,btohqsg
Every 5 to 10 moe will change the view ..specially pri sch..just can’t fit everyone what to do.. some parents Mis understand.. hais,btohqsg
In pri sch .. just 4 sub..Math is every yr complaining difficult.. Olympiad n thinking maths taken down still complaining difficulty..,btohqsg
Fruit punch for a cool afternoon,btohqsg
What is all these? Olympiad and thinking maths  never hear before. For super smart students only is it?,btohqsg
I thought only got 1 maths subject  then get A* A B or C?,btohqsg
I agree. In fact neighbourhood school Teachers may be more conscientious than big name schools where they expect you hv tuition after school,btohqsg
Actually the idea of streaming is good. They stigma happens because of the way people behave towards it.,btohqsg
Coz in psle .. at least have 3 to 5 questions of Olympiad n thinking questions.. marks in between 3 to 5 marks..,btohqsg
Different child even adults learn at different pace n hv different aptitude so can assign the right teacher n right pace n attention to each kid in class isn’t that good n logical? Again it is the parents n outside people lah,btohqsg
Exactly  that's why I said is individual's perspectives. It allows students to grow at their own speed as everyone develops at different speed,btohqsg
Yup! Moe try a lot of way to balance the pri sch students but not in sec..,btohqsg
Oic  u know the syllabus so well,btohqsg
Not everyone is called to be a doctor  a lawyer etc. Some aptitude is artist  musician  cook etc … as long as you do your best and achieve your best in the gift n aptitude you have that is enough,btohqsg
I m in this line for so many years,btohqsg
Probably they started with pr sch n implemented the changes but for sec not yet implement may be but we all know this is Govt direction bcos they hv been making known these few years,btohqsg
Coz pri they can try n test..Sec is balance in between,btohqsg
Only those in this line can vouch the truth. Don’t just listen to hear say that is falsely spread on social media n grape vine Haiz,btohqsg
Some parents are making their kids achieve their dreams  what they were not able to. They push for perfect score  thinking it's for better future  never understand is the learning process and values that are more important in life,btohqsg
Do you know my students very capable.. very happy with them..,btohqsg
Even they come with not rich family.. they really working hard.. in pri sch..,btohqsg
Exactly n for their own face. Of course every parent wants the best for their kids but their kids may not be cut of for the best the parents hope mah so hv to accept reality.,btohqsg
So true then their poor kids get stressed n mental problems Haiz worst get burnt out hate to study,btohqsg
Yes  and they don't understand that a happy childhood prepare the child to better face future challenges,btohqsg
Children grow up playing are more creative,btohqsg
Ya sad. I see very few parents inculcate good moral values to their kids which is much more important,btohqsg
This need a lot of encouragement n support..That time all the kid come look for me.. a lot of issues.. but after they listen to me. At least never go hair wire.,btohqsg
Wow God bless you. The worst are parents shield their kids from being corrected when their kids do wrong. Teachers get frustrated n parents you failed in your parenting. Then there are parents who don’t allow their kids to experience knocks in life how their kids learn to overcome failure n stand up again to press forward in life,btohqsg
I did a lot.. after I move .. then let go everything..,btohqsg
See those kids got poor results go jump down. What is the big deal to fail an exam compared to life,btohqsg
Some kid the parents fight at home.. they come look for me.. poor things..,btohqsg
I teach them maths.. spot questions for psle.. haha,btohqsg
That is bcos poor or no parenting at home,btohqsg
I don't know cc have such service,btohqsg
After me I think no more..,btohqsg
I totally agree. Poor or no parenting,btohqsg
I just want to help them..,btohqsg
Aiyo so sad. What a loss 😩☺️,btohqsg
Where go there.. a lot ppl know me.. haha,btohqsg
Which year they have this service?,btohqsg
Some how singapore lost people like you n lack reasoning keep blaming n blaming anyhow aiyo cannot stand it some times,btohqsg
Just that.. I happy that time..Then I start my biz open tuition center… haha,btohqsg
You open tuition center at bt merah?,btohqsg
Now no more? Tuition not easy to do,btohqsg
So short  got reno cannot even breakeven,btohqsg
I let go anything student n teacher .. earnings,btohqsg
I know very Will of pri sch questions.. so most of the material I did myself..at start without student scare man..,btohqsg
3 mth later break even.. hahaThen you guy talk about birds .. remind me last time the tuition center next door sell birds.. headache,btohqsg
My Life is just a roller coaster.. 😄😄,btohqsg
Yes lol. I thought you only eating this for dinner I was like huh?,btohqsg
Singapore biz biggest headache n cost are rental n manpower. Give tuition ar students’ home or groups of students at their homes more profitable,btohqsg
Yup! Can be done.. just I choose to let go..Then start for another opportunity haha..,btohqsg
Aiyo you really. Cannot like this leh. Lol,btohqsg
Haha..360 deg change to do other biz..,btohqsg
Ya Lor I so confused by you 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Must think carefully then if convinced move forward bravely aim towards your target mah,btohqsg
Just I listen to God.. he ask me to let go.. will open up another opportunity. Now I still run biz..haha,btohqsg
Why keep change n change within so short time? 😩😂,btohqsg
Hmmm then it is likely God did not prompt you to open tuition centre in the first place lor 😂 maybe you wilfully started it is it? Lol,btohqsg
I try try .. start see how capable m I.. I run 8 moths .. let go teacher n 80 students.. profit already.. more over the sec some changes.. I m not good in sec .. so decided let go..,btohqsg
Ok lah.. have another opportunity for me..,btohqsg
If God confirmed you to start tuition centre then He will surely see you through on the long run mah. And you can just do primary sch students leh. Enough to earn already. Sometimes biz too big is no good: bigger more expenses but profit not proportional. In fact more things to manage. Small is good sometimes,btohqsg
Very hard to look for English teacher..this 8 maths most of them friends n NTU student.,btohqsg
Then God was telling you from beginning no go lor bcos all pre conditions not there 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Bcoz I am Christian too I can discuss this with you like this hope you don’t mind. 🙏😂,btohqsg
No worries.. God love me provide a lot of good way..,btohqsg
God open another door for me.. currently still run the biz.. haha“ Let Go n Let God”,btohqsg
Wow.. in Asia only sg able to do it..,btohqsg
Brother  you are full time trader  or you are broker  got 2 computer screens? Lol,btohqsg
Aren't the school's not doing their job? Still need tutions?,btohqsg
This Huobi is manage by ??china company,btohqsg
Sometimes it is the parents lah. My own view if all parents don’t send their children for tuition then all kids progress by themselves all will hv less stress n save lots of money bcos no competition amongst kids caused by parents. But I suppose this is an inherent Asian issue,btohqsg
Some sch different write up..So Neigborhood sch sometimes did not cover so much.. depending the teacher too.. tuition kid get more knowledge out of the sch.. something will be different,btohqsg
Well it's become an issue! It wasn't like that before. The children going for tutions were considered to be duffers!,btohqsg
Audit laborious job leh  got time to trade? Lol,btohqsg
Audit is simple. Just add all the No's. And give marks one to ten.,btohqsg
Indeed.. some students can’t get to the point.. you imagine class 40 students. How much the teacher can help..,btohqsg
Bcos our parents like to compare their kids’ results with others mah end up competition lor then kids suffer. Haiz. Before less bcos most parents cannot financially afford now most earn much more so can spend on tuition lor to compete,btohqsg
True. I used to take my daughter to the school bus stop and heard a mother telling her small boy. ' I want 90%'. Haha!,btohqsg
I say you are brilliant 👍,btohqsg
They compare because still concern..If the students can’t might it 90% marks.. parents need to balance yourself for your own kid..To encourage more for your own kid.. non of then perfect..,btohqsg
Anyway the auditors are paid by the company. So.they better do as the management say.. or else?,btohqsg
You worry your kid.. doesn’t matter my view is focus of English language.. after the sec you will see the difference..You might can’t see the light of pri .. but sec will be change.,btohqsg
Even if this is true then Teachers will take more time to explain n teach the class so it will be clear syllabus cannot be too heavy. But parents give kids tuition then teachers think students can learn so much so end up syllabus gets heavier n parents continue to give their child tuition.,btohqsg
The problem is top 20 sch n Neigbor sch.. different syllabus,btohqsg
Ya. That is why I get real upset people keep blaming Govt when it is themselves who cause the problems. Don’t compare too much lah. Be contented n do your best,btohqsg
English is difficult even the English people don't know English properly. That's why they have grammar schools!,btohqsg
Yes  after all the beautiful plans  lack of good teachers. If school teachers good  why would parents spend money on tuition? Waste time  waste money,btohqsg
Later can get tuition for kid in poly n University? They must learn how to study by themselves leh.,btohqsg
Yup! Just focus in grammar will do.. this is work .. I have done with my students before..ready story book.,btohqsg
Teach them to think..why how when ..,btohqsg
What you mean pls? Even if syllabus different then parents put child in the Schs their child can cope lor why face so impt,btohqsg
They will be change no worries..after their o level,btohqsg
Exactly. These skills to learn in primary n secondary sch days mah,btohqsg
Best is to do the Irish way . Perfect English,btohqsg
The parent should ask himself  last time you can or not,btohqsg
Is it? No lah auditors follow Mgt say meh? 🤔,btohqsg
Coz the syllabus some parents can’t teach.. so some tuition center can provide..,btohqsg
Teach them . Start at home. Babies.  Play good classical music for them,btohqsg
Depending how capable is.Coz you have to understand kid what they like..,btohqsg
I have a friend last time teach Econs tuition to a uni student,btohqsg
I don't even like to say kid. Kid is an young one of a goat. Child is better English,btohqsg
So if you wanna to look for tutorials.. I teach you the way..,btohqsg
Aiyo 😂😂😂 so dependent on tuition once come out society to work how to know how to keep learning to upgrade? They kept depending on others to feed them Haiz,btohqsg
Actually a lot of kiasu parents  I really don't understand why need send pri school kids to tuition without letting them learn to be independent,btohqsg
Let said math right.. just ask you child to look for a question alway can’t might it. Let the tutor to teach.. if your child understand between less than 5 min.. then you can have this tutor.. haha,btohqsg
Primary school syllabus not that difficult,btohqsg
Exactly Haiz. Now even kindergarten child also got tuition 😩,btohqsg
Are you teaching yourself or u get teachers to teach?,btohqsg
Even secondary school  don't understand why need tuition,btohqsg
Last time my tuition center I teach maths.. I have 13 teachers,btohqsg
So u teach maths only  must be maths expert,btohqsg
I just did all in problems sum..I wrote my own questions.,btohqsg
So those living in the north need pri maths tutor can find you ☺️,btohqsg
That time so silly wanna come out the book..,btohqsg
Maths is practice n practice. Learn the basic formulas. If you practice really practice. Then you see the question band know the answer. Without even doing long calculations. This is true even for professional exams,btohqsg
Ya I learn it the tough way too but fortunately did not lose money just lose the size of profit. Haiz,btohqsg
Btw  I took Further Maths in JC last time,btohqsg
I did not teach many year.. sometimes commuter side asking me go back.. I have no time..,btohqsg
But this primary school maths  don't think I can do,btohqsg
Just teach in layman way will do.,btohqsg
But I heard after my days they introduced understanding English language to solve maths problem,btohqsg
Oh wow you big timer leh 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Think u same as me. Further Maths no problem. This pri sch maths can't do their modelling way,btohqsg
I would love to do maths again.,btohqsg
Can lah just need to digest the language lor 😂,btohqsg
Just teach the few topics will do..But have to understand your child able to do or not..A lot of methods.. so parents feel very difficult so send to tuition…Move over teach own kid not easy too..,btohqsg
Yeah a good auditor has excellent observation skills. Can feel n smell the wrongs.  Looks like you have those skills. Good on you sir,btohqsg
You’ve encountered much n seen much mah,btohqsg
good to walk away from it 👍,btohqsg
I really love this chat group. Topics are so varied. So many experts sharing experiences,btohqsg
Just have to see what the auditors found out in Malaysia about the glove factory workers living in horrible conditions. What happened . Nothing. Business as usual!,btohqsg
Street education is best. Learn to live. Learn to fight.,btohqsg
Who will make your coffee la?,btohqsg
Most of the times  the bosses of auditors are in some form of relationship with the company they are auditing,btohqsg
Can't screw up those relationships by checking too much,btohqsg
I wanna teach personal finance and/or Automation. Anyone got lobang?,btohqsg
Ethics and integrity in business is only in class rooms!,btohqsg
FM completed MC in just 1 year  right?,btohqsg
Automation is super. Learn logic first!,btohqsg
Robotics also a form of automation,btohqsg
Getting caught with the pants down when the music stops,btohqsg
I can't remember much except the grade on my cert... hahaha,btohqsg
Our pap Ivan Lim also kena,btohqsg
That one ah... Reaping bad karma,btohqsg
I dropped FM after 1st year  and didn't need to study MC... Machiam only 2 subjects left,btohqsg
I remembered the MC tutor very scared of us... Because we were there to audit her work real time.,btohqsg
My college very funny  for FM students  we don't have to attend MC lessons. So they teach together....,btohqsg
Stock operator as in broker. Or bookie. Or gambling house. They are the only ones who make money. Charge us for every trade,btohqsg
But we have 2 FM teachers  teaching different topics concurrently,btohqsg
2 subjects can have full A level cert?,btohqsg
Can... Mine 2 full 1 half,btohqsg
Actually I blur  don't know what is MC and FM  just go lecture  do tutorial,btohqsg
Ya lor  no difference... All maths,btohqsg
Yes  for FM studends  MC close eyes also A,btohqsg
But the good/bad tutor made a difference,btohqsg
I left statistics blank  also A,btohqsg
I really cannot understand probability that time,btohqsg
You still can remember all these but think I completed almost every questions,btohqsg
Yes  it was a big bet for me  so I remembered,btohqsg
I thought is 3 H2 and 1 H1,btohqsg
I used the extra time to double check all the remaining answers definitely correct,btohqsg
I decided to drop bio and took FM after 3 months...After I fell asleep in the bio lesson  which was the first class of the day.,btohqsg
I  took 4 A levels subjects  after 3 mths  I dropped econs. Left 3 subjects,btohqsg
FM tutors didn't like me  and recommended I drop in 2nd year,btohqsg
2nd year I was so carefree,btohqsg
I said bcos you are brilliant mah … n I’m sure hard work too lah. Your fighting spirit to succeed n not give yourself excuses to fail bcos you lazy,btohqsg
Actually the teacher teaching you in the lingo or way you can understand is very important. Even if the teacher is PHD or teach some students well but lingo not understood by you you also cannot catch his/her point,btohqsg
Hi hi glad to see you back 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Yes  on hindsight  years later when I touch on stats again  I realised that it takes 2 hands to clap,btohqsg
Yes. I used to give part time tuition during my army days ($89/month). If my student could not understand my teaching I had to change another angle to explain until he could understand. Every one understands differently,btohqsg
Actually I also hate bio. The terms are so Foreign bcoz I bad with language 😩,btohqsg
Me too lah. My time worse taught in mandarin sec  n English sec 4 😩. Ops now my age exposed 😂😂😂,btohqsg
