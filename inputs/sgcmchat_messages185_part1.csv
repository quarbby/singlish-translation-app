no leh  Sargeant gonna win SG Gp ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…,btohqsg
Unless u able to identify any unique decal or something,btohqsg
probably some chao yp or fucktard uncle tbh,btohqsg
his car has no decals on it   all i know it was a middle aged man driving it,btohqsg
Not to me   but to my mum and sister . they arenâ€™t used to fast pace driving   they had panic and anxiety attacks while i was being poked from woodlands sle to punggol,btohqsg
We will encounter such driver quite often  sometimes just have to suck it up and let it slide,btohqsg
i couldnt   he was pushing me to run 130/140 on busy traffic thereâ€™s cars everywhere . Occasionally i did changed from lane 1 and 2 he just continued to follow me,btohqsg
Some drivers think they big fuxk  always bully others otr,btohqsg
i donâ€™t think we can find the driver here  but do install a rear view cam if you think itâ€™s needed,btohqsg
Try to note down plate number next time when u encounter similar incident,btohqsg
Tats the best way to locate Liao,btohqsg
i agree   i just donâ€™t understand why poke ppl with family members inside ðŸ˜‚ i mean if i were to be alone i wouldâ€™ve closed an eye . I dont think anyone understands what it feels like to drive with passengers having panic and anxiety attacks . quite stressful i must admit,btohqsg
I did   i woke up and i totally forgot it,btohqsg
Agree  but the driver might not be aware there were passengers inside,btohqsg
nope   i tried asking my sister and mum they didnâ€™t really seem to remember . 4 digit number is what they recalled,btohqsg
But if he is a regular there  might bump into him again,btohqsg
We shall wait and see ba,btohqsg
Tf he bontot u all the way?? Thatâ€™s just rude man,btohqsg
Feel sorry for ur fam bruh,btohqsg
Nvm you were with you family,btohqsg
I thought of it actually even did i once but all that did was cause more anxiety and panic attack to my  family hah so i just dealt with it . i let off throttle to alow him to pass didnâ€™t work i accelerated it didnâ€™t work i changed lane it didnâ€™t work i did what i could possibly think of nothing worked,btohqsg
I know itâ€™s annoying but try ignore him next time and drive at ur comfortable pace,btohqsg
See how long he can tahan,btohqsg
Family safety more important bro   not worth ur time playing with such driver,btohqsg
Tbh if I alone I would have done it,btohqsg
I forgot his family in the car,btohqsg
you should stay off the fucking roads,btohqsg
that is NOT a mentality anyone should have,btohqsg
you're taking 1.5 ton machines and slamming hard on the brakes on the fastest expressway in SG,btohqsg
Like I wouldn't brake like that la,btohqsg
if you don't cause an accident with the person behind  the chain reaction would.,btohqsg
But I would slow down drastically enough to tell him that I know what he's doing,btohqsg
i'm sure you're dense enough to not understand the whole point of this,btohqsg
and if there's a car behind?,btohqsg
get your class 3 then pipe in.,btohqsg
nothing hilarious about risking the safety of other road users,btohqsg
they have families and friends to return home to,btohqsg
if you can't be arsed to think about that for a second  please re-evaluate your morals and your standing in society.,btohqsg
Sorry for the bad lighting angle,btohqsg
yea i guess thats true said,btohqsg
If you are on lane 1  you better be overtaking cars on lane 2. Cause it is an overtaking lane on the expressway.If you are cruising the speed limit on lane 1  you are road hogging. Always give way to faster vehicles on lane 1 regardless of what speed you/they are going at.You can be doing 140km/hr  clear road ahead of you but if the vehicle behind is faster than you and you don't move aside  you are a road hogger.Yes road speed limit is 90km/h  by virtue that is the limit but the overtaking lane is suppose to facilitate overtaking even if speeding is required cause you will have bad road users who are on the wrong lane at the wrong speeds.If you are not overtaking anyone then don't use lane 1. If there is someone faster behind you  move off. Basic stuff and road etiquette.,btohqsg
7pm i was going at least 110 first lane   i find that reasonable . maybe Iâ€™m wrong   i dont know   whats ur opinion on the minimum speed required to be on the first lane ? and as per mentioned i did move over to lane 2 . he just continued to poke me instead of just overtaking me from lane 1 .,btohqsg
minimum speed would be overtaking speed,btohqsg
on other lanes 2 3 and 4 am i right   yes i was,btohqsg
Speed limit and higher for overtaking lane  as explained above. If you have to ask this again  means need to read the above again. There is no Minimum speeds. Only laws governing the type of lanes and max speed. If you are travelling slower than other traffic  you have to keep to the left side of the road as much as possible. It is an offence to road hog as well. That is why when you are a L plate driver. They always tell you keep leftIt is better to move off the overtaking lane and let him be. He just wasting his time. You were road hogging lane one  move off and go at speed limit at lane 2  you are fine and he is just being an r-tard if he is disturbing you.It is funny  if you were truly cautious on safety you would really use the overtaking lane with your family or passengers. Is not ideal to go over the speed limit.The other possible thing.. was your headlights on.,btohqsg
"Likewise don't understand why people respond to ""pokes"" by going for it at 130-140 with family members in the car if they aren't comfortable",btohqsg
Iâ€™ve moved over   braked   donâ€™t understand why he still tailed me,btohqsg
Why get so affected by him tailgating or poking  if you pay heed to it and react he will continue  can just ignore bah,btohqsg
drive faster till you drop him,btohqsg
Sure one person being an asshole,btohqsg
