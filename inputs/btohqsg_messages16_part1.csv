How to get electrical concealed drawings?,btohqsg
Can I rent out common room during MOP?,btohqsg
Yes any number of rooms. Just not whole flat.,btohqsg
Any idea when can block 447A be having Top? Has the main building structure built above 15 storey?,btohqsg
Correct me if I’m wrong If you’re not getting your HDB within your studies year  it shouldn’t be a problem (if you can get some job by then)If you’re getting your HDB within  then you have to find ways to offset the amount because you cannot get the keys without paying off the house.,btohqsg
If u mean get the keys then yea  I’ll most likely have been working for 3-4 years by then  currently approaching final year as well,btohqsg
Nonetheless  I think you might need to fork out 10% or 5% down payment first.Check the HDB website for the latest update.,btohqsg
during signing of lease still need pay 5% downpayment  then key collection is 15%,btohqsg
Yes i get that. And we can definitely do the down payment with no issues.Original question was regarding if anyone has experienced their loan quantum increase due to significant increase in household income (i.e. My HLE is low because it doesnt count my current income since I’m a student  but near key collection i will have worked for at least 2-3 years),btohqsg
im in the exact same situation ah  the officer said HLE amount for mine will be revised 6months prior to key collection  the current hle amount can just ignore cos im student a student.my friend also same situation  student when signing lease  hle approval XXk only  then just collect keys last month hle approve to max 520k.,btohqsg
Ah okay sounds the same on my side as well  thanks!,btohqsg
