For DBSWWMC is calendar month or statement month,btohqsg
if i pay something today it is considered transaction date ?,btohqsg
It depends on the merchant also... Sometimes they post it late. So i think depends on the date listed in your banking app,btohqsg
Hihi does anybody knows if I earn 4mps for purchasing scoot air ticket by UOB Platinum visa ?,btohqsg

Hi if anyone have any good recommendations on free airport lounge credit card? Prefer a card that annual fee can be waived. Saw some free lounge access credit card annual fee is non waivable,btohqsg
Card comes with 2 x lounge visit per Yr. If waive the Annual fee they won't give you the 10k miles,btohqsg
you mean there will be 10k miles give e every year I pay the annual fee?,btohqsg
But premiere miles earn rate only 1.2 per dollar,btohqsg
You can call in to Citibank every year after your annual fee is charged to have it waived,btohqsg
Is there anyway to waive citi prestige annual fee if we forfeit the renewal benefits?,btohqsg
Prestige I believe its strictly non waivable no?,btohqsg
you are essentially paying for miles,btohqsg
10k for $192 works out to be 1.9 cents or $0.019Let's say you going to japan in Jan and it cost $900  if you go by miles is 90k + $80 tax.So your 90k miles values at (900-80) = $720.0.8 cents or $0.008 per milePay VS Actual Value$0.019 vs $0.008Essentially you are overpaying for the miles. Plus if you already transfer your existing points over  you need to spend another $25 for the transfer fee.,btohqsg
Tokyo 2way now is abt 950.,btohqsg
Depends you want saver + a bit of luck or you want confirm get a seat with advantage.,btohqsg
Well... for me I will only look at saver,btohqsg
That's why people don't usually redeem for economy class flights...redeem for business or first class instead. Want economy better to buy revenue flights. More options.,btohqsg
Yes. Redeem for business or first. Totally agree,btohqsg
Yah. But I donno what is his option mah. But Japan seems to be a popular option for now. It’s just easy to calculate,btohqsg
Japan is ok but try to redeem for business or first class. Usually less than 4 hours flight miles is not good value,btohqsg
My opinion anything below 6hrs econ.,btohqsg
Econ please play for it. Wait for deals. For redeem please plan ahead.,btohqsg
My premiere miles is basically for lounge and pay annual fee for 10k miles. Day to day use 4miles per dollar card.,btohqsg
Just to clarify  I’m not the one asking whether to pay annual fee to get the 10k miles. I’m just putting numbers out there that we need to calculate how much are we paying VS how much it actually values.,btohqsg
Yes I know. I'm not faulting you too,btohqsg
However  recently I got to know a new theory. If a business flight round trip to US may cause 7K. But you will never willing to pay 7K for a business class to US. However you only willing to pay $5K.Thus should evaluate your miles according to 5K.,btohqsg
This whole thing about how much should you value your miles is a very touchy and subjective topic.,btohqsg
At the end of the day is how much you value the ticket,btohqsg
To each his own  as always. 😅🙈Everyone's mile valuation is different; I believe there's plenty of resources by multiple finfluencers on how to calculate that by now. I suggest pple new to miles to at least watch/read to understand the concept and determining your own level of value.It's tough but I had to go thru that motion myself and trust me it's worth the time investment to do that first to avoid future regrets 😅Very sensitive topic indeed,btohqsg
Need to do more homework than just cash back,btohqsg
Ever since the nerf of grab and CDC. I'm no longer in the cashback game since I cant hit the minimum spend every month. So now i changed my strategy to points/miles as what Chris shared in his single CC video. And also I'm entering a new phase in new life that gotten me to be interested in miles game.,btohqsg
… higher expenditure in your fam ? Sounds like a good time to go miles,btohqsg
CDC as in vouchers or crypto?,btohqsg
Might want to travel more with my partner in the future. So thinking of collecting miles first. CRMC has expiry of 5 years from card activation. So not a issue for me.,btohqsg
Although it’s my understanding that all points expire 5 years from the first issue of the card  after 5 years there will be a new round of Citi Thankyou points to earn  let’s hope there’s still time,btohqsg
Haha  will review again in 5 years time. Maybe I'll need more cashback instead,btohqsg
Yea that is the case with crmc.When transfer to krisflyer  u get another 3 years anyway,btohqsg
Anyone know if any promo for Citibank credit card now?,btohqsg
On the other hand  Citi Premiermiles supposedly has no miles expiry - with a $25+ transfer fee,btohqsg

till 3 months after card expiry,btohqsg
Hello  Honey Money Fam! I heard from a friend that he transferred all his savings into Trust Bank App and he is getting about $80 returns from the app every month based on his $60k savings. My question is... is this the best app to get returns monthly?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anybody knows why I'm not able to use my SC smart card overseas? It failed in Vietnam and now Thailand. Extremely frustrating and a little embarrassing. Card is activated and I have more than enough available limit.,btohqsg
What did your bank say regarding the declined transactions?,btohqsg
Seems like your friend is just earning the base 1.5% rate. SIF GoSavers account has a base rate of 2.5% for first $100k.,btohqsg
Say if I only have 5k to save  will you suggest that I go with Trust Bank then?,btohqsg
If u are a salaried worker  wouldn't going to any of the mainstream banks be way better now? E.g. Uob one and ocbc 360,btohqsg
I would suggest GoSavers as long as you can maintain at least $1000 in the account,btohqsg
i will go with trust bank  and with 5 tx/ or ntuc member u get up to 2.5%vsother local banks that require u to have salary crediting + credit card spending + insurance + home loan + investment etc etc etc,btohqsg
assuming you're not willing to jump through any hoops to earn higher interest,btohqsg
Insured under SDIC up to $75k,btohqsg
Every month need to have 5tx? Or one month?,btohqsg

I don’t know 😂I relied on the SDIC insurance up to $75k,btohqsg
It is not easy to get a licence to operate a bank. Should be safe,btohqsg
The sdic insurance is only up to 75k per acc holder for SGD deposit. If you are concern of bank collapse  don't go beyond 75k. If you are concern on FD rates will still increase  then can think of short term FD. Of course interest rate can go the other way. Preferably funds in fd should not be funds that you will need it readily.,btohqsg

you still need to follow the MCC,btohqsg
Just pretend you go mcdonald  instead of order thru kiosk or cashier (offline retail/contactless)  you can order thru the mc mobile app (online transaction).What i would like to think is that Amaze pretends to be a online/app version of whatever merchants you trying to spend on.,btohqsg

Would recommend POSB everyday card for utilities spend (4-5% Cashback) and for sheng siong (7% Cashback currently). No min spend required for both categories.,btohqsg

Update:LiquidPay reply but I’m getting them to confirm when will system be up and running. Anyone managed to use LiquidPay via credit card these days?,btohqsg
Just to update on liquidpay payment linked to CC  I tried it today at a food court by scanning the SG QR code at the stall and it seems to be working again. Payment went through 😊,btohqsg
mobile contactless (applepay/samsung pay/gpay etc) or physical card paywave or online. MCC in whitelist,btohqsg
What I encountered for LiquidPay recently is that the system is unstable. When error is encountered  I just try again and it'll work on 2nd or 3rd try.,btohqsg
Another quick question. Did I earn the cashback if I were to pay using amex pay(amex version of paylah),btohqsg
Oh physical cars paywave eligible for 4mpd? Can check on their ibanking portal for points? Like CRMC,btohqsg
no lah  where to get Amex logo on QR for this,btohqsg

Just wanna be sure  TELCO bills like M1 SingTel Gomo are not excluded from CRMC 4mpd?I read the T&C  gas and electricity are excluded though.,btohqsg

GOMO recurring is included for maybank family and friends (data category). Not sure about CRMC though,btohqsg
GOMO recurring should be considered online spend and can be counted for DBS WWMC 4mpd,btohqsg
Can use posb everyday card for Geneco 5% Cashback no min spend. But not recommended for dining cos dining need min $800 monthly spend for only 3% cashback.,btohqsg

So which date should I refer to on Citi Rewards Points Summary page?,btohqsg
I understand there is a transaction date and posted date.,btohqsg
not sure on this. Usually I will take note of the before and after for the points reflection at the top of the app.,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I will just wait for Citi bank officer to revert and confirm.,btohqsg
A quick check leads me to just clicking the drop down under your name and clicking on points summary.,btohqsg
The page will not tell you which line is what transaction. You will have to decipher it yourself.,btohqsg
Thanks Jazz  will try to check immediately next time after purchase is made.,btohqsg
But… if possible  just subscribe icloud via telco,btohqsg
In the points summary  there should be an entry on the transaction's posted date. (Probably around 12 Dec)See if it is just 1 point credited  or 1 point + 9 additional points. If the latter  means it qualifies for 10x points.,btohqsg
Don't think u can just sign up icloud via Telco unless u buy a iphone from them,btohqsg
oh i didnt know that.... my bad,btohqsg
Once buy a new iphone drom telco the most is a f 1yr sub Depends on promotion then u got to settle own self mostly is free few months,btohqsg

hi all  can i seek advice on this. For those using UOB One CC. Can i check if e.g in a quarter  1st 2 months i spent >2k  but the 3rd month i only spent 1k  the quarterly cashback given will be based on 1k tier spending? or do i get nth at all as it wasn't consistent. 2K  2K  1K,btohqsg

Hi. Does buying air ticket and booking hotel via UOB one or ocbc 365 cc eligible for cashback ?,btohqsg

Oh nooo  then need to apply for other cards liao,btohqsg
Amex truecashback is it a good card?,btohqsg
Does insurance company consider Financial Institutions? if it does then maybank not eligible,btohqsg
Even if u apply this card  you can’t directly pay the insurers since most don’t accept Amex direct payments. You’ll need your grabpay card to circumvent thatFor Amex TCB  you have to top up grabpay wallet (for 1.5% cashback) then use the grabpay Mastercard to process payment (via e-AXS maybe)Even though you pay direct via master or visa credit cards and not grabpay   those cards explicitly exclude payments to insurance companies from cashback in their TnC,btohqsg
So paying insurance premium is for Maybank visa platinum,btohqsg
Lol okay I think misunderstandingBy lowest tier I mean $1k cos her lowest spending is $1k,btohqsg
Actually if we pay in full yearly  the insurance premium is 2% cheaper  is this true,btohqsg
Can I check if purchase of NTUC voucher qualify for the min $500 spend?,btohqsg
when u apply online it’s single acc.how to withdraw money- they will send u a physical card within 7 working days & once u activate ur card u can go to an ocbc atm  put in ur card  enter ur pin & withdraw ur money..Not sure abt the taxes sorry,btohqsg
yes annual payment usually cheaper cos u pay at start of year,btohqsg
U need to first go singtel transfer to your name,btohqsg
Use amex true cashback>grabpay master card>axs(insurance),btohqsg
then maybe this is better than using visa platinum  unless you really want to split into 12 months,btohqsg
Generally yearly premium is cheaper then monthly premium of u add up,btohqsg
Why cant we pay in full using credit card?,btohqsg
How to bypass grab wallet top up limit of 5k,btohqsg

Have anyone found out the best way to top up shopee,btohqsg
A noob question. Am I right to say CRMC with Amaze will convert most transactions to online transactions so to earn the 4mpd  except for travel related MCC?,btohqsg
I do quite a fair bit of contactless payment,btohqsg
Just wondering CRMC or HSBC Revo is better for me (paired with amaze),btohqsg
Yes correct. I would say CRMC for your contactless payments and HSBC revo for travel spending,btohqsg
btw hsbc revo cannot pair with Amaze,btohqsg
But payment upfront lose out in interest. Time value of money.,btohqsg
Cuz its visa! Sorry I miss that,btohqsg
Hi I like to test my hypothesis. As some one who works overseas  I do not gain any tax relief topping up my CPF.  From my standpoint  I feel that I am better off directly investing into equities  and not lock my money into CPF for 2.5 - 4% interest.  Is there something I may be missing in the CPF route to FI?,btohqsg
Then don't need to top up.,btohqsg
Citi premiere miles gives 2 x lounge visit  dbs altitude visa gives 2 x lounge visit. Will it stack if I have both cards?,btohqsg
Hi  curious to know anyone has cimb Malaysia account? Linked using cimb sg. Wonder if we can withdraw ringit from cimb Malaysia atm?,btohqsg
I don't gain any tax relief either but I do still top up where possible as I have reached the FRS. It's long term to me.. current equity market is not for me bec I don't plan to add on to exceed 50% allocation in equity.,btohqsg
Yup it works. If you pay RM 8 / year for the ATM card as part of the bank account package  you can do unlimited ATM withdrawals (but most CIMB ATMs restrict you to RM 1 500 per withdrawal  so larger amounts will require you to do it multiple times),btohqsg
Someone mentioned about paying insurance premium annually instead of monthly ad there is a general 2% saving. I know there are some who pay monthly by credit card and earn the interest on savings acc due to card spending. Overall  still earn,btohqsg
iirc Revolut card can also withdraw from CIMB ATMs fee free,btohqsg
Thanks for replying JJ.Is there anyway to withdraw ringit from CIMB Msia without using that RM8/year ATM card?Additionally  is there a more cost saving way to get ringits? Thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
1) If you are a Malaysian (eg. Singapore PR) - Basic Savings Account offer the option of not paying the RM8/year  ATM withdrawals capped at 8x per month (i.e.  max RM12k withdrawal)2) (Yet to try/confirm myself) - SCB MY's Privilege Savings Account – Statement offer free annual fees as per their fee schedule. They also give fee-free ATM withdrawals within the MEPS network if you meet some conditions (smth like NETS in Singapore) - but not clear if they allow Singaporeans to open an account there,btohqsg
else is transfer to a local resident there to withdraw for you / use revolut (though rates are very slightly worse off than CIMB MY's transfer rates),btohqsg
"Thanks  JJ.1) If you are a Malaysian (eg. Singapore PR) - Basic Savings Account offer the option of not paying the RM8/year  ATM withdrawals capped at 8x per month (i.e.  max RM12k withdrawal) => Is this only for Malaysian? So for Singaporean needs to pay RM8/year.May I know how much to transfer so that we ""break even""?",btohqsg
Hi everyone  quick question. Have a joint account with my fiancee. Thinking of moving everything to UOB One to get a higher interest rate.

Hi  using this same strategy of using CRMC + Amaze for contactless payments  would HSBC revo or DBS woman's world card be preferred for travel spending?,btohqsg
1) correct. Only Malaysian Citizens are allowed toBreakeven - It's hard to justify because there are advantages in having your own Malaysian account if you do business there  or can pay with CIMB MY card instead of Youtrip  personally I would say it's worth it if you transact perhaps a few thousand MYR per month and have some local activities. Else it's a bit of a hassle to have to maintain the account and prevent it from being dormant for that few $ in savings,btohqsg
travel spending as in online flight/hotel? hsbc revo 4mpd capped for $1k monthly  dbs wwmc 4mpd capped for $2k monthly,btohqsg
Time value of money is theory   individual need to work their money. In the time of low interest rate it is good to pay annual  in time of high interest it,btohqsg

Not that there's a way I know of,btohqsg
Hmm  apparently can pay through ATM machine. Will check and update haha,btohqsg
good luck! hope that works. will probably not count as eligible spend though,btohqsg
Pretty sure they won't count it as eligible  if not they would have just allowed all their cards to be eligible in the first place 😅😅😅From what I see  credit card payments usually always by giro or bank transfer. But hopefully ur atm hack would work out!,btohqsg

You can do their cashback master card,btohqsg
I guess  the results are mixed.Not sure what’s the hidden Criterias too,btohqsg
Yeah and you can just pair it up with amaze,btohqsg
noted  i think cc with good cashback rate is always visa(live fresh  evol)  really frustrating,btohqsg
Yeah and not all accept amaze,btohqsg
it's kinda ha... because cashback+ is kinda for all catagories  so i can direcrly use it hahaha,btohqsg
At least you still can use that card oversea with amaze and still get rewarded,btohqsg
that's true! hahaha  can spend it in jb at the weekend,btohqsg

the CRMC welcome gift of 40 000 Citi ThankYouSM Points  does using Amaze card consider eligible spend ?,btohqsg
maybe cos citi rewards excludes travel and 4mpd capped for $1000. Guess some people want simplicity instead of higher cashback. Then again cashback+ is not simple cos need to sms to redeem cashback. Maybank Barcelona easier,btohqsg

Just did a google search  singsaver classified favepay as mobile wallet 👍,btohqsg
I see. What would be the best cash back for online and paywave without min spend or rebate cap?,btohqsg
Would recommend SC Spree or amaze + CRMC. No min spend and high rebate cap,btohqsg
If u can meet 600 min spend  then can consider uob evol,btohqsg
Surprised. Could it be that the favepay transaction MCC is travel related?,btohqsg
Nope! I bought kopi with it. Ill check my transaction again in a few days  hopefully the points are just not updated or smth haha!,btohqsg
The bonus points should reflect latest 1 day after the transaction is posted,btohqsg
if amaze card is in Gpay or Apple pay  does that mean same issue will occur? since they are also mobile wallets? sorry a little surprised and confused by this,btohqsg

citi rewards mastercard. can link to Amaze to expand its mcc coverage,btohqsg
I am still looking at amaze,btohqsg
only get instapoints if sign up using referral,btohqsg
I am more to miles accumulation,btohqsg
Just sign up Citi rewards card,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I can use UOB one account to giro to syfe for investments. If yes then does it count as part of the 3 giro transactions for the better interest?,btohqsg
So if add amaze to apple pay and use phone to tap  will still code as online and not mobile contactless right?,btohqsg
in the first place applepay dun support Amaze. If use Amaze on googlepay  the transaction will be online to the underlying card.,btohqsg
So to clarify  Kris+ is mobile wallet payment  while liquidpay/favepay/shopback pay is online?,btohqsg
Hi chris  any lobang on balance transfer?,btohqsg
Can i check any benefits if i use Citibank Cashback + with Amaze for local spend vs just using the card itself.,btohqsg
Any tips on insurance payment after grab nerf?,btohqsg
kris+ is online also  i.e. get 4mpd on dbs wwmc. Though citi rewards exclude online payment via mobile wallet (e.g. google/samsung/apple pay).,btohqsg
Just use the card itself. Unless u pair the citi rewards MC to amaze,btohqsg
So if i am pairing CRMC to Amaze and decide to pay for accommodation on airbnb with MCC 7991  which is not an exclusion  it will be accepted for 4MPD?,btohqsg
Any way to confirm the MCC other than googling it?,btohqsg
lock dbs card  make failed transaction  check mcc on dbs ibanking chatbot,btohqsg
Okay let me try on citi app,btohqsg
I’ll contact citibank chatbot to see if they are able to provide the MCC for Airbnb,btohqsg
They dont be able to check until transaction is made,btohqsg
Does this method of checking MCC code work for DBS debit cards as well?,btohqsg
Yes it works. I tried before,btohqsg
use locked dbs card check mcc via dbs ibanking chatbot first before making the transaction using citibank card,btohqsg
Does CRMC + Amaze card pay prudential premium via iPay can get miles point ?,btohqsg
Only Citibank Cashback+ need SMS for cashback redeem right? Citibank Cashcard don’t need right?,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Read on their website account opening only via invite. Can anyone here or Chris share invite referral? 😅,btohqsg
Currently I think there’s no referral yet.At least from what I see in the app.Although the app seems developed but some functions don’t seems to be ready yet  I think it is slowly rolling out.I.e like linking to grab account and what not,btohqsg
For sharing  seems like this is no longer a Russia roulette,btohqsg
"Invite only  you can store money in their ""savings pocket"" to earn 3.48% pa",btohqsg
Ya for now this.And daily interest gets credited,btohqsg
Any idea how to get invitation?,btohqsg
Did you get 2500 Grabpoints for linking GXS to grab?,btohqsg
No idea. I applied to be invited but still waiting,btohqsg
Hmm it depends  it’s 3.48% of not doing anything extraWhy not?,btohqsg
how to make payment from GXS account?,btohqsg
hm send money can get 1.2× grabpoints?,btohqsg
yea  so how to make payment using GXS?,btohqsg
idk  I'm not on GxS yet,btohqsg
I saw seedly gxs like not worth bothering about. Unless something has changed?,btohqsg
Any idea does paying Singtel Bill online (not recurring) considered as online spend for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
GxS is a great option for people who have no salary to credit and have less than $300 spending per month,btohqsg
You have to wait for an invite from them,btohqsg
Can register interest by leaving your contact details on GxS app,btohqsg
since uob absolute cashback cc has nerfed of grabpay  is there any need to apply for this card for 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
1.7% is still the highest unlimited cashback rate provided the place accepts Amex. Useful for big ticket purchases. But otherwise not much use,btohqsg
yes eh  it's just amex is a little nerf😂,btohqsg
Think he means Amex is 1.5% vs UOB’s 1.7% is a 0.2% nerf lol,btohqsg
Your grab wallet will have a payment option to use GXS,btohqsg
So basically grab will just directly deduct straight from GXS,btohqsg
Hi all  do yall know if I can pair HSBC revo / UOB PPV with favepay for hawker payments and still earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo should earn (counts as online)not sure about UOB PPV,btohqsg
without grab pay amex tcb is kinda nerf lah. because maybank bacelona and citi cashback+ totally peak amex true casback,btohqsg
I got my invite like start of the week,btohqsg
Though grab ran into the red it's delayed,btohqsg
But the account still limited to $5k,btohqsg
So if you max out in pocket $5k  you can’t use it anyway,btohqsg
Cause they deducted at saving account,btohqsg
yes wads the perk of gxs,btohqsg
Current is boosted earning rate for their point when using the account for grab and singtel dash and 3.82% but max out $5k,btohqsg
So must top up in cash and use it,btohqsg
Not by using credit cards like Grab,btohqsg
Yes it basically just a like a bank account link,btohqsg
You can direct deduct from GXS,btohqsg
So like this set as primary payment,btohqsg
Top up by fast transfer I guess,btohqsg
Like let say you already have money and using GXS as a bank account,btohqsg
It just direct deduct and you still earn points,btohqsg
Like a bank I guess so the card like a debit,btohqsg
Oh I try it still under invite okyl not really Open to all,btohqsg
For some who had fully utilised the $30k annual limit for grab  this UOB Abs 1.7% is still the next best option for cashback,btohqsg
Does DBS Woman's World card get 4mpd when using SimplyGo?,btohqsg
I end up with amex over uob cos the cashback given is within the same month statement while uob has to wait for next month. 1 point to consider as well.,btohqsg
eh im wondering if any foreigner has successfully apolied a maybank credit card  i apply several times  all ends up rejected. i want the platinum visa card😂,btohqsg
Ya amex so fast cash back return to u,btohqsg
U meet the requirements or maybe credit score low,btohqsg
i think my annual income is qualify. idk where to see my credit score😂,btohqsg
If u got rejected u can ask for a Free credit score,btohqsg
Maybe in SG u don't have a record to start with,btohqsg
Try apply other card first to built up your reputation,btohqsg
Pick Those u can LoR better not anyhow spam application,btohqsg
Cimb is One no fee too,btohqsg
The whole think still under beta,btohqsg
Guess so that why I didn't noticed,btohqsg
I think is they are rolling out to active users of their ecosystem for grab and singtel,btohqsg
i have applied scb smart  dbs live fresh and uob absolute  they are so smooth😂,btohqsg
Any way to still earn cashback when using youtrip? Just did a 250 usd purchase using amaze and the difference compared to youtrip abt 8 sgd sia,btohqsg
Hi Guys  can I ask  I have Grab wallet (no Grab card) & UOB Absolute. I note that Absolute > Grab wallet will be reduced from 1.7% to 0.3% on and after 15 Jan 2023. I also note that AXS can't pay by Absolute (because AMEX)  so can I check if I can just top-up  use Absolute to top-up Grab wallet to the max $30k to earn 1.7% then slowly use the wallet to make payments via AXS until the $30k is used up? Will I need to apply for the Grab card to make payment via AXS?,btohqsg
i think you will need grabpay card because we pay axs machine through mastercard,btohqsg
Grabpay card is debit card from the grab wallet is it? so technically I should be able to top-up use the Absolute card to top-up the wallet to earn the 1.7% first then slowly use the Grab card to pay bills through AXS?,btohqsg
Max top up $10k due to the monthly limit. Chris did a video on this,btohqsg
The maximum that your Grab wallet can contain at any one time is S$5k.,btohqsg
anyone here sign up for Citi Plus Account to get at least $160 cash?,btohqsg
https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/citi-plus-review-singapore-2022Here's the T&C:https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltc05b5aa7ae1c3a47/blta5de2df767b1f055/6389a83bfa9d4632df8ca8c2/Citi_Plus_SingSaver_Rewards_Campaign_Terms_and_Conditions_01122022.docx.pdf(asking here cos thinking of opening this acct and concern if I miss out anything in the T&C)Thanks!,btohqsg
Hmm even can top up to 30k   not worry grab will ji ba boom?,btohqsg
I have a few large payments due in Jan. That’s why I’m not too concerned about the amount.,btohqsg
"Anyone knows if chalet bookings are considered under ""travel"" for Citi Rewards for 4mpd?",btohqsg
Hi gurus  which card is a better choice to buy air tickets ? Ocbc 365 or UOB one ?,btohqsg
Issit possible to credit salary to both uob one and ocbc 360  ask the hr to distribute the salary ?,btohqsg
Depends on company. I know of one company that allows that but think most won't allow as it's hard to manage. Their payroll system might not even support this too.,btohqsg
Agreed thr HR or finance will get pissed,btohqsg
Hi guys  am I right to say that shopback purchases will always be online purchase  and MCC will depend on the merchant you are paying (e.g. Lazada vs hawker). The question is for CIMB visa signature card and UOB EVOL,btohqsg
hi guys  does anyone known if top up cpf to loved ones  how long will it take to process?,btohqsg
Can transfer for KrisPay miles to KrisFlyer miles? Why I don’t see it  only see to KP miles,btohqsg
Hi  guys. Im wondering if we will be 1.5% fee charged like oversea spending if we use amaze card in sg? and the rewards points from citi rewards cc can be redeem to other gift  like vouchers?,btohqsg
Nope the fees only apply for foreign currency that is not SGD,btohqsg
Yes citi rewards card can redeem vouchers or cashback also,btohqsg
You will have something like these and your Grab Finance will have a GXS wallet asking you to link it  Grab will send you a notification asking you to sign up and link GXS for reward you with 2500 grab point,btohqsg
based on my understanding  only KP miles earned from payments can transfer from KP to KF,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI got 1 rly good purchase home appliance too  hair trimmer and scissors  both <$50 but saved me >$1k over the past 4 years of cutting my hair at home every 2 weeks instead of going to the barber 🤣,btohqsg
Nice  I just didn't like the cleaning up part so I just go to neighbourhood barber,btohqsg
Must see which Bank account you using  to hit the $500 spend,btohqsg
I have both ocbc 360 and UOB one account 🤣 not sure if purchase air tickets is eligible for cashback,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for a young person that just started working  would it make sense to top up MA for tax relief? What is the pros and cons for long term.,btohqsg
advantage of topping up MA now is mainly for tax relief  and not so much about the interest (since current interest rates are high). Tax relief is useful if at least in the 40k to 80k income bracket. Save $7 tax expense per $100 topped up to MA,btohqsg
Anyone use hsbc advance credit card? 2.5% cash back if spend min 2k. Better than usual 1.5%..,btohqsg
Hi all  what cards would you tag with amaze for hotel bookings?,btohqsg
Hi thank you for your response. Curious why you put the income bracket from 40-80? If abv 80 not worth?,btohqsg
higher then even more worth. 80k to 120k income bracket is $11.5 saved per $100,btohqsg
Below 20k no point. Below 40k not much point. Above 40k then can start to consider. Personal opinion,btohqsg
It’s not that it’s no point  it’s just that when you earn higher income you are taxed a higher percentage hence you ‘save’ moreOf course when you are in the lower bracket you top up to save lesser  so to each his own,btohqsg
also have to consider that your money is 'stuck' once it goes into CPF. Can be a good or bad thing,btohqsg
So would it be fair to compare in terms of opp cost.(7% tax savings + 4% int in MA) vs (4% avg for fixed deposits)Apart from the money being stuck in MA,btohqsg
I think it’s good practice to top up in proportion to your income,btohqsg
After weighing in the pros and cons  DYODD,btohqsg
you can put it that way. It is basically trading X% tax savings for the liquidity. I feel that it is more compelling to top up MA when interest rates are low,btohqsg
Hi couldn’t find info on this so looking for some help:If I make a transaction today (30 Dec)  would it likely to post on 03 Jan only or can it potentially post tomorrow (31 Dec)Asking since I want to utilise my rewards limits which resets on 1st of every month. Thanks!,btohqsg
really depends on when the merchant do the posting.,btohqsg
Hi guys if I add my card to Apple Pay and use it on grab rides  etc  does it still record as the category rewards?,btohqsg
does UOB absolute AMEX exclude spend for online course (e.g. udemy  coursera  edx)? Is there other cards to consider for educational expenses?,btohqsg
just wanted to confirm because I read the T&C and it doesn't contain it  but I know most cards exclude it,btohqsg
Hi  guys. anyone who applied scb smart credit card through singsaver in Aug get reward by now? idk why it took so long this time.,btohqsg
First video that is not sponsored by brokerage😂,btohqsg
Anyone here tried using amaze card in Korea to spend over there ?,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows for SRS still can contribute tomorrow for tax relief? Dbs don’t allow to do after working hours today and says must be made by 7pm on the last working day of the year,btohqsg
DBS treats Sat as a working day as well. Just try again tmr before 7pm.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how long do i need to wait for uob one card? Where do i check application status?,btohqsg
Does anyone knows how long does it take for FAST to reach Standard Chartered credit card payment?,btohqsg
Subjective to bank some as fast as below 1week some as long as 1 mth or moreIf u got UOB I banking Access u can check from there,btohqsg
Ocbc frank just change their card benefits. Didn't notified us. Was wondering y my cash back only $25,btohqsg
They put online sgd and contactless into 1 now...so now this card is pretty useless,btohqsg
Min spending 800 now from 600,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you know if buying gift cards on ShopBack is eligible for credit card rewards?,btohqsg
I remember have a update video but not sure is honeymoney or others.,btohqsg
i'm waiting for uob evol card; applied on 25 Dec. unable to check application status online.. need to call them to check,btohqsg
Now Min spend cashback is between Evol and Livefresh. Frank is not so good.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGis the usmile digital floss really that good? I’m going to buy it,btohqsg
You can read the reviews on the shopee linkhttps://bit.ly/usmile_ChrisSGfor more accurate and unbiased reviews,btohqsg
Ok but ocbc shld infom customers,btohqsg
A water flosser just does what it does lah  the only difference is how long can it last and whether it is portable,btohqsg
Dec is slow mnth. Everyone clearing leave,btohqsg
Hi guys. Does this qualify for the ocbc 360 salary crediting criteria?,btohqsg
doesn't qualify cos no 'GIRO' in transaction description,btohqsg
"from tnc - ""Only genuine employment salary credit via GIRO with transaction description “GIRO - SALARY” printed on the monthly statement  which is credited within the calendar month is eligible.""",btohqsg
Dbs livefresh. Starbucks can be paid contactless leh,btohqsg
Do we earn grab points for public transportation when we use grab pay card? I don't seem to see any points earn in the grab app. Please kindly advise  thanks.,btohqsg
Tat y I switch to other card already,btohqsg
which american express still gives cash back for toppingup grabpay?,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know if Citibank cashback (not plus) has a category gap or just monthly cap at $80? Also  spending is based on calendar month? (not billing cycle),btohqsg
Good morning to all  for OCBC 360 account  2% interest on salary credit.Is the 2% only for the salary credited for the month or for the entire balance available in the bank?,btohqsg
anyone planning to top up CPF tomorrow?,btohqsg
No category capBilling cycle. Easy to trace. Reflect in your bill,btohqsg
So I just got a new Amaze card to pair with citi rewards less than a week ago  and yesterday got a suspicious transaction attempt email (Your transaction at GAMERCRAFT  INC. has been declined due to the wrong expiry date entered. ) Their support just told me to replace the card- but I'm wondering if Amaze is legitimately safe or not. Any of you with similar experience?,btohqsg
Been using it for a long period  never had much issue with it,btohqsg
Sorry can i ask which card is better for buying 10k bill of home appliances at audiohouse? Citi PremierMiles Card ($1=1.2mpd) or Citi cashback+ card (1.6% cashback),btohqsg
there are better cards to use but which do you actually focus on ?do you often travel or frugal which dont travel often. basically if you are a frequent traveller then miles card are better to be used,btohqsg
Miles card like hsbc is good if frugal too . No min spent,btohqsg
If its 1 big transaction  can use citi smrt via kris+ for 5% cashback,btohqsg
Thanks kevin  but for the citibank smrt card  there is an annual cashback cap of S$600 (SMRT$600)  which ends up being a S$50/month cashback cap. In addition  online spend excludes mobile wallet and travel-related transactions. In order to reach the S$50 monthly cap  you need to spend S$1 000 on qualifying categories (groceries  online  taxis).,btohqsg
haha but for my bill  will be 10k at audiohouse,btohqsg
You are not limited to the monthly limit. Like you said  its yearly 600cashback for 12k spend annually,btohqsg
Either you split your bills or just put all on premiere miles or if you will be booking scoot or sq within 1 yr sign for uob krisfyler and earn the 3mikes per dollar,btohqsg
N paiseh I forgot to key in this referral code when signing up  and skipped the referral page to key in the code,btohqsg
Now that I have alrdy signed up  how can I navigate within the app to key in the referral code,btohqsg
Maybe bnpl just no sure whether audio hse have or not,btohqsg
How to still key in this audiohouse KPAUDIO referral code if I alrdy skipped the referral page when downloading the kris plus app and signing up earlier,btohqsg
hi all! Does using liquid pay with hsbc rev qualifies for 4mpd?,btohqsg
as long as category is whitelisted,btohqsg
Hihi  just asking for Citibank reward card  the 4mpd reward is capped at 1k each mth.. is there any restriction on how the payment is being made,btohqsg
dont use citi premier miles omg  use ocbc tri. and ur done. MCC 5732  ocbc tri cap your spending annually at around 13k for 4mpd,btohqsg
As in just sign up for the app,btohqsg
N haha yea but I don't have time to apply for ocbc tri sadly,btohqsg
of course  tag with amaze or online  widely accepted tho  but no travel.,btohqsg
o man  that's 40k worth of miles,btohqsg
Trying to buy appliances today before gst rise 😅,btohqsg
just 1 percent  comparing with 40k miles!,btohqsg
Normal retail spending like clothing  dining using contactless payment ok to have 4mpd rite,btohqsg
once u use your citi reward tag with amaze  the status will reflect from pending to inside about 3 buisness day  then u will see your points all is multipled by 10,btohqsg
If use as physical card can’t?,btohqsg
Hi all  deciding between hsbc revo and Citi rewards+amaze… thoughts?,btohqsg
watch honeymoney for guide. bro  u use citireward card tap contactless is 0.4mpd,btohqsg
just get both lol  revo has no annual fees  but u be better of spending with citi because of that long expiry points  and also more exchange partner. but till amaze is being nerf ya.,btohqsg
Depends on your spending per month,btohqsg
hey hey  can i ask a stupid question  using uob one card to spend on klook  will it has any cashback?i also recently signed up CRMC + Amaze card too. not sure which one is better to spend on Klook.,btohqsg
If its less than 1k den go for reward + amaze,btohqsg
If more than use revo for contaless spend and reward for online,btohqsg
In this case no need amaze,btohqsg
So if I want to spread out my application (so that the credit score won’t tank)  which should I go for first? Hahaha,btohqsg
yo  Depends on what u wanna clock leh  u want miles or cash back? LOL ,btohqsg
bro just get citi reward first. don't think too much  honemoney has the video for 1 card solution. follow that one can le. no need so much headache,btohqsg
hm. i never use CRMC+Amaze card before.,btohqsg
waiting for the cards to arrive. haha,btohqsg
Klook is a online spend  meaning u dont even need amaze  once u apply in citi when approve  can use it virtually already.,btohqsg
Citi rewards points are in block of 5yrs. Take for e.g you activate ur card on 01012023  all points earned from 01012023 to31122027will end on31122027,btohqsg
i see i see. i just need to learn more on the miles or points this CRMC,btohqsg
yeah read more   and see more youtube  answer all there le. haha is quite simple  just rmb citi reward cant use for travel.,btohqsg
i see alot  but still have some doubts for certain spending method. easiest for me will be cashback,btohqsg
yea. i think amaze card cant be used for instore spending in korea right?,btohqsg
Just afraid that Citi rewards will go down the path of WWMC once amaze gets nerfed… hahahaha,btohqsg
bro offline spend is no no  don't even talk about contactless LOL!,btohqsg
i don't recall can't leh. u should be able to use it,btohqsg
is it? i thinking of getting youtrip card just in case. as i planning to go korea in march  i heard now dun really uses cash alr. many places start to use cards or cashless payment mode.,btohqsg
Korea widely accept cash and cards. Don’t worry about that. Also you can use youtrip or amaze. No issue with that too The only thing u have to consider is that the fcy spread for YouTrip is better. But amaze earns you point when tag with Citi rewardSo you have to weight for yourself. But for me I always use amaze for overseas and local spend. It is worth to spend more for the spread in exchange for the miles. But some may not be comfortable. So you have to dyod,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we can check OCBC rewards before statement?,btohqsg
Maybe u can call ocbc and try your luck,btohqsg
While my request to increase perm credit limit approved in 3 hours a few days ago  submit 8am and approve 11am,btohqsg
Got it. So far I’m still trying to explore the crmc amaze. I will try spending in local first.On safer side  I will just bring both cards and cash for my trip.,btohqsg
Always bring some changed cash and Sing dollars. Cause cash is king  ,btohqsg
