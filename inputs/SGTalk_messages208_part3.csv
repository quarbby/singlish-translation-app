Remember to take the threefold refuge in the triple gem  abide by the precepts  behave in a dignified and appropriate manner.Chant 大悲咒 and 般若波羅蜜多心 5000x to control your desire. Observe the Five Precepts  understand the Four Noble Truths and follow the Noble Eightfold Path.Wear 3 Paladkit on your neck  rub metta oil and paste gold leaf sheet on your forehead then meditate for 60 mins. After that chant Phra Ngan katha 9x and face the wall to do self-reflection for 49mins  then chant Khun Paen and Kuman thong katha 9x .Lastly upgrade your prayer wheel with Tamiya plasma dash motor and spin it constantly at 108 rpm (not too fast  not too slow) for 七七四十九天.,btohqsg
