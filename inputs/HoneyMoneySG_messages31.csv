All points go back to principle card holder. And no  a single limit of 1k across both principle and sup card holder,btohqsg

can anyone advice on how to add Amaze card on the iphone?works on my android google pay but does not work on apple‚Äôs applepay nor googlepay,btohqsg
Amaze card doesn't support iPhones  it's Google Pay only,btohqsg
So all these 4 cards can be used for hotel banquet payment. So contactless means I need go down physically to tap their machine ? If is via online payment link  means only dbs woman   HSBC revo ? Uob visa signature and UOB PPV need me go down pay in person via contactless?,btohqsg
ah i see  so theres no way i can use the amaze card on the iphone as contactless. appreciate your reply sir,btohqsg
Unfortunately that's the case. You can still tap with physical amaze card to convert your card spending into online,btohqsg

I guess that‚Äôs the case. Also I met the case where MCC for some merchants are different for different payment networks.This is something I can‚Äôt get my heads around. Ezbuy for example is 5411 for MasterCard and 5691 for Visa iirc,btohqsg
Application for HSBC revolution card. Failed. Not approved. They don't disclose the reasons why not approved??? So weird. All banks will pester cilent to resubmit their application or submit documents which is missing for approval...,btohqsg

Ya I read the same thing when OCBC first have fixed deposit for CPF OA. not sure whats the difference after factoring the admin fee and the 1 to 2 months of not earning the CPF interest. Not sure if it's worth the effort to go to the bank and do all these,btohqsg
Seems like this is another credit card program in addition to IRAS GIRO monthly instalment. So should be no impact on 1% cash back on GIRO payment.,btohqsg
Coming march. No need to go bank anymore. Can do it via Internet banking,btohqsg
Main thing still don't know how much difference I can get if I put in the OCBC FD üòÇ,btohqsg
It's not only that. U just go read JT article,btohqsg

If my purchase is more than my limit  should I topup (fast transfer my credit card) to increase limit in order to enjoy cashback/miles?Say my limit is 8k and I want to buy something for 10k. Should I transfer 2k to my cc account before buying so all 10k will get rewarded?,btohqsg

need 1 for everyday spending makan  online shopping,btohqsg
Be honest with your monthly. See whether the card fits your monthly expenditure. Usually UOB One + UOB EVOL is ok already. UOB EVOL min spend is $600 a month.,btohqsg
Just try any one u fancy  read up each card tnc  see which aligns to your lifestyle,btohqsg
i am looking at HSBC revo,btohqsg
Unlike other groups we don‚Äôt bite üòÇ HSBC Revo has special rule. Apply for EGA bank account online first then credit card cos their data base not sync now,btohqsg

Hi guys! Have a qn regarding citi referral programme. If i refer my gf to get citi rewards  ill enjoy $150 and she will still get to enjoy the 40k thank you points promotion from citi right?Thanks in advance! üôè,btohqsg
HSBC revo + EGA best right now with4 mpd + 1% cashback everyday bonus ( their bonus requirement quite easy to hit )MCC cover most general spendingThen Citi rewards + amaze for online transactions   oversea transactions + mcc excluded by HSBC revoDBS altitude or Citi premier for overflow after using HSBC and Citi rewards or super large transaction or travel bookings as if more than $1000 HSBC can‚Äôt use anymoreAs generally both this card give 3-6 mpd on travel bookings (air ticket  hotel   Airbnb Agoda Expedia )Some people might use DBS WWMC after overflow from HSBC and CitiThat my current layout,btohqsg
AnyUnionPay card (debit/credit  SG/foreign) can get 1 free entry to Plaza Premium Lounge with 140SGD spend per two months. (The free one is always limited  but the 140SGD spending one has enough vacancies)And UnionPay cards have 8% rebate with min 50SGD in single receipt for Sheng Siong.

Hi all  planning to switch over to UOB one for salary crediting from OCBC 360. My salary will credit on the 11th of each month. When is a good time for me to switch over so I still get max interest from ocbc and Uob?,btohqsg
why not use citi cash back for 6% dinning   8% groceries and petrol? The rest use UOB Evol(to hit the uob one 5% for 100k),btohqsg
Cause my monthly spend to low to constantly hitting min  once in awhile I have large expenses but usually it below $600. Hence why I have a secondary card just in casePlus I don‚Äôt bank with UOB hence wasn‚Äôt looking at UOB cards üòÖ,btohqsg
You can try to do your own FAST transfer to UOB ONE account  and tag your purpose of transfer as: SALARY. Based on my own testing from DBS to UOB ONE  it works.,btohqsg
my strategy is dinning  groceries  petrol all use citi cash back max out the $80 rebate  excess use UOB one to pay for utilities like sp services  senoko  mrt  etc. Wonder if anyone has a better alternative? I am thinking of switching to uob evol but it doesnt give any rebate for utilities and the min is $600 hmm,btohqsg
Hi all  can the DBS Altitude Amex card be added to Google Pay wallet?,btohqsg
i think best strat still which you can maximised easily monthly,btohqsg
wah means can use both ocbc 360 and uob one liao,btohqsg
but you might cause some tax implication idk how it really work,btohqsg
opps it seem like it not working https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT206638,btohqsg
if uob one no need to credit salary can just fast means can use ocbc 360 get the 4.05% pa and UOB One for the 5%,btohqsg
i read somewhere doing FAST with Salary tag might cause some tax implication idk how true is that,btohqsg
What tax implications? We pay tax to IRAS based on IR8E and we are transferring between our own account.,btohqsg
Just transfer the min $1600 lo,btohqsg
i think if send to partner account might affect ?,btohqsg
no need to hold so much liquid cash. If dont want ocbc 360 can just put in rhb 4.1% fix d for 2 years,btohqsg
If too many ppl do this UOB gonna patch it soon,btohqsg
The bottomline is that we are doing this is not to runaway from tax. Even if IRAS is asking  show it lo. What to be afraid of.,btohqsg
Yes.. May be NERFED too.  Enjoy while you can.. Lol,btohqsg
if you meant if manual bill payment to credit card is considered giro bill payment then it is not.,btohqsg
NFA  but if you pay yourself salary  technically it works as a tax-deductible business cost to you and a revenue to you (taxable). Hence net 0.,btohqsg
Hi guys  what do you guys use for paying income taxes?,btohqsg
for the hsbc revo  can i buy gold bar to meet the requirement? do i get 4x miles from it?,btohqsg

Anyway just to share  if anyone using credit card directly overseas or for foreign currency online  visa exchange rate is way worst then mastercard by it self. I text with 2 different card from ocbc  1 visa and 1 master,btohqsg

Oh no Excluding Amazon andMustafa for 10x points soon,btohqsg

Other terminal within those should not be affected,btohqsg
Actually where to find the terms and conditions on what are the excluded transactions for the cashback ah ?,btohqsg
Bigpay cashback given in the cashback rewards. I can‚Äôt find the terms and conditions on what are the excluded mcc le,btohqsg
visa is bigger than mastercard so it has the guts to charge more.,btohqsg
That's why I make it a point to try to use MasterCard as much as I can.Visa  I wonder why they have 2x the market share of MasterCard?,btohqsg
I also wonder though I like visa more,btohqsg
MC has Amaze. And even without Amaze  there are competitive MC products.DBS WWMC  OCBC TR  Citi Rewards. Literally three of the Four Heavenly Kings.,btohqsg
And before they start charging more fees than MC,btohqsg
yes  im pretty sure the place will accept mc if it accept visa. we should use mc more in case visa become monopoly,btohqsg
If need 2-3 more MCs to complete the Amazing experience  it will be UOB KF and Maybank FnF. Maybe Citi Prestige if you have that.,btohqsg
Visa has Trust Card (will try to avoid that)  EVOL/Frank/Live Fresh  HSBC Revolution... Much as I don't like Visa it will be hard to put down any of the Triplets.,btohqsg
only specific merchants listed in the app has cashback,btohqsg
trust card can be used for oversea withdraw  amaze paypass can cover other payment.,btohqsg
I got this $50Awarded to me but I don‚Äôt know how to get it out üòÇ,btohqsg
Visa usually have better reward program  u will notice most cashback card is visa,btohqsg
yes and visa card is more than mastercard.,btohqsg
Guess for local currency can use visa and then mastercard for foreign currency spending,btohqsg
yes ha. i think youtrip has best rate in multi currency wallet maybe because it is a mastercard,btohqsg
yes  actually applied last year it is already visa.,btohqsg
sorry if it sounds stupid but i like mastercard logo. it is so well designed.,btohqsg

You can check the amount on OCBC iBanking  they will show you your ADB and the incremental amount from last month ADB  whether it has hit $500 or not.,btohqsg

Your answer is right there on the site.,btohqsg
Yeap  so it's stated very clearly that Samsung pay = Mobile contactless.I'm well aware of that. Its just UOB decides to throw spanner and tell me Samsung Pay = Paywave,btohqsg
unfortunately sometimes CSOs are not 100% reliable,btohqsg
only can conclude once the actual cashback comes in and is less than calculated....,btohqsg
Anws  I want to confirmIf the rebate is the same for the 2 scenario400 mobile200 onlineVs250 mobile250 online100 others,btohqsg

got $5 NTUC voucher if you use referral,btohqsg
Is it true that we should amaze for foreign purchase only on weekdays? If yes  which day will it be?,btohqsg
Another benefit of VCMA is that if you do VCMA and eventually you hit BHS  the contributions overflowing to your SA to hit FRS will not be reserved for your retirement account (RA) when you turn 55.Whereas for RSTU  any amount you top up as well as the interest will be reserved for your RA,btohqsg
I remember honey money says it‚Äôs cheaper  i.e. better exchange rate during weekdays?,btohqsg
via axs app only get 0.3% for max $50 payments using maybank family. Can via SP app instead  still have a few cards with rebate e.g. uob one; ocbc 365 or posb everyday for recurring payment,btohqsg
other cards also have worse rates during weekends  so still better to use Amaze if using linked cards with good benefits,btohqsg

For RSTU... The top up and it's accrued interest gets earmarked for RA... But how about OA tsf to SA?,btohqsg
OA transfer to SA won't be reserved.Please note that it's not accrued interest  it is interest earned.Accrued means owing. Which in CPF would only mean OA/SA used for housing/education. SA may be permitted to use for housing but it was once during the financial crisis (forgot which one liao).,btohqsg

how to ensure all payment is listed as online purchase?,btohqsg

Hi guys any recommendations for savings account at the moment? NSF here.,btohqsg
1) Yes you have to top it back up. Your interest calculation for any month of deduction will affect as CPF takes the lowest amount of every month and totals it up at the end of the year and gives you the interest on 1 Jan.2) If you have already reached BHS  then this deduction can be seen as a good thing as it allows you to squeeze in some tax relief.3) BHS limit increases annually. E.g. last year 66k  this year 68.5kI am unsure if you are able to pay these deductions via cash. Maybe someone can advise here...Hope I didn't miss out any points for you to consider...,btohqsg

any good ideas how to clock 500 for the uob one account spend?all my spends on ppv and citbank rewards.. now like unable to hit 500,btohqsg
if choose to renew upon maturity  will be the same prevailing 4.88 promo rates or their own existing spot rates,btohqsg
How does contribution for MA and SA flow into OA?I understand that I need my MA have to max first. But from SA a bit lost liao. üòÇ,btohqsg
Once SA reaches FRS and MA reach BHS  the contributions and interest from MA will flow to your OA.,btohqsg
Oo. Okay! Thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
Always choose withdraw interest and principal,btohqsg
I called to double confirm with the cso and they mentioned the same promo rates & tenor upon maturity if u selected auto renewal.. Hmm...,btohqsg
So hard to believe. Means 4.88% for 6mths?,btohqsg
Lol.. well cso sometimes also hard to believe.. will continue to dig further and confirm on it,btohqsg
Choose withdraw principal and interest safer? Mature already then look ard again,btohqsg
"DBS website stated ""Automatic renewals: Upon maturity  your deposit will be automatically renewed for the same tenor at the prevailing interest rate.""",btohqsg
Prevailing to that same 4.88 or to their spot rates lol,btohqsg
Means interest rate at that time,btohqsg
i figured by right should be board rates / spot rates,btohqsg
Likely non promotional base interest rates of the time,btohqsg
Hi able to ask if atome sg paylater count towards uob one spending of 500?,btohqsg
E.g if i going to spend 1k5 anyway i might as well split into 3months payment just for 500 spending category. Anyone have experience in this before?,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt just place the money in DBS 4.88% FD? The difference is only $1 per month for every $10 000.Is it worth to spend $500 per month just to get $1 more of interest from UOB per month per $10k.,btohqsg
Cant compare 5% for liquid money vs 4.88% for lock up money,btohqsg
Could we place multiple with the same FD ?,btohqsg
Liquid and illiquid money mah.Actually biggest problem is the lady card not applicable. I don't need those cashback card. Hmm,btohqsg
Also uob 5% can last for years even though unlikely but its possible,btohqsg
Its good for those max out 100k in UOB already..And hate to wait (4mths+) + all the stress / trouble with EGA Bonus interest to come inAnd with RHB High interest ending by this month which uncertain if renewing,btohqsg
Can set not auto renew? Sorry  newbie here,btohqsg
Any one know for how long is it ?,btohqsg
yup just now pay hawker use liquid pay - amaze reject (reason risky transaction),btohqsg
Yes can. There's an option to choose to auto renew or not before submitting your application,btohqsg
But need to consider you need spending more to hit $500 to earn 5%.Only $10 interest more per month by placing $100k but if you need to spend more than $10 to hit $500  not worth.,btohqsg
In this case EGA will be much easier once RHB promo ended.,btohqsg
looks like patched already  just tried cannot use lol,btohqsg
Uob one card is the only card that gives a 3.33% rebate for utility. So if u use it to pay for senoko  spservice  the rest use it for train think easily $500 that u must spend mthly anyway. Maybe suitable for those with family,btohqsg
hai the promo code end liao,btohqsg
how does the ega bonus interest work?,btohqsg
Any diff between singsaver and moneysmart?,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt really understand.. can anyone explain on whether the current strategy of amaze pair with CMRC will be impacted?,btohqsg

Nope it not going to affect doesn‚Äôt at all  main use was to convert CRMC to online payment  majority not topping up  mainly using it as a general card paywaving in general,btohqsg
Is your CRMC a new card which you have not received and activated the physical card?,btohqsg
Hi  wanna ask  what type of credit cards are suitable for low spenders? <$500 mostly on food  restaurants  shopping  transportation,btohqsg
yupyup you're right  it is. is that the reason? but I've successfully used it for contactless payment a couple of times before today though.,btohqsg
Yes.. That's the main reason. U use apple pay? You can use using apple pay but not through app e.g. NTUC or your case koufu. Apple pay uses a different card number at the back end.,btohqsg
I see. I'm using google pay. paying through google pay as well. is it the same for Google pay?,btohqsg
I believe the same principle. You can check the 4 digit card that is printed in the credit card slip from cashier. It should be different no from your CC no,btohqsg

Hi guys  if i value miles redemption as 2.5cents per mile(based on sin to lhr in nov net tax). Means a 30k sign up bonus miles is (value at 555.6 net annual fee) better than a 350cash in value right?,btohqsg
Beginner here  Thank you in advanceü´°,btohqsg
Maybe amaze want to stop people from using amaze indirectly as a cash advance?,btohqsg
Does liquid pay convert to online transaction when paying for hawkers ? E.g. DBS WWMC,btohqsg
would u pay the sin to lhr flight ticket at that price using cash? If not then the value of miles is lower than 2.5 cents per mile,btohqsg
Does anybody have any issues trying to buy this ETF from DBSI bring trying to buy it for 10 times got an email it saying unsuccessful ?,btohqsg
I start to think that this a exclusive ETF,btohqsg
Few questions you need to ask yourself before valuing the miles:1). Are you able to earn enough miles to redeem the SIN-LHR ticket? Some miles has expiry date  some do not have.2). Is there ticket for you to redeem if you are not willing to be in waiting list?,btohqsg
may i ask if anyone tried using credit card to pay for Lasik before? anyone has such experience?,btohqsg

You may link to amaze since it is a master card. It will then turn the spend v amaze to online transaction n reward u 10x  subject to MCC that is approved by dbs wwmc. Correct me if im wrong,btohqsg
Oh ya u r right. It started to exclude them last year june,btohqsg
Sorry@Yiwen08nt much of a help) :,btohqsg
yeah ahaha amaze got nerfed  so an alternative way needed. right now I think the only usage is piling company paid business travel expenses on it,btohqsg
then again I'm very new to these credit card strategies,btohqsg
Don't force yourself to spend. It's a cap  not a min spend.,btohqsg
even if you're spending ~1k a month  that's still 48k miles a year,btohqsg
ah yeah I put my expenses on the citi rewards usually but the spillovers have nowhere to go as of the moment,btohqsg
if you like miles revolution is better,btohqsg
Maybe put more on WWMC as the points expire earlier.,btohqsg
but even if miles altitude dbs is best what,btohqsg
Both Altitude and WWMC earn DBS points. DBS points can be converted to miles,btohqsg
how do you put local dining expenses on wwmc without the acceptance of amaze?,btohqsg
You can see this article (info is a bit outdated)https://blog.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/why-the-best-air-miles-credit-card-may-not-be-an-air-miles-credit-card/,btohqsg
Oh not possible then  if you're doing the linkage with Amaze,btohqsg
maybe for offline spend  you use Amaze + CRMC. For online spend  you use WWMC,btohqsg
ahaha that's the thing. I don't have much online expense if at all other than company business travel expenses,btohqsg
A lot of things can be considered online expense mah. Anything you order on your phone or computer is online,btohqsg
You don't take Grab? Order food delivery? Even if you use the fairprice app at kopitiam food courts or koufu app at koufu food courts also considered online,btohqsg
I actually don't ahaha. maybe when I spend on mobile games and those can be placed on the the wwmc,btohqsg
grab is expensive. mrt is king.,btohqsg
I also don't Grab very often but the once in a while I take it it costs so much I might as well rack up the points for it,btohqsg
But if you don't spend a lot online then WWMC might not be the best second card for you lor. You said company travel expenses is your next biggest spend? Then maybe consider HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
why HSBC revolution? isn't that just wwmc but just 1k cap for travel flight and hotel bookings,btohqsg
Also can use for contactless transactions mah,btohqsg
and not just flight and hotel bookings,btohqsg
true uhh you're right. points duration also significantly longer.,btohqsg
FYI Just tried earlier it state promo code expired,btohqsg
Another alternative would be UOB Lady's Card with travel as your 10X category + UOB PPV for your everyday spending,btohqsg
That one is 2 cards  but you can pair your Lady's Card with Amaze to save on forex fees,btohqsg
I got the wwmc because of multiple company trips overseas per year that spends around 4-5k per time,btohqsg
HSBC revo 1k cap doesn't utilize it properly,btohqsg
ok what one time spend 4-5k,btohqsg
month long or longer stays in international hotels,btohqsg
Most miles cards exclude public transport so you can use SC Smart card for buses and trains  5.6mpd earn rate,btohqsg
Besides flight tickets  for what miles can be used? Sorry  never used miles strategy before,btohqsg
guys i wanna ask a qnwhat is a new card holderif i apply HSBC card Aisit new for me if i apply card Bfrom hsbc as well,btohqsg
No. Most t&c would have stated that new cardholder refers to no existing card from that bank or 12 months after cancellation of the only card.,btohqsg
Which platform ru buying on? DBS invest saver?,btohqsg
You need to use DBS Vickers rather than the Unit Trust platform. DBS only offers this ETF in Unit Trust form for DBS Invest Saver customers,btohqsg

Which is the best dbs card to apply for? Either miles or Cashback works for me,btohqsg
Depends on how you spend. But a good cashback card from dbs in general is the live fresh card.,btohqsg
Does buying usdt counts towards minimum spend requirement or it is a different type of transaction,btohqsg
For local grocery and dining maybe. Overseas and online spend won't be on this card,btohqsg
You can also look at posb everyday card in this case since online spend won't be on this card.,btohqsg
Does it make sense to lockup a large portion of CPF in FD given i usually let it stay with CPFB and will only be using it for housing downpayment down the line (will not be depositing this share),btohqsg
Why not consider Tbills then? Also can use CPF oa,btohqsg
But look at the min requirements for certain cashback also. Not as straightforward as live fresh which just needs 500 monthly for all cashback.Everyday card needs 800 to unlock certain cashback categories like dining. Within dining  in restaurant vs food delivery also yield different % cashback.Both cards have capped cashback also  since the % are fairly high. 3-10%.,btohqsg
Shall take a look at it  thanks for the suggestion üëç,btohqsg
800 abit too high for me. 500 still achievable,btohqsg
Typo  600 not 500. Live fresh seems to be the better choice for you then.Online  contactless and sustainable spending all cashback at 5% and limit of $20 (basically to hit you have to spend 400 for that category).If you take bus/mrt  simplygo is 10% because contactless + sustainable spending.,btohqsg

Hi everyone. Any tips for contract employee applying miles related credit card? Recently just got reject by hsbc for revolution card and citibank for premier miles card. Given that i am currently earning at least 40k annually based on my month salary.,btohqsg
To keep pace with rising salaries  as part of Budget 2023  the Government will raise the CPF monthly salary ceiling from $6 000 to $8 000 by 2026. The increase will take place in four steps  as shown in this table  to allow employers and employees to adjust to the changes.There will be no change to the CPF annual salary ceiling at this juncture  but it will be reviewed periodically to ensure it continues to cover the broad majority of CPF members.To ensure that employees earning the same annual salary receive the same CPF contributions regardless of their salary structure  the CPF monthly salary ceiling will eventually be set at one-twelfth of the CPF annual salary ceiling at steady state.Source: Ministry of FinanceDiscuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgMore referrals athttps://t.me/sgpromocode#Cpf,btohqsg

If I have sufficient miles to straight up redeem biz class to europe for 2 pax.Should I :1)buy economy  use miles upgrade to biz.2) straight up redeem biz3) buy biz  upgrade first.I have assessed that with the miles used  you earned more value in the increment benefit in option 3. But the thought of buying biz seems quite wasteful. Just want to see if my assessment is flawed. Economy ticket (1.8)  biz (5.7)   first (16.6). The amount of miles used to ug to biz and ug to first is quite similar. For the same miles you earn value of (16.6-5.7 = 10.9k) as compared to (5.7-1.8 = 3.9k).So from efficiency and value perspective   I should go for option 3.
