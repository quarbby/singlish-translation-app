Customers leave a tray of sweets and some packet drink at door,btohqsg
So need how many to thank then is enough?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not so much the ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. It‚Äôs more about the attitude that people have towards delivery providers,btohqsg
Technically they pay for the service. They can dont say thank you. Saying thank you is just being polite. Clearly you are not very long in this line.,btohqsg
They dont even say to say anything,btohqsg
Perhaps. But manners maketh man. Nothing wrong with please and thank you,btohqsg
I have a very different experience ...  my customers almost always say thank you (sincerely)  some will say repeatedly with gratitude esp if it's after dinner hours or if item is heavyI think the social climate is very different now  esp after covid. Ppl are a lot more appreciative and respectfulOf cos i still hear horror stories of delivery guys getting verbally abused by customers - but i think that's the individual customer's problem. That kind of ppl will be rude to anyone and everyone,btohqsg

*Delicate Deliveries and Claims* üßÅüç∞We've introduced a new process to ensure delicate items such as cakes and pastries reach your customers picture perfect.To all driver partners  we would like to reiterate that you need to check what is the food item and should it be delicate items like cupcakes or a whole cake  politely request to take a photo of the food condition and packaging at the pick-up location. üì∏Should you not receive the items in good condition  ensure you highlight this to the merchant immediately. ‚ùóRemember to upload the photo of the cake in your Loading page in the driver app before leaving the pick-up location and take extra care while handling the delicate items. Compensation will apply should damages occur during the delivery process.Read more on the new T&C here:bit.ly/llmcake,btohqsg
