ea sports = your money is ours,btohqsg
Joke being they threw all that money to have exclusive on Porsche but the most iconic car in the Need For Speed series now is the BMW M3 GTR,btohqsg
Why do we have an Israeli girl showing her boobs liking our comments,btohqsg

I can never get bored of this r34,btohqsg
Was listed on sgcarmart for 1 mill,btohqsg
I saw but now listing not there,btohqsg
I get the feeling that by the time we Singaporeans can import BNR34 in on classic plate  the Americans would have cleaned out the whole of Japan by then lol,btohqsg
BCNR33 just 4 more years to go lol,btohqsg
My bad lah I donâ€™t rly know much,btohqsg
Iâ€™m some what a Gtr fan so I know lol,btohqsg
There are a few R34 GTR vanilla registered in SGV-Spec and V-spec II is much less iirc,btohqsg
There is a BNR34 on sgcarmart now. Bayside Blue,btohqsg
Idk why this bmw number plate is at the right side and is damn small,btohqsg
But his car sounds v nice,btohqsg
Compilation for 2024   do check it outhttps://vt.tiktok.com/ZS6Dtr1A7/,btohqsg
Just take note those small small plates are not LTA friendlyhttps://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/onemotoring/home/buying/vehicle-types-and-registrations/car/standard_registration.html,btohqsg
Looks similar to his   idw to reveal the plate number,btohqsg
Just be tactical. Skali the Israeli girl showing her boobs in profile pic here is a LTA plant,btohqsg
skali you ask to meet then one lta officer pull up,btohqsg
Many years someone organised a Harley Davidson meet up  i heard the story goes that when the meet up happened  they discovered that the event organiser was actually someone from LTA and the LTA guy on bikes were there waiting,btohqsg
did they get charged or anyt,btohqsg
I kena looking from it it's impossible to modify a harley davidson,btohqsg
What u think happened to those with non LTA friendly exhaust etc,btohqsg
Just remember in Singapore  entrapment is legal (unlike the US),btohqsg
No it's not him his plate at the middle one,btohqsg

You see everytime some nice car with a big engine go up on sgcarmart facebook,btohqsg
