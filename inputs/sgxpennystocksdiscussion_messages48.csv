If last Friday is a demonstration of what UG is capable of.  Would you let go for a few pips?,btohqsg
I am in for the long term but must be able to hold,btohqsg
Spare cash only.Never ever borrow to play share.,btohqsg
Yup.But can play contra these few days if you are into some risk,btohqsg
Wa.... power to UG. I am vested in UG too...haha...Just thot that I keep seeing 1.6 for MT here....so just wondering....,btohqsg
No point risking heart attack for a few K.I using this coming Q to gauge my TP.Aiming for the big pot.,btohqsg
No way..... holding tightly to my UG....TP is $4.8 pre split.....$1.60 is conservative for UG...haha,btohqsg
This type of opportunity is very rare.Something I can tell my grandchildren.Hahaha.,btohqsg
I key in the different TP into my SGX stock alarm. I love the feeling when it get hit.,btohqsg
Yup...I have been holding to my UG and waiting for the share split to reap the rewards üí∞üí∞üí∞. Lets all huat together.,btohqsg
Rubber price up... What to do with Aspen?,btohqsg
Good TP let us ride the wave.,btohqsg
TP can always change due to a lot of factors.I think the only way is up for UG so just park your $ there  as will be better than the bank.,btohqsg
Most TP are 12 months target  unless specified ya. And most TP must less 10-20% to be realistic.,btohqsg
Lol  because he vested in Aspen,btohqsg
True...it is just a number...also musy dyodd,btohqsg
Just my opinion My aim is to get XXX amount of income combining UG and MedTec.I will let go if total value is achieve.,btohqsg
Good to have a plan üëç,btohqsg
Always like to learn other forumer opinions.,btohqsg
Hi team members here Any comments or opinion on AEM pricing sharp dropped last Friday  closing at 3.55. Will next Mon drop further. TQ,btohqsg
Glove demand up too lah. Lol,btohqsg
It simply shows he‚Äôs vested. ü§£,btohqsg
What's the move next week ?,btohqsg
Move to sengkang and warms the cockles of my heart,btohqsg
Likely will drop to 3.4x support level but if you are already vested and intend to hold for long term  nothing to worry about. Can tp before or on the day of Q3 results release for catalyst,btohqsg
AEM below 3.5 is a good for entry,btohqsg
is a bad sign for AEM,btohqsg
Every time hit about 3.8 vendor will sell,btohqsg

Hi! For those who are interested in receiving bite-sized market news  do check this out!https://t.me/marketmuffins,btohqsg
Sharing the above news channel. Admin do feel free to delete if its forbidden.,btohqsg
You must be an independent thinker to become a real trader!You should NEVER EVER ask another trader crucial  personal and strategy-specific questions like ‚Äúhow should I move my stop loss‚Äù  ‚Äúwhen do you take profit‚Äù  ‚Äúwhich indicator is the best for entries‚Äù  ‚Äúhow much money do I need and how much can I make‚Äù  ‚Äúwhich timeframe is the best‚Äù or ‚Äúis my indicator setting wrong‚Äù...First  you don‚Äôt know the other trader's objections and  most importantly  he has no idea how you trade  he does not know your full approach  how you execute your trades and what your struggles are. At best  the answers you get are then totally meaningless and destructive in the worst case!By asking the questions above  traders hope to gain clarity and remove the doubts they have. However  when the answers you get are not correct and you start making changes to your trading that result in more losses  you will end up worse off.You artificially created hope and certainty by asking random traders and your hopes then got crushed once you saw that your results didn‚Äôt improve your performance. Then you are back to square one and many traders end up trading with a Frankenstein-like system where the individual concepts don‚Äôt fit and it creates bad trading results because a trader doesn‚Äôt know how to operate it.-From FB,btohqsg
Physician say he was diagnosed 72 hours ago. WTF!!!!!!!! So when actually he kana covid-19,btohqsg
Maybe medical stock will reverse down ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
72 hours ago from the live update just now at 11+pm = he was diagnosed on wed night SG time. They kept under wraps until multiple repeat tests confirm positive.,btohqsg
I watched the live update by his physician. seems like he was trying to siam some questions that the reporters asked,btohqsg
anyway  the critical period is day 1-10  especially day 7-10. Have to see how it goes the next few days. Boris Johnson initially also only mild symptoms but later go ICU.,btohqsg
DT's doctors seem to be very aggressive in treating him though. multi-prong treatment,btohqsg
I am listening to ABC News live stream (https://abcnews.go.com/Live). ABC's White House correspondent mentioned this. The physician update just now made it sound all rosy.,btohqsg
Seeing the event where guests mingled freely without masks n social distancing  they deserved it.,btohqsg

Institutions Net Buyers of Tech and Retail/Tourism Plays in 3Q20SGX reportedMedtecsattracted Net Institution Inflow for 3Q as shown below.This company is theONLY company in healthcare sectoramong 30 listed companies.The 30 stocks also included 13 REITs  which included REITs with retail or hospitality-related assets such as Suntec REIT  Mapletree Commercial Trust  SPH REIT  CDL Hospitality Trusts and Far East Hospitality Trust. Genting Singapore  SATS and Mandarin Oriental were also among the 30 stocks.,btohqsg
Nothing is sure but the risk might be worth taking now. Those whom bought the stocks at much higher price may be trapped but the current price seems unlikely. Especially TG  RS which the bosses themselves bought back just slightly below the current price. No risk no gain ya. And now is the time to take this risk. üòÅ,btohqsg
VP is speculation. TG  RS  UG & MT are no longer speculation. Results proven & will be better,btohqsg
My own opinion. Aspen cannot buy. üòÅ,btohqsg
I totally don‚Äôt noe bout this stock,btohqsg
I only monitor on few stocks. Those u just mentioned I don‚Äôt noe at all,btohqsg
I only those I mentioned to you,btohqsg
When you say VP speculation that's why I ask your opinion on all these also ma,btohqsg
For an old man to get COVID every hour is impt. Media just keep milking this to gain eyeballs. Indirectly help DT publicise and for people to forget about Biden,btohqsg
I tried riding along on VP but failed. üòõ,btohqsg
Beside gloves  I see Ix Bio & Avarga got potential,btohqsg
Acromec  cfm  Eindec all no good lah. Don't compare those to MTp  TG  RS and UG.Aspen has its own believers. Time will tell.,btohqsg
Asking for his opinion ma since he said VP speculation,btohqsg
Yup I have no issues also haha,btohqsg
Share share each other opinion no prob. üëç,btohqsg
I too poor for MT UG RS TG le,btohqsg
These cmin week can contra though. Won‚Äôt lose much,btohqsg
But can gain a lot. Worth the risk,btohqsg
VP next 6 months results should be good. But from now till then there will be better time to buy.,btohqsg
Zai ur head. When i bought it drop to 12x or 11x. Forgot,btohqsg
I will be very careful with medical stocks le,btohqsg
I think UG is the cheapest. Buy a bit for investment  at least until early next year.Low cost with high potential .,btohqsg
CFM ?I slightly better in medical counters.,btohqsg
BMW or bicycle depend on you,btohqsg
Medical stocks honestly to me not much meat left le,btohqsg
It's always one step up two steps down,btohqsg
Unless you very nimble or you always buy at low then ok,btohqsg
Eindec is involve in specialise ventilation.  Singapore is too small a market for it. I understand they are going to penetrate the China market  that where the dollar‚Äôs will be .,btohqsg
Is either in now or regret later,btohqsg
Becsuse is still your own money,btohqsg
Honestly also no catalyst for it to fly,btohqsg
If there is any reason just BB want to fry it up loh,btohqsg
Is either you believe or you don't believe hahaha,btohqsg
That why we are in this penny stock discussion,btohqsg
You make this kind of statement based on belief is,btohqsg
If you have read through the whole financial report,btohqsg
Most of us been saying medtec has good fundamental,btohqsg
Will advise to read up more before you commit,btohqsg
Heegul and john is good at catching BB,btohqsg
You have been saying 2 weeks in a row 1.6 le,btohqsg
To be honest  they will hit 1.6 near soon,btohqsg
Just that i hope is Friday,btohqsg
I dont know when but i hope is Friday,btohqsg
Many of us here vested in MT  all of is hope everyday will fly,btohqsg
Maybe we can think this way.If the company bosses themselves are willing to buy back the shares at a certain price  it means they are well clear about the direction the company is moving forward. Coupled it along with the latest financial report plus the next Qtrly/FY results  wouldn‚Äôt it be to our advantage to hold against the BBs? üòÅ,btohqsg
Sure will teach one Friday if the covid situation still serious,btohqsg
Singapore company to be successful in China will be very difficult unless big brand name or super complex technology. One year and you will have 100 competetors doing same thing.,btohqsg
Insider will know the news first,btohqsg
Some of us work in a listed company  we know how the game is play,btohqsg
When its an open secret it's no longer a secret,btohqsg
That's what I said about TG,btohqsg
Everyone say choing to buy TG the day before results released,btohqsg
And also take into acc the following stock prices have fall to current prices from their previous highs. So that‚Äôs another +ve we can risk,btohqsg
Im not sure about TG because i dont read their stats,btohqsg
And their price is more than OCBC,btohqsg
A glove company stock can win a bank,btohqsg
Actually my tp for MT is not 1.6,btohqsg
The technical part you can read from the company website. If not for C19  I would not bother to read into it.Currently the pricing is Low.  Worth to take a risk.,btohqsg
Yeaa financial report is the best,btohqsg
I prefer to stay cautious haha,btohqsg
Not too long ago VP have the same hype,btohqsg
Personal opinion is MT might reach 1.5 at most. Those tat have been holding medical stocks have been monitoring & buying the stocks for quite sometime already.  It might not be easy to rope in alot more new investors as they thk the stocks prices are too high to join in now.My guess for TG is $3.3+ maxRS before bonus is $3.9+ maxüò¨,btohqsg
My 2 cents worth   all got excited because of Boss Heng visit. Frankly  make no sense.,btohqsg
Yes I agree on the price. Maybe worth a punt at this price.,btohqsg
You are saying this because you saw the price action,btohqsg
View yourself as a businessman  and share your vision with us.,btohqsg
This one I might agreeSeems like he have been playing the medical game long le,btohqsg
I consider myself late to medical stocks leMT 0.2+UG 0.6TG 3+ or 4+,btohqsg
No. Just the unnecessary excitement it causes .Recently our egg BB also visited a company  not even a ripple in the stock market.,btohqsg
Tell me what kind of meat you want see lol,btohqsg
There's a reason why all gloves counter go bonus shares/splits,btohqsg
This sounds sensibleAnother 20-30% increase seems likely,btohqsg
MT how much target depends on Q3. If Q3 is same as Q2 it should cross 2 dollars. What if Q3 profit is double of Q2? In that case it will be a different scenario. Personal opinion anyway.,btohqsg
I think market is more forward looking imo,btohqsg
That is why TG price didn't move up despite their stellar report,btohqsg
MT guidance is important. If they have orders lined up for 2021 or beyond it will make a difference. Hope they release guidance along with Q3.,btohqsg
And also why their price went from 3 to 2 within a few days,btohqsg
Who really earn?The people manipulating loh,btohqsg
You are right tat the stock should be worth $2 up. But the price will move up only if alot of investors dare to buy up  which I feel many dare not anymore. U agree? üòÅ,btohqsg
If we do see the price chiong up  we should noe who‚Äôs buying to attract attention. üòÅ,btohqsg
One step at a time  there is no limit to how high or how Low a stock can move. Only our risk appetite.,btohqsg
Then we got to be careful. üòõ,btohqsg
If you play medical stocks early you can see the pattern shift le,btohqsg
Last time all one way rocket,btohqsg
One step forward two steps back,btohqsg
Not really. You see fear and greed work the same way unfortunately. Many who were burned once they see price go up will rush back in. Unfortunately that is the behaviour of average investors.,btohqsg
Which is what I am seeing now haha,btohqsg
All the optimism out of nowhere!,btohqsg
Q3 result expected 20% or more compare with Q2,btohqsg
Two more weeks we will know,btohqsg
When TG dropped from 3 to 2 someone said funds exited le ask all to be weary.When MT dropped to less than 1 people say medical bubble bursting ask to buy at 0.8,btohqsg
Just sharing some of the sentiments not so long ago in the chat,btohqsg
All the optimism from Trump.. tis one i still dont q get it,btohqsg
But put it this way MT also kena sold down quite a lot already,btohqsg
But I honestly can't expect that kind of crazy action again la,btohqsg
Now always one step up two steps back,btohqsg
If want to buy.. better buy near $1,btohqsg
This one I no comment but I prefer to trade with caution,btohqsg
Unless someone can tell me a catalyst on why medical stocks in play again hsha,btohqsg
If not hold till your children or grandchildren and pass it to them,btohqsg
My personal opinion is for MT the risk vs reward right now is better for upside than down side.,btohqsg
So better don't chase when up unless you set SL,btohqsg
Ya. There‚Äôs always some comments to create panic here. 4000+ members wor. I was affected by the TG dropped to 2.05 at one stage  but after the FY results was out & the company bought back the shares between $2.3+ to $2.6+  I‚Äôm SUPER confident BBs will not dare to lower the price anywhere below the $2.5 now. Coz that will likely trigger more buyback & investors whom did their homework will gobble up the shares at low prices. üòÅ,btohqsg
Did the price move much after results released?Answer is no,btohqsg
3 to 2 and back to 3,btohqsg
"Hindsight people will tell you ""yes it rise from low 2s to 3""",btohqsg
The potential of moving up is way higher than the chances of the price falling to a point to create panic. So I‚Äôm in for the risk.,btohqsg
But it's exactly the same group of people that tell you VP confirm going back to 0.7 before results released,btohqsg
Yup but you can see it's being controlled,btohqsg
The sudden surge in medical stocks on friday seem more like a relief rally rather than real uptrend,btohqsg
But i do see many bullish posts on MT now,btohqsg
It is. But investors have the company bosses ‚Äúindirect support‚Äù now.,btohqsg
I am holding 3 batches of MT leh,btohqsg
But I don't know what's up with all the bullishness haha,btohqsg
When all so bullish very scary sia,btohqsg
VP unfortunately turned out result pretty bad so not a good comparison. By all counts MT and gloves will be posting good results for few quarters. Beyond that is anybodys guess.,btohqsg
Yup. VP is a valuable lesson,btohqsg
Refer to previous posts before results released,btohqsg
But bro furion did share his write up on VP way before results released,btohqsg
Turns out to be pretty spot on,btohqsg
True but MT and Glove counters have already shown in previous quarters which VP never did.,btohqsg
Next few Q can always don't meet expectations,btohqsg
Provided me a valuable lesson though. I ‚ÄúLOVE‚Äù VP! üòÇ,btohqsg
Paid shouters working for BB  or those hoping to grab at possibly the lowest price.Good stock indicator will be the present of naysayers.Hokkien call them Horlan king.,btohqsg
I foresee TG to move up more than RS & MT though I‚Äôm not holding it currently. üòÅ,btohqsg
Most stocks once results out.. will drop,btohqsg
Latest ISDN results not bad also down,btohqsg
You know why MT one never drop,btohqsg
Released their results late at night,btohqsg
Open secret is no longer a secret leh,btohqsg
Who doesn't know TG results will be good,btohqsg
The day before results hovering around 2.7+,btohqsg
Then last one hour choing to 3 meh,btohqsg
Those can hold one at least not much damage done,btohqsg
I think got upside but limited la,btohqsg
Imagine all 100% this is what all medical stocks will look likeTG - 5.6UG 1.8MT  2RS 7.2,btohqsg
Something to look forward to. Christmas is just 2 and half months away.,btohqsg
Just for Bro AC 200% upside since he tell me MT no 3 no sellTG - 8UG - 2.7MT - 3RS - 11,btohqsg
I dont want to play spoiler as many are vested higher in tis one.. but i dont trust stocks tat suddenly move up on fri esp after dropping for most of the week,btohqsg
It could be just relief rally.. anyway tomorrow we will know,btohqsg
That UG jump was insane wor,btohqsg
Ya. I initially wanna short it at 0.89. Lucky I didn‚Äôt. üòÇ,btohqsg
UG don't seem like relief rally to me though haha,btohqsg
Anyway tomorrow we will know haha,btohqsg
MT also looks good to me,btohqsg
But it was really after DT kena covid then all ran up,btohqsg
Risk is there in all medicals. Anyway my point is risk of down side in MT till Q3 results is less compared to last 4 weeks.,btohqsg
UG most probably will open strong tomorrow.. not sure can chase,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not worth it to chase once the share start running.My MT is below $1 and at most investors should try to buy at that range.Once it start running  it‚Äôs no longer value investing.,btohqsg
Hey magic i am not sure how for rhb invest. I only know for vickers.,btohqsg
The share splits will not reflect in your RHB investment acc but will reflect in CDP acc. As long u checked ur CDP acc & the qty are reflected there  u can sell it thru your RHB investment acc even though it don‚Äôt show the qty. U can call your RHB investment broker if u r unsure just to be safe.,btohqsg
New Straits Times: Covid-19: 293 new cases  Slight drop from Saturday.https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/10/629542/covid-19-293-new-cases-slight-drop-saturday,btohqsg
Ok  thks! Let me go & chk it out..,btohqsg
hi I have a question regarding SCB and UGhealthcare stock split.lets say I have 4000 shares@average2.534After split it should be 12000 shares@average0.844is this right?because now they reflecting my 12000 average price at 0.935thanks,btohqsg
0.935 is the market price now,btohqsg
Sembmarine is penny stock now. So horrible,btohqsg
yeah but I have held on to it way back in August. so why is it reflecting the market price right now?,btohqsg
oh i think u are saying ur avg entry price?,btohqsg
yes I am  sorry about the confusion,btohqsg
oh this i am not too sure,btohqsg
but i am guessing maybe it has not been updated properly,btohqsg
It doesnt really matter. Just remember current price x3 whether above or below ur previous EP will do,btohqsg
Stay away  low oil price  no business   possible to dip much further,btohqsg
Yes... that is one way to look at it.So  at Friday's closing price of 0.935  you are in the money cos your avg price is 0.844,btohqsg
but the platform reflects the closing price 0.935 and my average buy price at 0.935.. and they reflect a lost due to commission.. haha I believe they have an error uh,btohqsg
When you sell you will know Liao,btohqsg
Your ep 2.5 and now is 0.93*3  is lot of diff,btohqsg
Don't think system will make this kind of error,btohqsg
When u buy  it‚Äôs at one price at 1 lot  after split u have 3 lots.When u sell at whatever price   just make sure the lots number is correct.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry about so called balance,btohqsg
Aiyo this news wan share how many times. These ppl never read the chat and just spam si bo ü§™,btohqsg
Just a technical thing ... so long as you know how much you have paid for the original cost....with the split shares and the gap up share price tmr should you sell  you will know how much you are in-the-money.,btohqsg
MT STA UG all go 3.88,btohqsg
They not here on weekends mah. I usually not here too but today kaypoh lor. üòÜ,btohqsg

Same links spammed over whole weekendDoes the number of cheers over weekend add to monday horsepower or something?,btohqsg

Juz Be careful. Wun be surprised that Trump may say his vaccine is working  to shock the medical stock,btohqsg
Actually true. Mayb he also trader üòÇüòÇJust gonna watch first,btohqsg
Juz watch out what he say,btohqsg
You mean treatment? Vaccine prevents disease.,btohqsg
No point for vaccine if he is already positive .,btohqsg
Covid already got treatments which reduce mortality like steroid.  He is on steroid now,btohqsg
Ya I know. We have been saying for months. But market rather trust trumps word or Russia China vaccines. Market is really irrational,btohqsg
He no need a vaccine as he is already sick,btohqsg
He needs a treatment not vaccine. He is already getting treatment.,btohqsg
Market is not dumb. They know vaccine is not same as treatment,btohqsg
Only dumb people think vaccine can cure a sick man,btohqsg
Bcz he need to resuscitate his election   he will tweet something,btohqsg
Not about vaccine . He is not stupid like some people,btohqsg
Who dont know whats a vaccine lol,btohqsg
A vaccine prevents a disease..not cure it.,btohqsg
We actually think market is not dumb but it turn out other way,btohqsg
Im saying institutional investor wont be so dumb.,btohqsg
U thought he will say vaccine cures him,btohqsg
I think he agreee with u,btohqsg
But he meant market like u say yes is actually dumb,btohqsg
We had been saying this for months but market work against it,btohqsg
He will say his vaccine trials are working but he wont say his vaccine is working as he is NOT taking any vaccine. He is sick and if he get vaccine he will get even more sick,btohqsg
But why will he say his vaccine trials working????,btohqsg
Sick or not sick... he can say his vaccine trial is working.,btohqsg
He nvr say vaccine is cure. Only say trump May pull stunt shock the world saying vaccine is working,btohqsg
He alr said many times about vaccine,btohqsg
It not surprise bcz he fighting for election,btohqsg
He can say his treatment is successful... but we know covid already has treatment plans.,btohqsg
You mean he will say vaccine news again because his stocks r dropping?,btohqsg
That is just blowing the trumpet. He already said many times his vaccine coming out soon,btohqsg
He may pull stunt yet again,btohqsg
That hydroxychloroquine works? Thats a treatment and not a vaccine.,btohqsg
I cud be wrongAn opportunity for trump in the electinCrisis is turning point,btohqsg
