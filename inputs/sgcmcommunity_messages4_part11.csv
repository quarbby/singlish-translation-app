One noob question - washing car in hdb washing bay  is mask on or off?,btohqsg
Observe 1m when mask off lor,btohqsg
No one except those going to car,btohqsg
Any thoughts on Citroen C4 ? As compared to vezel ? Price range similar.,btohqsg
LoL I was gonna mask off ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
French cars are out from my list,btohqsg
Itâ€™s better in terms of ride and handlingâ€¦.but reliability after a while would still be an issueâ€¦.,btohqsg
Comfy and looks great. Certain areas are cost cut but certain other areas they do well,btohqsg
Digital instruments but small. Heads up display.,btohqsg
Didnt expect reliability to be bad ...,btohqsg
SAF hidden core value:Do anything you want so long you donâ€™t get caught ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
Continental car priced so close to Japanese carâ€¦ there must be a reason,btohqsg
Donâ€™t buy just becuz itâ€™s continentalâ€¦,btohqsg
Shirts off also no issue as long no body washes with u from another car HAHA,btohqsg
Experience the Maintenance then will cry HAHAHHA,btohqsg
Better not ah later police case HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Please send location  we go watch show ðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Why want to waste petrol and drive Manuel,btohqsg
Manual is more fun than auto,btohqsg
For spare car in track yes   for only car in Singapore city driving is not ideal,btohqsg
manual is only more fun on roads that mostly do not exist in singapore. i have driven manuals for decades so i also know. lol,btohqsg
Yup sg so many traffic light   driving Manuel is a chores,btohqsg
True  my leg muscle pain if I drive whole day manual,btohqsg
can do mount faber and south buona vista runs at 4am lor,btohqsg
That's why I only drive on weekends,btohqsg
Might as well rent or buy a car in Malaysia for track,btohqsg
I prefer to drive manual over auto. So issues for me in heavy traffic,btohqsg
can a Singaporean buy and register a car in Malaysia?,btohqsg
I used to drive Manuel to auto to steptronjc to no gear,btohqsg
Usually thru a Malaysian relative or contact,btohqsg
for track use just buy unregistered,btohqsg
Singapore road to me is about fc   good fc like hybrid or ev,btohqsg
Got performance and good fc and easy to drive   as the road traffic light is too long,btohqsg
that means ownership will be under the Malaysian relative lah,btohqsg
Or u can just rent or ask a workshop settle for you,btohqsg
you can own a car as a foreigner but you might need a permanent address,btohqsg
or some long term visa like the MM2H,btohqsg
ah.. ok so buy an apartment first..,btohqsg
U see our fellow driver already doing this to save petrol,btohqsg
if need a perm space and visa then quite a turn off..,btohqsg
Alamak  I tot you will appreciate new job. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Dont be like him lah hais,btohqsg
I owned a C4 5 seater Picasso BlueHDi before. Was a great car and love the suspension  smooth! BUT  engine is not reliable. Had unexpected lost of power and rattled badly. Sent to C&C for Servicing countless of time and the mechanics just inform me they just tweak the computer due to mid-ignition timing! What the hell! It wasnâ€™t resolved throughout three years of warranty! Decided to sell off and surprised to find that Citroen resale values sucks like hell! Donâ€™t buy the car for obvious reliability and maintenance reasons  unless you are French or you have a French wife. Sorry guys  French is good at flashy cars but not a reliable car. Friends also complain about Peugeot as well.,btohqsg
Very useful insights. I guess I will look at jap or Korea cars instead,btohqsg
But now new cars delivery also delayed right,btohqsg
Chip shortage blar blar plus high prices,btohqsg
Good Review. I rather eat French Fries =D,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sad to find that Continental cars are no longer build to last. Even German donâ€™t build reliable cars anymore. Japanese and Korean are really good at making reliable cars but not as flashy in their design.,btohqsg
I think is country issue . Those cars are not meant for SG condition LOL,btohqsg
