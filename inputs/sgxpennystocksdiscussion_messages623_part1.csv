Above is Nickel Spot which was squeeze up and then LME halted it on 8th Mar 22 while below chart is SilKroad nickel (weekly)Back when SilKroad Nickel was at $0.465 on 22nd Feb 21  Nickel Spot was trading at $20k only.Nickel spot was last trading about $60k before the Halt which was 3x of 20k nickel spot when SilKroad was at $0.465.Therefore  i believe much more game ahead for this one.DYODD,btohqsg
Calling out for BBs. Please squeeze up this one.,btohqsg
Yea sure  thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
Wonder when they will unhalt though. Ultimately  Russia accounts for around 7% of global production of nickel  which is used to make stainless steel and batteries for electric vehicles.The fact that EV will take over the automotive industry over time means demand for Nickel will be there.Hence  Silkroad Nickel will be a beneficiary. Good investment opportunity perhaps.DYODD,btohqsg
