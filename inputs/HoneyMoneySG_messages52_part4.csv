More debit cards may incur annual fees if forgetting to use in future.,btohqsg
I'll do it ELI5 style.1. Send money/pay via QR/phone number/UEN -supportedbank account (DBS PayLah!/OCBC/SCB)2. Receive money via QR/phone number - linked PayNow3. Contactless/in-app goods and services purchase (currently ONLY movie tickets) -supportedcredit/debit card (most VISA/Master cards  AMEX cards issued by AMEX)4. PayLah! can be topped up using a non-DBS bank account via FAST transfer,btohqsg
If calculating cashback is too tedious for you  use unlimited cashback with no minimum spending cards. Pay and redeem the cashback. Don't have to think so much.,btohqsg
This morning I bought 卤面  pork  and fish. All can use XNAP. So the target of $600 spend will be easier to achieve.,btohqsg
Tried google pay PayNow. Must connect to a bank.,btohqsg
Because I also want the higher interest by UOB One Account.,btohqsg
Then just spend a bit more than $600.,btohqsg
As per my previous ELI5 message  send money/payment via QR/phone number/UEN only via supported bank account. Linked PayNow is for receiving money only.,btohqsg
I have a US chase bank and would like to transfer it's balance (USD) to Singapore bank account or brokers. What would be the cheapest way to do so? Thank you,btohqsg
If convert to SGD  can try IBKR,btohqsg
If u are planning to keep it in usd  cimb has free incoming remittance,btohqsg
Is there a minimum balance required by CIMB?,btohqsg
Thanks. Would Chase USA charge a fee if I deposit USD into ibkr ?,btohqsg
Point 3  none. But u need $1k to open account,btohqsg
Ach transfer no fee from ibkr,btohqsg
Thanks kel. But the major fee comes from that chase USA would charge $USD40 for international transfer this is what I want to avoid,btohqsg
In that case definitely use ibkr,btohqsg
Free incoming transfer  then u can convert and withdraw sgd if u want,btohqsg
It might be better for me to use it to withdraw USD fromcapital.com. Wire transfer is their only withdraw method  and no TT incoming fund charge.,btohqsg
"But chase might still charge a fee ""to"" the ibkr?",btohqsg
Can I use CIMB to withdraw USD from IBKR without TT charge?,btohqsg
Anyway  thanks. Let me try next week.,btohqsg
I wire from JP Morgan chase USD account to DBS multiplier USD account. Chase side charge me USD25 upfront (deduct from amt transferred). Upon receipt in DBS  they charge me another 0.05%,btohqsg
Anyone knows HSBC EGA minimum balance and fall below fees like ?,btohqsg
If no charge to withdraw USD from IBKR to CIMB SG  I can open a CIMB bank account.,btohqsg
I also want to know any method to withdraw USD from IBKR without TT charge,btohqsg
It only store sgd for cimb.,btohqsg
IBKR SG uses DBS to receive fund  but use Citibank to pay fund,btohqsg
CIMB cannot store USD? Then no need to open CIMB. I open it is to transfer USD.,btohqsg
Yes. Unless u are preferred customer. Aum few hundred k that kind,btohqsg
Ibkr to sg banks no fee,btohqsg
If anyone is using Shopback  please don’t. They just robbed me of my cash back,btohqsg
SGD no fee. USD is considered remittance  there is TT charge. If I convert to SGD  later need USD need to convert again  normally will have some conversion loss.,btohqsg
I am abt to start using shopback pay. Wat happened?,btohqsg
I just received an email saying that my cash back expired,btohqsg
How did they rob  you ?,btohqsg
Apparently it’s not. Now all my cash back gone because it “expired”. Is this actionable? Can I sue them?,btohqsg
You can reach to them by clicking the link provided,btohqsg
Suggest you email them first and appeal. Going thru legal for a small sum does not seem a sensible move yet,btohqsg
Shopback has more rebate than XNAP? If bind UOB EVOL  can get 8% rebate.,btohqsg
Unless your UOB EVOL reaches $600  then might need to use other payment methods.,btohqsg
But I am lazy to calculate whether reached $600 or not. I am blur blur.,btohqsg
The extra rebate comes from shopback and not your card. Means it will not offset your bill. To keep it simple just treat both as a method to convert the spending to online spending,btohqsg
Use the UOB app to track overall spending at least. If you want to ensure you get both the rewards from online and contactless then you need to find a way to keep track yourself. We all find some way here.If you are not familiar/confident with spending on UOB Evol suggest you change to no min spending cards to keep it simple for yourself,btohqsg
Can uob lady card points convert to cashback ? If yes what’s the rate,btohqsg
I will try to reach $600 spend per month. I applied UOB Absolute (no min spending) to pay school/Govt/hospital expenses,btohqsg
I just downloaded shopback app and linked to my UOB EVOL. But not sure where to use in hawker centre. I think maybe in shopping mall  but not for daily expenses.,btohqsg
Hawker use XNAP and pay by Apple pay,btohqsg
I hope you didn't accidentally keyed your OTP into a malicious site that looks like UOB.,btohqsg
Ok  thanks. I did it this morning. Very good!,btohqsg
