It‚Äôs a simple Yes or no qn bro ü§£ one word would have sufficed,btohqsg
Regular traffic in the sense he meant it isn't derogatory?,btohqsg
He just said if you're looking out for what the person said he's looking out for,btohqsg
Don't go for all the meets  you won't see what you want,btohqsg
Meets more for appreciating the culture,btohqsg
saying don't bother and regular traffic... isn't that rude enough,btohqsg
did u not read what he replied to,btohqsg
Is this the real TikTok guy,btohqsg
sister i already read. maybe u are not an owner so u don't know how it feels for people to just talk about cars like that.,btohqsg
us owners go to meets to enjoy  showcase our car whether it's an expensive car or now  meet new people,btohqsg
Ppl call my cla regular traffic leh,btohqsg
Itsokie kids   just stick to seeing cars instead of owning one‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Regular traffic definition simple: if you go out on a drive and see more than 4 of the car you're literally traffic,btohqsg
And it doesn't have to be derogatory,btohqsg
Yalor I mean if u think that way then that‚Äôs great for u  other ppl saying car meets not worth to attend is their statement and their problem lo,btohqsg
Owning a car is alr hard enough in singapore. At least pls appreciate the joy the drivers bring to us w their own cars with hard earned money. Those w cars js wna have fun socialising at meets. I unds if ppl say meets not worth i unds their opinions but  i feel that mayb we all need to work on rephrasing no matter how real it might sound to everyone else to prevent any conflicts like this.,btohqsg
Im speaking thru 3rd person pov.,btohqsg
All I see is  people who go to meets to see cars shouldn't go in with any expectations,btohqsg
People there with their cars enjoy the company,btohqsg
Thrs no need to throw slurs and insults  cos at the end of time the ones getting hurt by owning a car thru hard work r the owners  not the spotters.,btohqsg
At the end of the day car meets are mainly for the owners to bond over and whatever others say shouldn‚Äôt really matter  unless it‚Äôs q directed ah,btohqsg
This is the reaction that's sad,btohqsg
Not the one telling this person not to go for a meet if they're looking for a certain type of cars,btohqsg
All yall carspotters  car enthusiasts whoever u guys are etc  literally everyone here. The owners of their own cars r not at the meet to get thrown insults and jeered at.,btohqsg
Im sure all of us know the purpose of a car meet  its to bond n socialise positively,btohqsg
Those that have been holding car meets sure want this intention to be set out to the country full of car enthusiasts,btohqsg
And like he said  if you're looking for specific kinds of cars and can't appreciate everything/can't socialise. Don't bother going,btohqsg
