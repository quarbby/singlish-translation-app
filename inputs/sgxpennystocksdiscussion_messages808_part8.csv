Buying Too Early.If you trade chart patterns  your losses will sooner or later force you to wait for confirmation before buying a stock. What is confirmation? It is a price at which any squiggle becomes a valid chart pattern. Many times  it is the highest high or lowest low in the pattern.Considerdouble bottoms. If you see a twin bottom forming and decide to buy the stock  the chances are 64% that prices will resume their downward trek.Only one in three trades will rise above the high posted between the twin bottoms and confirm the pattern as a valid double bottom. After confirmation  the chances are 97% that prices will continue rising at least 5%.,btohqsg
