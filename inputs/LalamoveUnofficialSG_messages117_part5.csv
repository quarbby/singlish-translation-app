Hi  I'm new. May I ask what's the key difference between LLM and Grab Express? Is my understanding correct that LLM works based on scheduled orders vs Grab's assigned jobs?,btohqsg
LLM fastest finger winGrab based on sky drop and some prayer.,btohqsg
Lalamove is you can choose whatever jobs you want and some you need fast fingers.. grab express is wait and pray.. but their fare on grab express is just pathetic,btohqsg
Thanks@Dyf_x3  based on distance alone  which platform pays more? Do you mean LLM has better fares?,btohqsg
Yep! LLM fare is better then grab..,btohqsg
I do grabexpress as a pab rider.. they give me only like $4.70 for drop off 2 traffic lights away..,btohqsg
Llm pays like $10 if really super near,btohqsg
But have to see.. if the distance too far and its like $14 it depends if you want to take it or not.. you will still get to choose instead of bring forced to collect,btohqsg
I see! Will LLM tell you know what the customer's transporting? I got once a grab mart order have to carry 24 bottles of 1.5L bottles.,btohqsg
That one you can ask the sender what's the item 😂,btohqsg
Don worry llm sometimes I carry this much item,btohqsg
No warning one kana bomb 😂🤣,btohqsg
Grab is grab 🤷.. this is why I do llm I feel so much more comfortable..,btohqsg
I Don have to be safe 🤷 I chilling in a bus 😂,btohqsg
Hello! Can I ask for petrol station benefits (e.g. esso / caltex) can the LLM discount stack with credit card discounts?,btohqsg
i dont think so. u already get 25% from LLM  and depending on your CC minimum amount for cashbacks  mine is $800 but so far i havent reach that amount yet monthly for me to calculate,btohqsg
need to send a chair from toa payoh to bukit panjang,btohqsg
Is it big? If big maybe can try book llm for people to take..,btohqsg
It shows on mine its on maintenance,btohqsg
Hi! I note when accepting a job (8 seconds)  multiple drivers can join the same job. How does a job eventually get assigned? Is it awarded by distance between driver and pick up location?,btohqsg
I guess is by luck? I not so sure..,btohqsg
Sometimes even though you are near the order pickup will be thrown to others..,btohqsg
Lala sticker or bag  rating n distance if I not wrong,btohqsg
