Idk sometimes life is hard üòî,btohqsg
But it is wat it is,btohqsg
This one if you tall.. good luck.,btohqsg
i think u shld let it go,btohqsg
I think above 160cm alr difficult,btohqsg
In the most  unique green u‚Äôll ever see,btohqsg
Unique until not on official merc website,btohqsg
Because the SL is only AMG....,btohqsg
So you're not gonna share your mom's supposed SL?,btohqsg
It's a GT car positioned more towards being sporty,btohqsg
Essentially a 1290 super duke r,btohqsg
Would be nice to see it tho,btohqsg
Ok  so still imaginary because SLs of this generation are only AMG,btohqsg
bro u can‚Äôt expect a 1.3k grp chat to be all silent,btohqsg
this isn‚Äôt ur pri sch chat,btohqsg
js let ppl talk and chat,btohqsg
bring back/unmute those u did jn,btohqsg
"Then why'd you say she has ""non AMG""",btohqsg
Fun factBicycles are slower than cars,btohqsg
bro i muted cos he was harassing other people   i don‚Äôt know about you but even if its not a ‚Äúpri scch groupchat‚Äù shldnt be like that?,btohqsg
because he was harassing others to the furthest extent,btohqsg
sending NSFW doesnt work out too kan,btohqsg
this chat alr got so many kids not even a car chat,btohqsg
u might as well let them talk,btohqsg
u restrict like macam pri sch chat,btohqsg
u can‚Äôt have it all bro,btohqsg
Nah jk it was me sorry,btohqsg
what to do mah? i know i cannot handle all lah but yall shd know to have basic chat decency what,btohqsg
joke is joke can   but limit it to somrwhere else la,btohqsg
u don‚Äôt have to handle it,btohqsg
u are expecting the control of a small class chat within a setting of 1.3k ppl,btohqsg
im not expecting like that  but like i said its common sense not to send NSFW or say stuff completely unrelated to the chatroom no? you yourself say alr that the place here alr not becoming like car gc so i was trying to limit it a little,btohqsg
ok no real car chats have talk,btohqsg
i banned literally no one  i just muted temporarily because OUT OF CONTEXT it seems wrong alr   since its kids would you really want to expose them to this kinda shit? yes i know eventually theyll see it but its still good etiquette to keep it out kan,btohqsg
