Hi gurus  like to know for car service maintenance at service centre gets cash rebate? If yes  which CC to use? Thanks for advice üôè,btohqsg
same thing for money market funds as well  you only earn interest either on or after settlement datethen when u sell  you stop earning interest probably one day before fund is sold and dunno how long then u can get the cash back in your bankthis is all 'normal' slippage to be expected when you do investment products..which is also why you cannot compare savings account rates with 'product' rates 1:1,btohqsg
Is there any way to pay China QR ÊîØ‰ªòÂÆù merchant and earn credit cash back fees or lower transaction admin charges?,btohqsg
If you guys ever venture into Structured Products  it can be even more scammy when settlement could be 3 weeks later  and some banks may require you to put money upfront (if you don't have approved credit facility).,btohqsg
Hi  any recommendations for a secondary credit card? I have UOB Evol as my main CC but once i maxed out the cashback cap  i was thinking if there is any other CC worth using... so far have read about UOB Absolute Cashback card. Any others?,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh. $400 contacless and $400 online  5% rebate.,btohqsg
Is there any cap for 10x Citi Rewards Card pairing with amaze card?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs $1000 per month = 10 000 pts,btohqsg
Yes. The cap is the cap of the citi rewards card itself. Amaze is irrelevant from a cap pov,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone knows if you‚Äôre a NTB to trust bank if you cancelled trust account 12 months ago?,btohqsg
I just got my HDB and need to spend a huge amount of money in courts/ gain city to buy home appliances and furniture. Any tips to apply which credit  card for maximum miles benefits?,btohqsg
Per Chris  seems OCBC titanium is a good choice,btohqsg
If want to buy electronics more than 2k use which miles card? Apparently ocbc titanium cannot earn bonus points cos it's on exclusion list,btohqsg
Trust bank not even 12 months old üòÇ,btohqsg
Split the payments and use cards that are not excluded  give us more context like what MCC or where u buying from..Off the top of my head  potentiallyAmaze + CRMCUOB PPVUOB VS,btohqsg
But all got 1k or 2k limit,btohqsg
But if the card has no function after ur big purchase I suggest just a general spending card,btohqsg
But will lose out a lot on bonus points,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ur call bro  if u don‚Äôt use the cards afterwards ur points become orphaned also haha,btohqsg
Facing the same issues as Paul. Trying to strategies best way to spend/ split payment.,btohqsg
Alipay allow to link master card but will have fee if send 100 or 300 cny per transaction,btohqsg
Will help if u cn state what and where are u going to buy the item,btohqsg
It‚Äôs simple actually  don‚Äôt be too miles focused  if the card has no function after a big spend then don‚Äôt focus on the 4MPD  maybe cash back is more suitableMiles game is more of an every day lifestyle,btohqsg
Going to court to buy fridge  washing machine  bed  cooker hobs and stove.Going to Taobao light bulbs  light fixtures  sofa and etc,btohqsg
Titanium for courtsTaobao WWMC I guess,btohqsg
Courts can see shopback courts voucher 3% for today will be back to 2% can do with cc,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask if I use amaze + uob one lady (6miles promotion) in oversea  am I entitle to 6miles rewars for food category?,btohqsg
If the MCC is in the whitelist then ya,btohqsg
Anyway that we can check the mcc whitelist details?,btohqsg
Just Google UOB Lady credit card exclusions then the first few should be the T&C,btohqsg
Buy at places that have kris+ (harvey norman  audio house)  use UOB KF  uncapped 3 mpd + 1 mpd from kris+,btohqsg
Same advice to u too. Buy at kris+ merchant and pair with UOB KF,btohqsg
Checking the website  do you know what is ‚Äúbonus Kris flyer miles with Krisflyer uob account with deposit balance > SGD 1k?‚Äù,btohqsg
That one if u open the uob KF savings account. This one I no expertise. I guess from the wording  if you have the account you get some extra miles?,btohqsg
bonus 5mpd capped at 5% of your MAB. 0.05% p.a. interest,btohqsg
"Usual sense i get from online articles is ""Dont bother"" but DYOR on this üòÇ(Something along the lines with capping)",btohqsg
ya i also don't bother  got too many other things to take care of already lol,btohqsg
very small amount one la... i get like 50 cents worth each month.it is capped by the balance of your UOB krisflyer savings account which does not make sense to keep a big balance. i just keep $1k inside,btohqsg
Hi do a singetl and sp services accept dcs cashback credit card  not a master or visa card,btohqsg
Actually yes because trust launched Sept 2022,btohqsg
OK  just barely  how many customers signed at launch  and cancel within 11 days?,btohqsg
Hence I‚Äôm just checking if it‚Äôs considered as NTB or if anyone has read anything about it because their terms and condition didn‚Äôt specify their NTB status condition.,btohqsg
Do u have sc cards ??,btohqsg
Well isn‚Äôt SC Cards NTB not affected when you sign Trust?,btohqsg
dun think so. Diners club only accepted at some merchantshttps://dcscc.com/en/merchantacceptance/merchant_locator/merchant_locator.asp,btohqsg
Not sure. But last time I had trust and I signed up for sc it was affected. My sc was not ntb anymore,btohqsg
Hi all kris+ purchases pair with UOB KF have 3MPD? No need to hit the $800 spending on Singapore airline related right?,btohqsg
Should call in and confirm  I get my NTB even after signing Trust,btohqsg
Wow guys and gals  just be careful when using GIRO to pay off credit cards.So today there was a credit card due for the amount of (ficticious) $1234.50  but the GIRO only transferred $1234.00. If I didn't check  I would have $0.50 overdue/rolled over and have to incur 24% p.a. with probably a minimum $10 interest amount.This is the first time it is happening. My source account is HSBC EGA. So please pay attention!,btohqsg
"correct.no need to wait for 12 months either.but it doesn't count as the ""$800 spending""",btohqsg
