O lvl always teach Caso4 is solid right,btohqsg
FCE also doesnt lie. If not u get poisoned,btohqsg
Ya lor u sure or not,btohqsg
I mean FCE not supposed to teach u chem rite? No point knowing so much,btohqsg
If is propaganda  its not a lie,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure they teach u not to put weird shit in ur food,btohqsg
It is made out of sodium,btohqsg
That's my bio answer for prelims,btohqsg
Idk what to say for bad effects of genetically modifying eggs so i said chemical warfare weapon,btohqsg
It's legit I was so desperate,btohqsg
If the egg got bad things,btohqsg
How is it chemical warfare lol,btohqsg
who knows covid might be spreaded via an egg,btohqsg
Yeah imagine lighting yourself up when farting,btohqsg
Gonna prepare a lighter beside someone who farts silently often,btohqsg
Wait guys so how do i make more friends,btohqsg
I need more EQ tips or im gg to be forever alone,btohqsg
Btw anyone know why hydrogen gas is less soluble than oxygen gas in water,btohqsg
I was thinking that oxygen gas still had several electrons not involved in bonding whilst hydrogen gas all is in duplet config so no electrons free from bonding,btohqsg
"No such thing as ""less soluble""",btohqsg
Yes induced dipole.. all molecules have that,btohqsg
Honestly its what the o lvl paper said and im sk fucking,btohqsg
Hydrogen gas got London dispersion forces?????? OH YEAH,btohqsg
But the lower the mr the lower the london dispersion forces,btohqsg
As Long as thereâ€™s electron cloud  thereâ€™s LDF,btohqsg
I guess but it got me thinking,btohqsg
When hydrogen tries to dissolve in water  interactions are formed,btohqsg
Unfortunately the amt of energy released from these interactions isnt enough for the amt of energy needed to overcome the imf in both water and h2,btohqsg
But i wont be surprised why hydrogen is insoluble,btohqsg
Since the bond length btwn both H atoms is very short,btohqsg
So is actually strong (ignore the bond energy value),btohqsg
And thus not easy to break,btohqsg
Oxygen on the other hand has a longer bond length,btohqsg
Bruh okay my god i feel dumb,btohqsg
Itâ€™s about the IMF  not covalent bond within molecule,btohqsg
Break bond between the water particles,btohqsg
Form bond between the particles and water,btohqsg
Bond length is more related to reactivity,btohqsg
UGHH GOD DAMN IT Im too stupid for this shit,btohqsg
Bonds are nvr broken when particles change from solid to liquid to gasIs imf,btohqsg
So... why is o2 more soluble..,btohqsg
Guys thanks for always answering my questions,btohqsg
Im just curious sry sry ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ,btohqsg
Well so far we think that its the bond length of the covalent bond,btohqsg
But the intermolecular forces of attraction is the main thing determining solubility,btohqsg
Honestly this is fucking beyond me sorry,btohqsg
Induced dipole-induced dipole interactions formed between oxygen molecules and water molecules are stronger,btohqsg
But the idid force b/w O2 molecules are quite strong too,btohqsg
Hence energy released is greater  more sufficient to overcome the interactions between water molecules and between oxygen molecules,btohqsg
The idid forces b/w o2 molecules are stronger than that b/w h2 molecules i think,btohqsg
