Walao eh don‚Äôt like that leh,btohqsg
So true!!!!!! Everyone so helpful here,btohqsg
Lol sounds like 24/7 dashcam not common. Like that the vehicles on Watch scheme by SPF like useless leh,btohqsg
Tapping on drivers‚Äô dashcam in MSCP to deter crime but‚Ä¶dashcams r not on lol,btohqsg
If u kena hit n run like me before,btohqsg
Just that most people daily drive the car,btohqsg
So the camera doesn't particularly drain the battery completely,btohqsg
Or they add in a battery backup,btohqsg
Most dashcams now have a standard parking mode  i.e.  low power mode,btohqsg
I gotta drive more often then. Bought 2nd hand car 1 month back. And I still take train to work lol,btohqsg
me too  just not used to drive. drive cannot look at hp,btohqsg
I'm more interested in connecting my car to the cloud...next stage can use PlayStation controller to remotely drive the car...üòÇ,btohqsg
SG Swifters and Shell host food rescue driveLocal Suzuki Swift owners club SG Swifters  together with Shell  organised a drive to rescue some cartons of milk and learn more about fuel saving.‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!üëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è for the drivers involved in the drive!,btohqsg
They say no battery and just come and changed battery and now can start as normal.,btohqsg
Thank you everyone for your kind help üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
If it helps you not crash and makes you a better driver,btohqsg
IIRC detect low voltage/ 0V on one of the electrical lines  if detected  switch to battery power source. Sorry I suck at electrical engineering  but roughly something like that,btohqsg
I put the circular one bottom right tho. Can or not ah,btohqsg
I‚Äôll have to check with blackvue on the price of a spare battery,btohqsg
Cos I also prefer 24/7 tbh,btohqsg
Also technically  you already have a Blindspot mirror,btohqsg
The mirror next to that is more convex,btohqsg
Most conti cars have it like that as per EU law,btohqsg
IMHO depends on your driving habits also...if you drive daily  I don't think it's necessary to get a backup battery,btohqsg
I believe about 300+ including install,btohqsg
If you go on a holiday  you might want to either disconnect the dashcam or let a relative drive your car,btohqsg
Have to disconnect the negative terminal of the battery too if go holiday,btohqsg
IIRC got ‚Äúsmart dashcams‚Äù that go into ‚Äúhigh power draw mode‚Äù to record on motion/vibration  but then $$$,btohqsg
Oic. The instruction manual suggest me put on top right,btohqsg
Most dashcams now have the activity sensor thing but I feel some are not very sharp with it,btohqsg
The recording is a bit delayed to the incident,btohqsg
yeah man‚Ä¶not easy to solve this problem,btohqsg
My other car grp got some auntie open the door,btohqsg
Hit the member car until got dent,btohqsg
Then she come out scold the hell out of the auntieü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
sigh‚Ä¶why am i not surprised lol,btohqsg
She told the auntie particulars come out say gna bill her for repair,btohqsg
Can make insurance claim if someone‚Äôs car door hit ur car?,btohqsg
You cut your toe nails leh mah?,btohqsg
Dashcam more for your own safety in case of an accident,btohqsg
It makes everything very seamless and easy,btohqsg
No need to look for evidence etc. easy for the insurance to judge,btohqsg
And that's why if you have dashcam  can actually get lower insurance quote,btohqsg
Yes but the bill not so high so easier for them to just pay off themselves,btohqsg
Or dispute counter party‚Äôs ‚Äúevidence‚Äù sometimes,btohqsg
I bet his big toe nail long long one de now,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I try to park the passenger door near to pillar  at least one side will be free of scratches. Then driver side door have to see luck whether your adjacent car got passengers or not. Chances r don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
It's more of you telling your dealer or broker to add in,btohqsg
Age  experience  CoM  NCD  parking arrangements  work profile,btohqsg
Wads happening guys .. so happening here ü§£,btohqsg
