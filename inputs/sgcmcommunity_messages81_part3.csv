This is also true. My car used to feel fast  now it feels slow.,btohqsg
i just got this car like 2 months back,btohqsg
New car. Congrats. Any service records? üòÇ,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs that new I guess it‚Äôs also what Rick said,btohqsg
Low downpayment high loans guaranteed affordable.,btohqsg
In-house financing  2k income also can drive!,btohqsg
Very true. Do not fret  we will sell you the car for 70k when the paper value is less than 30küòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Eh. But we pay only 30k.,btohqsg
What we sell is not what you get üòâ,btohqsg
Trust me  your every single dollar is well spent when you are getting a rare carüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
dunno when is the next servicing..got it from an unreliable car dealer,btohqsg
i dun even know if i can trust whatever they say or not,btohqsg
Car Review: Facelift - Volkswagen Arteon 2.0 TSI DSG R-Line (A) üí¨The refreshed Volkswagen Arteon flagship sedan stands out from the pack with its impressive style and admirable drive.Check out its new facelift with Julian! ü§óüëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you think the Arteon's facelift is an upgrade from its previous version!‚û°Ô∏è Read ithere!,btohqsg
I user to do CCTV for SGP coverage so got car lable to enter track,btohqsg
U can start a new servicing cycle then.Change outEngine oilGearbox oilRadiator coolantBrake fluid.,btohqsg
sourcing for a reliable workshop also,btohqsg
Heard the new volvo C40 is at Surrey Hills Grocer @SGCM_Adminare you guys there?,btohqsg
Not sure about other departments  but our side not there - J,btohqsg
Don't try the mount e lift if you can't do weird angles and narrow lifts,btohqsg
Maybe just send in for a service yourself? Did you get any service records of the car at all when purchasing?,btohqsg
that's why i say i bought it from a wrong place,btohqsg
Yeah that's not a very good thing when buying a car.....,btohqsg
I don't think it's the place,btohqsg
There's a lot of cars that sell without service history  must pull out from AD or ask for a first service/discount for one and start your own cycle,btohqsg
And PPI to figure out if any work has been done before and wear and tear has been done up,btohqsg
i really doubt the words from the sales person,btohqsg
and i am thinking if i should just send it to komoco for thorough workout (servicing),btohqsg
after that  i will just find a workshop to maintain it,btohqsg
Komoco will surely do a thorough servicing,btohqsg
They will also do a thorough job at emptying your bank account,btohqsg
For the same thing that could be cheaper outside,btohqsg
Well all you have is his word since you didn't secure any receipts  paperwork or do an inspection before purchase,btohqsg
Would suggest you find a good workshop for your car. Since your car is quite basic and a lot of units around,btohqsg
Any shop that has good ratings and has worked on japanese and Korean cars should be fine,btohqsg
maintain for a year and see if i can sell it away to get something else,btohqsg
You can use this as a training car!,btohqsg
And the next one you buy,btohqsg
Can be a better unit where you look into service history  ownership  do an inspection,btohqsg
Check multiple units for the same model  etc.,btohqsg
But try a service and see if you feel a difference,btohqsg
If not  you've just gotten used to the power it offers,btohqsg
Lag could be belt  could be gear,btohqsg
My car became scary fast and my brakes too underpowered,btohqsg
Ohh the one cannot stop is you ah?,btohqsg
or maybe it could just be that the car is slow,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminyou all got one massive loophole.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt cuss but I can if the Queen doesn‚Äôt understand me. May God let her soul rest in peace.,btohqsg
Is your boot now filled up with spoiler or home storage items?,btohqsg
Not you lah. Your Audi stage 9.5. üöÄ,btohqsg
i'm not living in a car,btohqsg
