U can find the website of the country u are goings meteorological service they usually have the most accurate readings but the data is only as accurate as their models and what equipment they got,btohqsg

Reminder that the ICC still has a pending warrent of arrest for Putin,btohqsg
technically since air flight to Russia is almost impossible they can’t arrest him,btohqsg
Exactly my point putting an arrest warrant on a world leader is the world's most useless shit ever,btohqsg
Ah yes they will just casually come to us,btohqsg

The best part about kway chap is the guts small intestine  big intestine,btohqsg
If u think about it technically you are eating the parent covered with their children,btohqsg
Cuz chicken nuggets are chicken that uses an egg wash for the breadcrumbs to adhere to it for frying,btohqsg
Hence from the chickens perspective we are eating them by killing them and smearing their children around them to rub it in,btohqsg
bro trying to convince us to be a vegan,btohqsg
Look I am merely making a statement of fact. I for one am into that masochistic shit and find it even more delicious in that perspective,btohqsg

I'm curious how are locals' view towards private unis like jcu  sim  curtin. My friend wants to take psych in jcu,btohqsg
Nvm I think he js a trainee teacher,btohqsg
I actually considered applying to SIM for CS. It really is a place to quickly get the paper and be done with it,btohqsg
I don't see much ab jcu though  mostly SIM,btohqsg
JCU has a worse reputation  though apparently the psych department is considered good? (Mostly because they have an attached clinic  so the students can get experience in house),btohqsg
my mouse cursor is haunted  keeps on jumping around,btohqsg
Have you tried removing the mouse? It seems like having an animal as a cursor is destined for a bad user experience,btohqsg

Fun fact:TEL uses a system from 2008 for maintenance,btohqsg

I preferred the tap to shoot,btohqsg
new aiming and shooting thing nerfed mobile players so bad imo,btohqsg
everything on roblox is cash grab now,btohqsg
they just spam heaping piles of hot steaming shit,btohqsg
and pray that people buy gamepasses,btohqsg

Why be immune when you can be invincible.,btohqsg
is the vaccine so powerful that one vaccine can fit all variants??,btohqsg
they are wasting our time and their resources,btohqsg
It's like the influenza vaccine. It's called guessing,btohqsg
blud doing the house md method,btohqsg
it is not guessing there...there are only 3 types of influenza virus and they are only making an intelligent guess on which strain is it (and that is why it is recommended to jap 2x yearly) (sometimes once a year as it is the same strain),btohqsg
Even if it's a different strain if it uses the same pathways in general your body should mount a strong secondary response either ways,btohqsg
All depends on the shape of the viral antibody,btohqsg
And obv the amount of memory T and B cells activated,btohqsg
Then shld we be going for covid jab again,btohqsg
Will current vaccines protect you against the new KP.2 Covid-19 variant?As Singapore is seeing a new wave of infections  here's what you should know:https://str.sg/jMZQ,btohqsg
That last I heard of T body cells was like during covid where I watch a vid on how our immune system works,btohqsg
JUST IN:One person is dead and others injured after Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 encountered severe turbulence on the way from London to Singapore.The aircraft was diverted to Bangkok and landed at 3.45pm local time.https://cna.asia/4bIuDCn,btohqsg
walao from f16 to sq flight,btohqsg
i think boeing 777 should be banned from flying,btohqsg
They say it's a decision issue with he pilot,btohqsg
It's like one of the most popular planes,btohqsg
boeing should stop murdering their whistleblowers,btohqsg
One of the reasons why Boeings stock remains untouched through all the scandals,btohqsg
gg i will be taking boeing 777 soon,btohqsg
but it is a 1.5h flight so TOUCH WOOD,btohqsg
Almost every American defense contractor does that,btohqsg
not the touch wood thing 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
When u going? I make sure to buy life insurance in your name just in case,btohqsg
coz the 787 plane need to wait at airport transit 4h (and it is at night so we were worried the lounges will be close and we stranded there no dinner),btohqsg
btw v out of context but sq just killed someone,btohqsg
it is not out of context,btohqsg
I saw it declare the emergency,btohqsg
apparently all the food also thrown to the floor,btohqsg
I was speculating either medical or suddenly random depressurisation,btohqsg
I guess it's medical but on a larger scale,btohqsg
I v interested to see the report on this,btohqsg
im not sure but i guess investigation ongoing so they never say what it is,btohqsg
whether is pilot fault or plane fault,btohqsg
but the thailand media say more stuff i think,btohqsg
i think it is more of plane fault coz SQ pilots are skilled,btohqsg
she act like she understand thai,btohqsg
Probably just declare as Force Majeure and move on,btohqsg
speaking of which I shld see if I can change my flight,btohqsg
there is such thing as google translate,btohqsg
but wont give u a gd translation,btohqsg
oh u taking a boeing 777?,btohqsg
actually tbh idk what news outlet my dad read but he said overseas one give more info,btohqsg
can try  i think this can be a valid reason,btohqsg
Who knows musicians raw input is just gibberish then the keyboard output words,btohqsg
but i think need to contact customer service,btohqsg
luckily im only taking boeing 777 for 1.5h,btohqsg
or should i try changing and hv to wait 4h at the airport for the transit flight,btohqsg
+ idk if the lounge will be open coz i need a dinner spot lol,btohqsg
Waa atas siol got lounge access,btohqsg
can check Changi app to see if lounge open,btohqsg
i think it reaches haneda at 8.20pm,btohqsg
and last time we had a night flight at haneda airport  haneda is damn dead,btohqsg
I tot is all a359 or 787s,btohqsg
no it is the flight from sapporo to tokyo,btohqsg
Seems like a waste ngl maybe it's for the latter legs,btohqsg
and im not taking SQ...hv u forgotten,btohqsg
wah i feel this is purpose...,btohqsg
i think i only get access to sq wifi,btohqsg
lol I love how the buses back to sg doesn't even have anyone,btohqsg
actually i may be able to hv wifi coz im a krisflyer member and ANA is also a member of star aliance,btohqsg
ya I'm watching them drive past,btohqsg
i learnt my lesson not to go malaysia during school holidays,btohqsg
one of them not even bothering to close the doors,btohqsg
i went with my friend via bus and took half a day to get there,btohqsg
woodlands to JB sentral in 20min,btohqsg
U shld go super early morning,btohqsg
they dc one  see long queue but still waste time talk to each other,btohqsg
not all airlines even offer free WiFi,btohqsg
SQ first FSC to do it,btohqsg
Thanks to him I can’t apply to go overseas for a few months,btohqsg
Not sure if it’s an scdf only thing  or SAF and spf also stopped approving new applications to go overseas,btohqsg
Very good what stay in Singapore,btohqsg
I hope the Malaysian authorities can catch all the members of that terror group and bomb their houses,btohqsg
I wanted to go to Malaysia for a day trip,btohqsg
Wasn't that guy a lone wolf?,btohqsg
They actually do check unfortunately so I’ll be charged,btohqsg
not like scdf admin has the admin capacity to charge you,btohqsg
Exit permit? What permit SG so great SG Secure will protect me,btohqsg
The media said he was part of some terrorist group called Jemaah Islamiyah,btohqsg
Yeah but it was a lone wolf attack,btohqsg
Nah I’ve seen people get charged for failing to apply,btohqsg
I think it’s a $50 fine and my promotion would be delayed,btohqsg
Maybe he could’ve consulted the others in the group or acted on their orders? Idk,btohqsg
He did? Idk the news never say,btohqsg
They probably need to investigate first I guess,btohqsg
damn they only offer to first class passengers,btohqsg
He not a true sigma 🐺🐺😈😈💩,btohqsg
SQ krisflyer get 2h free wi-fi,btohqsg
Thankfully I applied for my UK trip long ago instead of waiting,btohqsg
Since terrorist ruin your plans why don't u learn from em,btohqsg
Since I’m in the branch that deals with people getting charged I’ve seen one NSF get a $200 fine for going overseas without applying 4 times. Don’t know why he only got caught after 4 times though,btohqsg
bros salary got cut in half,btohqsg
Nah it’s just a one time fine. But getting promotion delayed could cost him $25-$50/month for at least 3 months,btohqsg
Now nsf base pay is $755/month,btohqsg
The same guy has been acting and arrested so many times,btohqsg
ticket prices will probably like double if that happens,btohqsg
or at least the problematic one,btohqsg
the oldest of the 777 is already 20y/o,btohqsg
That's why it's so good the planes can be retrofitted instead,btohqsg
I’m surprised that he could live in Singapore illegally for 3 years without getting caught,btohqsg
Boeing will be here no matter what because they are the more economical option,btohqsg
787 Dreamliner still remains one of the most efficient planes,btohqsg
Ppl preference is not the airlines problem,btohqsg
having been on both  350 is quieter,btohqsg
and if im not wrong  has longer range,btohqsg
here goes the airbus v boeing debate again,btohqsg
Talk so much end of day is it operationally cheaper,btohqsg
Fuck yall I am flying my 182,btohqsg
Nothing like a plane than can transport an entire army,btohqsg
eh anyone here got a Nintendo switch oled,btohqsg
Or knows how to check authenticity,btohqsg
Thinking to buy one of carou but dk if it’s legit,btohqsg
this one isnt about the aircraft lol... put a airbus in the same situation & its unavoidable... airpockets happen time to time but depends on the severity,btohqsg
6000ft in a few seconds in scary to say the least,btohqsg
Recently there are q a number of 777 incidents w different airlines,btohqsg
The one that the door drop mid flight was also 777 iirc,btohqsg
only recent 777 incident i recall was engine cowlings falling off due to improper maintenance,btohqsg
Prepares you for uni. No one is gonna look out for u,btohqsg

lcd screen usually can be fixed..motherboard fried then that one is gg,btohqsg
Ya I hope u do well,btohqsg
basically only been there the last 2 times lol,btohqsg
Bro the scene is from Margin Call lmaoand it's a much better representation of how money works today.So you think we might have put a few people out of business today. That its all for naught. You've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if this is all for naught then so is everything out there. Its just money; its made up. Pieces of paper with pictures on it so we don't have to kill each other just to get something to eat. It's not wrong. And it's certainly no different today than its ever been. 1637  1797  1819  37  57  84  1901  07  29  1937  1974  1987-Jesus  didn't that fuck up me up good-92  97  2000 and whatever we want to call this. It's all just the same thing over and over; we can't help ourselves. And you and I can't control it  or stop it  or even slow it. Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong. And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. Happy foxes and sad sacks. Fat cats and starving dogs in this world. Yeah  there may be more of us today than there's ever been. But the percentages-they stay exactly the same.,btohqsg
Wah SQ is world’s best airline behind qatar and ANA in 2023,btohqsg
Interesting Fact: Qatar is the only airline that has operated for more than a decade without any hull losses in its history,btohqsg
deceased apparently is a 78 yr old british man travelling with a wife,btohqsg
damn the news has hit american news,btohqsg
SQ368 that caught fire a few yrs back did not even receive this much american attention,btohqsg
abc news did not even catch this when it happened,btohqsg
Common things that happen in America,btohqsg
SQ368 literally flew for 2 more yrs and got decomissioned,btohqsg
I've been thinking about starting to save money n im curious how much is expected from people my age (19) to save up?,btohqsg
in total the newly commisioned Airbus A350 only served the skies for less than 3 yrs,btohqsg
It depends on if u work and if u get pocket money,btohqsg
Just save up as much as u can,btohqsg
if you save $1 a day  you will have $360+ at the end of the yearif you save $10 a day  you will have $3600+ at the end of the year,btohqsg
$0No societal expectations for students.Even for adults  you just need enough to have a roof and a full stomach.,btohqsg
Welp. As long you are not living paycheck by paycheck.,btohqsg
I'm living paycheck to paycheck 😔,btohqsg
someone videoed the SQ incident on ig,btohqsg
apparently one of my jnrs was on the flight,btohqsg
idk in that mess how she took out her phone to video it,btohqsg
but it was after it landed in bangkok,btohqsg
im a bad example coz before i work  i wun want to spend money,btohqsg
no it is on her private ig acct,btohqsg
but damn it was that bad that oxygen mask was pulled,btohqsg
Oh could you briefly describe what you saw,btohqsg
The news said that the man died because of a heart attack,btohqsg
🙈 cost of living everywhere in the world right now is a wreck.,btohqsg
I amazed my peers at my age of 27 already owning homes and starting families. welp.,btohqsg
the plane analyst predicted that it is likely clear air turbulence so the pilot cannot give adv notice...and it is likely after lunch was served so people were queuing at the toilet,btohqsg
Bro I am 16 year old and idk what I am doing with my life,btohqsg
someone who i would think never wear seat belt apparently flew up and broke the bag compartment,btohqsg
it was said he had a heart condition too,btohqsg
the vids alr being shared around,btohqsg
its ok. I still clueless despite being 27. lol.,btohqsg
yes this is predicted gonna happen,btohqsg
alot of the injured look like they got spinal injuries,btohqsg
there was someone lying on the floor at the toilet area  then some passengers were in the bend position (i forgot what it was called on the plane)  and there were a lot of empty seats...it was quite in a chaos also,btohqsg
one of the critically injured cracked his head...he flew up and hit broken the bag compartment,btohqsg
London to SG is like a 14 hour flight. It's kinda common to be unfasten walking down the aisle  or standing in the aisle talking to someone in another row. lol,btohqsg
imagine how severe the turbulence must be to cause such an impact,btohqsg
this what I observed when I went to London last year.,btohqsg
yea and the problem was coz (i mean this is just a prediction) that it was clear air turbulence and hence the pilot dun hv room to give advance notice for people to get back to their seats and wear seat belts,btohqsg
could be bad luck  the door storage compartment wasn't locked well  Turbulence come  a luggage might hit a passenger's head.,btohqsg
because normally if the turbulence is caused by cloud  it can be predicted by the radar and the pilot / flight crew lead will make an announcement and the seat belt sign will be turned on,btohqsg
it was already said that he did flew up and hit broken the compartment,btohqsg
that is why that plane analyst said it is likely caused by clear air turbulence (not by cloud) so cannot be seen on radar,btohqsg
nevermind  you have a long way to go before your 30s. Just know what you want to do  instead of following other footsteps. And try not to end up as much education debt. lel.,btohqsg
not in SG but im not sure anywhere near bangkok did hv storm,btohqsg
but from the video  looks like a no?,btohqsg
i hate presentations  let alone stuff like ur group member talking to themselves behind u when u were talking,btohqsg
and the cher did nothing to intervene,btohqsg
Well I've seen an A-level senior of mine dedicated his Master Thesis to Hatsune Miku. Could be much worst.,btohqsg
i did screwd up coz it did distract me and i tot i said something wrong,btohqsg
What's the objective of the Group Project and how is the assessment criteria. lol,btohqsg
test ur ability to work in a team i guess,btohqsg
as with assessment criteria  it depends on the project  what it is about,btohqsg
i would have so added roblox into my poly work if i could,btohqsg
some group projects do hv peer evaluation component tho it is damn damn damn negligible weightage,btohqsg
and hence it promotes free loading,btohqsg
it is not like in school where u can report to the examining board,btohqsg
uni / poly dun give any damn into such cases,btohqsg
my slides are normal don’t worry,btohqsg
there was someone who flew to the ceiling and broke the bag compartment,btohqsg
but in the video no coz she took it after the plane has alr landed safely in bangkok,btohqsg
I mean from a peer assessment perspective. If you play your cards right  just tell everyone to give everyone full marks  and everyone won't get screwed over. 😂,btohqsg
Damn so that injured person wasn’t brought back to their seat,btohqsg
when u are pissed  u are pissed:-(,btohqsg
The person at the toilet area,btohqsg
he is one of the critically injured with a cracked head,btohqsg
no he was being attended to by an air stewardess,btohqsg
sorry this one is the one that flew up  not the one lying on the floor,btohqsg
Oh ok I thought it would’ve been dangerous for the person lying on the floor to remain there,btohqsg
well  that's why need to be the nice guy :),btohqsg
some people cant get up  some people were using the toilet when the turbulence happened,btohqsg
form good connections and show you did work  so people don't have reason to hate on you lol,btohqsg
I hope there’s more updates soon,btohqsg
The flight fell into an air pocket while cabin crew were serving breakfast before it encountered turbulence  prompting the pilots to request an emergency landing in the Thai capital.,btohqsg
Passengers on board flight SQ321 were carried out of the plane after the aircraft made an emergency landing in Bangkok.One person has died after the SIA flight from London to Singapore was hit by severe turbulence. Follow our live coverage:https://str.sg/sjjw,btohqsg
The exception is what is known as “clear air turbulence”  which Mr Chow said occurs suddenly and is not detectable by radar.“The only prevention is  if you have no reason to go to the toilet  no reason to stand up  you sit down and belt up. That is the best practice ” he said.,btohqsg

After around 11 hours of flying time from take-off in London  the aircraft sharply dropped from an altitude of around 37 000 feet to 31 000 feet within just five minutes as it finished traversing the Andaman Sea and neared Thailand  according to FlightRadar24 data.“Suddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking  so I started bracing (myself) for what was happening  and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop  so everyone seated and not wearing (a) seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling ” Mr Dzafran Azmir  a 28-year-old student on board the flight told Reuters.“Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it  they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it ” he said.,btohqsg

My friend wants to change subject combination,btohqsg
It will be extremely hard to change midway into the sem,btohqsg
Yes to this but it has its pros n cons,btohqsg
Tbh the person wants to change from h1 econ to h1 history. given that the person has o level history background and h1 history is quite similar I think  theoretically should be ok,btohqsg
This one…shld be ok if it is h1,btohqsg
I tell her if you want change you should tell the civics tutor asap,btohqsg
But im not sure the sch’s protocols,btohqsg
every decision has its pros and cons wdym,btohqsg
idk I told her if uw change ask the ct,btohqsg
she say she regrets taking h1 econs and after seeing my hist stuff she wants to take h1 hist,btohqsg
Coz i dun really hear of ppl changing midway,btohqsg
Yea asap…and before the sem ends coz this week last week of sch,btohqsg
She has 2 more days if she dw disturb ct on public holiday,btohqsg
I think it is ur own decision + now i think 4h2 is just for scholarship purposes since the new system is out of 70,btohqsg
wait ur friend taking 4h2s ah,btohqsg
Do not let others sway ur decisions,btohqsg
Unless i mean uk it is some valid reasoning,btohqsg
I told my bro there is no point in taking 4h2  he wants to take 3h2 1h1  but my parents force him take 4h2,btohqsg
And said ‘u dun talk nonsense  u didnt take 4h2’,btohqsg
ask ur bro to take 4h2 and drop in first sem,btohqsg
But If he takes econs he shld take h2,btohqsg
He is struggling w math and i cant rmb which other subjects,btohqsg
cuz essay can just vomit everything,btohqsg
Neh i dun think it is a good idea,btohqsg
Idk which is good to drop,btohqsg
Wait is ur brother Sec4 or j1,btohqsg
It is a yes and no,btohqsg
Anyways I never regretted not taking econs,btohqsg
Coz my cher did told me that i would hv scored btr if i hv taken h1,btohqsg
u still got ur A anyway,btohqsg
Apparently my old econs cher teaching Ur sch now,btohqsg
Coz case study is way easier to score than essay,btohqsg
I wont know anyway cause I don't take,btohqsg
if not u will do 90 marks case study,btohqsg
I'm still on the camp of H2 econs more worth than h1,btohqsg
I mean my econs cher came to me and told me I would hv scored better in h1 coz i took econs at os and the case study is the similarity,btohqsg
It depends…some ppl really cmi in essays,btohqsg
