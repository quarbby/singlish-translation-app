So just keep it there? And wait for new promo? Or so?,btohqsg
the only exception is if you are so very 100% sure you have ZERO use for the bank and ALL their products  then go ahead to close then you can qualify for NTB items after 12 months.,btohqsg
you need to send SMS again,btohqsg
so far i haven't not found any bank that I have zero use for... there is at least one valuable credit card per bank.,btohqsg
then it will take a new reference month,btohqsg
But required new human. I only using their HSBC revolution. Once EGA ends  I have no use for it,btohqsg
can throw into GXS/Mari/Trust or other banks for one month then go back to the same HSBC account.,btohqsg
the objective is just to reset the baseline,btohqsg
Throw the 2k out from EGA?? To other banks? Wait for one month to reset? But@mttelegrammtstated requires 2 humans to cycle,btohqsg
now I suddenly have an idea. seems like the HSBC EGA is a good way to reset my OCBC savings. now I need to keep increasing by 500 every month in OCBC.,btohqsg
if you have 2 humans  there is no need to wait one month to reset,btohqsg
2k have to keep in HSBC during the one month too so won't fall below minimum sum,btohqsg
Ohh. So technically I can wait for 1 month.. empty out the acc. Send in sms to recycle as well,btohqsg
Ah noted. 2k min inside. Wait a month to recycle. Else 2 acc which doesn't requires waiting time,btohqsg
yes but if only one human.. your peak interest is only 4.x%.. you will never get the 5.x% p.a. since you can't get the 1% month on month incremental balance bonus,btohqsg
another benefit of keeping the HSBC EGA is for tax giro lor,btohqsg
Don't really understand why can't get the extra 1% since I have on month increment balance..,btohqsg
I currently does that as well. Deposit the rest in HSBC hahaha,btohqsg
the 1% is based on MONTH on MONTH incremental balanceMarch = $100kApril = $110kMay = $125kyou only get 1%p.a. on $10k in April and 1% on $15k in May,btohqsg
u can make use of the account in other ways  i transfer X amount of money to different bank accounts.like $$ meant for auto repairs or house maintenence that kindso the money is separated and i wont use it for no reason,btohqsg
But doesn't required min 100k or so right. Just everymonth increase can le. Only 1% only on topups,btohqsg
As said  you can increase by $10 also can.. but only the INCREASE AMOUNT will earn the 1% p.a.,btohqsg
Haha not much. But money xfer out to HSBC during this promo is still better than ocbc 360 under credit n save condition,btohqsg
I applied for OCBC Titanium Rewards Credit Card. I don‚Äôt think it will work with Singtel bill. Can I pair it with Amaze? Any tips to clock $500 using this card?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how the HSBC EGA works with joint acct?E.g. If I have an EGA account  and my dad and I have an EGA joint account and he's the main account holder  does that mean I can loop it between both accounts for the interest or it doesnt work cause my name is in both?,btohqsg
Base 4.4% without crediting n such  better than FD,btohqsg
Oh so just need to open hsbc acc?,btohqsg
Seems to be so and send in sms for promo,btohqsg
Min 2k so won't get charged with fall below fee,btohqsg
So 2k also can get 4.4percent?,btohqsg

CSO any how say lah üòÇ My transaction date was 9 Feb and posted date was 2 days later on 11 Feb. 365 card only good for dining and grocery that's all.,btohqsg
never wait till last few days to fulfil your credit card spending needs.If your card cycle ends on 30th of each month for example  you should hit everything and stop using the card by 25th.,btohqsg
Hello bros  when we select SRS during POEMS  how come they deduct from my cash instead of funds from SRS Acc?,btohqsg

Hello experts  I recently signed up up Citi Rewards card and have paired it with Amaze card. Is there a way to not bring the physical card out whenever I want to make payments? I‚Äôm an iPhone user so I can‚Äôt add the card into my Apple Pay.,btohqsg
oh I managed to link it to my google pay. Just wondering if I would still be able to get the 4mpd?Citi rewards > Amaze > google pay,btohqsg
To be more specific  if you wanna pay via google pay like how you use apple pay on iphone it wont work.,btohqsg
Means I cannot paywave but can paynow/scan & pay right?,btohqsg
Correct. But the paynow function wont link to your card it will just link to the bank account that you setup in google pay,btohqsg

Hi guys  is crmc works in paying shopback?Or need to pair with amaze card?,btohqsg
Hello  for miles  which website is more accurate (heymax  whatcard)? I just did a check and realised there is a discrepancy is what is report on both sites.,btohqsg
if im not wrong whatcard is user generated data while heymax is visa apiin any case  just use heymax to see MCC but need to do ur own homework to see if the MCC is in white/blacklist for your respective cards,btohqsg
Anyone knows where is the best place to buy Samsung S23 ultra? Is it Amazon?,btohqsg
if only u asked 1 week earlier i had a few sets to offload... now no more already,btohqsg
heymax based on visa? doubt so  it is not showing different mcc for different branch,btohqsg
now should be carousell. many people selling brand new ones as Samsung last month had a massive secret discount.,btohqsg
"For HSBC EGA users  if you all had linked GIRO payments to the account  how do you best ""reset""? We'll need to keep some money for the GIRO payments  and hence will have a higher baseline during the reset month right?",btohqsg
Thanks. I was waiting to compare with xiaomi 13 ultra when it is available before making the decision.,btohqsg
