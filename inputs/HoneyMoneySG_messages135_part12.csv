Thank you. Do you happen to know if we have any way to check the MCC that they will use to confirm which card to you?,btohqsg
From other chats:6513 for promo rental8299 for promo educationAnd both are excluded by many general spend cards.,btohqsg
Kind of a stupid promo if it doesnâ€™t earn rewards. Might as well use no fee Citi payall then (also doesnâ€™t earn rewards but no fee),btohqsg
Ya lor. At first I thought they want to undercut Citi payall ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi anyone purchased the Chubb policy in Sep and received the Accor Plus sign up code already? I still havenâ€™t. Bought the policy in early Sep.,btohqsg
3% iirc but they give u 3% cashback so net zero  trust link/cashback is better,btohqsg
Still see availability to credit a minimum monthly salary of SGD15 000Â  on hsbc websiteBut seems some members experienced cannot setup HSBC EGA premier via this route or transfer in 15k a month already ?,btohqsg
Some people reported that doesnt work anymore. RM from hsbc told them so.,btohqsg
Example of hsbc site is wrong itself. Its 20k miles in 50k hsbc pts instead of 30k.,btohqsg
I also finding. But seems all card dun earn anything. My wife delivering soon. Sad  scb removed if not I can use ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Previous promo was 30k miles for 75k HSBC pts. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I withdrew cash 2 months back. Am I still eligible?,btohqsg
Hi  any good credit cards to set as recurring for Singtel bill?,btohqsg
Have to check with moomoo CS as every case is diffferent,btohqsg
Ah I saw fnq not accepted :(,btohqsg
Must be new or existing (with assets already inside moomoo before 20/09/2024),btohqsg
actually it just means both new and existing customers are eligible,btohqsg
if i own citipremiermiles card does it make sense to still get Amaze + citirewards?,btohqsg
Yes 4mpd is better than 1.2mpd,btohqsg
As an example  SCB Priority Banking will have this kind of Information. What you can do  is to use as REFERENCE  read up on the recommendations. Then if you like any of them  use a low cost method to buy the same funds (yes you can buy those funds in major places  not just SCB).Fundsupermart is a cheap and rather easy to use platform as one example.,btohqsg
Hello guys  when you trade with margin with moomoo  how do you repay the deficit? Do you deposit money? What if the currency is usd  when you deposit sgd  does moomoo automatically convert to usd and offset the margin deficit? How long will the margin interest start to kick in  the next trading day?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany advise where I can get the best out of $150k deposit (OCBC  UOB and HSBC excluded),btohqsg
And you went straight for the boss. ðŸ˜‚Any requirements  risk tolerance? And why no those 3 banks?,btohqsg
usually my reply is wait for the video. but really these 3 banks quite good what,btohqsg
Haha. Already placed money in it  hence excluding the 3 banks ðŸ˜…Hopefully is lower risk. Else I will rather deposit in the Stock/Option market ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Both cards reward based on different categories,btohqsg
Spend half your money to go for this coursehttps://www.coreinvest.me/shop/coc2401-core-power-options-concise-69#attr=15Then use another half of your money to set up a trading account and start trading. You are young and longer run way. If you learn about investing and compound interest early  you will be financial free earlier. All the best! Cheers,btohqsg
Oh wow. What's ur review for the course? And why jumping into options trading?,btohqsg

Yes bro your memory is very good haha ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
helloo  tryna maximise interest on uob one acc and i'm wondering if lady's card is the best bet in terms of maximising rewards (mpd and also increased interest in uob one);the typical pink one only allows selection of 1 category and i'm concerned i cant hit $500 on one category like dining for e.g. haha,btohqsg
There is other card like uob one which is more versatile to hit 500 and get 3.33 percent cashback,btohqsg
Hi all  does this mean if i buy CSPX i will be charge at 1.70 USD per trade?,btohqsg
