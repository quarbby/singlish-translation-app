once in math i spent 1 hour on a qn at 12am then we didnt even go through the qn in tutorial,btohqsg
Sometimes i just purposely stay quiet then the class is silent lol,btohqsg
I just wear headphones when it's too much in class,btohqsg
Mr lim just ask ppl write stuff on whiteboard,btohqsg
then i lost the foolscap with my working so it didn't matter anyways,btohqsg
mr lim not teaching us topics for now,btohqsg
My class if i dun speak  no one does,btohqsg
currently mr chow and ms luo,btohqsg
It is me solo-entertaining the teacher,btohqsg
Sometimes i want give others a chance but,btohqsg
actl i think this is more of ms luo,btohqsg
So whenever i wanna stop solo-entertaining the cher  but i find myself speaking again coz no one else does lmao,btohqsg
every tutorial will ask us to write ans on whiteboard,btohqsg
Mr lim actually takes down who volunteer so he stopped me fr volunteering a few times,btohqsg
That was mr lim for us,btohqsg
My Cher just go thru normally,btohqsg
for the vectors tutorial with mr lim,btohqsg
It is easier to explore new grounds when guided by good facilitators. It is like this in classrooms and it is the same for other aspects of lifeIf you are considering attending a course with Brahm Centre  I think you can consider courses facilitated by BCâ€™s founder A/P Angie Chew (you can google and read up on her â€” think she was named Straits Times Singaporean of the Year in 2018 or 2019?) or Christina Liew (I attended her course and I think she is proficient),btohqsg
Cuz like nowadays alot of ppl,btohqsg
I got mr lim pissed once,btohqsg
Bz w nsg  syf dunno what,btohqsg
He didnt talk to me throughout the tutorial,btohqsg
"he say ""ik yall are too good at vectors  so i will just look thru your working to check if there's anything wrong""",btohqsg
"then he say ""the problem with this is i can't look at all the interesting methods you have come up with""",btohqsg
ya we're too good (i spent 2 days on 1 question until i gave up and asked someone for help),btohqsg
js curious how many hours of fmath do you have per week,btohqsg
cause you guys have 2 subjs h2 math and fmath,btohqsg
if there's a period with only h2 math can skip,btohqsg
"cause for dhs the period is listed as ""double math""",btohqsg
so technically i released 1 hr earlier on wed,btohqsg
and the fmath ppl dont follow the h2 math scheme of work,btohqsg
U have lessons for 2H2s and 1H1,btohqsg
i'm gonna get U for my fm WA1,btohqsg
The j1s doing j2 shit like,btohqsg
"oh ya the teachers told us what is being tested for ""fm"" wa1 alr",btohqsg
Coz i was his math rep then during lecture the lecturer called for our class math rep (my class is unlucky)  then i was very shy + i was sitting at the lecturer eye level in the middle so made that shyness even more helpz). Then i only raised my hand when the lecturer (ms cheyenne) was like â€˜dont worry it wun be uâ€™â€¦and then i raised up my hand. And then she was like â€˜2 person to your rightâ€™  it was someone fr another class lmao (and it was actually mr limâ€™s ok idk their relation but mr lim n ms nicolette chia seem really close),btohqsg
wait habibi ur sch have irl math lectures and do the fmath ppl have to go or ndont need,btohqsg
cause dhs fmath i think only have tutorials,btohqsg
due to the small cohort size,btohqsg
Actually do fm students go for math lecture or is it free period,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€i thought this one is who sia,btohqsg
our sch have no h2 math lectures if u J1,btohqsg
Maths idt I can maintain standards alrd fr,btohqsg
"h2 math wa i'm confident since it's ""just"" graphing and transformations",btohqsg
in dhs the 2 classes with fmath are mixed (1 is pfm + pcm funny humans  one is pfm + pcm h2 econ)So when the pcm  having h2 math tutorial the pfm ppl have their own tutorial,btohqsg
i can still remember my y3 teacher scolding me for not drawing properly,btohqsg
Im looking fwd to traveling to sch for 1h lesson tmr,btohqsg
