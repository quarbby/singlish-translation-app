bad idea to hang a katana high up,btohqsg

In any case mounting katana high is weird. Its not a deer head,btohqsg

I just dont really recommend something heavy above where u sit or sleep,btohqsg
I have the metal ones from caesars. Zenitsu's and tanjiro's katana,btohqsg
They're heavy  but not as heavy as a real full tang katana,btohqsg

Your handle on the right side also means you're constantly on guard  cos you can easily draw with your right hand. (unless you're left handed),btohqsg
