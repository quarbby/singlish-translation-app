Fuel prices will cascade down to everything we purchase. Inflation will hit us very hard and for those who’s salary is not raising fast enough  effectively it’s a lost in a few percentage or more of their income. That’s why Singaporean are crazy Liao! Super angry bunch as they are unable  to vent frustration at Government.Of course there will be our wealthy ones amongst us who are profiting from this crazy market. Live and let live fellow countryman!,btohqsg
Yup buisness ppl or partners that have profit sharing won’t get affected as Thier income will go up significantly also,btohqsg

this recession will be inflation driven ...the working class will be badly affected...,btohqsg
later dog puke in car how,btohqsg
I would recommend getting a specialist workshop to do a PPI in any case  it'll be the most comprehensive as they know what issues to look for in the specific car you are purchasing. The sgcm warranty can be something you get after the deal is almost done too,btohqsg
dog life best life. Eat sleep sh!t gaigai sleep,btohqsg
+1 my dog meet his friends more than I see mine,btohqsg

they love to go on car rides to the maccas drive thru near my place as i get supper,btohqsg
Thanks. Any recommendation of such specialist workshop?,btohqsg
what car are you looking at?,btohqsg
I'm looking at some A-B kind of SUV  Vezel (or HRV)  Nissan QQ  Tucson. Apparently on SGCM  there are more choices on Bezel.,btohqsg
Just noticed some dealer put that SGCM warranty logo in the Ads  most are not. Also similar for STA logo,btohqsg
I presume when they put the logo there  the inspection has already been done?,btohqsg
ya need submit sta inspection cert if want put t hat,btohqsg
for sgcm i presume is in house inspection,btohqsg
STA and SGCM inspection are good for a base level of security and give you details on some wear and tear and information on any accidents or anomalies with the car,btohqsg
Can consider some places on this list  but you would have to make sure if the dealer allows for an independent workshop inspection first,btohqsg
if don't allow immediate red flag,btohqsg
"For example this one  it indicates ""protected by sgcm warranty""",btohqsg
I kena puke and diarrhea from puppy. On my clothes 😂👍,btohqsg
Some suggest only STA or vicom as it'll be unbiased which is fair at times as well. But if they don't allow anything  best to walk away,btohqsg
For the inspection under sgCarMart Warranty  we will naturally do an extensive check of the car to ensure the car is in a healthy condition.The check will be done using original diagnositic tools from the manufacturer to ensure the car health status.We are unable to compare our check with STA or AA as they are only an evaluation test. Even if you pass their inspections  you will not be eligible for sgCarMart Warranty until your clear our checks.,btohqsg
"Road worthy inspection.You need workshop inspection for worn out parts.Lower armBall jointGear box leakingAbsorber leakingDo a Facebook search ""pre purchase inspection"" many workshop has such service.",btohqsg
