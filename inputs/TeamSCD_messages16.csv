I see  mine i only install lowering spring  dont know if want to chg to coilover,btohqsg

BBK cost about 1.4 after Nego and discount (don‚Äôt quote my name  no discount one),btohqsg
Rims were oz racing HLT with re004 less than 2k  17‚Äù,btohqsg
If looking for rims I can recommend  got discount if quote my name ü§£,btohqsg
Lower spring will become lower and lower,btohqsg
I want Blitz cause I want the DSC plus and Japan item,btohqsg
I want hks. But 2.7k lol,btohqsg
Lowering springs - stock absorber tend to give way quicker. If car under warranty then can (some dealer don‚Äôt cover absorber) If not also need see your daily needs  are you carrying a lot of people etc. if not coilovers also will bottomout if you full load,btohqsg
Idk why hks so expensive haha,btohqsg
I also looking at blitz but here no one have thats why,btohqsg
Like a lot of ppl selling after awhile,btohqsg
I wait for my stock one spoil I change haha,btohqsg

But tbh  Singapore de car photo place very limited,btohqsg
Overseas u can see a lot of nature,btohqsg
some ns training area open to public,btohqsg
This is the Lim Chu Kang one right,btohqsg
Oh ok. Nvm can save money,btohqsg
Then I go for blitz lor,btohqsg
How is tein comfort? I dont like a stiff ride,btohqsg
"ya  after I put bc everytime I take a slow sharp turn I tot my wheel gonna ""dislocate"" anytime üòÇ",btohqsg
but okay la depends what you‚Äôre really looking for i guess ?,btohqsg
too stiff for street also not forgiving,btohqsg
imagine driving on cte towards sle at 90,btohqsg
hahahahaha my friend had track setup on his type r and my butt leaves the seat everytime I drive over uneven road,btohqsg
Can try ksport sport it‚Äôs quite comfortable,btohqsg
your 17kg spring rate can make my spine break,btohqsg
I don't find mine to be that harsh leh... Maybe the car heavy,btohqsg
Or my butt got more meat to absorb,btohqsg
My bro mazda 6  i find super hard,btohqsg
I also don't know whether their adjusted to soft or stiff. Just drove the car as it was when I bought it,btohqsg
But tyre pressure also can play a part,btohqsg
For me 33 to 35psi it nice. Anything more it becomes bouncy,btohqsg
no it's not mine it's a friend's one üòÖ,btohqsg
I saw it at takashimaya carpark last year taking photos,btohqsg
ahhh I wanted to change to 004 how‚Äôs the review of that tyre ?,btohqsg
I actually don't know what to compare it to,btohqsg
I using 004. Raining cannot corner or drive fast,btohqsg
My previous car I just use normal tyres,btohqsg
I'll need to try those on the car first,btohqsg
AD08 in wet also scared the shit out of me,btohqsg
But I never had any problems with the re004,btohqsg
Maybe just my driving style no issues,btohqsg
cuz I head supposed to be not bad though RE004,btohqsg
Rain I don't corner fast la,btohqsg
Nice. I bought mine when got discount,btohqsg
ofcourse ah .. but like aquaplanning all ok?,btohqsg
I try China type before. Not bad at first. After that cmi.,btohqsg
Other then enter puddles whole car slows down,btohqsg
Corners  I think the LSD will kick in to help,btohqsg
okay la usually push when dry,btohqsg
Wet weather potenza sport is better than re004 and ps4,btohqsg
I will try the endurance then I let u guys know,btohqsg
Anyone try PS5? Heard it‚Äôs out Liao,btohqsg
But dry weather re004 is better for cornering in my opinion,btohqsg
Re004 is only one direction if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
So can only rotate wheels once,btohqsg
I thought sport is supposed to be uuhp,btohqsg
Together w csc6 ps4s and f1ss,btohqsg
While re004 is uhp tgt w ps4 f1a5 etc,btohqsg
PS4S when reach to a point of heat will start to lose grip alr though,btohqsg
Yup they are of same category,btohqsg
Just find re004 more aggressive in dry compared to potenza sport,btohqsg
I might continue with re004 in future cuz to me it looks good on the car üòÇ,btohqsg
try RE71R next ah . Dry sibeh solid,btohqsg
okay ah not as bad as AD08,btohqsg
keep it under 100 lo in rain,btohqsg
Went from ps4 to re004 to potenza sport,btohqsg
AD08 technology very old Liao ‚Ä¶ so can‚Äôt be compared to newer tyres,btohqsg
I think 71R now have the 71RS version  maybe can try that,btohqsg
71R heard sg no more Liao,btohqsg
I think I‚Äôm following that route also,btohqsg
Uuhp tried csc6 and sport.. but need more grip liao.. need semi slick,btohqsg
Unless downgrade car then down to uhp,btohqsg
hahaha 7.5 really need more gripper tyres,btohqsg
üòÇ ya.. but slowly still long..,btohqsg
my bro in law running 235 or 245 still spinning on dry,btohqsg
But I heard sport wear rate is bad af,btohqsg
235 I using also spinning üòÇ,btohqsg
