i'll rob the bank then return the money,btohqsg
i get the girl pregnant but i run away but i still pay for child support,btohqsg
you can save the pics and all but claiming you took it is another level of hypocrisy and shows that you stoop to a lower level than most criminals,btohqsg

Hey guys  tried to make a still photo into a roller using pixlr eHow is it,btohqsg
abit too much motion blur too look realistic imo,btohqsg
considering the context of the shot and all,btohqsg
Not bad but the wheels do wrongly  the wheels are normal blur  u need circular blur,btohqsg
And if possible maybe the trees could be blured maybe at a 90°angle rather thn upwards like the road,btohqsg
Yeah uh pixlr e doesnt have circular blur,btohqsg
Not the most realistic ah but i think it's alright,btohqsg

inb4 average birthyear starts with 201X,btohqsg

2011 coming in alr next yr,btohqsg
"no wonder all the ""enthusiasts"" are so rabak",btohqsg
bro waiting for you liao  i alr bought 2024 tix,btohqsg

1-14 then i'll need to submit pre enlistment doc,btohqsg
wait to rush  rush to wait,btohqsg
all aim at exhaust thinkin got rev incomin,btohqsg
i would too if it was dempsey,btohqsg
because that generation was *chef's kiss*,btohqsg
i mean the fact that they think it would be POPOPOPOP-ing,btohqsg
haha these are the type of people that think C&K is boring,btohqsg
they all aim at the exhaust for like 30secs,btohqsg
but there is genuinely nothing ear-pleasing about pops and bangs,btohqsg
only the burbles of a classic car  or a genuinely high-performance car make sense,btohqsg
okay la imo i do like the sounds it gives me like a sense of adrenaline and excitement ahh but running for it and disrupting others by revving is not a good idea,btohqsg
a very very light burble is fine,btohqsg
something like the stock M4 when it launched,btohqsg
but a gunshot pop and bang is just piss,btohqsg
adryean? you meana space d space r space y space e space a space n?,btohqsg
antilag is okay if it is being used for motorsport purposes,btohqsg
the F1 V6s have antilag. they sound absolutely amazing.same goes for rallycars,btohqsg
if there is PROPER ENGINEERING for those  it's very neat,btohqsg
but if it's a stupid flashtune,btohqsg
Honestly r35 is too overrated like when i see one i dont even care to shoot it,btohqsg
Fine i will do the rx7 one instead,btohqsg
not overrated la just more common compared to the others,btohqsg
cn i steal one of the posters,btohqsg
and hang it in my room,btohqsg
They actually just let u take it,btohqsg
But I asked the guy first,btohqsg
