Regarding the UOB Christmas promo  plan to open a Stash account in early Nov  and register 100K earmark after account opened. Does that mean I only need to put 100K by the end of Nov? and the earmark will end by 15 March 2024? Correct?,btohqsg
Yes  higher payout & tax saving. Tks,btohqsg
50k earmark will still count toward the uob interest  just need to maintain another 50k in there,btohqsg

Ok.. if you already hit FRS you can't do cash top up to SA/RA for tax saving.. you can top up MA upto 8k per calendar for tax relief  need to monitor insurance deduction so that u can topup or on 1st Jan. Can topup SRS (15.3k) for tax relief and you are near to withdrawal age.,btohqsg
Does anyone have same experience as me.. I signed up UOB lady's card recently. And since it has past 1st Oct deadline  my card will not have bonus category until 1st Jan next year.,btohqsg
That means this card will be useless until next year because it doesn't have any bonus miles,btohqsg

U would have nominated the bonus cat at application  it will follow that,btohqsg

I think u will still get the bonus categories that you have chosen for the quarter even if u get the card in the middle of the quarter,btohqsg
