actually golf is pretty spacious for a small family of 4. look small outside but inside space quite ample,btohqsg
pretty fast too if you get the higher spec,btohqsg
i see so many singaporeans fly over the humps without braking,btohqsg
I also do that with sedan,btohqsg
then suddenly hear the suspension frash,btohqsg
Ya man damn stress. I have coilovers so i had to slow down  the prius tailgate me over the hump,btohqsg
Then owners complain why shocks fail so fast.,btohqsg
most likely not their car. when I rent car I go over hump no brake at all tooüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt stress. Just know you‚Äôre protecting your $hock$,btohqsg
Now many suv lower Thier car   I even saw some 1 need to do the zigzag move at hump,btohqsg
1 sec air time+50 points üòÇüëç,btohqsg
I nearly died laughing in the car,btohqsg
You go see a lot of vezel and chr doing that,btohqsg
Should have taken a pic to share,btohqsg
Lowering is a new level man,btohqsg
they notice their car with high heels got severe body roll,btohqsg
Hahahaha exactly  they buy the wrong car liao,btohqsg
Lowered SUV.Get the heightGet the boot spaceGet the cornering feels5 üåüüòÇüëç,btohqsg
i also last time wanted join in the trend to drive suv,btohqsg
after test drive really not suitable for me,btohqsg
I‚Äôm short. I will need a ladder to climb into one.,btohqsg
the height advantage is just so overrated,btohqsg
as aero dynamic is like crap,btohqsg
Kena take photo by@bbfasingaporeand die laughing,btohqsg
I do this on a stock car if there's nobody behind me and not in any rush...,btohqsg
stock car is best  just go only,btohqsg
and some place u know the parking  the height is taller for the clearance at the back,btohqsg
i seen ppl lower car  and just hear the bang sound,btohqsg
and the sales keep telling me,btohqsg
how fast the car acceleration is,btohqsg
Surprisingly ppl say  sitting in x3 feels giddy,btohqsg
and how good the cornering is,btohqsg
I surprised to hear ppl saying cx8 more comfortable‚Ä¶ not from my words,btohqsg
But the luxury of x3 is better,btohqsg
my colleague too. bought the MG SUV. he say dun like the drive.sold within months. lucky after he bought it Coe on the uptrend,btohqsg
i never seat in cx8 before haha,btohqsg
i only know i sit in vezel when take grab,btohqsg
if i sit behind i will die,btohqsg
But then again‚Ä¶ suv drive can‚Äôt compare to sedan,btohqsg
If u don‚Äôt need the space  just keep to sedan,btohqsg
I tried to drive CX5 when i drove car club car for work... almost soiled myself when i went a little too fast on BKE PIE exit,btohqsg
and the car feel like floating when above 100,btohqsg
those are just hatch back with bigger higher wheels,btohqsg
but prefer to sit in an s class,btohqsg
Which is the trend these days also,btohqsg
maybe just for me if i compare a jazz to a vezel,btohqsg
i just find that it is a jazz on heels,btohqsg
Heard someone from Malaysia says the drive is better than cx8,btohqsg
I sat in mitsubishi outlander hind seat b4. I dun find it any spacious aso... ü§î,btohqsg
SUVs these days are honestly just Hatchback on high heels.,btohqsg
