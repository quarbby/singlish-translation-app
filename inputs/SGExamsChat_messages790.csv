My school offered O Level English  Chinese  Math and Science if they managed to score 70% and above in sec 3,btohqsg
I forgot abt the criterias alrd cuz long ago,btohqsg
She take express science from s1,btohqsg
Then sec 2 take express maths,btohqsg
Ok to be specific  Sec 5 NA take O level HCL,btohqsg
Then that means bro gotta take o lvl chi in sec 4,btohqsg
never allowed a math in mine,btohqsg
imagine the jump from NA CL to O level HCL,btohqsg
O level HCL is harder than h1 chinese,btohqsg
Mine got like na ppl can take express subjs from s1,btohqsg
O level Chinese SBB at Sec 4 NA and then Sec 5 take HCl,btohqsg
I love being acoustic exempted from MT,btohqsg
Ya that makes more sense la,btohqsg
It's siao  my cl teacher in na accidentally gave us a HCl paper one time,btohqsg
Literally nobody could understand the first para,btohqsg
In sec school there was the HCl magazine,btohqsg
"Sad story is for JC  I was the only person who did not score very well for CL  so end up I was the only one transferred to the ""weak in H1 Chinese"" class",btohqsg
there is a sec 5 student takes both chinese and higher chinese. but did not take English. I am confused 😵‍💫,btohqsg
My whole class is Chinese passaway one,btohqsg
We don't take it srly also,btohqsg
Urr someone in my class unironically got U tho,btohqsg
So when we collecting MT a level results  I was the only one being happy for scoring an S for H1 MT,btohqsg
I was kinda sad when I saw I got C,btohqsg
But meh considering how much I gave a shit,btohqsg
Same that's why when the teacher give a compo assignment my class takes 1 month to finish,btohqsg
ok cuz my chi cher also my PW cher I go tell him,btohqsg
See I sacrifice Chinese for pw,btohqsg
"For us  is ""if you do finish your compo during recess  you donnid come class  so can leave sch early""",btohqsg
Something I found odd is most of the teachers in my school don't hold back students for recess,btohqsg
the na chinese teacher have to teach hanyupinyin and read every single word in textbook because the students cannot even read,btohqsg
But you know they should have because the following lesson etc  you alr move on to next topic,btohqsg
Sometimes my sis speaks chi in ABIT of ang mo accent also,btohqsg
Mine too  like my class were shit at chinese but were too damn hardworking cus we need pass chinese  so wewillinglydid it during break,btohqsg
And then the prev topic  you will be like...hold on  what did I learn,btohqsg
For some reason I don't rly have any ang mo accent when I speak tho,btohqsg
Nah literally I rmb a chi lesson so vividly. The teacher was going through the format for Chinese email,btohqsg
Best CL class moment was our H1 CL made us watch Taiwanese reality debate shows,btohqsg
My Tamil is non existent haha,btohqsg
Like this occured multiple of classes,btohqsg
"Half way through  the bell rings for recess..I could you not  projector shutoff  laptop shutoff. Stand up say goodbye to teacher and the rest of the class thought nothing much.Following lesson   OK class ""we going to do a trial exam for email""",btohqsg
Ok but tbh is cus for oral  they alr confirmed Chinese media and TV is the topic so make sense,btohqsg
I actually read that watching more tv shows or basically news in chi helps you alot,btohqsg
I took up that advice and actually somewhat improved my Chinese,btohqsg
This JC Cher ik right she teach chi one then I was joking abt how I disappointed my chi cher w my chi gradesShe's deadass like: nevermind go get A for the other subjects lor,btohqsg
Funniest moment  we watched it in x0.5 speed cus the taiwan ppl speak damn fast,btohqsg
My speaking is tolerable is cuz,btohqsg
I literally need to speak it in my family,btohqsg
Hey but y'all with the Korean dramas can watch like 100 episodes and can only do greetings in Korean,btohqsg
but not sure why she do not take English,btohqsg
Then writing n reading I rly don't care then U can guess what happen nexts,btohqsg
CL and HCL can. Cus HCL require them to do O lvl CL at sec 3.but the english portion uh....,btohqsg
Meanwhile others watch 100 episodes of taiwanese dramas and every dialect also can spurt,btohqsg
I think he means cannot take GP as standalone,btohqsg
I had a classmate that did that and replaced his English with french ...so basically 2 Mt languages,btohqsg
TM right got ~20 ppl who failed English then need retake,btohqsg
Chinese and french...I wonder what he was thinking,btohqsg
The rest got booted to idk whr,btohqsg
Bruh my batch alr got 80% of the class failing English at sec 5,btohqsg
I rmb prelims only 3 ppl passed English,btohqsg
Idk why but the jump for English from sec 4 to 5 is like another world,btohqsg
I am at a popular now,btohqsg
Looking at the hcl tys 😂,btohqsg
Actly I shld go and take a look at whats in my sis test,btohqsg
Fml they got editing  but cl ver,btohqsg

PSLE HCL Composition Topic: Complete the story: Today is John's Birthday. John's is rushing home after school to celebrate his birthday with his mother ......,btohqsg
"He could not be anymore excited he thought to himself ""I'm one year older  one less year less from being able to drive a car"". That has always been his dream  to drive the car he oves with the person he loves beside him. Then as the sun rose  he wokeup from his dream  he realised his birthday was in 1 week's time.",btohqsg
Buddy needs to go back to school to learn english,btohqsg
want to see what i wrote back then?,btohqsg
"Today was John's birthday  and he couldn't wait to get home from school. He had been looking forward to this day for what felt like forever. As he rushed out of the school gates  he felt a surge of excitement and happiness. He had plans to celebrate with his mother  and he couldn't wait to see the smile on her face when he walked in the door.In his haste  John didn't notice the red light at the crosswalk. He stepped out into the street  and before he could even react  a truck came speeding around the corner and knocked him to the ground.John's world went dark  and everything went silent. He felt a sharp pain in his head  and then... nothing.The truck driver slammed on the brakes  but it was too late. John's body lay motionless on the pavement. The driver jumped out of the truck  horrified by what had just happened.John's mother was waiting at home  eagerly preparing his favorite cake and dinner. But as the minutes ticked by  she began to worry. Where was John? He should have been home by now.The doorbell rang  and she opened the door to find a somber-faced police officer standing on her porch. ""Ma'am  I have some terrible news..."" he began  his voice trembling.John's mother's world came crashing down around her as she heard the words she would never forget: ""Your son was in an accident. I'm so sorry  ma'am. He didn't make it.""The celebration that was meant to be a joyous occasion turned into a tragedy. John's life was cut short in an instant  all because of a moment of recklessness. His mother was left with only memories of her dear son  and a pain that would never go away.In the days and weeks that followed  John's mother struggled to cope with the loss of her child. She became withdrawn and isolated  unable to face the world without her son by her side. She would often find herself standing at the crosswalk where John was killed  reliving the moment over and over again in her mind.As time went on  she began to experience flashbacks and nightmares  reliving the trauma of that fateful day. She would wake up in the middle of the night  drenched in sweat  with the sound of screeching tires and shattering glass echoing in her mind.The diagnosis was clear: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). John's mother was trapped in a never-ending cycle of grief and trauma  unable to escape the pain of her loss.She sought therapy and support  but the pain never fully went away. She learned to live with it  but the scars of that day would always remain. The memory of John's bright smile and eager excitement on his last birthday would haunt her forever  a bittersweet reminder of the fragility of life and the devastating consequences of a single moment of recklessness.",btohqsg

This 23-year-old gave up being a RSAF regular and took a more-than-70% pay cut to move to a sleepy town in Kyushu to pursue his dream of playing pro baseball.Singapore’s national team captain Eleazar Ng tells CNA his story:https://cna.asia/44EGkI6,btohqsg
Have you all finished your WAs tho( to all JC students:)),btohqsg
If u do things with enough confidence u would be surprised as to the extent to which it can be pushed to,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcEbE_-cigAthey actually got mothership to do a interview,btohqsg
This was me before but i didnt want to make a scene,btohqsg
My bro dun seem to have any exams,btohqsg
hmmm maybe! I only know of his oral mt but cant be no exam till promos right,btohqsg
No MYE for 2024 JC/MI intake but some schools may have timed practices or whatever name they can come up with,btohqsg
Yes our sch has time practice,btohqsg
because you bro do not want your parents to know his results,btohqsg
And tbh i dont rly like that they removed myeTo quote my math cher  theres no mye and then only have the baby tests so the only big test in Y5 is promos. Then people may not be prepared for the big test,btohqsg
thats why he do not want parents to know he did badly,btohqsg
Yea  I am with you on thisRemoving MYE feels like kicking the can down the road — that isn’t all too far down actually,btohqsg
got time practice or class tests even before mye is cancelled,btohqsg
now k2 got exams i heard,btohqsg
although no idea what the exams are for since pri school enrollment still uses the lottery system,btohqsg
Ya  but those were done in addition to MYENow  those are done in place of MYE,btohqsg
I feel like for me I will just have to do more time practice myself and take the baby test very seriouslyEspecially since I want to offer H3  the baby test must do well too,btohqsg
students need to have time management skills. timed practice students may not be serious,btohqsg
Yes i agree. In y4 i slept during all the time practice,btohqsg
Right now the next batch of p1 kids in my neighbourhood has these two as a lottery system,btohqsg
for my sec sch at least got mock prelim  in june or july i think,btohqsg
Do they call it mock prelim?,btohqsg
shld be  some of the dates have been confirmed,btohqsg
need check the parents gateway lol,btohqsg
Where all the basketball girls come from,btohqsg
Eunos primary has closed so now the lottery in my neihhbourhood is Telok Kurau primary and Maha Bodhi primary,btohqsg
for my sec school sec 4 NA students have two prelims,btohqsg
maha bodhi is massive for a pri school,btohqsg
Having dates fixed doesn’t mean they are called mock prelims though,btohqsg
Same pri sch as our founding father,btohqsg
i wholeheartedly agree on this too,btohqsg
cuz its like the national exam simulation,btohqsg
wait till they make it to Uni as well (which should be the goal for all JC students???),btohqsg
there's actually such a thing as mid term test at the half way point of each semester,btohqsg
to get 90rp just like you,btohqsg
i think you jumbled up the numbers,btohqsg
please dont ask me what noise a tortoise make cause..idk,btohqsg
Let’s see how this batch of J1 handle promos  if there is any outcry,btohqsg
nothing is impossible if i have a say in it,btohqsg
bruh what is that open ended please,btohqsg
i only got into NTU because my dada donated a lot of money,btohqsg
so that the first time we take the full paper in the exam environment isnt just at prelim,btohqsg
My goal is to get >80% for the subject that I want to offer the H3,btohqsg
And other subj cant be too bad or sch wont let you take h3,btohqsg
Schools will usually define what it means to be “not too bad” before the examsLucky that when I was a student  the criteria werent strict and I was allowed to do S paper (sorta H3) for chem despite flopping my f math 🤡,btohqsg
Their criteria is B for the h3 subj and. E for the restBut I feel like my other subj should minimally be B or C  to be able to cope with the H3,btohqsg
Wait thats a very generous criteria to be eligible for H3  no?,btohqsg
“the rest” inclusive of GP?Yea  what you are thinking is sensible,btohqsg
Not all schools’ internal exams are of the same standards so every school can set their own criteria,btohqsg
Q26. “Nothing. I got no money”,btohqsg
no bro u need to insert all the wrong answers,btohqsg
I think thats on paper only cause my senpai say her friend got rejected from h3 Econs cause hearsay her promos got 1 B. but could be due to other factorsThey would have some form of selections or interviews beforehand i think to determine if you can take. so if you fail the selection i think also gg,btohqsg
Tuition held MYE for students and some parents KBKB about that,btohqsg
Actually I forgot 😅 but yea I think inclusive of GPI think I can pass Gp with ease though. A or not is another issue but >E is doable,btohqsg
Just do your best and trust that whatever the outcome  it is the best outcome possible,btohqsg
actually can connect everything to hops 😂😂😂,btohqsg
its another way of saying swimming,btohqsg
i now realise this may have been overkill,btohqsg
lemme weigh it when i get home,btohqsg
wonder if i shld return it,btohqsg
the idea was my mom n i have seperate powerbanks,btohqsg
with packaging so maybe like -20g,btohqsg
Some mala store auntie call me mei nu,btohqsg
odd samsung doesnt have 45w powerbank only 25e,btohqsg
even my mom say quite chonky,btohqsg
bruh i think the store auntie too sleepy alr,btohqsg
She say her vision not that good,btohqsg
Hi did anyone here receive mindef letter to enlist for diploma (I’m still studying),btohqsg
Am I suppose to leave it as it is or do smt about it,btohqsg
🙏🏻 I just told my friend to send me the content of his letter  problem solve alr thanks,btohqsg
Should see the big BoisAnker Powerhouse 535 Portable Power Station  512Wh Portable Generator 500W 7-Port Outdoor Generator:https://sg.shp.ee/2nGBVsq,btohqsg
mindef letter? its just a letter. unless its specified the location of enlisting...you are not actually enlisting,btohqsg
So can leave it as it is?,btohqsg
that has a more specific use case,btohqsg
a phone is ard 5000mah so 10k is alrdy good enuff,btohqsg
and most laptops need >50w anyways,btohqsg
fyi usually 20k mAh batt are not indicative of actual capacity,btohqsg
The technical side of it is complicated  but the rule is simple. The actual capacity of a power bank is about 2/3 of the capacity indicated. The rest disappears due to voltage conversion or is lost during charging  especially as heat.,btohqsg
if anyone is wondering why ur power bank runs out so fast when charging stuff when it shldn't,btohqsg
Heyo there's goes the cute anime sticker,btohqsg
just checked and nth on pg yet but they mentioned it during assembly,btohqsg
I’m thinking that it would be too sensitive to name it “mock prelim”But just like what a really really very very old ah pek had once said “What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet” 🌹,btohqsg
had to google the quote lol,btohqsg
Haha it’s like the only O level lit thing that I remember — and not because I took lit  but my friends who took lit kept telling me about this quote,btohqsg
Wait till u find out your 1TB drive isn't 1TB,btohqsg
im surprised that word is not flagged,btohqsg
My 4tb ssd was actually only 3.4tb!,btohqsg
Damn they be eating 0.2tb per increment on 1tb,btohqsg
No this can't be... it says I am 102% African with a 2% margin of error. WHY LORD WHY?!?!,btohqsg
The more important information would be what sample they require,btohqsg
my moms fren bought this and its so fking good,btohqsg
Hihi i planning study for Os as priv candidate while in NS so i can go poly after. I just kena pes e9. How long will it take to get my enlistment date ah? N how's e9 in NS?,btohqsg
E9 in NS will definitely have plenty of time to study for Os,btohqsg
Maybe even some colleagues to help you out if they took the same subjects,btohqsg
studying might be your best use of time in NS if you’re E9 tbh,btohqsg
Yeah at least you wouldve accomplished something in the 2 years instead of wasting it (me),btohqsg
1+ years of shaking leg sleep in office,btohqsg
Ive learnt the art of delaying all my work till 5.25pm to submit,btohqsg
oh ya i finish the work but then wait to submit,btohqsg
u damn lucky to get e9 HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Or unlucky because to get e9 youd be suffering from something,btohqsg
only thing not good is u can't run or jump in any army camps or bases,btohqsg
my ns life more shag than combat,btohqsg
cuz they max out my shift,btohqsg
so I got literally no rest time xD,btohqsg
Prob the reason you got pes e9  that is suffering he referring to,btohqsg
for me the doctor discharged me right after my ns,btohqsg
so... I guess I just nice finished ns with e9 pes,btohqsg
Bruh I went to do echocardiography for my ns followup check. They can’t detect parts of my heart cause I’m too skinny 🫠,btohqsg
Is that grounds for free downpes,btohqsg
I literally went cmpb and alr the mo downpes me on the spot cause one of my eyes is 600  the other is like 50/100,btohqsg
What do ppl do tho if they e9,btohqsg
i heard it mostly paper work n stretches cuz cant do physical activity,btohqsg
bedok is a clerk and usually pes e will become clerk just like him,btohqsg
E9 your BMT is also modified which basically means clerk,btohqsg
so he studying for A lvls,btohqsg
Can be like bedok too as private candidate,btohqsg
I wonder pes e will be assign to call centres anot,btohqsg
oh he got U for his A lvl subj,btohqsg
Basically you graduate bmt to go to ASA training immediately lmao,btohqsg
Either way it does not look like I’ll be pes b1 at all but maybe who knows,btohqsg
I dont think ive seen E9s do anything else  maybe driver,btohqsg
I guess im 100% doing ASA i guess cuz im exempted from anything driver related lol,btohqsg
The BMT is legit u sit in lecture for BMT,btohqsg
then do they sleepover or bookout everyday,btohqsg
Got assessment a bit la but this is Mindef u fail also nothing one,btohqsg
Wait sorry i was confirming your sentence,btohqsg
then how pes c bmt is like,btohqsg
C9 u got excuse physical activity?,btohqsg
So instead of reporting at NS i report at home?,btohqsg
Idk 😭 i saw reddit say got hbl,btohqsg
The ppl on reddit confusing me lol,btohqsg
Might be for covid only idk,btohqsg
Okay i wasnt excuse physical but,btohqsg
The physical for pes c is do nothing anyway,btohqsg
i thought pes C cannot push up or smth,btohqsg
So for e9 dh any heavy load carrying or smtg?,btohqsg
or is it the shouting one,btohqsg
Pes c is still physically capable,btohqsg
No siao E9 solely admin roles,btohqsg
Even a person who only has one hand/arm can do E9 stuff so,btohqsg
He can get his third penta U,btohqsg
Icic but i cant figure out how to study though for English in Os 😭 like idh tutors or anyth. some of my friends told me to just use chatgpt...? Is that reliable for english ?,btohqsg
I wouldnt trust chatgpt to help you study anything tbh,btohqsg
please never use chatgpt to cheese through anything,btohqsg
Maybe if you can afford it  get a tuition teacher or maybe even a cheap uni student to help you,btohqsg
the best way to study for english is to get into a toxic relationship so you can practice interpretating various meanings,btohqsg
after i started dating my english unironically got better,btohqsg
my english has been falling off,btohqsg
Does reading harry potter books help w/ eng,btohqsg
After i finished ns my english ironically gotten worse,btohqsg
Reading anything with proper English helps,btohqsg
reading any form of literature would,btohqsg
"You may not really understand grammar rules but youll subconsciously pick up what is ""proper"" english",btohqsg
Like a voice inside of you that tells you what sounds right or wrong,btohqsg
You could  maybe someone here can offer to vet through and see how to improve,btohqsg
im hot ass at paper 1 but i trauma dumped and came out with A2,btohqsg
Trauma dump with proper england pls,btohqsg

@aforaceIf i dont get >90% for bio promos im gonna Kilometres per second/hj,btohqsg
This sounds like me in chem,btohqsg
Not surprising considering a lot of ppl talk Singlish/broken English,btohqsg
I need to stop having mental health issues,btohqsg
In my office there’s this guy that literally uses swear words in almost every sentence,btohqsg
Wah but 90% is a hard target tbh,btohqsg
Like he everything must say cheebai like wtf,btohqsg
I think I can if I actually study,btohqsg
Help…me hving mental health issues throughout last sem was a …,btohqsg
Mental health issues always come at the most inconvenient timings,btohqsg
I havent studied properly since like,btohqsg
tbh i was feeling horrible when i got 78% in prelims coz my practical pulled me down (got 52% for that),btohqsg
Isok now U still got time,btohqsg
I hope you are feeling better now,btohqsg
I feel bad seeing ppl mug like hell and get bad marks,btohqsg
While i didnt study at all and got the same mark as them,btohqsg
I was a bit insensitive coz i was still the class highest but i think my cher knows fr my face im still not happy,btohqsg
i was lucky i study and get whatever i wanted,btohqsg
I think this isn't rly an issue just didn't shove it down other ppl,btohqsg
Its normal to feel this way,btohqsg
I think it needs some luck,btohqsg
But sometimes it can be due to studying the wrong way,btohqsg
This is my bro (but i think he more extreme),btohqsg
Brb I gotta ask my depression to come later,btohqsg
Why not ask it to never come,btohqsg
The psychologists hate this one simple trick,btohqsg
I trauma dump until i kena fail in essay during sec 5 🥹,btohqsg
Cuz of that i scared to just trauma dump LOL,btohqsg
means u nrver dump hard enough,btohqsg
i almost made my characters a mlm relationship but idk if cambridge swings that way,btohqsg
so i just gave the girl a unisex name,btohqsg
u couldve been a man in your next life,btohqsg
