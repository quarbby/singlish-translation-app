Depends on the amount you have in the account. If you have $100k  UOB one will be better with 5% interest rate.,btohqsg
I heard this before but you must really know the used cars market.Typically it works only for the rarer and more unique cars where there is Price Asymmetry. The seller doesn't know the true value of the car (and sells cheaper than true value to you) and the buyer doesn't know the true value of the car (and buys more expensive than true value from you).,btohqsg
nope it should never be the case. its your money and you are asking them to transfer excess back to you,btohqsg

UOB absolute for hospital bill can split 6months payment? Assuming hosp is above $10k,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt exactly 500? Or 500.10? When you deposit that extra?,btohqsg
I think you can discuss with hospital for 6 monthly payment.Just out of curiosity  Absolute is only give 1.5%  right? Perhaps there are better miles or cashback card out there?,btohqsg
Can  as long as you don‚Äôt withdraw it to confuse yourself n worry it will fall below $500.,btohqsg
Oooo didnt know hospital got that kind of dicussion for 6months‚Ä¶ maybe‚Ä¶ yes absolute 1.5%‚Ä¶okay maybe ill look into other cards,btohqsg
why not both if flushed with cash? lol,btohqsg

The problem is there‚Äôs is no way to check the MCC codes by yourself other than calling the hotline,btohqsg
The POSB FD is only for new or existing customers also can get this rate,btohqsg
is there an link to an official webpage for this?,btohqsg
So many typos  different fonts  low res image  you think banks will put this out? Lmao,btohqsg
then how did u get the image,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know yet. Let me first do a check with my banker.,btohqsg
just make sure don't click any weird links or scan any QR codes.. always login at official websites,btohqsg
Yup i checked. Its in. Thanks!,btohqsg
Loans rates in sg are falling alrdy ....,btohqsg
And posb website do not have the rates that's shown ....,btohqsg
Is a scam. They tried using SMS to scam too.,btohqsg
no official notice on their website  text ill-formatted on that picture and a few other red flags,btohqsg
Please do not spread misinformation here  and if you go to the POSB website itself to click on the rates for SGD fixed deposits  it goes to DBS  seems like POSB does NOT even run SGD fixed deposits at all,btohqsg
Anything can be scammed  even the scamshield app....,btohqsg
"I have deleted the POSB FD ""promo"" which is not an official promotion. Please exercise caution when you click through links especially if they are attractive promos.",btohqsg
yeah a separate non official phone number is a big red flag,btohqsg
if using dbs/posb card can check mcc via ibanking chatbot,btohqsg
not live as in not chat with human cso,btohqsg
Yes agreed and I report to posb. My banker also told me is not true,btohqsg
Thats too complicated.Can you break down to make it clear?,btohqsg
