I was driving on a merging lane. I was in front at the right and even signal my intention. This Mazda driver just sped up from the back and horned me and die die want to cut in front of me. I must brake to let him go pass. Drove beside him and tempted to give him the finger. Angst,btohqsg

Review of the legendary nasi padang at bedok reservoirDesa Rancapanggung Malay Cuisine run by our brother@awj_moodVerdict: 8.5/10Personally  I love nasi padang. It's always a good alternative to the Chinese cai fan fare I usually have. But   nasi padang is generally always more expensive than cai fan. At this store  you can get a huge packet of nasi padang for cai fan price (which was a pleasant surprise and huge motivator for me to come back for a repeat purchase).I ordered the beef rendang set. The beef was tender and tasty which is heaps better than most stores that serve you a hard piece of dry meat that can become makeshift murder weapons. If you're a meat eater you might want to add a double portion of meat.The sambal also damn shiok. 😍I think@awj_moodscared I not enough to eat. The rice he gave me was like a mini mountain.Definitely will order again. - J,btohqsg
