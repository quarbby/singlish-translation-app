I mean it's the general consensus around the world. We lack creativity and only know how to study,btohqsg
But those who havnt left the comfort of their parents riches arent really,btohqsg
Like there's quite a few who are dumb as bricks  especially the Ang moh teenage guys studying here,btohqsg
Oh  if you're going by that category  they're definitely not street smart,btohqsg

Ironing and polishing is as easy as watching others do  or a YouTube video helps too,btohqsg

Rich people don’t have to worry about prestige,btohqsg
Idk lol. Maybe I'm just too poor to understand,btohqsg
So don’t need to aim for prestige,btohqsg
They just needa be sure who they wana procreate with,btohqsg
UWC students are actually nicest so far that ive met,btohqsg
Their sch culture is actually quite multiracial,btohqsg
