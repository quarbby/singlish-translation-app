If u plan right this can be better than a full-time job,btohqsg
U just have to work at the right hours and place urself at right places,btohqsg
Is it more worth to do stack or single trip?,btohqsg
Stack is more worth it but xiong,btohqsg
But some stack is out of the way 1,btohqsg
Ask you from East go to west then go to east side again,btohqsg
Usually this kind i go my own route. Clear east first then west ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Really depends ..  normally small fares means the distance is nearby so just take and go   along the way u have anything then stack. If u get jobs with good fares then I suggest u proceed to complete it unless in-between u get something along the way both pick and drop points must be aligned . Mostly u can stack when u are in town area .. if cannot stack don't waste time waiting cause ur time is your money   and let's say u wait and there is no order then u risking your account punctuality,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ But do u chit chat with the contact order? the most you will talk to the contact order 2 to 3 min right.,btohqsg
Bro let's say u do deliveroo and say the restaurant overlooked their order and when u arrive there they ask u wait .. isn't it the same ... Now most mobile plans are free outgoing even the prepaid ones ..won't it be better for u to call and confirm at least it will be a smooth process.. sometimes even when they put do not call to confirm I still call caus that one call could save me my time in turn my income,btohqsg
then it is not the phone bill issue as what you voice out in your message.,btohqsg
If u need any support feel free to dm me ..,btohqsg
I can only say if llm change their system to be like grab panda or deliveroo would be better. There's no sense that would want rider to call restaurant since food/item already being ordered by customer andwho is paying for the phone bill,btohqsg
So isn't it better u call once u accept   if not ready can cancel   don't need waste your effort cycle there,btohqsg
Just asking all opinion if take from city Square mall deliver to jurong west area total get credit $19 its it worth it?,btohqsg
U may think that if they ask u wait u cancel u don't lose anything   but then again u have wasted ur time and effort going there ..,btohqsg
Then after at jurong west just hope can have an order from west side to east side again,btohqsg
My advice  don't travel too much to do a job .. unless u using hybrid or diesel,btohqsg
Personal opinion  if need me go west  i will take if order above $25,btohqsg
Chances of getting another order from west quite low. Unless u doing other things like eg  ryde. For you to come back to town area from west.,btohqsg
U will be at the mall yes  how sure are u to get the next order .. like u said there are alot riders there too yeah,btohqsg
I wait for those which is convenient for me 1,btohqsg
That same one min   if u call ur life it's easier,btohqsg
U can fool us but pls don't fool urself,btohqsg
So u did 15 orders in 2 hrs yeah..all I can see is 6,btohqsg
Drop off  just nice another pick up ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
So meaning to say u are earning $75 per hour using bicycle.,btohqsg
Y get so agressive.. all m asking is u make $75 per hour ? And  in 2 hrs u do 15 orders pedaling ?,btohqsg
Still not answering my question.. 15 orders in 2 hrs ?,btohqsg
But how u do 15 order in 2 hrs. Last time i got scooter. Max also 1 hr 4 order ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
why not u screenshot whole log. That will clear ppl doubt.,btohqsg
And this is like super good time. ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
and is this consistent or just one day special,btohqsg
Ok sorry just wanted to make sure .. so one order u perform is 8mins average ( pick up   travel   drop off) ... And one order average u earn $10 for a 8 min job... Bro u must be a super hero,btohqsg
Bro u safe entry go inside restaurant take food and go to your bicycle already 5 mins .. but u still manage a 8 min average..,btohqsg
i have doubt but that is my opinion.,btohqsg
HAHAH by the time i find the restaurant. I think 8 mins have passed ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Ok I see   so all your orders from west mall to opposite block ah,btohqsg
Don't say this   wait he say u slow ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Bro next time form westgate to opp block just walk don't need to even cycle .. lol can exercise more,btohqsg
Exactly what I said just now .u can fool us but not yourself ...,btohqsg
i think he is the only rider in Westgate cos all the nearby jobs  he bao ka liao,btohqsg
U ask me how long I doing delivery   long enough to know that no matter what u cant do 15 different orders in 2hrs especially with bicycle. Not condemning ur cycling skills or whatever but   15 orders means 15 different pick ups and drop offs ...just dosent make sense   if a clustered situation with one point loading can prob do Max 8 drops per hr ...,btohqsg
Stop the jokes bro   none of your data got Westgate to J condo,btohqsg
Sorry bro to have wasted ur 8 mins   by now u could have completed one order,btohqsg
The jokes on u man ...,btohqsg
Omg.. i go and see my deliveroo.xxxi realise i super slow. I 1 trip almost 40 mins ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
"Don't worry we are humans not super ""Heng"" to complete in 8 mins",btohqsg
That's reality   hope one day u can wake up to it,btohqsg
Rest early so that u can go westgate tomo to take all their orders,btohqsg
