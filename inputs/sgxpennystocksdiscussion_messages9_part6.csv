Yup i think Master also cannot chart tommorow will be based purely on sentiment...about the results...good luck to all vested💪💪💪,btohqsg
But then again remember what happened to MT after outstanding results all way downhill....,btohqsg
But at least got guide.. 287 . .. above 3 is good for those vested 😀. Huat all! I saw 2.15 thought technical rebound to 2.5.. but never buy 😅 anyway.. its an learning experience.,btohqsg
But then to be fair TG price in klse and in sgx very close price movements unlike MT in Taiwan and MT in Singapore,btohqsg
$2 to $1.2  i think its bad😜,btohqsg

Thanks. I got out at $1.28 few days ago when sentiment was really bad. Was worried it will really go down to $1. So got out while still have little profit instead of loss,btohqsg
Ok. Will try to get in with small position. Thanks for sharing. P.s reading the forum in share junction really stressed me out🤣,btohqsg
And MT forum always crowded with those people,btohqsg
Yes  it will be a long while before life can be normalised  even when vacinne is out,btohqsg
Effectiveness is questionable especially if vacinne is rushed out,btohqsg
