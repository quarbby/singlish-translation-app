alot of the paikia from my sch take lol,btohqsg
my sis want to take that in jc,btohqsg
physics is the best science objectively,btohqsg
Is poly or JC better? Should I choose Raffles?,btohqsg
"""you see people jump down bridge you also go do ah""",btohqsg
Sign on is the best option,btohqsg
i think we all high alr,btohqsg
go study8 months to A lvl only,btohqsg
yest is first time i tslk hrte,btohqsg
ofc food then you get so excited,btohqsg
Which is better Raffles or Hwa Chong?,btohqsg
now u are old dude too,btohqsg
What happend to hello? What happened to inclusivity?,btohqsg
Ill give u the best optionYour house,btohqsg
nothing to do with it at JC level lmao,btohqsg
yea idk why ppl think hwach and dhs are very chinesey jcs,btohqsg
what if i live in Argentina,btohqsg
ya tbf i rly like their house shirts,btohqsg
like realistically both hci and raffles give you the same things that matter,btohqsg
No no nodon't fall into the valley,btohqsg
because there are almost zero minorities,btohqsg
the minorities cannot adapt to the chi culture,btohqsg
raffles has Indian and angmo people,btohqsg
Glad u laugh  they say laughter is the best medicine,btohqsg
my jc also got western ppl,btohqsg
my og got a eurasian girl lor,btohqsg
then got another girl in my cg from czech republic,btohqsg
last time I took on 2 Nepalese studentstheir dads arr Gurkhas here,btohqsg
"my og had an arab guy and the boys said ""which one is the most likely to own a plane""",btohqsg
the culture is mainly on the sec sch side,btohqsg
the jc side is no diff from others,btohqsg
the cool part is when they fill up address on my registration form  it's the gurkha camp,btohqsg
but there’s the perception la that’s why ppl will also apply to there less if they aren’t chinese,btohqsg
I’ve seen angmoh people in ite,btohqsg
how is ip jae divide in ip jcs though,btohqsg
is it like v bad or decent,btohqsg
tbf i asking on behalf of my little sis  she wants to go to a ip jc via jae route,btohqsg
if u got qn i can help u ask,btohqsg
got divide but it’s usually not that bad lol,btohqsg
like it won’t stop you from making friends,btohqsg
bc later the ip kids dw to talk to jae kids,btohqsg
or like scared the laugh at them bc they camr from neighbourbood sec sch,btohqsg
if anything it’s just them being more comfortable with people they alr know,btohqsg
the neighbourhood sec schs should have an ip programme to directly affiliate to yijc,btohqsg
What are the cohort and teaching staff like?,btohqsg
Huh ip programme why go to yi?,btohqsg
They can have a massive cohort size if they lower COP to like 20 or smth,btohqsg
that's what they prob tryna do 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
i direct ur msg to my friend ya,btohqsg
but nobody wants to go yi,btohqsg
but idt she will respond so fast,btohqsg
It's also cause some are sap schs lah,btohqsg
I thought moe gives all schs equal budgets to work with?,btohqsg
But ofc ri and hci have alumnus donations and stuff  the other top jcs too,btohqsg
ok im gonna be super blunt because this is tele,btohqsg
hello i am waiting for poly to start   I am going to china tommorow alone for fun does anyone know how much yuan I should bring,btohqsg
i personally dont mind making friends with jae ppl like talking to them  doing group projects etc,btohqsg
u want to spend how much on food souvenir taxi public transport,btohqsg
but then i would definitely prefer to hang out with my friends since y2 if i could choose,btohqsg
+ this is a very vague qn bc we also dk how long u going for holiday,btohqsg
my friend tell me bring 20k but I can only bring 10k,btohqsg
have you made any jae friends tho,btohqsg
i went to china last yr aft os,btohqsg
my parents brought an upwards of 5k sgd,btohqsg
and if i got smth personal i would also prefer to talk to themthis isnt discriminating against jae btw its just that most ppl prefer ppl they are alr familiar with. like in y3y4 i also mix mostly with my y2 friends,btohqsg
but china stuff is cheaper than sg stuff,btohqsg
the food there quantity alot but v cheap,btohqsg
i showed 1 jae person around the sch and exchanged numbers with her but thats it,btohqsg
i fly in shenzhen and fly out chongqing,btohqsg
i went to shenzhen last yr also,btohqsg
because my parents don't go china,btohqsg
cos my sis scared of this,btohqsg
like ppl in ip ignore her,btohqsg
chinas stuff is rly a lot cheaper,btohqsg
like im not going to sugarcoat this but then if i got some personal trouble i would def prefer to ask my friends from jh for help or advice because ik them longer and trust them more,btohqsg
LOL pls lah I 1 week I brought less than 10k yuan not fucking enough,btohqsg
their hand sanitizer bottle is $1 only sia,btohqsg
ik a few ip dhs ppl,btohqsg
Mind u that was on  a sch trip,btohqsg
over here just a small hand sanitiser bottle like so many dollars alr,btohqsg
but bc sg cost of living damn high,btohqsg
Just fyi but that was back then in 2019,btohqsg
because i have hard time trusting people due to some personal issues and im more of the intorverted kind irl,btohqsg
guys do yall have curfew for jc,btohqsg
like i was adopted by my current friends in y2 lol,btohqsg
cos aft cca i usually go out w friends for dinner,btohqsg
also why is dhs not rly considered for jae students ah,btohqsg
But nvr go to that pt ah,btohqsg
ok it depends on ur definition of ignore,btohqsg
ppl may make small talk with you,btohqsg
But tbh right there's a soft curfew for my parents,btohqsg
Awww do u wish for a slow or fast death,btohqsg
Aft 11pm they confirm not happy,btohqsg
bro is the most studious and disciplined student,btohqsg
but they may not want to invite you for lunch with their ip friends because like ur new afterall,btohqsg
my friends in Malaysia told me to china because it is our duty to return to our ancestral country,btohqsg
then whether or not u count this as ostracisation,btohqsg
is rly up to u la,btohqsg
do the jae ppl form cliques and stay away from the ip ppl,btohqsg
n she learn v fast her grades v good,btohqsg
Iw to shoot myself w cca bruh,btohqsg
ngl the past 2 weeks we havent gotten our classes yet and i mostly hang around with my jh friends,btohqsg
Then like not alot of ppl,btohqsg
if i have more than 2 lects in a day,btohqsg
I used to have 3 lectures back to back xd,btohqsg
i spend less than 10 dollars for post cca dinner,btohqsg
i feel bad for the netballers that end at 10pm,btohqsg
then they stay up till 11pm BRUH,btohqsg
yk jc ppl are insane right?,btohqsg
don't worry  you will spend a lot again after NSand a lot a lot more after Uniand if marriage and kids come in  no eyes see liao,btohqsg
@lxrthanyway regarding ip jae divide what i have to say is that it def exists  its just how big it is and also ask ur sis to do 2 things1. keep an open mind - sometimes you have to talk to ip ppl first. ip ppl are also human  and they may feel shy too seeing someone they dk. If they initiate conversation then its great. dont like have inferiority complex  ppl can have their own ip friends AND be friends with you2. have realistic expectations. student council pres is inevitably gonna be an ip kid because elections are glorified popularity contests but its not impossible for jae kids to get sc positions. also if ppl prefer to spend time with their ip friends its not a sin. humans like familiarity and you'd also prefer to spend time with your sec sch bestie (if you have one) as compared to friendly but unfamiliar ppl right ?,btohqsg
my sis wants to go ri sia,btohqsg
it differs from cohort to cohort,btohqsg
she switched her mind from dhs,btohqsg
if she can then go for it lor,btohqsg
that one is not limited to one sch,btohqsg
ya her eoy tests results all raw r5 single digit,btohqsg
i was actually supposed to be off on thurs,btohqsg
with inflation I think around there,btohqsg
o levels can blindsight tho so eh,btohqsg
but because of a stupid medic in 9SIR,btohqsg
i mean sec 1 i got raw 6 but olvls i got 30,btohqsg
if you get then i treat you hotpot,btohqsg
yijc need raw 20 to go,btohqsg
jc must at least raw 20,btohqsg
-2 for cca  -2 for hmt  -2 for pe  -2 for recess  -2 for clep,btohqsg
wait U also apply to Manchester hor,btohqsg
i got -2 for a perfect discipline record aswell!!!,btohqsg
similar caseI do 6 × ⅓ chin ups last timebut they still fail me,btohqsg
can’t wait to finish my loans,btohqsg
That's what I get in a week????,btohqsg
if i get A for GP,btohqsg
might not have to. nvm discuss with you during recess week,btohqsg
i thought it was genocide paper,btohqsg
many rich people that are beyond our imagination,btohqsg
what does redox have to do with deez nuts,btohqsg
and some people pretend to be,btohqsg
the average yijc student has 0 braincellls,btohqsg
was trying to hint Stupid Idiot Units,btohqsg
the median salary in SG is $5.17kDon't be averageBe below average 😂,btohqsg
i got U for my GP test because i thought it was bio,btohqsg
though... median and average are 2 different things,btohqsg
that's a lot! i only earn $10 per month (pocket money),btohqsg
be below average so that girls think you're ugly and they won't date you. you can focus on your studies and improve from 0 rp to 30rp in your a levels!,btohqsg
