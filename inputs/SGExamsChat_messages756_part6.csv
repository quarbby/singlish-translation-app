“no  u need to spend more time studying. did i tell u all about how i spend 11 hours a day studying? realistic of course we dont want to burn out do we”,btohqsg
Looks like the same comments my TA gives for essays,btohqsg
if u have nothing to nitpick,btohqsg
literally every comment here is just,btohqsg
just ignore him la.anyone who spends that much time on sgexam discord is not someoen you should be listening to seriously,btohqsg
"like at least when i mark i directly re-write their work and not just say ""good""",btohqsg
cuz it was too on the spot,btohqsg
I keep thinking ldc is lious dreyfus,btohqsg
cuz now cambridge go put in their markers report,btohqsg
something along the lines of how stronger responses show differences in contexts across DCs or LDCs,btohqsg
so bo pian need write like that liao,btohqsg
ok wait i skimmed through this,btohqsg
whatever in green is written by me,btohqsg
GP also wanna talk abt DC Vs ldc,btohqsg
He sent u batshit stuff too?,btohqsg
whatever in black is the original essay,btohqsg
he sent me stuff about him self h*rming in dms,btohqsg
I heard now gp 8 qns,btohqsg

@randkmdkddo you think arts stream students have advantage over sci stream for gp,btohqsg
I am a science stream student,btohqsg
Wait you took pcmg or smth right,btohqsg
Geog got alot of gp content,btohqsg
I feel that arts students tend to generally produce like okay-ish work ig cuz they alr write alotbut i feel that alot of arts students do alot of overnarration and underanalysis,btohqsg
like they love telling me shit thats happening in the world,btohqsg
but they dont check their own biases or assumptions when they write,btohqsg
Gp I tot just memorise ks bull and kaleidoscope,btohqsg
Idk I think I'm gonna fail gp,btohqsg
Problem is if U write GP essay like how U write geog U r fucked,btohqsg
actl ik how he looks like,btohqsg
Content geog does help tho icl,btohqsg
but idw dox ppl so yeah,btohqsg
What sort of sample paragraph is this,btohqsg
If u wan a picture dm me lol,btohqsg
"""Is conflict inevitable in today's volatile world""Cites Pedra Branca",btohqsg
I wrote that for like territorial claims,btohqsg
didnt know we still living in the 1980s,btohqsg
So the example too old la,btohqsg
and the writing also is kinda bad,btohqsg
we have International Organisations = confirm got peace because they are a neutral third party,btohqsg
If I memorise ks bull and got A means my compre alot better? Essay prolly shit,btohqsg
but what is so significant abt a neutral third party when it comes to international mediation?,btohqsg
this one i close one eye cuz if i do this is considered negative marking liao,btohqsg
theres also very little engagement with the condition in the first place - that the world is volatile,btohqsg
why cant we be like uk and just do  3 alvls,btohqsg
I generally dont think GP is a hard subject,btohqsg
Is just that students rely way too much on memory for GP,btohqsg
Geog also no neg marking hor,btohqsg
like cambridge has given 30/30 before for content,btohqsg
