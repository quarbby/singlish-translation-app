hollywold always felt so iffy fake to me,btohqsg
as an entertainment circle reference for US,btohqsg
I'm also confused as to why,btohqsg
Singapore lack cultural relevance IN THE PERFORMING ARTS = we are in the lost decade,btohqsg
Well no shit we were never culturally important in the first place lol,btohqsg
U can't be becoming significantly increasingly irrelevant if you were alr irrelevant in the first place,btohqsg
Does that matter tbh? I believe most first world Europe countries artists are the same.,btohqsg
"I'm just trying to understand the line of argument hereClaim: We are in lost decadeReason: Singapore is not culturally superior compared to our neighbour'sCounterreason: that was never singapores strength in the first place ie singapore's relevance never came from our performing arts it was more of just a ""it was there"" kinda thing so using that as a metric is kinda flawed",btohqsg
this term lose decade  as in Singapore is financially/economically stagnant?,btohqsg
"Like this whole discussion is basically just an overdramatic way of saying because singapore is not perfect anymore therefore we are in the stage of ""lost decade/we no longer have a place on earth""",btohqsg
sounds like a General Paper  open topic discussion kind of thing.,btohqsg
"TLDR:Late 90s - early 2000s1) Crimes and Pessimism for the future was rife2) Pockets of social decay started to become prevalent3) Tons of subcultures and trends created felt like it was a  coping mechanism to weather the problems of the decade4) Modern day's japan rates of suicides  extreme political views and trend of single adults are mostfly formed by the teenagers that lived through this ""lost decade""",btohqsg
1) the way people on r/Singapore talk these days...2) Not as pronounced yet3) Unsure about this yet.4) We've hit 2 of these 3. The only one we haven't is the suicide rate.,btohqsg
Our core strengths are also weakening  and with nothing in the pipeline to replace them. Even Japan had ACG to eventually become their new core strength.,btohqsg
except 4) is not referencing teenagers in this decade  but the decades from the 90s to 00s..so If i were to use that rhythm..i could say that our lost decade was also the 90s-00s,btohqsg
feels more like overseas artists come over to singapore to become a singapore citizens or PR (permanent resident)  only because of the strong currency and better international ties with most other nations like where they were born or originated from  as a comparisonthat  ORlocal artists head for overseas opportunities see (Source Link: Jasmine Sokko who was known to be one of the opening acts of Coldplay's 2024 SG Concert )  i got to know her through for her participation in one of a China Music Talent Reality Show called Rave Now ‹ 即刻电音 ›Which was also where famous music artist and record producerAlan Walker( first time seeing his face without a mask since he used to be pretty iconic for being part of the trendy masked artists kind ) where he starred as a guest mentor appearance for the same show and Jasmine Sokko who was the ONLY singaporean contestant who was placed in the FOURTH top ranking placement in this type of variety show competition,btohqsg
problem was Seng Yu Rui commenting about comparisons that Singapore was certainly never strong at,btohqsg
and looking at the multitude of factors  its very more likely we alr had the lost decade  that was the 90s-00s,btohqsg
"prob his ver of ""strong"" is different from us",btohqsg
iirc she hit a europe music tour but not for full blown concerts,btohqsg
I'm curious as to what the 2 if the 3 u are talking abt,btohqsg
And how it is smth that has been happening RECENTLY,btohqsg
the lost is 00s - 10s,btohqsg
but singlehood itself is not a singapore only phenomenon,btohqsg
extremism? our extremist here aint even adults  they are teenagers and if they are..they dont even come from sg,btohqsg
u cant say that singapore is going through a lost decade when ALMOST the ENTIRE WORLD is going through the same problem,btohqsg
middle child as in stuck between the transitional phases of different eras across the decades..millennial > gen z > gen alpha with the extreme of technological advancements,btohqsg
this isn't just a singapore trend,btohqsg
and doesn't add to a lost decade feature,btohqsg
like the credibility of the source a side which isnt reflective of the entire SG populace,btohqsg
classic   would have been better if it was r/SingaporeRaw,btohqsg
the world in general is becoming less or less pessimistic,btohqsg
"""The way people on r/Singapore talk these days""",btohqsg
The core reason Japan had their lost decade was the loss of their core strengths in tech. Our equivalent loss of our core strength is happening right now,btohqsg
how do you know that's from reddit,btohqsg
and what is our core strength,btohqsg
the ui/ux doesn't even look like light mode reddit,btohqsg
theres pessimisim rn based on what he sees on reddit,btohqsg
people forget the lives of others in the decade they never lived,btohqsg
then they make assumptions thinking they lived a better/worst life than the current,btohqsg
retroactively apply standards in different time periods,btohqsg
then say this and that is happening,btohqsg
LOOOL people who live in sg for years ( pr  sg citizens and long term repeat visitors ) don't even know what the components of the national flag representsthe red + white colours respectivelythe moon + 5 star values,btohqsg
middle child is always considered the left-out children,btohqsg
idk i feel like seng keeps throwing the,btohqsg
but he hasnt exactly said what it is yet,btohqsg
u can ask anyone they can tell u a different thing,btohqsg
i don't understand why you keep comparing stuff with japan,btohqsg
are you some loyal japan fan?,btohqsg
The fact that both the West and the East trust us. The West is slowly losing trust in us,btohqsg
