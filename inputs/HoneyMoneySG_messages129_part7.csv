It is  but unwise to do so because the amount that is going to be earmark/stuck inside has very negligible base interest earnings. Imo  since its going to be earmark/stuck  why bother to utilise a low earnings account type? Better to go with uob one or stash acct  easily >3%,btohqsg
Oh yes I am planning to go for uob one account but I am thinking should I be opening an uob one account and putting 150k in or how do I calculate the amount.,btohqsg
Hi experts who uses endowus  currency is in HKD?,btohqsg
Just open and put money in  register for nation saver too.,btohqsg
Oh. That is interesting‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll want to call CS to check myself. I‚Äôm not sure if this makes sense if they can approve and give me a card that I did not consent or even signed up for. Doesn‚Äôt sound entirely right to me,btohqsg
There's no HKD for SG accounts.,btohqsg
How long does it take to get the sms response for 1% giro,btohqsg
Hmm... I am prompted to top up in HKD,btohqsg
Anytime after you fulfil the requirements. Can be same day  can be following week  can be 3 weeks later.,btohqsg
I know the reason. Created an account in hkd üò≠,btohqsg
Hi all  1 question for 2k transfer to hsbc EGA. Can I use DBS same name user  use sala giro to hsbc to unlock the 1%?,btohqsg
Since Amaze + UOB krisflyer cannot be used  what should I use for large overseas spending? Trust  Youtrip?,btohqsg
Trust for me. the exchange rates are pretty close with Youtrip and I don't have to worry about loading the card. Another youtrip like solution (more convoluted though) is ichange  if you are lucky to get your stuff processed (notoriously slow),btohqsg
Just fast transfer 2k in can already. Not need put salary,btohqsg
Do you think is good to pair Amazon and Citi Premier Miles to get 1.2 Miles?,btohqsg
you mean for foreign spend? why not?,btohqsg
Amaze + Citi will make it to local spending instead of foreign. So it will be 1.2 miles instead of 2,btohqsg
Probably  is too low and not worth,btohqsg
True but I think there is some calculation of fcy spread Vs mile value or something,btohqsg
Userkchas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:do not pm others with your referral code unnecessarily. This is the last warning.,btohqsg
lemme do the math. Take 1k equivalent sgd spend.naked citi: 32.5 sgd charge. 2271 miles earned (2.2mpd from 12 sep 24) => 1.43 cpmciti + amaze: 20 sgd charge. 1224 miles earned (1.2mpd) => 1.63 cpmdisclaimer: didnt take into mastercard fee but the results wont be much different.,btohqsg
your disclaimer holds if you are only fighting among cards that have the same 0.8% visa/master/amex feeyou need to really break down into all the raw components if you want to fight against Cash or Youtrip  or Ichange for example.,btohqsg
I don't agree. Early Aug I went to US  the average Amaze rate is 0.7376 vs Trust rate 0.7515 for each SGD.,btohqsg
amaze+card has about 2% markup over Amaze wallet,btohqsg
Yeap.Any advantage to use Amaze wallet vs Youtrip (wallet) or Trust (credit card)?Guess most use Amaze + card for miles?,btohqsg
Wow. And it‚Äôs still better exchange rate than Trust?I wonder if the new Trust Cashback card has a different exchange rate compared to the old Trust link card.,btohqsg
so Trust is better? yea  I have found that to be case in most places compared to Amaze. I was comparing with Youtrip,btohqsg
I have been using trust heavily for overseas spend ..their rates are superb,btohqsg
wait I am confused now. 1 SGD giving you 0.7376 USD is worse than giving you 0.7515 USD right? üòê,btohqsg
amaze wallet has good rates and instapoints. But Trust cashback card is better now with the 1%,btohqsg
EGA is super confusing ..except their 1% Giro cash back,btohqsg
yes but get rewards on card linked to amaze,btohqsg
yea that is for the miles people for sure. especially with Citi rewards from what I understand,btohqsg
cashback also can  e.g  can get 8% on maybank family and friends if use for eligible mcc,btohqsg
Oh ya. U are correct. That means he was paying more when using his Amaze.,btohqsg
Has anyone here checked if the new Trust Cashback card has exchange rates as good as the old Trust link card?,btohqsg
the FX rates info for the cashback on their website leads to the same place as the old card,btohqsg
Yeah. I saw this. Just asking if really using the card is the same,btohqsg
But how you know you already qualify Everyday+ Rewards Programme,btohqsg
Nope  Amaze currency rate will be more than Trust  but less than bank.,btohqsg
In my survey  Trust on par with Youtrip.Amaze with mark up but you get mile points,btohqsg
I just fast transfer 5 time to my other bank and deposit 2000 to account . How long I will get the message ?,btohqsg
Yes  you are right.So with Amaze you need to pay more when settlement (in SGD),btohqsg
Hello! Was wondering if there's any card that can award 4mpd for a retail contactless transaction at Janpaul (ring company)  am considering these options:UOB preferred platinum visaUOB Lady's cardThank you!,btohqsg
about 3-5 days  but sometimes may not get sms  dun need sms to get the 1%,btohqsg
uob preferred platinum visa for mobile contactless  4mpd for max 1.11k,btohqsg
Thanks! I saw that UOB also holds a minimum of $15k uni$ in your account  is there any other bank that doesn't have this restriction?,btohqsg
There will always be examples where payment method A win or payment method B win.Most important is majority of the time which one wins. And ideally before a big transaction u do the same check again before u do the transaction.Days where there had been a big fx spike up or down. Or weekends. Are usually when such instances occur.,btohqsg
Is this group used for advertising?,btohqsg
Only if u sign up for auto transfer. Don‚Äôt.,btohqsg
