The issue now because of waiting times on new cars is that you will get a faster delivery if you sign up with the in-house financing at the AD,btohqsg
Like BMW financial services  etc. Etc.,btohqsg
Because obviously they have more to gain,btohqsg
Is there still waiting time? There should be plenty of stock now,btohqsg
Ready stock you must really compromise on paint  spec  etc.,btohqsg
Wah I would want to buy a brand new car just so I can pick and choose,btohqsg

Speaking of options  u could technically save some interest fees if u pick a low spec car with max loan  then use the extra cash to retrofit,btohqsg
Definitely save some  but idk how much haha,btohqsg
Depends on what the car is and the options though,btohqsg
or  just PI the car. AD tend to take in more premium when u option more,btohqsg
Car loans are so much cheaper leh lol,btohqsg
