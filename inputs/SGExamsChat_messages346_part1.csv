"""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate  our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light  not our darkness that most frightens us. You playing small does not serve the world. There was nothing enlightened about shrinking  so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us  it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine  we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear  our presence automatically liberates others.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO9070EWdS4",btohqsg
should I just send the whole message,btohqsg
"""..always reject fear. Instead  clothe yourself in faith and confidence. If you do that and embrace the ""light"" in you  you will find that you will handle problems and issues that emerge in each paper in a way that utilises the best of what you know when you go into your exam zone of mind with good vibes and a positive heart.Yet  this necessarily begins with a focus instead on what you actually know and have. Accept that nobody can be 100 percent ready for anything. So it is important that you remind yourself that you have done your best to do what you can  given your circumstances. That you actually know more than what you care to give yourself credit for. More importantly  that you have learned and grown in the last two years in ways you haven't even quite fully comprehended. This is true of life more broadly  and not just with taking a major examination.So  go *rock* the examinations and have fun --- yes  actually enjoy the challenges of resolving problems! Treat it as *a celebration of your growth* and the knowledge and wisdom you've acquired in the last two years. I was telling some of you to treat these upcoming series of examinations like a rock star on a multi-stage world tour and to enjoy and have fun at each stop along the way.Because if you don't  you will just be mostly hiding your own ""light"". The ""light"" that the student talks about in the video clip is our individual potential  virtues and strengths. In a sense  It is our hopes and our dreams that we fear the most  because we want them so much that we fear that we may never ""get there"". Sometimes it's too difficult; but mostly  it's just that we are unsure of ourselves and therefore deeply insecure. And so  we respond in a variety of ways that may not always be too constructive and instead veer us both farther and further away..Don't let your fear hide your light. You've worked too hard and hustled too much. Be bold and take your place in the arena. It's your time to shine -- and lift everybody around you as well. ""-wise words from my teacher",btohqsg
