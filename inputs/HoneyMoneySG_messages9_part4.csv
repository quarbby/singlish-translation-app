I think the message here would be: If you want to lead a different life from the masses  you need to do different things and different mindset from the masses. Otherwise  you will just be an average individual,btohqsg
Can't seem to access the podcast... Need to register an a/c with mewatch or sth?,btohqsg
Actually  re: this topic I've been wondering about switching from 2-4% withdrawal into savings depletion and what a good age for that would be. 75?,btohqsg
Plenty of such comments in the CNA article...,btohqsg
Don't worry about it  come into public must be resistant to such stuff already,btohqsg
Retirement may not equate to zero income eh,btohqsg
You have to do up your own calculations and forecast from there,btohqsg
Growing a thick skin is part n parcel of a YouTuber...,btohqsg
have your brought or r u planning to buy a house? that 1 mil enough to cover housing?,btohqsg
BTO building now. not including own stay property as net worth. Enough to cover,btohqsg
nice that u can FIRE at 35. think i can only do it at 45.,btohqsg
after going through your video  it seems that you have alot of hidden cash not shown out.,btohqsg
That's the plan  still work-in-progress. Also FIRE is not a competition. As long as you have lived a fulfilling life  that's more important,btohqsg
is your bulk of investment in stocks? Because your robo advisor holdings is only a few thousands.,btohqsg
Anyway  I'll make a reaction video to questions/comments after I have listened to the podcast. Still on vacation now,btohqsg

Hi all.I am looking to pay my rental (>$3000/m) with CitiPayAll  first time Citi user.Am i able to use Citi Reward (4mpd  cap at $1000) and pay the rest from Citi PremierMiles (1.2mpd  no cap)?,btohqsg
the 4mpd cards usually very specific on the type of spends... i don't think rental will qualify for 4mpd at all imo,btohqsg
Can't play it before lunch.. now can liao...thksüëç,btohqsg
0.4 mpd if you use Citi Rewards,btohqsg
üê∂ A very simple theory: you just can't earn worthy miles from Citi using Citi's own service,btohqsg
If it is within your means you can time the payment during promotions period to get 2.5mpd. Meaning to say that‚Äôs 3 months pay for full year. It abit far stretched but I did that to pay insurance and utilities phone bills together  for 1 year.,btohqsg
Haters will be haters don‚Äôt bother . Good job!,btohqsg

We need to pay 0.8 cents per mile right? Means pay 0.8*2.5 per dollar spent?,btohqsg

Will SSB rates continue to rise until end of year?,btohqsg
Fed increase rate will not help SSB rates to go higher?,btohqsg
Dunno peaked or not  but yea next month jssue very likely to be 2.9% or less. Unless something major and unexpected happens in the coming week.,btohqsg
