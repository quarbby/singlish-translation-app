Pls continue sending more old Singapore pics here,btohqsg
I can send those I find online too but honestly besides you I’m not sure who else is interested LOL,btohqsg
Most ppl here probably couldn’t be bothered about it historical architecture/old buildings in Singapore,btohqsg
HAHA..i ocassionally just send generic pics once in a while of sg in the past..whether its recent history like 2010s or older in times of the 1970s,btohqsg
Ah I see  keep them coming.It feels like another wave of redevelopment is hitting Raffles Place. Back in the 60s-70s quite a few colonial era buildings were being demolished to make way for new office buildings there  and now several of those old office buildings were torn down to be redeveloped again from the 2000s onwards. Long ago there was shell house  which was demolished in the late 80s. NowOcean building  straits trading building and Clifford centre are now gone. The arcade might also be demolished as well,btohqsg
i used to have a folder of them,btohqsg
i got rid of that folder for a few yrs alr,btohqsg
1977 before the arcade was built (so the old colonial building was yet to be demolished). But Clifford centre (shown in pic) was alr completed then  can also see shell house,btohqsg

And also it is also these exams that give students proper gauge on their learning gaps and where they stand,btohqsg
