Looking back on the voluntary quarterly updates  Moya half year results is expected to be profitable and will be out by 14th Aug 21 or earlier. IMO  this might be the catalyst to aid the break out of APEX.#upwardbias#bigbreakoutVested. But please DYODD.,btohqsg

Why the LOI from Indonesia's OY! no follow-up newsï¼ŸðŸ™„,btohqsg
Buy MC must be really patient because any time very hot  very wet then suddenly it can go very dry like some pussycat. So must be able to hold. No contra hor!!,btohqsg

Very simple. That indo company is accumulating... this piece of news is easily market moving and they know it. Logically  they will earn by pushing it Up rather than short. Why? Because the share price has been going down for 3 weeks. Not much meat. Once they accumulated enough. They will do another round of say LOI is still on  trust in MC  Blar blar to push up the price again,btohqsg
Must see market condition. Previously I bought a bit already. Now I am more confident because I see what happens to OIO  Frenken  Nano,btohqsg
This kind of news i seen plenty in Sgx. Itâ€™s the easiest to push up as they are not held to any contract confirmation. They also playing market one.,btohqsg
Walau why say goldilock like heng pat? Very diff...he more like malay mangoðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Goldilock...tmr can show ur 100k-200k buy ? Nv see before play so big one  very sua gu...lol,btohqsg
One example? Noble group. Those who have been around actively in2015-2018will know what is the hottest counter. This counter have been playing up the price with potential investors. Eg CIC  Sinochem  and yes Goldilocks. One news out  easily move up one white long candle in one straight line. Burning all shorts. When was such news released? When price been trending down snd down for some time and suddenly  one good news n  price shoot up,btohqsg
Not say MC is like Noble. I think this MC is going to be the next big thing in Fintech world. The next ifast.What I am trying to say is that news of potential investors taking a stake is one of the easiest way a stock can move up. And if such news happen before  it can happen again.Moreover  past history shows that any time MC release news  the price tend to react positively,btohqsg
And it can come any time,btohqsg
Trade donâ€™t rely on news. Trade must see chart. All the best to all traders. May everyone huat,btohqsg

Pika World Daily Update: 27 July 2021Tesla: The Bulls Win  for now Its big day and the result release were promising  with many indicators pointing to the positive end of the companyâ€™s expansion plan. However  the stock price was relatively flat after-hours.Letâ€™s get into the details.Record Operating ProfitConsistent with our previous update  Tesla has reported a quality record operating profit and good bottom-line profits for the second quarter. Despite a global semiconductor shortage that had restricted EV production  not just for Tesla for other companies such as GM.The earnings were $1.45 per share  well ahead of the estimate of $0.94 per share. In addition  sales rose to $12 billion  breaking expectations of $11.5 billion.An operating profit of $1.3 billion exceeds our expectation of $1 billion  at least in our prior discussion. It marks the first time Tesla hit more than the billion marks  setting a record level and much higher by about $500 million than what analysts had expected.Stock Price in ReviewSince the company announced its first-quarter result on 27 April  the stock price is down by about 6%. In comparison  the Nasdaq had risen about 5% over the same period. On a Year to Date basis  Tesla is down by around 7%  looking pale compared to a gain in the S&P 500 of about 17% and Dow Jonesâ€™s 15% gain.The after-hour gain appears to lack in momentum as investors are still internalizing how the semiconductor constraints can still hit Teslaâ€™s production prospect.Nonetheless  the latest earning result could provide firmer support for the stock price.Strong EV Car SalesThe earning results were music to the bulls. First  most of the operating profits were derived from Teslaâ€™s car business and on a lower proportion by its regulatory credits. To put into perspective  credit sales account for $354 million  which is a drop from $518 million in the 1Q2021 result.Essentially  Telsa could earn from selling credits by producing more than its fair share of zero-emission cars. The bulls and bears have been fighting for the longest time on how such credit sales can last  and this set of results hand the bulls a strong case for their sentiments.The better-than-expected earnings result coupled with lower credit sales signals a robust underlying car business as Tesla moves towards a more structural and mature operational capability in scaling up its production globally.Robust Margins and CashflowThis can be seen in its automotive gross margins that exclude any credits at 25.8%. The profitability is sound. Cash flow is healthy with $619 million registered  up from the $293 million in the first quarter. It marks the 5th consecutive quarter that Tesla achieved a positive free cash flow.A slight impairment of $23 million accounts for Bitcoin loss compared to a gain of $101 million. Their Bitcoin holdings stood at $1.33 billion at the end of the first quarter  and investors will have to wait for the subsequent quarterly regulatory filing to observe any changes in Teslaâ€™s bitcoin holdings.Overall  it is a splendid day for Tesla!It is 27 July  Tuesday  7.36 am in Singapore and 7.36 pm in New York. It was a great trading day  and we hope all Pika World friends have a fruitful day ahead.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg

Updates on Golden Energy  strong uptrend and price hovering above the trend line.- MACD about to cross and have turned upNote: Follow the trend  but if price close below line and without quick reversal  itâ€™s cut time.If players want game  they will paint the chart nicely. So far it has been painted really well.,btohqsg
IX BioPharma- Rights over subscribed (excessed)- they look to be setting up their international Distribution channel with recent announcements all about this(Expect to reap rewards/ results later on)Note: This counter not easy to play. Although there have been some rounds of accumulation  itâ€™s better to wait til overall medical sentiments is good and after stronger volume comes into play before considering as we can expect more news catalyst coming within the year,btohqsg
But good to manage expectations yea because recently many played this . Heavy boat not easy to sail so fast.Expect The other route instead so if really wave 3  itâ€™s bonus,btohqsg
Power to the moon today ?,btohqsg
