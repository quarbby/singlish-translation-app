tourism- mass or niche tourism- short haul or long haultypes of tourism- film induced- dark tourism- mice facilitiese.g raffles hospitals ( medical )uss ( themeparks- scenic beauty- honeypot tourismreason of growth of tourism- leisure time > more balance on work and leisure time > more time to pursue activities to travel. e.g in 2004  sg gov introduce 5 days a week instd of 6 days a week- changing lifestyle. people have more disposable income which means more purchasing power and ability to travel overseas without having much financial issues unlike the past- ease of info. easy to search places or info on the internet and book theu the internet. e.g trivago-attractions. it attracts tourists to invest in the country. e.g paris- infrastructure and services. gov build transport to ease convenience of tourists which will also benefit tourists. e.g sg changi airport t4 was built to accommodate the huge capacity of travellersreasons for fluctuations of tourism- diseases- civil war / political wat- natural disaster- economy recessions,btohqsg
impacts of tourism ( negative )- vandalism  littering- ppl treating locals w disrespect as they paid huge amt of entry fees.- increased crime rates- fusion of culture btwn locals and tourists,btohqsg
impacts of tourism ( positive )- continue to persevere local custom and traditions- increase country economy and financial,btohqsg

Is it possible to skip grades in Singapore,btohqsg
Like enter poly at 15 ex,btohqsg
I met this girl earlier this week,btohqsg
Who said she was in poly y3 at 17,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know if she was jokin or bullshitting or something,btohqsg
But she said it with a very serious face so,btohqsg
u either have to be 18 or 19 to be in y3,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs a lie that I‚Äôve never heard before,btohqsg
And she said it with such a dead serious face,btohqsg
So I thought she was being for real,btohqsg
Genuinely never heard of something like this before,btohqsg
its actually funny how a y3 girl at 17 is being serious about her lie,btohqsg
My friend dropped out of poly to go army first then attend a private Uni,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs possible that she like skipped 2 years in primary school?,btohqsg
that you can literally get a promo,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong the gifted years programmes used to allow pri school kids to skip 1 yr,btohqsg
like if u all subj 100%,btohqsg
Most school won‚Äôt allow students to skip grades because  if a student does well it reflects nicely about the school‚Ä¶So most of the times  if a student does skip grades..they are exceptionally smart,btohqsg
ok just searched it up it's not ture,btohqsg
To the point that parents of other students may complain,btohqsg
all schools don't allow you to skip levels,btohqsg
so it is definitely not possible to be a y3 student at 17,btohqsg
how about being a foriegn student,btohqsg
This person need to buy 4D,btohqsg
That 1 I think is u held back usu tho,btohqsg

Lmao  they finally tested that topic,btohqsg
I might as well die nothing feels right,btohqsg
even then i still not very confident for SEQ,btohqsg
I never even learnt about end of cmc in sec school,btohqsg
i didn't complete my third point but sbq ok for me,btohqsg
I freaking started studying for history since June holidays and this is what I get,btohqsg

No point living my fucking A1 gone and my whole L1R5 screwed,btohqsg

150k men in army and 66 mil british pounds in reparations,btohqsg
6.6 billion pounds and 100k men,btohqsg
but idt its that much of a deal,btohqsg
as long as u state the reparations,btohqsg
how many marks will they deduct,btohqsg
I need to get less than 20 marks in order to enter jc but I feel that I can‚Äôt even get 20 marks now,btohqsg
the number isnt important but rather the statement,btohqsg

But I don‚Äôt think I can make it,btohqsg
don't be too hard on urself,btohqsg
as long as u did ur best,btohqsg

But the jump I heard rly is bas,btohqsg
My sis said alot of her chers all discourage S5 straight up,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why sec 5 is being stopped soon,btohqsg
The discouragement don‚Äôt even stop once you enter sec 5  it legit continues till mid years,btohqsg
My form teacher constantly reminded my class‚Ä¶‚Äùdon‚Äôt waste time here‚Äù  ‚Äúyou come sec 5  you better do well‚Äù,btohqsg
Basically if let's say u failed English the sch give u a place,btohqsg

This is also real  The Us Debt has rise 2 Trillion in 5 months,btohqsg
In comparison from2016-2021  they grew their debt by 10 Trillion,btohqsg
If the trajectory continues they could reach 50 Trillion before 2030,btohqsg
& they will just keep printing usd,btohqsg
The govt is headed for another gov shutdown at the end of November,btohqsg

I want to but cmi xd,btohqsg
Jokes aside hope u get it tho,btohqsg
if i may ask  even though you don't take ur  what exactly do you do for Econs?,btohqsg
There's like 2 parts macro and microMicro is basically focused on specific markets like example the fish market like how is the price decided on etc  how companies make decisions to earn money (for h2 only),btohqsg
Macro I haven't learn yet but it's basically abt country's economy,btohqsg
i think that's common across all subjects,btohqsg
But ya u will see graphs,btohqsg
I would call it the most sciencey,btohqsg
Ok la but for A lvl econs,btohqsg
When u draw graph is usu just the shape,btohqsg
Oh then for exam for H2,btohqsg
The Us is really a prime example of what happens when politicians are corrupted,btohqsg
I consider this a pro for H2 btw if you can1. Memorise the content2. Know what to write what not to write,btohqsg
Alot of ppl will struggle w econs tho cuz right they tend to be damn cheebai abt keywords,btohqsg
So like even if u understand if u don't use the keywords,btohqsg
just like yesterday  my friend asked his classmate to help jio him to a club to meet some girls...8-10 ppl i think? He was asked to pay $60,btohqsg
