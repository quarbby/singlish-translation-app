Mental instability they don't see courage. They just tot is normal,btohqsg
I see as the person need go imh for evaluation,btohqsg
If proven not in right state of mind. 10 years..,btohqsg
Hais this is the sad thing mostly is mentally unstable then they get light sentence,btohqsg
Like the the person who attack did not get heavy punishment  but I believe is fair  penalty set by the judge,btohqsg
Like the longer years in jail,btohqsg
Technically he doesnt deserve the heavy sentence cause nobody wants to be mentally ill,btohqsg
Ahh yes attempt murder. I see the slit throat action,btohqsg
Police always try to charge highest possible charge until proven,btohqsg
Dunno is the lady words sparks the guy minds to do  or the guy just had it too much then start the attempt murder,btohqsg
