Hi Pls take note.  LLm already been abused by scammers including drug Traffickers a few years back.  Those say like pay u extra but in cash one   beware.,btohqsg
If not then just cancel and waste everyone‚Äôs time,btohqsg
Not just that. Those selling e cigarettes also using LLM to send over their products. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
So long no one chat with her?,btohqsg
2men plus a car plus 30mins.  $18. Is this Bangladesh,btohqsg
Well to solve the case if it‚Äôs simple even brainless can do it they willOr else if the case is consider major they mayBut this right they didn‚Äôt even bother wanting to take the QR code provided to at least stop or trace further on so easy and simple suk it up Lor if not you need to spend you utmost quality time to just chase and chase,btohqsg
Look out for this person  taking advantage of ‚Äúcar / van system‚Äù . Put car but flower arrangement can only fit in Van   lalamove cs also useless   say ‚Äú should be able to fit in car  you settle yourself I‚Äôm ending the chat now‚Äù.  Tired of lalamove alr,btohqsg
How to fit in car? Unless I really stupid dk how,btohqsg
Ask customer to cancel order or top up the difference from car to van,btohqsg
Take photo show lalamove staff in ubi office  CS useless,btohqsg
Die die dw top up. üò≠ end up just take cause need money lol,btohqsg
Don't do that  customer know you lanlan next time he do again,btohqsg
I only take car job when I heading to that location or going home otherwise not worth it,btohqsg
Im so sad‚Ä¶ offered to go his house and collect cash and help buy for him but he cancelled.. üòû,btohqsg
I want to help people buy thing but more helpful drivers out there üòÖ,btohqsg
Ya la  its because of people like that customer know you LL..so they will keep doing this,btohqsg
Then they Are Part Of Syndicate tooüòÇ,btohqsg
if u know how to report is better to make llm price like is not helping all delivery drivers platform at all now most drivers take order due to no choice.,btohqsg
Rules are rules cannot fetch passengers without PDVL means cannot lol. Eventually LLm kena one,btohqsg
Non Pdvl can legally take 2 rides a day  that's what grab hitch is based on. Also it's not the llm platform that is breaking the law  it's the driver doing the hitch.,btohqsg
all got no choice llm driver like become slaves ready to customer.customer paying everything they can do but go no choice just ok open pants and swat have to if being ordered by them.,btohqsg
LLm is allowing customers to abuse the platform  LLm will surely get involved. Actually LLm Drivers with cars aren't allowed to fetch passengers. Even for van it's at own risk,btohqsg
"So u one of the drivers customer say anything u also go fetch and do for them? Never follow LLm guidelines? What do u mean no choice.  Or u an abusive customer trying make drivers"" no choice ""lol. U wanna try me as ur driver see how I make an abusive customer no choice?  They will lose loads of their time.....  I don't mind losing mine.  Human pride and dignity don't just worth those 20$.",btohqsg
We all have a choice here   joining lalamove is our choice as well. So there's no such thing as no choice only submissive,btohqsg
Depends how u talk to Cs.  U need give them dimensions of the items.  Don't show pic first.  Your pic showing ur van easily fit in.  So Cs tgt hand in hand cheat ur labour and van rental/instalment.,btohqsg
Thank you! Next time if happen again I will give dimensions,btohqsg
Remember always have measuring tape with you,btohqsg
"Don't take next time.  U are spoiling this customer.   U corner the customer into either1) they gonna follow LLm guidelines N pay .2) waste their time wait for next driver.I normally tell them"" Sry I can't fetch your item till u change to mpv or van job.  Cos once I take the picture LLm knows it is bigger than the dimensions cars are allowed to take.  Or u want to cancel it to wait for next driver to come and take this risk?  "" I am not allowed to not follow the LLm delivery guidelines.  Sry",btohqsg
I even saw an uncle bring weighing machine with him weigh items before in warehouse.  Lol.  Why not man,btohqsg
Thank you! Will try if encounter the next time!,btohqsg
Precisely   abusive customers made the choice to try their luck in lalamove.  Many are banned by abusing ggv. So they keep use LLm.  Peninsula that Viet lady told me ggv banned her. Cos I bird her say her 2cartons so huge why order car   ask her if she go try ggv she need pay more inclusive $15 labour fee.  Then she said kena banned. Lol,btohqsg
Don't so formal leh.  We all victims,btohqsg
Tdy no way go into suntec,btohqsg
Sometimes  job never indicate size of items and when you reach then you know its a few big cartons of heavy weight. How?,btohqsg
You need to call the customer and ask what item  no of item to deliver. The best to send you a photo if he doesn't know how to describe,btohqsg
Call the person before go down to collect.  Don't go believe their bullshits that not heavy or nt huge.  Ask them send pic in the app.  Ask them Wad are the items to be delivered,btohqsg
hi guys  has anyone here taken order from kranji camp before? how long did it take for yall to receive the money?,btohqsg
They should pass you immediately after you pass the item if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
this one heng seweh same like use we swap take order.always see who heng seweh get first if that incase ifcase no choice take or dont take risk once u at there ready u see uself if dislike ask them to cancel job tell them honestly u cannot take the job because u dont like and pls dont take gas money from them u u time waste to come there also.all the best,btohqsg
this is right advisable to call them afraid they scam or book wrongly and if really some cs did sent some photo ready but this funny  photo looks easy come out u go there haha it is not easy same like some girl‚Äôs photo look very pretty real life looks same auntie ,btohqsg
If food order to bungalow than no one pick up how uh,btohqsg
they might listen to u and change to bigger vechicle but the problem is after that end paying u the amount they come and complain u and we driver had to answer and worst still u have to refund then back.,btohqsg
put outside after also they come complain u the food is cold r bird have been attack driver fail to find them and finally worst u have to pay all the amount of the food and u deliveries fees also might be taken.,btohqsg
But Best is Inform Customer and LiveChat in case people Took it they say NEVER Saw.,btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone encountered this before? Cash out failed. üòí,btohqsg
Lol....all u need is evidence.  Inform Cs abt they upgrade to mpv order etc. But if u drives a car  best is make sure u know u are nt treated like a Bangladesh worker before going down. Don't assume the customers can do anything they want.  Cannot have such negative mentality. Screenshot down,btohqsg
Motherswork lor . Those stuffs.  Quite bulky one,btohqsg
Cannot la.  LLm not same grab.  Must have ppl receive,btohqsg
Nobody receive wait.  Tell Cs.  Every 10min u wait they giving u $2 nia,btohqsg
