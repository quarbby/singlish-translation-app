not that there is a hard and fast rule about what marks get what grades but,btohqsg
it sometimes does  i got promoted by the bell curve cuz the whole cohort did jialat for physics,btohqsg
i have never ever heard MI using a bell curve,btohqsg
According to my dad’s prediction that 23m = 4qns  22qns 120m (coz i did not count total marks)  i can afford 63/120,btohqsg
back in my day fail means fail  even if you get 44/100  you can still kenna retained,btohqsg
i came into MI at a wrong time xD,btohqsg
a lot of my friends had to retain because of her,btohqsg
one of my friend kenna kick out of school because of her,btohqsg
LOL i hope hes doing okay,btohqsg
he got 43/100 for his chem  and only passed another h2,btohqsg
If it is 100m —> 52.5/100-23m i just gutterI can afford to lose another 30m,btohqsg
i got 41 for physics and passed 1h2chance given,btohqsg
bell curve here bell curve thr a level bell curve not so easy,btohqsg
Am i lestin / wyatt / siyan,btohqsg
i mean that is better  but she couldve looked the other way for certain close cases but ya,btohqsg
honestly how did the cohort do so badly,btohqsg
Im hungry but my dad takes ages in the toilet,btohqsg
which is to say its not very original and quite routine questions,btohqsg
so u go toilet to search for food,btohqsg
if standard dropping and people cant even solve routine A level exam qns,btohqsg
no principal joined only this year,btohqsg
only mdm khoo is saving our butts,btohqsg
okay la maybe there's more to the story,btohqsg
yala i saw u during institute day,btohqsg
maybe standard quality of teachers dropped too,btohqsg
oh its just my phys yeacher,btohqsg
oh my y4 math cher was called mdm khoo,btohqsg
I did not finish the paper alive,btohqsg
What's your total for cGPA computation,btohqsg
i dont think the MI notes wouldve changed much since i left,btohqsg
so i kinda know how the notes are,btohqsg
i dont suppose they are that bad bah,btohqsg
damn we disagree on opposite ends,btohqsg
i think their gp notes are shit,btohqsg
and i swear its just MI that doesnt appreciate my writing style,btohqsg
they will not use the whole range one,btohqsg
they can give me a U for prelims but i go a levels i get an A  and i did not change a single thing about my writing style,btohqsg
okay ppr 2 is just cancerous all year round tbh,btohqsg
year 1 - 3 i've never done well for ppr 2,btohqsg
ya la gp not part of promo criteria,btohqsg
thats kinda the sad mindset of MI students,btohqsg
but i was in those shoes so understandable,btohqsg
i was last batch before gp implemented into promo criteria,btohqsg
thats asking for retention rate to skyrocket,btohqsg
no but the new criteria is like ESSS,btohqsg
I need to be above 3 to graduate w honours,btohqsg
What is needed to not decrease my cGPA by > 0.18,btohqsg
Waaa errr yeah it will fuck it up for a C and D,btohqsg
Especially if its a 4k mod,btohqsg
I would have retained y2 with the new criteria,btohqsg
