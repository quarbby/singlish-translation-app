Hi dear van drivers and lorry drivers...pls do know that there are additional charges if u carry items up/down the staircase. And if customer book smaller vehicle and u are driving a bigger vehicle pls prompt customer that items needs a bigger vehicle and do not proceed doing the small vehicle order with your big vehicle. If item needs 2 manpower to carry inform customer need 2 person to carry instead of proceeding to do it 1 person. REASON„Äãif u never charge staircase and next time customer order and have staircase when driver inform customer they will be not happy and say why previous driver never charge before and now why driver charge me? If u proceed for order with big vehicle for a small vehicle order and items actually needs bigger vehicle and u proceed to do next time customer book and other driver accept and prompt customer to change bigger size vehicle then they will say why previous driver can fit my items and now driver say cannot? If item/furniture needs 2 person to carry pls prompt customer to add in 1 more helper instead of carrying the item by 1 person if item is bulky and more than 25-40 kg pls prompt customer as said. Because if next time other driver accepts order and say items need 2 manpower to carry and customer will argue why previous driver can carry 1 person and why driver needs 2 person? I am sure we dont want to be cheap labours so as others. Its to make drivers life easier instead of breaking and spraining their back. Thank you very muchüôè,btohqsg
Yes  I always call n ask  if I go there  something not right  I just reject the order n move on.Some is cheapo type.Some is act blur type.Some is on purpose typeBut also haveSome is reasonable n top up the difference.Just do whatever value for money.Don't spoil market  end up all suffer unfairness treatment.,btohqsg
"Btw before proceeding with order always ask photo of items if customer give excuses say u need to submit photos of items before proceeding with the order. After customer send photo of items do confirm ""is there anymore items"" better to play safe then go there waste time and $$ in the end claim 50% only when can do more and other better $$ orders.",btohqsg
