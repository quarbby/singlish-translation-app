Oh u mean the fm selection test,btohqsg
I see  what do you think are possible reasons why some ppl who take f math might find f math easier than math,btohqsg
"tbf fmath is not really ""harder math""",btohqsg
Coz i was stunned by all the proving qns,btohqsg
Maths is harder when there is no context to it i feel,btohqsg
at my level  it was just less careless when it's tougherbut more careless when it's easier,btohqsg
Maths to me is always the same,btohqsg
I think its bc of complacency,btohqsg
The difference between A* and A,btohqsg
To me is i rlly got to learn why im doing this method and this step when im in uni ah,btohqsg
why is valerie just reacting to everything,btohqsg
If I recall  around 97 for J1 F Maths but 93 for C Maths,btohqsg
Like how quadratic equation can be used in almost any algebra equations,btohqsg
But when itâ€™s tougher do you feel that you can still solve it? If yes I suppose tougher questions are better for you,btohqsg
Yeah then doesnâ€™t necessarily mean f math is easier ah,btohqsg
cuz gude asked me for help for gp last yr,btohqsg
and i got lazy to respond,btohqsg
So my gut feeling was right lol,btohqsg
Motto of life: aim to be lazy,btohqsg
I still donâ€™t get this joke,btohqsg
Also was this msg why Gude asked me to send the GP notes,btohqsg
If gude you see this pls tell me whether you rly think itâ€™s better than RI notes lol,btohqsg
There is a unique emphasis on the tangibility  the solidity  the texture  the weight  the graspability of an object. The real being solid was part of a scientific attitude connected with a sense of ownership  we purchase and buy what we so desire and seek the glamour and riches of a lucky few. Everything and anything is buyable akin to a commodity  trading and bargaining in the same way we do for an apple.,btohqsg
ur sch gp notes are actually one of the better ones ive seen,btohqsg
im not sure why the distinction rate is still low,btohqsg
Ya same. But I heard from my brother than actually they do the most value add compared to other schs (like they see the students o level English grades and compare with how they perform for As  AC students were found to have the mostImprovement),btohqsg
Idk where he got the info from but should be from somewhere reliable,btohqsg
In conclusion1. all schools are good schools2. grades are not important3. vote wisely when you can. I just don't know who is wisely.,btohqsg
Like Acjc GP dist rates ranged from between 28-35% the past few years iinw,btohqsg
eh this is not bad ig,btohqsg
Not all are equal at least,btohqsg
Yeah definitely better than the national average,btohqsg
RI 2023 apparantly had a super high distinction rate but it was comparable with their AB rate,btohqsg
never said they are equal. Just all schools are good schools ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I rmbr seeing the 2017 stats from the Reddit post,btohqsg
I actually do have the full list  for the subjects that my school offered. These are for the 2017 batch  the first batch of the new syllabus. Don't ask me how I got it  I just very sneakily and quickly took pictures :) These are National Distinction rates btw.H1 Biology - 23.0% H1 Chemistry - 21.4% H1 CSE - 25.2% H1 Economics - 31.6% H1 ELIT - 32.7% H1 Geography - 27.6% H1 GP - 24.4% H1 History - 25.9% H1 Math - 37.0% H1 Physics - 22.2% H1 Chinese - 24.8% H1 Malay - 26.0% H1 Tamil - 26.5% H1 GSC - 41.2%H2 Art - 50.8% H2 Biology - 46.0% H2 Chemistry - 38.9% H2 Chinese- 31.7% H2 CSE - 18.4% H2 Economics - 42.3% H2 ELIT - 47.7% H2 ELL - 41.1% H2 FMATH - 42.2% H2 Geography - 37.5% H2 History - 44.6% H2 KI - 53.3% H2 Math - 51.2% H2 Malay - 34.8% H2 Music - 44.0% H2 Physics - 41.3% H2 TSD - 38.5%,btohqsg
yeah 24.4 makes sense its arnd 25,btohqsg
reminds me of my RI 2022 batch of students.They told me all of them were in the worst physics grouping. ðŸ˜­Cuz scored the lowest in sch.That's why they came to me,btohqsg
end up 100% of them As and Bs,btohqsg
Hi if I kill babies  why will the number of adults in the future decrease?,btohqsg
Tf I forgot acjc got h2 malay lit,btohqsg
I donâ€™t actually know if ac had that,btohqsg
u dont have to study for GP,btohqsg
GP is literally a 100% skills based subject,btohqsg
I feel like it depends on luck and skills lol,btohqsg
My GP skills are moderate only,btohqsg
he came up with a method,btohqsg
to be able to circumvent like,btohqsg
Then in the end his classes had an 80% distinction rate LOL,btohqsg
I retook just GP for fun and went from C to A.Army language works better.,btohqsg
