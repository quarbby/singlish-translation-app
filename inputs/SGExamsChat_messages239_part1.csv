write until your hand shaking your write feel like dropping off,btohqsg
With 5 mins of planning and an average writing speed of 2.5 seconds per character  the max amt of words is like 1080,btohqsg
And like despite that  ppl can write very nice eh,btohqsg
ya blows your mind doesn't it,btohqsg

Why do you need write 1080 characters,btohqsg
I regularly write shorter than my peers but regularly score higher,btohqsg
You write more means more chance for errors,btohqsg
