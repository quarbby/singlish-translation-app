battle royales only apex and fortnite are valid,btohqsg
and also theyre bearable to play,btohqsg
i dont mind a slower paced game,btohqsg
as long as its not camping half the time,btohqsg
also tactical shooters have needlessly high skill ceilings,btohqsg
every other shooter you can join with zero FPS experience and still have fun/get good,btohqsg
but with tactical shooters you basically need to be great at aiming already,btohqsg
i dont believe a game should require you to have prerequisites,btohqsg
csgo is still acceptable because you dont HAVE to play s&d,btohqsg
but with valorant literally everything is centred around s&d,btohqsg
my plan is to practice mechanics until a big shooter drops so i can speedrun climb,btohqsg
