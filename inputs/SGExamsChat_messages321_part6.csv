i'd rather u get 256 then external SSD,btohqsg
But with the voucher and etc.   more worth.,btohqsg
Tablet standalone is no good for tertiary I think.,btohqsg
256GB in-built SSD  then add on external SSD  which u can plug out and connect to other devices,btohqsg
Computer n tablet now J1 like no use like that,btohqsg
Most tablets don‚Äôt run on full operating system unless you buy Surface and other Windows tab.,btohqsg
This is a good storage option.,btohqsg
id rather she buy 256 internal  then add on this one,btohqsg
hmmm should I buy from sch,btohqsg
and then i use icloud to store,btohqsg
But then again   no choice uh.,btohqsg
idh iPhone though cannot airdrop here and there haha,btohqsg
its a sign for you to change,btohqsg
High Storage was good if there ‚Äòs bootcamp built-in,btohqsg
but not like u use windows got sth like airdrop,btohqsg
But now. I don‚Äôt think it ‚Äòs attractive,btohqsg
i don't have the money to change LOL üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg

Apple Care+ is worth it if you repair your computer at Apple. Like screens etc.,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know where I can find h2 practise papers or even Tys for subs like history and geog,btohqsg
@ifightagainstscamsi've decided on asus zenbook 14 ux425 le! the pricing around 1.4k with 2 years warranty,btohqsg
seen reviews and it seems to be q good,btohqsg
Good choice. It ‚Äòs a value buy. 14in that is lightweight.,btohqsg
yea it's 512gb as wellbattery life up to 15 hours too,btohqsg
I am not sure if the battery will last that long tho but you may charge it with a powerbank so it ‚Äòs good.,btohqsg
the batt hours take with pinch of salt la,btohqsg
cos sometimes your programmes may require heavy batt usage,btohqsg
always bring ur charger just in case,btohqsg
Powerbank with USB C is adequate if you prefer not to bring the charger.,btohqsg
yep! adapter and powerbank(in case no charging port),btohqsg
i got a feel of the laptop at courts and its not too bad,btohqsg
the school not selling this model so most likely getting from courts or asus website,btohqsg
it's not included in asus student discount though but it's ok,btohqsg
An a level study group we have,btohqsg
no ratings though... saw one on lazada got a lot of good reviews,btohqsg

Not sure what ‚Äòs the difference tho.,btohqsg
this is the exact one I saw at courts,btohqsg
