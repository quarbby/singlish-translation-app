Anyone knows the interest checker for UOB. Iâ€™ve spent over >$500 in both my evol and one card (some charges are still pending)   but the interest checker is still not updated yet and itâ€™s almost end month. Does the 500min spend only counts if itâ€™s processed and reflected in the interest checker?,btohqsg
Is your transaction all eligible spend,btohqsg
All is paywave/apple wave. Never used the physical card. Should be eligible?,btohqsg
provided mcc/merchant not excluded. The tracker updates 1 day after transactions are posted. Only eligible transactions posted by 30 Apr count to the $500,btohqsg
All right  will check once itâ€™s updated later since the last update was on 27th. Thank you! Checked the exclusions and my transactions and looks all fine.,btohqsg

You need to also consider a) do u use another miles card currently b) your travel habits are 2 pax or more c) do u foresee using the 4th night perks from your travel.,btohqsg
The app tells you how to do it in their support tab,btohqsg
A) using crmc+ amaze  and UOB solitaires for my miles spendingB) travelling with spouse most of the timeC) doubt itâ€¦ havenâ€™t experienced or see the need of this upside as of yet,btohqsg

No idea yet  no new from hsbc yet,btohqsg
hi  for existing uob customer. Do you open UOB lady account for the extra mpd? is account opening instant or need to wait?,btohqsg
If you have the lady's solitaire card and you know you will spend 2k that month  then it's worth to put in 10k for the extra 2 mpd. Summarised version.,btohqsg
I just chat with UOB CSO  she said we can still participate thisUOB Big Savings Payout Promotionalthough we hv participated the Rising Dragon Promo..Because the additional 50k top up on top of the existing earmarked 100k is  fresh fund.. so we can participate the 50k to get $250,btohqsg
I would trust the t&c more than UOB's CSO but go ahead and try. At most don't get the $250  still can get 4% p.a.,btohqsg
Let me read the t&c again,btohqsg
Hi  if I use my cc to pay for shopback qr in restaurants  can i stack both cashback and cc cashback?,btohqsg
Hey guys...anyone know whats the minimum spend for the citi rewards card?,btohqsg
There is no min spend card to be reward ~You are rewarded 4mpdAnd it rounded down to nearest $,btohqsg
And if i use the card frequently paired with instarem amaze- do i need to pay the annual fee?,btohqsg
To me  I prefer one card not just before of the shopee and grab etc. But I don't need to headache to be particular of what type of transaction you spending in view of the max cap. For one card  if you exceeded 500  you can always go for higher tier. I am much happier with the flexibility after changing from dbs live fresh to one card. One card if you can bear with interest rate qualifying criteria is to make eligible spend of min 500 for 3 months,btohqsg
You have to go higher tier for the whole quarter though. So itâ€™s not really very flexible,btohqsg
Only TCB gives 1.5% rebate for SPC after 7.1% promo as tested  other Amex cards excluded.Input and save Amex card number to Grab directly earns rewards  all top ups excluded.,btohqsg
Yes agree. I also been using the one card but tempted to switch to EVOL as the cash rebates are much higher. I usually just clock 500ish on one card only though. Once i hit 500ish  i use another card to clock.,btohqsg
Hi  guys. I saw there is a dcs logo on some sgqr code  can I ask if I can pay with dcs app from dcs credit card? I would like to apply one dcs card if soðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
