As we are aware  the Fed is laser focus on inflation.☘️A strong labor market has been seen as a hindrance towards inflation moderating. We will have JOLTs on Tuesday and Nonfarm + Unemployment rate on Friday.☘️GDP data on Wednesday will shed light if the the economy is still too hot for general price level in the economy to cool.☘️The Fed's favourite inflation indicator Core PCE Index will be released on Thursday.Have a restful sleep and see you tomorrow!Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg

"S NallakaruppanMr Tharman Shanmugaratnam Vs Mr Tan Kin LianI would like to share my personal experiences with the two Presidential Candidates.A. Mr Tharman ShanmugaratnamMr Tharman is a well-liked person by many Singaporeans and the general consensus is that he would make an Excellent Prime Minister instead of being a largely Ceremonial President . He would also be a Great Statesman as he has the depth & breadth of Ministerial Experiences behind him.However  my personal experience with Mr Tharman was less than desired. I've been in the Stockbroking industry for almost 30 years & way back in January 2015  I had written a letter to Mr Tharman  together with an unprecedented support of more than 1 200 signatures from the industry  to urge the then Deputy Prime Minister & Finance Minister to take urgent corrective measures to revive our moribund Stockmarket which has been languishing for too long a time. We've put-in considerable time & effort to draft this 7 page letter identifying the issues affecting the Singapore Stockmarket and our sincere recommendations to resolve them.We were keenly expecting a response from him & maybe even have a short meeting with him so that he can understand the issues better and undertake urgent corrective actions to rebuild the much-needed confidence in our markets.Sadly  there was no response from him & it was akin to  throwing our considerable time & effort letter to the wastepaper basket. It broke our hearts!Our moribund stockmarket continued to languish & billions of dollars have been wiped-out from our markets due to pretty low valuations. The listed Small & Medium Enterprises are also having a very tough time raising capital from the markets and some of the better ones have been privatised resulting in the hollowing-out of the Singapore Stockmarket.Strangely  even our very own GIC is investing many hundreds of billions all over the world except the Singapore Stockmarket. Our markets have been in the doldrums for too long a time & the Government doesn't seem to take notice on the sorry state of our markets due to a severe lack of liquidity & market confidence. Normally Governments in many parts of the world constantly monitor the state of the markets as it is a good barometer & catalyst for the economy but in Singapore's case it may not seem to be so. Take the case of how China is now actively seeking to revive the fortunes of the Chinese Stockmarket as it affects the wealth of millions of Chinese citizens.So  based on my personal experience  Mr Tharman's Election Tagline ""Respect for All"" doesn't ring a resounding bell for me & many of my colleagues in the industry and several hundreds of thousands of Singaporean investors who have been suffering in silence!B. Mr Tan Kin LianMr Tan Kin Lian has been the General Manager (now renamed as CEO) of NTUC income for many years. I have been a NTUC Income shareholder for more than 30 years. NTUC Income shares were priced at par of $10. When Mr Tan Kin Lian was GM  besides the annual dividends of about 6%  the Board would propose 15% bonus shares every 5 years to take into account the reducing purchasing power of money as the Co-operative shares could only be redeemed at $10 no matter how long the period you hold. Mr Tan Kin Lian was aware that many of the shareholders are retirees who are dependent on the dividend income to maintain their standard of living & so he & his Board made this conscious Bonus Issue policy. However  after he left  this Bonus Share declaration was discontinued.Mr Tan Kin Lian cared for the Mom & Pop investors then and he continued to speak-up for them during the Global Financial Crisis Days in 2008 & he continues to champion the cause on the ever rising cost of living for the middle class  lower middle class and poor Singaporeans.There are 3 reasons why I feel Mr Tan Kin Lian would be a more suitable President for Singapore.",btohqsg
"1. One of the most important criteria for being a President is to be Independent. Mr Tan Kin Lian will probably be much more independent as he does not have any Political Affiliation for a very long time as compared to Mr Tharman who has just left the Establishment only about 2 months ago. Any reasonable person would tell you that it's very difficult to severe ties that were established for over 2 decades! The Government of the day plays the Executive Role whilst the President plays an important Custodial Role. Both these Roles are distinct & seperate and having a truly Independent President is critical.2. Mr Tan Kin Lian has spoken up for the underdogs many times at Hong Lim Park & many other forums. He's frank & sincere and has a heart for fellow Singaporeans.3. Mr Tan Kin Lian is also frugal and he has stated publicly that he takes the Public Transport most of the times. This is an important trait for the President as he can relate to the daily lives of fellow Singaporeans  & would make a Great Goalkeeper for our Hard-earned Reserves as he'll treat it like his own & at the same time have a heart for the less-privileged.Now  come 1st September 2023  Singaporeans have to decide who will be the 9th President of Singapore.We truly need an Independent President & my dear fellow Singaporeans this is your critical moment to seek your ""One Chance For Change"" to make a much better Singapore for one & all and the time is NOW!We shall stay United in multi-racial Singapore & the Progress & Wealth we've amassed thus far should benefit all Singaporeans & not only a select few at the Top!Thank You. Xie Xie. Terimah Kasih.
