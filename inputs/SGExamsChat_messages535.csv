i live next to a landed estate,btohqsg
i know  but im curious whether the hdb's being built is being kept up with demand,btohqsg
or just a bunch of fear mongering by the govt to get people to raise the prices of their units,btohqsg
so this is a valid statement?,btohqsg
just a bunch of fear mongering being thrown around,btohqsg
Personally  some HDB prices seem extreme but a steady increase of prices is valid,btohqsg
the million dollar hdb's you see on the news get to those value because of the furnishings of the unit likely,btohqsg
not tough to see how they can get sold for more than a million,btohqsg

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76647454/proper-way-of-setting-up-oauth2-for-authentication-for-microservicesAnyone got opinions on this ?,btohqsg
is anyone good in html/css here,btohqsg
keep the frontend and authorization logic separate  frontend is responsible for displaying the screen component and just redirecting the user to the external oauth2 page  once you get the authorization code from the redirect uri the backend can then exchange it for a jwt access token (or refresh if you want as well)to explain on how the above works:1) your frontend redirects the user to the oauth2 external authorization url  it has things like client_id (which you should already have) and redirect_uri2) oauth2 provider will redirect them through the redirect_uri  this redirect_uri should be your backend server endpoint3) your backend server endpoint that takes the authorization code and turns it into jwt access token (or and refresh token)you notice that while frontend and backend both interacts with the oauth2 provider  only your backend have a direct server relationship with the oauth2 provider  because the redirect_uri to your server endpoint means the provider is directly calling ur server endpoint and frontend has no business on thisso to answer your questions right (i assume the SO asker is you ah)> Do I need to set up a frontend that exchanges the authorisation token with the oauth2 provider (let's say Google) and then sends that authorisation token to AMS and then let the AMS use the authorisation token and exchange it for access and refresh tokens from the Oauth2 provider ?100% no  as explained above  ur frontend redirect the user to the external oauth2 provider url  the external oauth2 provider directly calls ur backend endpoint  so is just between your AMS <-> oauth2 provider> In this case  does it mean I have to register both microservices (frontend and AMS) with the oauth2 provider so that one can request the code and the other can exchange it?no  only your AMS should be registered  as mentioned  your frontend should only be purely responsible for your screen component  everything else like backend logic is no go> Is it more advisable to bring the frontend's code (React + ChakraUI) for login  and registration to the AMS (python)?same thing as above> Is there an alternative to both or a right way to do it?you can look up PKCE  but it is more relevant for apps like SPA because your tokens are exposed since everything is done on the client side  but generally the method above is standard approach,btohqsg
So youre suggesting only to register AMS w provider so that the ams does the full implicit grant flow. What do i display in the frontend then? Idk if the ques makes sense‚Ä¶Currently exploring PKCE and webauthn hahaah but not too sure how they fit in the ms archi.Code in queshttps://github.com/neilscallywag/MS-TemplateUse the features branch,btohqsg
yes correct  your frontend should be displaying the buttons lor  when users press on it  it should trigger the entire authentication flow  frontend should display the user info (sorry im not sure if i understood ur qn) based on what was provided from the backend after verifying,btohqsg
basically you know how HTTP requests works right,btohqsg
Hmmm actually yeah i think i overthought the issue in my head,btohqsg
anyway in the context of microservice architecture  basically what your AMS is responsible for is generating the JWT access token  its also purely responsible for handling all the oauth2 flow and all the nonsense with the external provider so your other microservice no ned to bother about it  they only need to verify the JWT access token on request and that's it,btohqsg
cause the main concept of microservice is separation of concerns ma,btohqsg
yeah hahaha  after the flow its just standard JWT verification with the server side to display the authenticated info from the API,btohqsg
Yeah‚Ä¶.. actually jn i q confused when reading the tutorial‚Ä¶ had to look at the RFC for oauth2 to und its actually not even for authn its for authz,btohqsg
But thanks a lot man really appreciate the help <3,btohqsg
actually do you really need a microservice architecture though  you just making a webapp right  if its not too big the entire backend can just handle it  anyway you only need a couple of auth endpoint such as where the oauth2 external provider redirect uri will throw to and your standard log in create account (if you have a native auth system instead of just oauth2),btohqsg
I making a template for projects and hackathons‚Ä¶ the usual people i work with spec in diff langs ( ts  golang and py),btohqsg
ur backend is what? nodejs? or python,btohqsg
Thats why wanted to do MS archi to make authn easier to incorporate,btohqsg
if its nodejs u can just throw a firebase SDK on it for ur auth stuff and call it a day,btohqsg
Then jwt verification handled by kong gateway or aws,btohqsg
u making a boilerplate to speedrun hackathon is it,btohqsg
ok ya that makes sense  so an auth boilerplate to handle all the oauth nonsense then just let them build their own backend to just verify the jwt can alr  but yea it depends on waht you need ba  if its oauth2 it's a bit more complicated because you need to handle the interaction with external provider  if its just native login system on ur app then just import some library can liao,btohqsg
lol got some guy just replied you on SO,btohqsg
Yep yep‚Ä¶ but native login a bit meh alr,btohqsg
ok ya actually same thing  authorization code flow meta,btohqsg
Even in the rfc the resource owner is avtually referring to my user legit had to reread 10101019283739x,btohqsg
Okay but yeah he recco AMS to handle flow also,btohqsg
npnp  yea if its like AMS for Oauth2 external provider then i think its fine to separate it,btohqsg
i just generally prefer to not spin up more containers than necessary esp if the scale of the project won't be that large,btohqsg
Actually q confusing. He recco frontend to  be the callback and then frontend to pass params back to AMS,btohqsg
Why not just let AMS handle everything,btohqsg
its because of UXin the standard flow i mentioned jn  you realized frontend isn't involved in the whole thing right? so when i call the backend endpoint to get the access token  the frontend doesn't know anything ma  so the backend endpoint has to redirect on 200 okwhereas in the method he talked abt  the frontend call the backend with the authorization code request  immediately gets a response and the session is initiated  straight away update,btohqsg
anyway second method is less secure but its not an issue  anyway the token is shortlived and one time use also  once u pass to the BE that's it,btohqsg
either way works just see how u wanna implement it,btohqsg
for example  when I did email verification for my site  i send my users an email with the frontend website with a query parameter for the verification token  then the token is extracted from the frontend and passed to the backend so i get instant response  so what i did was an implementation of the second method,btohqsg
then u immediately see oh settled successfully verified no need for additional redirect,btohqsg
If i do second method got additional boilerplate code that needs to be created for frontend,btohqsg
you probably need another JSX to handle the page,btohqsg
Aiya i think q okay if all my frontend gonna be react,btohqsg
cause is another route ma  then u just create another JSX component for it lor,btohqsg
yea if all react is ok  if its like html css then might be abit more work,btohqsg
Yeah coz most probably hackathon/schproject wgt write html css,btohqsg
Just import chakra theme and carry on w life,btohqsg
you can just set a useEffect hook in your JSX to parse the authorization code  call the backend then render the appropriate content based on the response code,btohqsg
ya siao raw html css no go nowadays,btohqsg
yea haha just import some component lib like mui chakra slap on a few jsx and then call it a day,btohqsg
finally going back to your true self,btohqsg
we were like literally 10 sec into call,btohqsg

Bro I legit never saw her before  then after getting to know her realise why she knows me,btohqsg
She went to my grandparents house during cny heard my name being called there and I responded,btohqsg
No wonder I‚Äôve never seen her  cause she is one of those cousins that you only see during cny,btohqsg
Even if it is someone I help b4,btohqsg
Ain't no way I said my real name,btohqsg

but then i handed over to night crew alr q quickly,btohqsg
BRO NEARLY ALL 6 AMBULANCES IN THE STATION GOT TURNOUT,btohqsg
like i saw 1 i was like hi,btohqsg
then a 3rd one like right after,btohqsg
and like the 4th one i saw ready to exit station,btohqsg
i check the place where all ambulances are and like all of them gone,btohqsg

TBill yield up  ssb 10 year SGS curve probably gonna be up  so next issue probably 3.++,btohqsg
next issue put in another tranche,btohqsg
I been bond laddering my house funds into SSB anyway (not that it‚Äôs a lot),btohqsg
Commitment period quite long  can‚Äôt get my money out if I wanna make a good buy let‚Äôs say some sort of market crash or housing impulse choice,btohqsg
Although to be fair SSB also 1 month not say super responsive but better than 6m 1y or longer,btohqsg
Half equities half SSB  interest pay my insurance premiums and income tax  live 10% income. Buy condo  go gym  get FU money  do what I want  get old  downgrade condo  save for premium old folks home,btohqsg

Malaysia quality of life not as good,btohqsg
alot of new lines coming up,btohqsg
alot of new stations..getting sprung up,btohqsg
You can keep it for 10 years but SSB can sell any time get principal back 1 month,btohqsg
If you sell at the end of the month the closing window may be as fast as 4/3 days,btohqsg
Which is when you can play timing the market (housing or stock),btohqsg
FD you beg and cry also the money won‚Äôt come back,btohqsg
Optionality to me is worth more than the extra 100 interest a year on 10k,btohqsg
SSb interesting feature is the bi-annual interest,btohqsg
So if you ‚Äúladder‚Äù which means you buy monthly tranches  you get a stream of money deposited into your account,btohqsg
Which you can use to pay bills,btohqsg
But ofc FD is better overall return so if you don‚Äôt plan to do anything FD better,btohqsg
If you have a steam of interest monthly which matches/pays for recurring bills. you can accrue better interest rates on the money.Because you don‚Äôt need to leave money in your account collecting lousy interest  I think it‚Äôs not a bad choice all things considered.Feels good to me anyway. When I add all the factors up  ease of purchase redemption  optionality  frequency of interest  risk  flexibility  I like it better than FD.,btohqsg
