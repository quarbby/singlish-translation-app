Maybe the coffee shop talk I have been hearing that near election  Coe price will drop might come true,btohqsg
got any difference between GLB250 vs GLB35,btohqsg
I don’t want the touring .. but I want the 4.4L version sir,btohqsg
Which car you plan to get?,btohqsg
One is 2.0L one is 1.4L,btohqsg
but in order to buy house and save $$  really just renew current 1.4 then drive all the way,btohqsg
but interior and mbux is almost the same right?,btohqsg
U change out the GT .. then u put GTR 🤣😂,btohqsg
The GLB 35 is 300+ bhp,btohqsg
are they problematic in the long run?,btohqsg
my friend old mercs e250  they drove for about 200k to 300k in 10 years,btohqsg
Ha ha usually the owners are,btohqsg
but they have very regular servicing and good maintenance regime,btohqsg
Only the oil leaks .. if u pray the correct god 🤣,btohqsg
would it be advisable to get a second hand GLB35 with 35k millage,btohqsg
isit acceptable for a 2 year old car,btohqsg
He asking about the 2.0 one .,btohqsg
mileage abit on the higher side but its acceptable,btohqsg
Not too complicated to work on  if got things happen,btohqsg
u go showroom see whether new one,btohqsg
so far the used listings all similar to 26-30 leh,btohqsg
sorry idk how does depre come into play when buying car,btohqsg
We go showroom see GTI ?,btohqsg
Cos end of coe if you scrap you get the parf plus remaining coe ma,btohqsg
Then what you lost is the deprec,btohqsg
If you scrap after 10yr  you get only the scrap value,btohqsg
Aiyah  ves has reduced and gst up 1%  no wonder...so effectively the drop in coe made up by the reduced ves and gst 😂,btohqsg
car body itself got money de mah,btohqsg
some cars if export to other countries can profit,btohqsg
Now I know . But the amount get back at the end of the 10 yrs will be little . Might as well sell on the 5th years or when the coe is high to get some profit,btohqsg
some ppl just use it point to point  drive all the way,btohqsg
As a business man   profit comes before anything,btohqsg
that's why im living my life pathetically,btohqsg
Hahaha not profit  but rather is reducing losses,btohqsg
When you have 5 boys like me   money is really not enough .,btohqsg
Hahaha dun mind my saying  as a businessman especially in sg buying car you should know the mathematics 😂,btohqsg
Now my wife is pregrant with another 3   I need to make more milk money,btohqsg
Invest now  reap the rewards later 😂,btohqsg
Invest in cpf . Got 4% interest .,btohqsg
Your kids would start working and give you money ma  look forward to that day 🤭,btohqsg

Yah i be thankful if my kids if i ever have become normal ppl,btohqsg
My wife got allocated funds for the kids . She mentions that   property price will be very high by the time they grow up and not sure what f they can afford any .,btohqsg
That is a problem that WE the current flat owners need to fix,btohqsg
But we give them life to come to this world   so need to provide them with some support .,btohqsg
But yes i have heard alot ppl saying now housing so expensive  by the time kids get housing  norm is 1million le,btohqsg
Maybe become like Japan or HKG   cannot afford the property,btohqsg
support until they start working can liao  how long you wanna spoon feed them  though,btohqsg
this day and age spend your money make yourself happy can liao  life too short to worry about the next generation,btohqsg
I mention some support not full support,btohqsg
But we must not become like China where the parents must settle their kid's housing problem,btohqsg
Maybe in the near future .,btohqsg

Last 2 rounds haven get car  down Liao,btohqsg
Will COE drop to 35k-40k ?,btohqsg
now everyone know coe drop everyone will rush to buy,btohqsg
Hi car is 2 years old around 15k. Workshop say battery charge at 80% say recommend to change. Need to change?Then tyre rotation and wheel balancing suppose to do but they say my rim not straight then need to change rim then can do balance and rotation. Should I also?,btohqsg
But all are chargeable except labour,btohqsg
They can just factor labour in,btohqsg
Ya so should change or can ignore?,btohqsg
Huh? Warranty is 5yrs or up to 10k km  whichever first ah?,btohqsg
Sounds fishy to me. Your car 2 yrs old only  15k km  rim can drive till not straight ah?,btohqsg
Rim I think they say change 4 is 400?,btohqsg
I think I mount strike curb sometime. But is it so severe to make it no straight?,btohqsg
Huh  what battery they use? Usually is about 80 to 120  battery very easy to change,btohqsg
Yah possible but unless you buang daily  else is kerb rash only. Suggest you check with another workshop,btohqsg
So fast need to flush brake fluid?,btohqsg
Engine better dun flush  especially since your engine would have a coating of the protective oil,btohqsg
I more surprised 10k already engine flush  brake flush also hahaha,btohqsg
Can request all don’t change except engine oil n filter?,btohqsg
No cause it’s either you hit 6 months or the mileage interval. Because I drive very little  the mileage only 15k. But I hit my every other 6 months interval and this is where I am at currently,btohqsg
Can but will void warranty cause I didn’t adhere to the 6 months servicing cycle,btohqsg
Service don’t need flush one. That should be optional one.Oil and gearbox oil change is a service,btohqsg
You can take out the car manual. It will tell you maintenance is oil changes. Never seen the manual say flush.,btohqsg
But ya. Seems like you hostage to your workshop quite bad. Worst than C&C 🤣,btohqsg
The manual is in Japanese cause it’s a PI,btohqsg
so what now? Drop the warranty and change workshop?,btohqsg
If drop warranty  engine oil change still free?,btohqsg
Or stick with them then ask them don’t change engine flush?,btohqsg
This chart is based on 40k but I only use 15k. When it comes to car servicing does time period matter or mileage? So in this example  they estimated 2 years one would have driven 40k hence flush. Although time period hit but mileage haven’t  is it ok not to flush? Ignoring the warranty part,btohqsg
I think don’t matter much? Since only $20 n under warranty,btohqsg
I’m confused. You all say don’t flush  I’m assuming it’s the engine flush and flush braking? Or just mean engine? And braking flush is required?,btohqsg
I think just let them do to protect ur warranty,btohqsg
how long is the warranty? you want it right? do whatever is needed for warranty den,btohqsg
yes mileage or time  whichever comes first,btohqsg
Okay. Then battery and the rim change also?,btohqsg
not needed for warranty no need,btohqsg
Until Oct 2026. Not sure if the warranty is needed?,btohqsg
batt abt 2 years there le  can change outside lo,btohqsg
Feels like a lot of things excluded for warranty,btohqsg
rim u drive at highway no vibrate is ok,btohqsg
dunno what your warranty entails le,btohqsg
Think it’s the standard stuff. If wear and tear won’t cover,btohqsg
seen VW covers my friend's engine mount which i tot was pretty good haha,btohqsg
he say PI  dunno what car,btohqsg
10k do flush a bit too much,btohqsg
My car 118k. Haven even flush once,btohqsg
They flush me since the beginning of time,btohqsg
U bought for PHV or normal,btohqsg
Just to fetch baby around. Hardly use the car. Don’t know much about car also,btohqsg
If rarely use  can take risk consider drop warranty,btohqsg
But the free servicing still must give u,btohqsg
But go which worksho? And will they give me a servicing plan like this round need to do what  next round need to do what that kind?Can recommend me? Cause I not well versed with car like - oh 20k need do this do that or oh this one like not right need to change this part that kind,btohqsg
Meaning they shouldn’t charge me engine oil?,btohqsg
It’s free from the pic u show,btohqsg
Engine oil is 65 discount is 93  how does that work out?,btohqsg
I think include eo  filter n part of labour,btohqsg
You go to which workshop? Can recommend?,btohqsg
Cheapest eo change in sg I think,btohqsg
And everything else other workshop ah?,btohqsg
Engine flush is normal but seems like flush too much for your usage pattern,btohqsg
Need to call a few workshops n see which one cheapest if u want to save,btohqsg
"Depends on whether you want to go AD workshop  franchise/""branded"" workshop  or independent workshop lor",btohqsg
Generally EO change about $100 for oil (usually 0W20/5W30/5W40 depending on your engine) + Labor and maybe throw in OEM filter FOC,btohqsg
Check t&c. Did they state for warranty to be effective  die die must go their auth workshop for servicing?,btohqsg
Or after X amt of servicing  u r free to go anywhere,btohqsg
Tbh PI car no warranty one  anything the PI throw in is a freebie/discount for your vehicle,btohqsg
If tnc is die die their workshop  then u gg,btohqsg
Ya but is on them right lol,btohqsg
PI original job is to just import for you only lol it's the value add that they offer,btohqsg
I think the savings from these can overhaul engine n gearbox already lol,btohqsg
Sheesh I should write amedium.comarticle about this lol,btohqsg
Bigger PI shld be more trustworthy,btohqsg
Maybe a few k after they psycho u to change extra parts,btohqsg
this reminds me of men in black 2 lol,btohqsg

My first hand account with car times proves this sentence wrong🤭,btohqsg
Now  cos after next week sure back up,btohqsg

Agree. If new car  lemon law is 6 months? After that can fire the ws. Every servicing flush engine is just fleecing you,btohqsg
they say max is 4k disc,btohqsg
My recent servicing for 2016 honda vezel hybrid is only 180 cos had to do throttle body cleaning  and I used amsoil ss,btohqsg
They expect ppl to rush down,btohqsg
I'll go for non guaranteed bid 😂,btohqsg
Wah every 1k change engine oil?,btohqsg
Hmm the previous one… you refer to the servicing charge. I don’t have the receipt already but this is what I paid1k - around $2010k - around 5020k - around 70?30k - around 90,btohqsg
No sorry  look at this chart instead. And reference against the servicing parts I list earlier,btohqsg
First 1K after collecting new car best to change oil,btohqsg
The battery is $180. It says there 12v (Energizer),btohqsg
Oh I saw the top line is 1k 🤭,btohqsg
Where to repair  the air con cheap,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea which websites provides the updated prices of cars??,btohqsg
Updated prices are always at the showroom,btohqsg
2 person buy at the same time might be given 2 diff quotes,btohqsg
its up to u and salesman negotiation power,btohqsg
bottom line  they all have a min. selling price  but its marked up  how close u can get is dependent on u and ur salesman,btohqsg
See hw much loan u take,btohqsg
aiya  usually just discuss the price first  then loan all those handle later. most importantly is the selling price,btohqsg
