Is it just me or was BlackBerry mostly a business phone in Singapore?,btohqsg

I think mostly because BBM never became big in Singapore,btohqsg
i rmb owning a black berry and my samsung m7500 had more features than the black berry,btohqsg
(also I suspect data plans were too expensive back then before 4G andCircles.life),btohqsg
Also holy shit I forgot about that Samsung Armani phone. You were rich bro!,btohqsg
I never really got why BBM never took off in Singapore though  looking back,btohqsg
It could have been WhatsApp before WhatsApp,btohqsg
I suspect BlackBerry just never really needed to expand out of the business market they had a stranglehold on,btohqsg
Until the iPhone ate into that  by which time it was too late,btohqsg
No one used BlackBerry unless you needed to for work  it didn't make sense otherwise.,btohqsg
(also it was a looser time for data security in Singapore),btohqsg
