Hello  did anyone who applied to ntu's MATH/MAFI/MADA/MACS have to undergo a Math Qualifying Test? If so  i would like to know more abt it as I've been called to take the test but im not sure what syllabus it covers. It just says it covers O lvl A/E math and logical thinking qns,btohqsg
one of the stalls had a 18k rent,btohqsg
i mean if all they say is o level a/e math  thatâ€™s all u needa know.. like the qns may be difficult to identify concept and apply the steps but itâ€™s actually just wtv u learn in sch if u take o level  but then agn I no experience so depending on someone else to answer,btohqsg
yup itâ€™s one of them above,btohqsg
insane right.. and u think about it.. cost for the wholesale food and all.. then staff  shop display  food license,btohqsg
jae is joint admission exercise. similar to psle  upon receiving ur results  you go to the portal and select ur sch based on ur results,btohqsg
any qns abt eae and dsa ? I can answe for eae,btohqsg
IM GNNA SLEEO AND SEE UR REPLY TMR GOOD NIGHT EVERYBODY,btohqsg
yea.. but itâ€™s fully aptitude based  donâ€™t look at your results  as long as u get L1R4 equal to or less than 26 nett (meaning minus off ur cca points alr) then ure admitted. 26 net is the last mark u can get for poly  any higher  youâ€™re in ite or u choose to repeat   so scoring wise itâ€™s simple,btohqsg
idk but I found out a lot of the stalls alr having existing business pre Covid so they managed to flourish before Covid and open a shop  hence being able to afford.. but for small businesses..,btohqsg
for small buisnesses...bazaars cant give profit,btohqsg
yup.. at most go to heartland bazaars,btohqsg
I feel like this yearâ€™s bazaar space was abit wasted in terms of like weird claw machine and furniture stalls and insurance and car and house,btohqsg
