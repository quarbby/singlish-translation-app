https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/case-to-roll-out-new-features-on-price-kaki-mobile-app-including-online-shopping?utm_campaign=stfb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebookVery very bad move by Case. Prepare to pay more for groceries liao. By making it easier to compare prices  esp online  retailers can tacitly collude to increase prices. Those that read game theory before should know what I am talking about.Thinking of buying Dairy Farm and Sheng Siong to use the dividends to offset pending price increase.Hope PAP can come in and stop this... Inflation and cost of living alr so high  now they want us to pay even more really knn.,btohqsg

Now retailers have more easier time to compare prices,btohqsg
Ofc there's the case where some ppl will still go to certain supermarkets for whatever reason  like distance or membership,btohqsg
Ya which is why prices will increase,btohqsg
Why would they want to fight themselves when they can makan the consumer?,btohqsg
I mean the ppl in Dairy Farm  NTUC and Sheng Siong I believe are smart enough,btohqsg
But consumers will suffer. This is my PoV,btohqsg
