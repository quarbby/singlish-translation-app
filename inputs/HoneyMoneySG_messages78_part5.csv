What‚Äôs the recommended tax bracket then to start using SRS to reduce income tax?,btohqsg
I think somebody asked before. You can search chat history.,btohqsg
"I searched ""hsbc"" and it didnt work. Am i doing it wrong?",btohqsg
I applied ocbc 365 card in oct. I have did the min spending. I have yet to receive any sms from ocbc. How long it usually take? Possible to contact them directly?,btohqsg
Search ‚Äúhsbc crash‚Äù because you ask about ‚Äúcrash‚Äù,btohqsg
Thanks for the guidance and the written guide. I did not get any result either. Guess i'll just wait or restart my phone,btohqsg
dependent on many other factors  but above 80k chargeable income is where i feel the pinch.of course you have to balance things like cashflow since srs cant be withdrawn till 63  having limited options in what you can invest in srs etc,btohqsg
Refer to this and the Reddit post for HSBC app crash.,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if SCB credit cards can be cancelled within a year,btohqsg
does ur sign up promo TnC states otherwise?,btohqsg
Good morning all.. just to confirm overseas usage on dining n shopping  use Amaze to pair with UOB privi card can get 1.4mpd? This is my best option as I don‚Äôt hold ladies card n others,btohqsg
Yes if the mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Seems like ladies solitaire is the best paired w amaze now  but I can‚Äôt get it now üòÖ,btohqsg
Maybe u can evaluate if it is worth paying 2% to get 1.4mpd. Usually if it is an isolated travel case personally I can use YouTrip. Because need to consider orphan miles if you don‚Äôt have mile strategy.,btohqsg
U mean using amaze with UOB privi I still will get charged 2% to earn 1.4m?,btohqsg
I dun have exact data but recently 2% is from amaze,btohqsg
It is more ‚Äúworth it‚Äù if pair with 4mp citi rewards.,btohqsg
U can get uob lady or citireward,btohqsg
For mcc i am sure i go for maybank fnf for my bonus cat,btohqsg
Thank you let me check  if 2% then def not worth. My threshold for ‚Äúpaying for miles‚Äù is max 2cents per mile üòÇ,btohqsg
I be more concerned on orphan miles. But looks like you are new to bank for others . Sign up for free gifts pls haha,btohqsg
Thank you both.. but I‚Äôm self-employed now and I need time for NOA to reflect income so atm I can‚Äôt apply for cc üòÜ,btohqsg
If don't mind not having NTB bonus... Can get secured cc instead,btohqsg
Get Lady with dining category. Even if 4mpd is better than 1.4mpd after promo end. The Lady miles earned will pool together with PRVI.,btohqsg
Thanks! Good idea! For the UOB lady‚Äôs or lady‚Äôs solitaire?,btohqsg
The prob w lady‚Äôs is only 1k cap. I‚Äôm prolly spending few k on dining in jap üòÖ,btohqsg
Get PPV n vs. they are all pooled.,btohqsg
Sorry what‚Äôs PPV n vs? And what u mean pooled? I‚Äôm still quite noob in all these üôè,btohqsg
Pretty sure they wrote the requirements in the website.,btohqsg
Uob lady 10k secured  solitaire 30k secured,btohqsg
Uob prefer platinum visa (mobile contactless 4mpd)  uob visa signature (foreign spending/contactless 4mpd),btohqsg
Pool mean all reward for uob are all combine into 1 acct unlike some bank is 1 card 1 acct,btohqsg
Thank you  you all are awesome üôè. UOB plat visa contactless my no.1 card. 9x first 1k I will max out every mth. Ok I‚Äôll check out vs and solitaire :),btohqsg
If I have uob ladys solitaire for dining and travel  and I plan to cancel my uob one card (which I have been using for shoppee and grab+utilities)+ I have hsbc revolution  citi rewards and dbs womens worldWhat should I replace the uob one with? Uob ppv or uob visa signature? Hahaha,btohqsg
Look like you not cashback team  all miles card. Can consider uob ppv,btohqsg
I used to be cashback team but now I'm travelling more xD,btohqsg
Uob ppv 4mpd up to 1.1k spend per month for online and mobile contactless  no minimum spending. Better then vs which required 1k on contactless to get 4mpd,btohqsg
Oh I'm thinking of vs for the fcy though,btohqsg
Because if I travel  uob ladys is only up to 3k  and maybe citirewards paired with amaze for 1k overseas spend. My trips tend to be 1 mth so I was thinking of visa signature for fcy spending,btohqsg
Ppv is good for contactless but visa signature has that. And shoppee/grab I can replace with dbs womens world card for 4mpd,btohqsg
Just the utilit bills part cannot replace,btohqsg
If u can hit then just get both,btohqsg
Uob pool so it is ok,btohqsg
I only travel 2-3 times a year but loong trips and I spend a lot on them. So wondering if visa signature is more suitable,btohqsg
Don't really spend locally much. But cannot waive if I don't really use right,btohqsg
I have no problem waiving with uob when i have almost all their card  some i rarely spend also haha,btohqsg
Haha OK so both cards got no min spend for annual fee waiver ah. Then I will just get both,btohqsg
Uob ppv good for normal day cover if u run out since no minimun spend for online and mobile contactless,btohqsg
Average daily balance  not end of the month,btohqsg
Hi. Can check I apply uob lady solitaire after apply thru sms. How long will get approve or reject üòÖ,btohqsg
