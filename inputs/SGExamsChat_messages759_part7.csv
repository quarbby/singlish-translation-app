i don't even know wat i did in sec 4,btohqsg
My cca always had laptops to game on so all the classmates close to would come to my cca just to use the laptops..rmb once we were doing headcount.The teacher was mystified after realising how many students were in the class,btohqsg

i see my sec sch juniors in public  i legit want to run away,btohqsg
I saw my juniors literally could not see any leading the cca or becoming a leader,btohqsg
Honestly when I think about it  I could have. But I was not more capable then the ones eventually choose to lead for my cohort.Nor for the cohort after mine but the 3rd cohort was a diff story,btohqsg
I was sec 5 then so I knew who became the cca leader  he was not bad for one. The garbage one was the co-leader,btohqsg
Become co-leader but cannot plan  then ask teacher plan. Say not happy...,btohqsg

idk but as someone from NA and sec 5  wont say all but about half of my sec 5 class that i know of went to poly  the rest either go ite or private uni  and for those who went ite also managed to find their way to uni. My point is sch vibes does matters  especially in the case of teacher's quality. personally i feel without my teachers in sec 5  i might not be able to score that well,btohqsg
tan(6theta) = tan(3)(2theta) = 2tan 3theta/ 1- tan^2(3theta)= 2tan(2theta+theta)/ 1- tan^2(2theta+ 1 theta)then u can solve from here,btohqsg
oh i dont take fmath i was just asking yt for fun but thanks,btohqsg
