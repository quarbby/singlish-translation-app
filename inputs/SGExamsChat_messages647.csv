the way people were split last time is diff bc no jae,btohqsg
now idk how they are split but is still the 4 houses,btohqsg
cause ik a snr who was the last pure ipjc batch,btohqsg
last time which house you're in depends on your class,btohqsg
so your entire class in same house,btohqsg
Cause they alr have the classes when you come back right,btohqsg
now is cfm not by class cause my og got 3 pcme (ip),btohqsg

i mean u r gna grp tgt wif ppl u r famillar wif mah,btohqsg
because i personally aint travelling from nus to ntu so i aint expecting someone to do that either,btohqsg
ori i was mostly talking to ppl i alr knew,btohqsg
ok i have alot of tea on him lol,btohqsg
now my sec sch i think no sports day liao,btohqsg
does every sch do their cross country at the OCBC square,btohqsg
or is it like got diff venues for diff schs,btohqsg
on insta they say at ocbc square,btohqsg
house system is a simulation of adults interest groups,btohqsg
Until they hand write a sign,btohqsg
after my sch's x-country we p much flooded suntec city,btohqsg
first is bedok reservoir  ecp  pasir ris,btohqsg
do they transport the students or they must report there themselves,btohqsg
sec sch old enough to travel,btohqsg
is it as far as from pasir ris to sungei gedong tho,btohqsg
yalah we also travel ourselves for our x-country,btohqsg
but bukit batok to pasir ris abit far,btohqsg
i thought u meant bukit view,btohqsg
i took grab to bedok reservoir in sec 1,btohqsg
can i be friend with u,btohqsg
ik a sec 2 in my cca who grab to ocbc square,btohqsg
i mean my mum book for me,btohqsg
korkor not mean to meimei  mei mei happi,btohqsg
Korkor meimei is going to BAN/j,btohqsg
what caught my eye is how does he mess up your name,btohqsg
if u say common like felicia phoebe chloe etc,btohqsg
My name is tay foo wei,btohqsg
wait is ambasing's wife named sarah,btohqsg
keep talking about his crush called sarah in poly,btohqsg
but felicia rly to common alr,btohqsg
i was stuck on this for a few days,btohqsg
me? im tryna learn how to code myself lol,btohqsg
also chatgpt assumes ure using a normal codespace i think?,btohqsg
but u can use ChatGPT to help guide you,btohqsg
first time i tried using chatgpt with it spent more tim eexplaining top it in prompts,btohqsg
might try to finish this mario task,btohqsg
i just check the TM portal then i randomly find that i alr got allocated a subject combi,btohqsg
bro idt felicia common eh ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Ann koh can't take my class sia L,btohqsg
i mean not the most common  but also not so rare,btohqsg
every where i turn got confirm 1 person named felicia,btohqsg
even if not chatgpt  the fastest way to learn coding tbh is to look at what others have done,btohqsg
brother where you find that much feliciaâ€™s pls lmk,btohqsg
bc any issue you have has likely been answered before,btohqsg
my sec sch batch donâ€™t have one felicia except for me ðŸ’€,btohqsg
ok actl there were quite alot of ppl sitting for the selection test,btohqsg
Idk what yâ€™all talking but this the only thing I know,btohqsg
i want to go thru the thinking process first tbh,btohqsg
i was expecting 2 rows but almost the entire theatre filled,btohqsg
How many ppl take my combi,btohqsg
then i see my fren story confirm got one of thier fren name felicia,btohqsg
when u say look at stack overflow  i cant necessarily read everything tho,btohqsg
same i was also quite surprised,btohqsg
gigachads answered your question 10 years ago,btohqsg
or some random asked the question  ownself reply it but nvr post their ans,btohqsg
reading what others have done doesnâ€™t take away from the thinking at all bc you still need to understand it to adapt to your problem,btohqsg
Not even full class of fmath,btohqsg
you do you but itâ€™s more of adding to your toolbox,btohqsg
i admire wanting to learn tho,btohqsg
idk if this time they will open a full class or smth,btohqsg
more of googling specific problems or things you wanna achieve,btohqsg
maybe after cs50 and i wanna do own projects,btohqsg
U must did rly well for the selection test,btohqsg
I kaypoh my cher next time LOL,btohqsg
i felt some qns i do until rabak,btohqsg
i never took but iâ€™ve seen the paper,btohqsg
but there were 2 qns i can confidently do,btohqsg
then also got 1 student named felicia,btohqsg
i havenâ€™t touched programming in like a month or two alr,btohqsg
wanted to send link but forgot here cnnt send link,btohqsg
as in i respect wanting learn it just like that,btohqsg
ya i have to look for ans to reverse,btohqsg
how is it done this way,btohqsg
@Habibi5201we both got our dream subj combis,btohqsg
just practice from those courses on websites,btohqsg
i got better at it bc i started using it everywhere,btohqsg
i picked up programming from like some course  it took me like a few months to complete the whole beginner course,btohqsg
Hope y'all get the cca y'all want tho ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
then from there i just apply my programming skills on diff projects,btohqsg
i feel it is easier to learn programming if yall had a purpose,btohqsg
coding language is like learning another speaking language,btohqsg
you have to use it enough,btohqsg
like i need to code for some electronics lab,btohqsg
i used it for all my lab analysis even tho it takes longer,btohqsg
and the prof is a cb that expect us to know the in and outs of the code,btohqsg
then i did an astar intern in ML despite having not much prior experience in it,btohqsg
forced me to pick up stuff,btohqsg
ohya yall know the felicia teo murder case? by some fking coninceidence thts also my math cher name??? like it cant be both first name and surname same sia,btohqsg
fr like explaining to do a simple action like picking up a cup,btohqsg
if u are bored u can look up how it is done in the,btohqsg
helps if u are learning low level,btohqsg
programming language like c and c++,btohqsg
i did one c++ module in poly,btohqsg
c++ was the first language I picked up,btohqsg
wat does matlab do  i only see ppl say its for math n sci,btohqsg
sounds like a dick move but then when i touched on python i actually found it easier to learn from the basics,btohqsg
yes thatâ€™s what itâ€™s developed for,btohqsg
like prob only the 1% of its true capability,btohqsg
is c++ even good for image data processing,btohqsg
bcos im trying to code an imagery processor in c++ for satellites,btohqsg
im using python too but more for the displaying of images,btohqsg
It is as powerful as your ability to code well with it.,btohqsg
i mean python can also ah,btohqsg
i think have some library for it,btohqsg
python works with tons of C libraries..,btohqsg
a lot of the syntax and functions is just way more optimised for science and engineering,btohqsg
it also has like apps and other tools built in its library,btohqsg
but then i donâ€™t have the best experience when it comes to libraries,btohqsg
so i scroll through the files until sian alr,btohqsg
It is really depends on what SPECIFICALLY you are trying to do.,btohqsg
wait i remember i have a code for it,btohqsg
let me try to find it,btohqsg
best if u can find a project and copy paste the code,btohqsg
might sound vague af but thats what i did ah,btohqsg
can also do that but then i also need to see whether itâ€™s what i want or not,btohqsg
i mean once you master the basics of a code language  it's about expanding that toolbox,btohqsg
i mean at least iâ€™m working on the project with one other person who has more experience than me in coding and etc,btohqsg
so that i donâ€™t end up getting stuck,btohqsg
being stuck is ok tho for learning reasons,btohqsg
tbh my ability to code has gone down a lot recently bc i haven't had to do much of it,btohqsg
and u dont know where to copy and paste,btohqsg
i think that is the pain part,btohqsg
im still trying to learn how to use opencv,btohqsg
if idk how to use the library  no way that i can code the satellite image displaying and the data processing,btohqsg
pcb modules and payload alr built and most of the code for other sections are alr done,btohqsg
some nanosatellite project that me and my friend started since nov,btohqsg
stuff like payload and pcb just reminded me of a rocketry thing i did last time lol,btohqsg
yh itâ€™s something to do with launching into space,btohqsg
like i didn't go but we had a whole team,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve been too busy with school that i havenâ€™t worked on the project ever since sch started,btohqsg
i ghosted the team q a bit last time lol,btohqsg
i mean my friend also got school,btohqsg
weâ€™re just like 2 16 year olds working on this,btohqsg
this is the comfortable one tho,btohqsg
to this day i still dk why i didnâ€™t bother learning from cs50,btohqsg
lemme walk a few circles ard the living room n gonna get the ans frfr,btohqsg
every single non quantum related project i've done with code has been plane/rocket related lol,btohqsg
the only 2 ppl ik doing phd are in quantum shenanigansðŸ’€,btohqsg
i should start writing my proposal on particle physics,btohqsg
how anti matter basically makes up the universe,btohqsg
he has a visible chinese accent,btohqsg
i swear kuro has met every single type of person that's existed on this planet,btohqsg
the ones i met were never so bad at least,btohqsg
I seen china students drink from the,btohqsg
Like sucking the thing like a straw,btohqsg
Tbf they are like exchange students,btohqsg
Not here for a long time but a short time,btohqsg
But long enough to make me remember,btohqsg
i feel like he's trying his best but like his point doesnt come across,btohqsg

no idea why the  right side is even more than 5,btohqsg
actually i haven finish hbl hw skull,btohqsg
oh i was responding to yt about adding new var,btohqsg
need upload this code as my hbl sil(student initiate learning,btohqsg
back when it's not expected for all of us to have computer access also,btohqsg
or maybe that's just me ðŸ’€,btohqsg
like a journal for when u start new hobbies basically,btohqsg
u can see the 10 mins increments of new portion completed or new voodoo magic,btohqsg
if it were me i'd spend my time on my bed,btohqsg
one of them was literally play mlbb,btohqsg
then bs smth at the end,btohqsg
cher wants 1 at every hbl  so every 2 weeksish,btohqsg
thing is i'd love to self learn stuff but i just hate when it's forced onto me,btohqsg
hope this year i dont slack off on this,btohqsg
wanted to start since sec 2 kek,btohqsg
I wish I was there like I was there to see you try specs,btohqsg

even i don't use it and i'm older,btohqsg
this is going to be a loooong night,btohqsg
Say that again and I'll do you instead,btohqsg
