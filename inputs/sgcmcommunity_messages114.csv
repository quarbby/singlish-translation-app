New BMW M3 CS gets a total 543bhp output üöóüí®The BMW M3 CS is 20kg lighter than the M3  and pushes out a total 543bhp  thanks to extensive use of carbon fibre and a raised turbocharger boost pressure.üëâüèª React with üî• if you think the BMW M3 CS is a powerful car!‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!,btohqsg

And then went down to the dead end,btohqsg
2 Rolls Royce parked in a way that the passage was narrow and ‚Ä¶ most of u will know by now.. I scratched my bumper,btohqsg
Those old buildings really need to re evaluate their parking lots and space,btohqsg
it's a good place to train your driving,btohqsg
I really pei fu those bm drivers  merc,btohqsg
Maybe should park at the top. Near to the entrance/exit,btohqsg
I stupid went all the way down,btohqsg
U Shd park at one raffles place,btohqsg

Mental illness isn‚Äôt taken seriously because people are throwing around like it‚Äôs a fever like that,btohqsg
Sorry‚Ä¶I dun mean in that way,btohqsg
I jus can‚Äôt stand the sight of those scratches at the bumper,btohqsg

No la. It will be taken seriously. Dire consequences will happened if not get treated well,btohqsg
Hahaha you‚Äôre good but it‚Äôs just my 2 cents,btohqsg
No worries. It‚Äôs a free world ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
ppl juz need to chill and dont stigmatise those w mental illness or make fun of them. Alot of words used by bird brains become socially unacceptable. Like the word retarding  it essentially means deceleration but ppl use until it becomes so negative. ü´†,btohqsg
It‚Äôs chilly now. Raining the whole day and my day to the zoo‚Ä¶.gone,btohqsg
I got prepare for wet weather..hehe,btohqsg
I live for civic banters from my favorite person,btohqsg
Honestly not everyone can buy civic,btohqsg
At least the wannabe brokes dont buy 13.50 brakepads from China,btohqsg
They dun compromise on quality for sure,btohqsg
Buy 13.50 is the most poorest decision a person will make,btohqsg
Drive BBA but now money buy ATF and brake pads,btohqsg
Smartest decision is buying a civic,btohqsg
You buy 13.50 brake pads because u r a WANNABE,btohqsg
not all people can afford bba like you ü•∫,btohqsg
Atleast my car can brake properly,btohqsg
Maybe need to save money and buy 13.50 brake pads,btohqsg
Then can save money buy BBA ü•∞,btohqsg
Should I buy cheap and poorly made brake pads?,btohqsg
I starting to think you 4 year old leh,btohqsg
My civic can easily smoke your car,btohqsg
Actually right  why you against civic ah,btohqsg
Ahbeng with civic smoke you is it,btohqsg
WAH I WANT DRAGON LEH IN MY CAR,btohqsg

Tonight we meet up  see who wannabe who isn't,btohqsg
YAY TOO POOR TO BUY BRAKE PADS,btohqsg
When people ask you questions cannot answer also,btohqsg
Your cheap brake pads might not work on the way here,btohqsg
I thought we talking about cars üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Do you have any other words in your vocabulary?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a lover  not a fighter ü•∞,btohqsg
When someone says the same thing over and over again and doesn't get any support,btohqsg
So I call you poor and stupid repeatedly  means it becomes a fact? ü§î,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know. All I hear right now is a whining kid. Trying the slender a respected member of SGCM chat,btohqsg
So you can find me easily ü•∞,btohqsg
Can you do the honors and paste it for me?,btohqsg
I need the OG to do it,btohqsg
They can come down and witness also,btohqsg
Maybe can use your kotex to soak up your tears,btohqsg
Congrats! You just described yourself again,btohqsg
Yes I cry reading his messages everyday,btohqsg
Now I just read it as watanabe,btohqsg

You wouldn't be so jobless and screwed in the head to come here and do this,btohqsg
I would give up after my first üòÇ,btohqsg
I respect u admitted ur poor,btohqsg
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm making your day better!,btohqsg
Yay fourth time you described yourself!!,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the third word you‚Äôve learned?,btohqsg
Maybe can become rich like me one day,btohqsg
Actually don‚Äôt call you poor lah,btohqsg
Let me get back to you okay,btohqsg
My brake pads cost more than your imaginary cars,btohqsg
U have demonstrated NOTHINGG if you are the only one in Singapore using it. Your words are NOTHING compared to the voices of the majority,btohqsg
Just someone who is hiding behind a computer screen lying down on the sofa with chips on ur hand,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt understand. What does civic wannabe even mean?,btohqsg
Take photo of ur car leh,btohqsg
Yes boss CNY i go win Money le,btohqsg
Yah go and do good things lah,btohqsg
But cannot tahan him spreading fake news sia sometimes,btohqsg
So we settle tonight or not?,btohqsg
Can you be a wannabe if you already have it?,btohqsg
Hi guys are we going for a drive,btohqsg
Not if I hang my clothes outside,btohqsg
I think the kid phone kena confiscated,btohqsg
Always heard that lesser known contis parts availability may be an issue and cost higher  how bad is it now ah? Saw some 2nd hand Citroen/ Peugeot depre still within my range. Not considering any brands in particular I only filter depre,btohqsg
I go for a nap and come back 300+ messages lol,btohqsg
Not that bad actually  only some parts stockists may not have or need order  leading to longer down time. If you just need a people hauler  just get Japanese brand for a piece of mind. Citroen and Peugeot not particularly known for reliability,btohqsg
Selling civic fc bumper and mods,btohqsg
And you come across as scammer,btohqsg
Huh whut? I‚Äôm not a scammer‚Ä¶ lols,btohqsg
Pm@awj_moodto sell your civic stuff then you can go away,btohqsg
Hahaha not say you scammer but selling things here isn‚Äôt allowed üòä,btohqsg
I but if you list your FC on SGCM you can link it here?,btohqsg
But Pete doesn't drive such a cheap car,btohqsg
Not that civics are cheap either,btohqsg
Maybe u can visit me at Kovan melody and see what cars I drive,btohqsg
Or maybe u want me to visit u no problem,btohqsg
You dare to come yishun? We welcome you with open arms,btohqsg
Creepy fella just call me  I'm scared. Sorry just blocked him,btohqsg
Just wanna understand what‚Äôs the unhappiness with me about that‚Äôs all bro,btohqsg
If anything I‚Äôve said has angered you in any way. I do apologise@Xipeng,btohqsg
Just read the rules of this Tele... Not difficult la,btohqsg
I clicked on pinned message and it just put me to this,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt find the rules here too‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
I believe he talking about this,btohqsg
But in any way sorry for not  understanding the rules enough,btohqsg
@Xipenghope u don‚Äôt misunderstand my intentions and all.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I wanted a meet up to just to understand what‚Äôs wrong,btohqsg
Like maybe I did sth wrong as I‚Äôm new here,btohqsg
Np but please don't anyhow call people  creepy af  and don't advertise your stuff here  not the right place,btohqsg
The only people I accept calls from are people named Imran,btohqsg
I called to faster resolve the issue and yes sorry I didn‚Äôt know I couldn‚Äôt advertise here as I just wanted to dekit and clear my stuff to upgrade my car that‚Äôs all,btohqsg
As there was no clear instructions till I was told,btohqsg
Who in their right mind goes straight to asking people to settle outside tho,btohqsg
I mean to me it‚Äôs faster. Like to meet up face to face to talk nicely to settle,btohqsg
Well I got no passport cannot leave yishun,btohqsg
Hope can meet up as friends again,btohqsg
I believe@SGCM_Adminhas something up their sleeve in terms of car meet,btohqsg
Hello good evening guys.Is there anyone know workshop tht opens in weekends that specialise for Hyundai,btohqsg
Hahahaha m2 cs is my weapon of choice. Either that or the m5 cs,btohqsg
is there any possibility to steal fuel from a car?,btohqsg
Odd question. But there is always ways to do it.,btohqsg
hmm...i just realised i lost 2.2km worth of oil,btohqsg
Well.. the ECU does calculate based on many variables.. Such as current fuel consumption  how many L left. 2.2km is very little amount to steal so it is likely the ECU had just re-calculated,btohqsg
but in a span of 6 hours  there can be variance?,btohqsg
End of the day still need use ur Mileage/fuel used,btohqsg
i sent the car to the workshop on 12 noon  leaving 626km worth of fuel,btohqsg
Go workshop need take pic of odo or note down odo before leaving,btohqsg
Some mechanics got habit of test driving the car( which is required for some repairs) but some is really joy ride,btohqsg
collected the car on 1800hrs...balance 598km worth of fuel oil,btohqsg
Sometimes ecu range will drop  but idt it will drop dis much.,btohqsg
that's why i asking if one can siphon,btohqsg
cos fuel now very exp ma,btohqsg
Depends on the job you did.. If they disconnect the battery  the ECU could have really lost all the previous calculated values before and these are it's new estimate.,btohqsg
So what did you get done at WS.,btohqsg
i can't curse and swear over here  rite?,btohqsg
Siphon also that is little to even siphon out..Not worth.ECU calculate also not 100% one... You leave it idle for a few hours turn it on the values can jump one.,btohqsg
Use short forms and special characters,btohqsg
ok...let's hope they can't be this cheapo la hor?,btohqsg
No lah want steal steal whole tank le lah,btohqsg
of cos not whole tank la,btohqsg
See 5 litre also go jail,btohqsg
It is all depending on the current air fuel mixture  engine conditions and other things. It is likely you drive more later you will see the value stuck higher for awhile.,btohqsg
they siphon bit by bit. a full jerry can,btohqsg
Steal 50 litres also go jail,btohqsg
I doubt they will siphon cause abit pointless. Too much work for too little rewards. Higher chance they took the car out for a ride but for spray and scratch work  they shouldn‚Äôt even burn that much fuel cause they only need to move the car around the workshop,btohqsg
Jerry can usually 20L one.. And to risk mixing the fuel types also no good,btohqsg
Not all cars pump 95  some 92 or 98,btohqsg
i think i linked up the stealing of bunker with stealing fuel oil,btohqsg
But if you did not record your odo  hard to jump to conclusions. Very high chance may just be ecu recalibrate,btohqsg
MOving car around workshop does make ECUs think it is using a lot more fuel too! Cause it is calculating distance based and for the amount of fuel you use for many short trips.. Mathematically you will see higher fuel to distance use,btohqsg
When you park up the car for a longer time  the range estimate does fall quite a bit when you start up,btohqsg
Goes back up once you start driving for a bit,btohqsg
Also if the car was moved a few times here and there,btohqsg
2.2km worth is a few ml,btohqsg
unless there is another workshop at 2.2km away from the main workshop,btohqsg
Yeah. I didn‚Äôt use much of my car over the past week after CNY visitations and I also notice a higher fuel consumption avg when I started again driving today.,btohqsg
And if they would  more than 2 litres,btohqsg
Why would they take so little,btohqsg
Use your fuel gauge needle to judge how much fuel you have I would say,btohqsg
not 2 liters eh. just worth 2.2km worth of fuel oil,btohqsg
Not the range  range changes live based on driving,btohqsg
i din calculate exactly how much fuel,btohqsg
If you've got a 14km/l FC,btohqsg
just find it strange the difference can be so huge,btohqsg
You see your FC when you start car after 1 day,btohqsg
Will be single digit to start with,btohqsg
Slowly will go up to double digit,btohqsg
wahh...i am dreaming that fuel tank will auto fill up when i start up the car,btohqsg
ur ecu will recalculate again de. Sometimes my ecu say range left 490. But as i drive the range left increase back to 500 ish,btohqsg
so far...i din see that happen,btohqsg
That means you don't coast hor,btohqsg
If you coast then will go up,btohqsg
Yah the ECU SUCKS. NEver accurate HAHAH,btohqsg
no one wants to take an elantra for a joy ride right,btohqsg
always give u a higher estimate but it never reaches it,btohqsg
Erm ok if you so paranoid right,btohqsg
I suggest you take picture of your odometer next time,btohqsg
When you drop the car off,btohqsg
not paranoid per se. just wanna understand,btohqsg
cars are so advanced nowadays that i dunno what is what,btohqsg
Range is not an accurate gauge of how much fuel you have,btohqsg
Hope you find your 160ml of fuel,btohqsg
so coasting compared to step and release gas pedal is better or what,btohqsg
Gas pedal is not on off,btohqsg
The longer you go  the more fuel efficient it'll be,btohqsg
And the lesser you brake the better cause you brake then need to pick up speed,btohqsg
Coasting is when your transmission is disconnected from the engine. This saves quite a decent amount of fuel as the engine runs freely at lower RPM and your car is just gliding freely only left with resistance of the wheels.Step and release gas is not really coasting cause the transmission is still connected  it is more of you are.. gently engine braking.Cruise Control is your car maintaining a constant speed electronically. A stable speed usually will give better F/C cause there is no spike in speed(demands more fuel),btohqsg
elantra FC best around 80 to 100,btohqsg
anything more than that ur eating fuel,btohqsg
anything > 120 is eating fuel,btohqsg
No i was being specific to elantra only HAHHAHA,btohqsg
I believe this highly depends on.. Gear ratios too.,btohqsg
jialat...i beginning to feel that 100 is slow...,btohqsg
On some roads for sure.. But LTA disagrees XD,btohqsg
but now i go in alone also no problem HAHHA,btohqsg
aiyo...i scared i kena bang and then no one to save me,btohqsg
me just a few mths of experience,btohqsg
heh? ur license how long le,btohqsg
just pass meh? cannot be lah,btohqsg
WALAU P PLATE 100 CALL SLOW?,btohqsg
when i P plate i drive 70 80 only,btohqsg
but i actually drove like more than a year,btohqsg
ppl tend to panick at the test stage,btohqsg
but dunno why after i change to school  things became easy,btohqsg
cdc and bbdc layout very diff also,btohqsg
HOW YOU KNOW JERRY SO WELL!!!!! I‚Äôm impressed sir!! üòùüòùüòù,btohqsg
Guys I need some advise.Is Citro√´n and Peugeot a problematic car? High maintenance?If I need a low dep and daily use car is this type of car not worth considering.,btohqsg
High maintenance due to unreliability as compared to Japanese cars for sure.If you buying as a weekend or second car at home  sure be fine. Of course if you are financially blessed  just go ahead. French car are comfortable and well equipped.,btohqsg
German car la. everywher on road. parts easy get. most ws familiar also..,btohqsg
but can be quite boring also esp if u spend 2 or 300k on a German ride n find they are everywhere at traffic light,btohqsg
Nvm nvm! Just add M badge or add stripe.  Instant personalisation!! ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
even Porsche can be seen everywhere these days... 400 over k like nothing to Singaporean for a 10 year car. respect,btohqsg
Singapore is replacing HK as a financial hub. With many ultra wealthy families relocating here  it‚Äôs going to be a common sight. Help contribute to Singapore taxes and consumer indexes!,btohqsg
common ppl jialat . esp the young...,btohqsg
Yah common ppl that need car to work jialat,btohqsg
Government policy is moving towards car light Singapore. Good transport infrastructure are in the making. Autonomous vehicles in the future to convey people and goods from point A to point B in Singapore. Rationale for common people not to own a car at all in the future. Common people take public transportation  cycle or other mobility devices. Cars are exclusively for the wealthy and the authority.,btohqsg
Govts always forget certain issues but like to focuses on bread and butter. Aspirations. Dreams of the young adults. No one wanna slog in the 9 to 5 life forever. Go home do chores. Rinse and repeat. Car lite or not  they need to balance it out,btohqsg
If all these car rental company continues to add into their fleet   then the price will continue to shoot up,btohqsg
Or can buy japanese car also hehe,btohqsg
Buy some dirt cheap brake pads from taobao,btohqsg
Might as well buy parts from taobao,btohqsg
Then laugh at us for buying cars in SG,btohqsg
Jap car suit our road condition n weather best...but those who want status will still go for more exp euro cars . just top up a more every monthüòõ,btohqsg
And get nothing back except some perceived face,btohqsg
Alot of people live their life for other people anyways,btohqsg
Buy all those fancy things to impress people they don‚Äôt even like,btohqsg
If a JDM depre is 15k,btohqsg
Ur wrong . it's not to impress them. it's to make your frens relative n neighbour angry n envious üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Okay lah  cause you prefer conti,btohqsg
so many cheap Coe BMW outside. DEP cheaper than your BN altis,btohqsg
gals can't tell the difference it's new or old... they only see badge.,btohqsg
can aso buy a Coe slk. can fool a lot chicks üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
unless yr chick used to being chauffered in s class or Bentley since young. most gals got no ideas on carsüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
True the Peugeot repairs can be expensive but seems you are a bit lucky to get a bad lemon,btohqsg
But as usual  except for the older Benz  conti cars all sorts of things will break down  power windows  buttons  central lock etc,btohqsg
jaguar can buy? or just as bad as frenchies?,btohqsg
I dont prefer conti. I see the car specs also,btohqsg
But if a Korean car vs a jap car  i also see specs of engine first and also what I using it for,btohqsg

Forrester is a fuel guzzler sia,btohqsg
You talking about miata NA then yes,btohqsg
Take Forester NA turbo version for comparison.Not any other brands Zz,btohqsg
Forester is heavy and with 2L boxer some may feel under power,btohqsg
sometimes NA is abit nicer cos of the linearity,btohqsg
some people like the kick when turbo spools,btohqsg
that time got ppl offer $88 888 888 u never take up,btohqsg
the 2.0 NA like 160hp only,btohqsg
Hais 150 for me enoufh alr,btohqsg

Why you think like me .. hahahahah,btohqsg
