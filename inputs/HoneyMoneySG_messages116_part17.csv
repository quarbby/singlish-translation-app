Im using amaze+crmc for other stuff thats why im considering privi miles or krisflyer..,btohqsg
would u be able to clock 800 sia related spend annually?,btohqsg
Nah i dont think so. If i were to take SIA it would be to redeem miles for it,btohqsg
then uob kf is not suitable,btohqsg
consider uob visa signature if u clocking min 1k for local contactless,btohqsg
Hmm i wont be able to hit 1k local contactless tho. Any reason why uob privi miles is not recommended?,btohqsg
uob prvi is not good for spend below $20 because of its points rounding  no uni$ at uob$ merchants  and at best only 1.4mpd,btohqsg
any cc suggestion for SG airlines flights (est. S$2k),btohqsg
