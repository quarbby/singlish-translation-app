I hit by that a few times  but don’t really care  since still count as $500 for 360,btohqsg
I generally use uob one for shopee and ocbc reward for lazada.,btohqsg
Lazada always okay for me to get 6mpd 👍  not sure it’s lucked or any different mcc that not hit me,btohqsg
Uob one card as long as it’s Shopee it doesn’t matter what mcc ?,btohqsg
I would think so. But i rarely buy from shopee supermarket. Always retail item,btohqsg
Which Gaincity outlet? Go n find out if they have Favepay or ShopBack pay scan QR option to pay.,btohqsg
You will not get the base points. Still get bonus points.,btohqsg
I also don’t buy from supermarket  but once a while get the mcc supermarket 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Be careful though… ShopBack Pay may change the MCC to dining :),btohqsg
Hi  can I check if heymax NTUC voucher can only used for online purchase?If I buy $150 voucher  can I split the voucher into multiple orders or do I need to use them in one order?,btohqsg

If i spend a consistent of $1000 in petrol monthly  using OCBC 365 I can get $60 cashback? Anyone know about this?,btohqsg
UserJeromehas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no referral codes allowed,btohqsg
Just leave it ? Take it as you prepaid some in advance if it a everyday card,btohqsg
In@ChrisHMSG’s OCBC’s videos  it says has to be transferred via a corporate account. What does that mean? 😅,btohqsg
It is UOB LADY card…but i had called UOB hotline to do the transferIt is a $1000…. So i thought it is better to get it out 😀,btohqsg
HAHAHA Okay that is a lot  I thought you meant by $100-200 🤣,btohqsg
I wanted to transfer my $ from Chocolate Finance to UOB saving accountKey in my credit card by mistake  🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️…. Surprisingly it went through,btohqsg
You can use a personal account now to transfer in the salary. Must be a third party account.,btohqsg
I had the same mistake once too 😅 I accidentally transferred to CRMC but I just left it in as it my daily card anyway,btohqsg
Haha… so i am not alone 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Ah yes  for certain banks their credit cards act like account numbers  allowing FAST transfers for instant repayment.Anyway the CSO should be able to help u transfer the excess payment out into your bank account.,btohqsg
Just wanted to share.I guess this is the reason why Syfe hid the performance trendline for the China Growth Satellite portfolio on both website  App - even after portfolio revamp.,btohqsg
Hello  my uob statement is generated on the last day of every month (ie 30th or 31th). So if i were to continue using the evol card  for this month july expenditure 1-31 july  i will be following the old system right? The $600 minimum spend,btohqsg
I already stopped moved on to other card,btohqsg
Don't want risk it haha 😂 good luck to u better look for a replacement,btohqsg

Hi everyone  can I check the MCC on the airport taxes and surcharges on a miles award redemption?,btohqsg
Okay so it’ll be SIA  online category?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone knows this?In the previous UOB One Big Savings Payout T&C  my earmarked period is until 16 Sep. To “prepare” for the next quarterly promotion  does it mean I should start to empty the account from 01 Sep onwards and I will also transfer the earmarked amount once it is released on the 17 Sep. Is that right?,btohqsg
Assuming same as the Q3 promo  by right cannot have any transaction in Sep (30 days before 1 Oct),btohqsg
For existing Accounts  the Incremental Fresh Funds must result in at least a corresponding increment in the Account’s day-end balance throughout the Promotion Period AND Earmark Period as compared to the Account’s Monthly Average Balance for March 2024. - do you mean this clause?,btohqsg
I am curious would they be so stringent on this. Logically they could but it's a risk we have to take.,btohqsg
What is the risk? The earlier credited cash credit amount being clawed back?,btohqsg
No he meant literally the funds should not be moved in Sept. Not too sure how are they going to enforce it or check.,btohqsg
Yup I remember this but still curious haha,btohqsg
