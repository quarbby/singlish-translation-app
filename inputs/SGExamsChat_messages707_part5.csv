@xtrleso even if your friend is the perfect applicant  if there are 5 other people with the same profile as him (Im assuming Asian Male) he is likely not gonna make it because US schools like diversity,btohqsg
For Cambridge especially. My brother got 3H2 A plus H3 distinction and got inside Cambridge,btohqsg
a lot of them are genuinely insane,btohqsg
If you’re talking about UK unis wise then it would be of more help there than other places,btohqsg
Like Cambridge they insist on 4H2,btohqsg
H3 merit/dist can be used in lieu of one of the H2s,btohqsg
But if like for example Olympic swimmer + Ipho medalist then has a good chance at MIT (not guaranteed),btohqsg
So even though my brother got h2 math B he could still get into Cambridge,btohqsg
yup just uk... my goal in life is immigration to europe and uk is the closest there is. i cant speak other european languages besides english so the uk is the best shot i have,btohqsg
i saw a hwachong girl linkedin (she got accepted to harvard yale and other us uni) her portfolio is INSANE,btohqsg
all the best to whatever you are trying to achieve as well :),btohqsg
Oxford only requires 3H2 A tho,btohqsg
it’s an expected thing for those in the states shooting for those schools but it’s not as common here so it looks even more insane to us,btohqsg
But given how the pool of applicants is likely going to have very strong ppl those with 3H2 A and no H3 won’t stand a good chance,btohqsg
why does oxford allow for 3h2 A for cambridge requires 4h2 A?,btohqsg
Don’t know. Cambridge probably just favours their local students more,btohqsg
They just require A*AA or A*A*A depending on the college in Cambridge the course,btohqsg
That’s why if your friend wants Oxbridge might as well take uk a levels,btohqsg
and tbf she does actl come from quite a well to do background so she had the resources to get all those ECs (not denying her hard work but yeah),btohqsg
But uk a levels has multiple examination boards and he has to do his/her research,btohqsg
isnt uk a levels easier than sg a levels?,btohqsg
more broad content but less depth,btohqsg
There are stories of ppl who get like C for h2 math go take uk a levels and got A*,btohqsg
your pfp is so cute by the way! what kind of stuffed toy is that? :0,btohqsg
can only answer for bio and not other subjs but uk alvl has physio topic in their alvl bio while sg h2 bio is mostly molecular bio,btohqsg
My econs tutor also boasted that after seeing their a level syllabus he could go there and offer tuition with a guarantee of a refund if his students don’t get A or A* lol,btohqsg
oh jeez... must be a lot easier,btohqsg
I heard it rly depends on the exam board and subject,btohqsg
Some exam boards have easier papers for some subjects,btohqsg
But I don’t exactly know how it works,btohqsg
is that why sg always tops the world in PISA tests?,btohqsg
I also don’t get why there are multiple for the same qualification,btohqsg
On Reddit I’ve seen some ppl saying the f math papers from some exam boards are harder than sg,btohqsg
But overall basically should be easier,btohqsg
oh wait. uk also offers fm in their 6th form a levels?,btohqsg
Not sure how their sch years work sry,btohqsg
I only know they have AS levels and A levels,btohqsg
for example i looked at the uk alevel bio syllabus from 2025 onward   homeostasis is in their syllabus but it isnt in sg alvl,btohqsg
im not sure either... i heard from my relatives that theirs is y12-y13 (our j1-j2/y5-y6 for ip students),btohqsg
Yeah I think it’s called advanced subsidiary. It’s like half of a levels,btohqsg
I forgot the exact details too,btohqsg
you can treat it like h1 but not really,btohqsg
more ppl take fmath in uk alvl than sg,btohqsg
Students usually complete A-levels in two years. In the first year  you study the first half of the A-level  which is called the AS-level. In the second year  you study the A2-level. Your combined result from both years is your A-level grade.,btohqsg
cause iirc fmath is a hard requirement for some uk uni courses,btohqsg
but some of their fmath topics are in sg h2 maths,btohqsg
while in sg h2 math is enough,btohqsg
Hmm it would be strange that the uk a level fm paper from some exam boards are supposedly harder than sg’s,btohqsg
if im not wrong some uk unis computer sci has fmath as hard requirement,btohqsg
yep but i think if you took h2 fmath they'd also like it,btohqsg
