and my household uses a lot,btohqsg
How many peeps in your hsehld?,btohqsg
sgexams attracting more n more adults for some reason,btohqsg
U get a interest free loan for like 4 years,btohqsg
yala cuz price of water increase by 30% liao,btohqsg
i wldve gotten a loan if my parents allow,btohqsg
well there's that but my family abuses aircon like mad,btohqsg
Does going uni guarantee better pay?,btohqsg
1) u will forget your stuff and lose motivation to study if u wait2) no interest3) u start off earning more,btohqsg
starting yes20 years later may or may not. Depends,btohqsg
yea a lot of people that decide to work first then study later end up never doing it,btohqsg
Because some lecturers in poly claim people should go and work first then let their companies sponsor further education,btohqsg
It helps their GES numbers if u did so.,btohqsg
masters is ok to work first if you want,btohqsg
no point. Days of cheap $$ are gone,btohqsg
masters for certain industry aso not much use,btohqsg
but bachelors is becoming more and more of a basic qualification alr,btohqsg
But I want to do research or academia field.,btohqsg
without it you hit an income ceiling quite fast,btohqsg
How high is enough education? Masters? PhD?,btohqsg
want go academia just skip masters go PhD for STEM,btohqsg
ik some ppl even before they finish undergrad they got offered a phd position ah so,btohqsg
this sort of thing if you got questions i can try to answer ah,btohqsg
also a matter of whether u can pay/will someone sponsor u,btohqsg
PhD should NEVER be self sponsored,btohqsg
And which branches of study are good?,btohqsg
like even my current supervisor straight up told me,btohqsg
don't do it if you can't get funding,btohqsg
there's a ton of funding available so,btohqsg
i mean academia side within STEM it's not that much different,btohqsg
no i mean in general for doing a PhD,btohqsg
no one should be doing a PhD out of their own pocket,btohqsg
Yeah but I feel more funding is available for STEM research,btohqsg
Thats why would translate to more intake ig,btohqsg
Because some lecturers studied business  computer science and psychology for their bachelors  masters and PhD respectively. Not sure whether same branch is better or branched out,btohqsg
it's gonna be dependent on the prof's funding yea but STEM also gets more applicants anyway,btohqsg
What does stem stand for again?,btohqsg
comes down to end goal. but advice is to not tunnel vision on one specific role for research,btohqsg
honestly some ppl do phd in different fields cause they just like it,btohqsg
phd is a passion thing bc financially doesn't make sense,btohqsg
I see. I want to major in behavioural econs. Does that count?,btohqsg
or they just want the Dr title,btohqsg
Especially for non STEM we like those people,btohqsg
For me I find it a very interesting subject,btohqsg
it's not STEM per se but as far as non STEM stuff goes  econs is decently well funded,btohqsg
Haha  asking here cus my parents don't support the idea of going uni. Hopefully can get a scholarship,btohqsg
altho i don't see a value in mba lor,btohqsg
like why don't your parents want,btohqsg
Lol I'm still in poly and my parents alr getting me to pay them $500 rent and fund myself,btohqsg
They wanted to tap into finance world,btohqsg
