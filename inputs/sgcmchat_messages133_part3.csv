but if it is that's neat.,btohqsg
Nope regular comp with 50 jahre badges,btohqsg
Keep ur opinions to your self,btohqsg
Then y do they still work till today,btohqsg
It’s not the they can be sports cars it’s the fact that they can destroy cars like lambos ect. And that JDM cars have sooo much they can be done to them for example you can’t put a 2JZ GTE twin turbo on a Porsche 911 GT3 RSThe thrill of the JDM cars is that you can fuck around and mess with the engines to make it faster or build it to a specific category (drift  drag  street ect) but if you buy a GT3RS the engine is alr built the more you fuck with it it defeats the purpose of the car and the way it’s built ( not saying that GT3RS can’t be built),btohqsg
tell me you're 12 without telling me you're 12,btohqsg
i am a JDM enthusiast as well,btohqsg
but saying that they can beat supercars is a massive stretch.,btohqsg
requires a fuck ton of work,btohqsg
a 3RS is already practically perfected from factory,btohqsg
which country are we in now?,btohqsg
trust me  i have friends who throw a fuck ton of money to make their cars half decent,btohqsg
japanese cars are easy to mod,btohqsg
but throwing a fuck ton of mods together haphazardly doesn't make it fast,btohqsg
just because your GTR has 1000whp doesn't mean it's a go-anywhere  do anything car,btohqsg
people overly worship JDMs. they have their limits.,btohqsg
The toyota wish can fit groceries,btohqsg
as a Probox enthusiast i will vehemently deny,btohqsg
also please fill me in on why the A80 and 2JZ is so adored,btohqsg
they fucking threw out the 2JZ in favour of a 3SGTE for the GT500s,btohqsg
which means the 2J is arse,btohqsg
Laughs at boost leak on a 2jz,btohqsg
had a friend who owned a A80. sold it within a couple of months for a more livable TME Evo,btohqsg
the boost leak was the major issue,btohqsg
"B58s "" am I joke to you ? """,btohqsg

Someday I hope to own a b58 powered car,btohqsg
i've heard alot of good things about B58s. shame those are crazy expensive here.,btohqsg
If I could b58 swap my e93 I would,btohqsg
The problem with the current cars is that there's really no feel,btohqsg
indeed. they're just built to be fast.,btohqsg
So even with such a good engine the drive isn't very engaging,btohqsg
bring back no power steering 😗😗😗,btohqsg
Have parked with it and nearly died,btohqsg
You'll be covered in sweat every time you park 😂,btohqsg
i tried my friend's E30 in thailand  died while parking and creeping out of the lot,btohqsg
normally this is spam but it’s funny so it’s okay,btohqsg
Paul walker aint walking out of this one !!!,btohqsg
wasn't backing out from being a pedo either 🫡🫡🫡🫡,btohqsg
He walked out of this in a few,btohqsg
wasn't walking out of the porsche for sure,btohqsg
just realised that the Ineos Grenadier uses a B58. that would actually be pretty neat to drive.,btohqsg
Although if you really use it off road idk how the zf8 will handle it,btohqsg
doubt they'll ever be *really* sold here but would be neat to own one,btohqsg
i'm sure they tested the Grenadier to the extremes already,btohqsg
maybe more so than the Defender 😬,btohqsg
Looks like an interesting car to own,btohqsg
Although I don't think I could daily a high car,btohqsg
I tried some last week and I couldn't take the body roll,btohqsg
"if i'm not wrong the ""civillian"" variants are quite okay",btohqsg
