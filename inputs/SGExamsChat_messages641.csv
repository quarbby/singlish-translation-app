Mb I forgot it was only introduced sometime in the 2000s. Perhaps TJC campus had some extensions?,btohqsg
I unironicslly do not know a single bcmh student who did not get 90,btohqsg
COP is a popularity contest idea. There was once a school‚Äôs COP was x points  but actually only 10ish students in that cohort was x points; the rest were (x-1) points and below,btohqsg
No extensions in land area but random buildings sprouted out within the compound haha so the architecture was a mix of new and old and make-shift haha,btohqsg
Yeah I‚Äôm aware of that. But assuming all else remains constant the COP may fall with a reduced intake,btohqsg
Anyone here know the COP of Dunman and ACJC arts stream?,btohqsg
Dhs no clue  Acjc arts should still be 9 I think?,btohqsg
That is one factor. You can accept just 50 students but if the school suddenly turns really unpopular for some reason ‚Ä¶ haha or have more capacity but turned very popular because endorsed by Taylor Swift ‚Ä¶ hahaha,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said assuming all else remains constant,btohqsg
dunwoman high leh? Where‚Äôs the gender equality?,btohqsg
Ahhh yes yes. I missed that,btohqsg
Edit for missing onesDHS:Arts - 8  Sci -7TMJC:Arts - 13  Sci - 12SJI: 6,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs really hard to keep all else equal. Back to the example of TJ  now that they are located right next to a MRT station exit ‚Ä¶ not sure if that helps too haha I‚Äôm a practical person,btohqsg
Yeah I thought cj sci is worse than tm sci,btohqsg
No way TM sci score higher than,btohqsg
Hmm yeah idk what‚Äôs the intake for both,btohqsg
@PolarbearnextdoorCan i make it to dhs,btohqsg
Well  maybe catchment? With one sch shifted closer to TM  there is greater competition?,btohqsg
Anyway  all these are speculative talks,btohqsg
uh guys so what's the cop for tm,btohqsg
ya I was trying to see their website,btohqsg
Well well  whichever the final posting for you  always bring your own sunshine. Enjoy the orientation and new school year ahead~,btohqsg
so far only DHS TMJC SJI nvr say,btohqsg
one JC has to be the dumping ground for raw 20 ppl,btohqsg
Do u think appeal is like,btohqsg
Guys i have zoom in like 30min,btohqsg
also my friend and i got our desired subj combis ‚ù§‚ù§ jc is off to a good start,btohqsg
yeah IB getting more popular this yr,btohqsg
Guys Guys Guys Qs r based on 1st come 1st serve due to too many Qs some Qs can only answer on 1(4)February 2024 as I only can FilmüìΩÔ∏èüé•Maximum 2 hrs tututututtututu,btohqsg
What O level score is needed for NUS Computer Science?,btohqsg
is either a's or poly gpa,btohqsg
So why is it that my friend is telling me that she got into NUS Computer Science with only O levels?,btohqsg
No diploma or A level cert,btohqsg
Her GPA is just slightly below 4.93  if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
21/22/24/30with a standard deviation of 3.,btohqsg
Nope  she said she doesn't have a diploma,btohqsg
Just O level then straight to uni,btohqsg
I don't think that's how it works?,btohqsg
No but when I asked her about it,btohqsg
i don't think uni gaf about o's,btohqsg
And started saying a real friend wouldn't question her,btohqsg
some international students go to Uni after Sec school,btohqsg
I found her resume on some site too but it feels really weird,btohqsg
O levels then a 4/5/7/13-year gap,btohqsg
im so happy that i got my first choice jc combi,btohqsg
even though there was a 90% chance id get it,btohqsg
Does this mean she is an insane individual?,btohqsg
she probably did cs stuff since she was young,btohqsg
Does that explain why she gets so angry whenever I ask why she hasn't been in school for 4/5/7/13 years,btohqsg
Nope  I don't think she knows coding either,btohqsg
there‚Äôs alot of interesting people in the world,btohqsg
I hope there isn't anyone else like this,btohqsg
Even worse if they're trying to give advice to students younger than her,btohqsg
Would be pretty bad if they ended up like her (insane),btohqsg
i used to know someone who- Went to my batch (NA)- cracked at coding but had some behavioural issues- stopped coming to school in Sec 2- Repeated Sec 2NA- skipped whole of 2NA to move to Russia- Came back to SG due to the war- Disappeared,btohqsg
I just knew he was in Russia because he told my friends,btohqsg
Posted to arts stream still can go sci stream,btohqsg
No  based on merit. They will shortlist applicants after the deadline has passed and contact the shortlisted applicants.,btohqsg
The subject combi portal doesn‚Äôt differentiate between science and arts students,btohqsg
Honestly I don‚Äôt know of any cases of local uni accepting applicants with o level as highest qualification,btohqsg
I see. So does that make her a pathological liar?,btohqsg
feels more like tryna get attention lol,btohqsg
No clue  you should know your friend better than me,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs legit I think all those 6 nett ppl who got into NY arts but want to use the loophole will be damn pissed,btohqsg
I see  I think she's insane,btohqsg
Gonna appeal out or just suck it up and take hybrid,btohqsg
Oh ok lol I‚Äôm very sure she was just lying,btohqsg
my fren got in tjc sci,btohqsg
I just updated the missing ones here,btohqsg
Anyone checked this out? Seems like a pretty cool contest,btohqsg
What kind of eat do you think it is,btohqsg
again? us congress damn boliao leh,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thankful that I don‚Äôt live in any major American city,btohqsg
i wonder why some people want to emigrate to usa lol. other than pay differences,btohqsg
Non rivarous non rejectable non something,btohqsg
@mersculado you listen to ariana grande,btohqsg
fr imagine going there and getting shot on the street üíÄ,btohqsg
i swear my chem cher says the most random shit sometmes lol,btohqsg
"""green ppt slowly turns brown(fe2) is like sex change right?""",btohqsg
rhe fact tht they sell guns in walmart,btohqsg
did cjc‚Äôs sci cop decrease to 12?,btohqsg
I guess I‚Äôll wait and hear from others  if it‚Äôs true gg to those 6 nett who wanna switch to science,btohqsg
hi guys I got posted to MI how shd I appeal,btohqsg
ngl abt the same la hor,btohqsg
I dropped out 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
Everytime we touch i get this feeling everytime we kiss i swear i could fly,btohqsg
I should send this picture to josh,btohqsg
All the jc COP drop so,btohqsg
????? Basket I in MI dawg,btohqsg
josh aclty got in his psych course,btohqsg
Hearsay my snrs say some of our notes btr than theirs,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/millennia-institute-student-who-left-school-to-have-twins-resumes-studies-and-scores-four-as-at-a-levels4 POINTS FOR O LEVELS WENT TO MI???,btohqsg
Cause every time we touch  I get this feelingAnd every time we kiss  I swear I could flyCan't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to lastNeed you by my side'Cause every time we touch  I feel the staticAnd every time we kiss  I reach for the skyCan't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you goWant you in my life,btohqsg
She went to acsi but dl ib,btohqsg
Well id say yi retainee rate is quite high,btohqsg
hi I am appealing frm mi to yijc,btohqsg
tbf ejc q lax on retaining,btohqsg
You mean EJC retain rates so high,btohqsg
my batch had 682 students  40ish retainees i think,btohqsg
That's 1 in every 14 students?,btohqsg
my friends class had 4 retainees bruh,btohqsg
Ok then thinking about it similar to mine,btohqsg
in a class of 25 students they had 4 retainees,btohqsg
and they were estimated to be the best performing class (lol),btohqsg
That‚Äôs because she went to ACSi first,btohqsg
Once you enter a JC/ACSi/SJI can‚Äôt apply to another Jc via JAE ever again,btohqsg
Which is quite stupid imo  they should at the very least allow IB people to apply to Jc the following year if they want to drop out of IB  and vice versa,btohqsg
But then you can apply to MI during another JAE exercise even if you went to a JC  so I rly don‚Äôt get the logic behind this,btohqsg
The JAE portal will just show that you aren‚Äôt eligible for JC/SJI/ACSi if you try,btohqsg
If this rule didn‚Äôt exist she would‚Äôve have been forced to go to MI. I think she could‚Äôve still individually approached different JCs to ask if she can transfer  but perhaps it was too troublesome or there weren‚Äôt any vacancies.,btohqsg
But there was a student in my class who transferred to acjc at the start of term 2 in J1 after she found that the Ib course in ACSi wasn‚Äôt for her  I guess it‚Äôs because both Acjc and ACSi are related schs so they could make this arrangement,btohqsg
Well I found it out the hard way when I wanted to voluntarily retain but Acjc didn‚Äôt let me to cos no vacancies. I thought I could still transfer but unfortunately not lol.,btohqsg
Idk what's the retain rate for tm,btohqsg
But idt it's like that high cuz they legit,btohqsg
Even if like they prolly shldnt,btohqsg
i rmbr my year i think 60% of the cohort got a S or U for h2 physics/chem,btohqsg
its good if ur scoring Us,btohqsg
i rmbr my friend got best improved in cohort for physics,btohqsg
but still improved from U to U,btohqsg
she improved from 5.8 to 29.8,btohqsg
ik someone who purposely fked mye to get good progress award,btohqsg
but its cuz our prelims had practical,btohqsg
also it was a pri sch kid,btohqsg
yes it was back when there was mye,btohqsg
i forgot if its voucher or cash but yeah theres a reward and cert,btohqsg
I mean I got good prog,btohqsg
my school gives out like $50 per award,btohqsg
because my sch dh Edusave  award,btohqsg
Ironically comparable even though we're a 3 year course,btohqsg
Cause if so  HM I got one dumbass friend who keep saying they wanna dropout of MI to take  private As last year,btohqsg
Iestin is the sufferer of ntu physics now,btohqsg
Why am I being dragged into the spotlight U old fat fuck,btohqsg
this didn‚Äôt start out with it being anything bad,btohqsg
I will rip your oesophagus out,btohqsg
Please send all assignment answers ty laoda,btohqsg
i‚Äôm surprised you can spell oesophagus with your english,btohqsg
does YI offer 2 h2 sciences for comb sci students,btohqsg
You're so close to getting it done and over with,btohqsg
I mean  iirc they counted it as if >67.5  you eligible for local Us,btohqsg
Like that's just a weird stat,btohqsg
i got a1 but like idk if i go YI can do or not,btohqsg
If I was I wouldn't be in ntu physics :'),btohqsg
Y2 makes u wan to kill urself,btohqsg
I wouldn't doubt that  that's just our regular stat for almost every year,btohqsg
The comparison can't even be fair,btohqsg
If there‚Äôs one thing gg down is mi grades,btohqsg
We 3 years still get these kind of stat,btohqsg
By logic we suppose to do better,btohqsg
Wah I haven‚Äôt get my pw yet,btohqsg
But eh not bad what dailou,btohqsg
bro TM is 60+% but A only,btohqsg
you can find si Yan for me and beat him up on my behalf,btohqsg
It's bad lol only reason why I can go uni is because my H1s carried  my H2s are abysmal,btohqsg
I actually haven't talked to him irl before,btohqsg
He only invigilated one of my mid terms before,btohqsg
Is the level 3 toilet still stinky,btohqsg
Omg idk why a few days ago it's under maintenance,btohqsg
End up only L2 and L1 need use,btohqsg
last year got condom or Smth iirc,btohqsg
Welp ig it didn't spread that much as I tot,btohqsg
I only heard about a couple called mustard and ketchap,btohqsg
I think they cover up bah,btohqsg
I really observe and hear alot,btohqsg
I actually used to teach a MI senior geog,btohqsg
at least it means you saw me before,btohqsg
If there‚Äôs one thing that y3s know,btohqsg

GO DROWN IN YOUR PHD SHIT,btohqsg
So the suicide molest and all,btohqsg
what did siyan ever do for you,btohqsg
everyday im happy i didnt take physics,btohqsg
idk how my friend enjoyed physics shes doing it in ntu rn,btohqsg
but she hates her coursemates cuz they keep asking her to do her work for them,btohqsg
So it happened when I was y1,btohqsg
cause I just entered pu2 this year,btohqsg
i think cuz shes thriving (tbf h3 physics was too easy for her so im not rly surprised),btohqsg
So much shit happened within the span of one month,btohqsg
why got fieldpack/assault bag in the bottom right cornor,btohqsg
Welp ig my life is peaceful,btohqsg
I hated physics in mi so much I'm doing it now,btohqsg
idk i met a ntu physics professor in a very weird situation,btohqsg
Aite I'm coming over to erase it,btohqsg
when u peeing and have small chat w the prof isit,btohqsg
Tbh I wonder if moe asked them to patch it up  it would be strange if ny principal decided it on his own accord,btohqsg
I just know for orientation week last year   got one snr tryna hit up on a jnr,btohqsg
it‚Äôs on my tablet too but if you delete my work,btohqsg
Dude and my friend tells me tea wtf,btohqsg
My friend is the kind who knows tea,btohqsg
jokes on you my tablet isn‚Äôt an ipad,btohqsg
By hook or by crook  imma delete all the shit U cooked,btohqsg
I thought Mr Low was only there for like 6-7 years,btohqsg
This is the same for all schs,btohqsg
Before you do that can you send me all his answers over the years first,btohqsg
Anything to help out an alumni,btohqsg
Bruh I hope it wasn‚Äôt the new principal who changed it then  if not it may be a sign that he intends to scrap more stuff that makes nyjc appealing,btohqsg
Spms be notorious for reusing assignment questions anyway so I bet his still works,btohqsg
which ones would you even need rn lmao,btohqsg
Truth is we are the bottom,btohqsg
Ngl idk why but it's kinda funny asf for rand to say that,btohqsg
wasn‚Äôt complex methods assignment two just released,btohqsg
No idea what I'm learning in complex methods... something something branch point,btohqsg
i feel this fit gonna be hot af,btohqsg
NYJC PRINCIPAL IS PANG CHOON HOW,btohqsg
Eh mi principal is now the acs baker?,btohqsg
Oh actually ps2 assignment would be nice too cough,btohqsg
If u did Smth is wrong,btohqsg
Sometimes I miss tanwanyu telling us to reconsider the mi route,btohqsg
bro hes gonna turn NYJC into another hwachong,btohqsg
he gonna turn it into a zhongguo wansui kinda sch,btohqsg
eh Idh enough shit and fks to give,btohqsg

Ye I know if u said Mrs Tan,btohqsg
WTF YALL CALL HER MRS TAN,btohqsg
No way you don't know her full name,btohqsg
That's a rite of passage for all mi students,btohqsg
I JUST ENTERED MI LAST YEAR,btohqsg
Eh does mi still have conditional promotion,btohqsg
Hello! Has anyone here completed / is currently doing theWork-Study Diploma / Work-Study Post Diploma / Work-Study Certificate?I am doing a project and am looking for people to do an online interview with. It takes 30 minutes and pays 10 dollars!,btohqsg
no la he ask whether u grad alr,btohqsg
Hopefully they still allow hybrid with arts then,btohqsg
Some schs hybrid is under science stream,btohqsg
i always just thought this was the case,btohqsg
For TM it depends on the H2,btohqsg
If U 2/3 H2 R under arts,btohqsg
Theres lore behind why i said that but idw share,btohqsg
Nah some other JCs they just need you to take at least just 2H2s for the stream you‚Äôre in,btohqsg
For Acjc you can enter arts and take 1H2 sci and 1H1 sci  if 4H2 can be 2H2 sci 2H2 arts,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said some schs,btohqsg
DUDE WHERE DO I FIND SUCH FUCKS TO GIVE,btohqsg
just don‚Äôt be npc can alr,btohqsg
Some of DHS art stream combis listed here are also hybrid. For example: H2 math  Econs  geography and H1 chem,btohqsg
That's Right.If My Fans defend 4 me Admin Ban them.Admin anyhow BAN ppl,btohqsg
Why isit that everytime I need justify things aren't racist cuz Indian people say they are racist,btohqsg
So my division is giving a 0.5day PM OFF next friday to everyone cuz CNY eve  then they want everyone else to clear 0.5day AM OFF next Friday to not come camp (cause got division exercise going on) If don't have OFF use leave.All the indians in my office say it's a racially motivated move to force people to take AM LVE on that day,btohqsg
this is just another instance of microaggression where we as the minority have to do what the majority tells us to because of the decision they all in all likelihood made BECAUSE it is the eve of cny,btohqsg
They ignore the fact that all the Chinese people also have to waste 0.5day leave on this as well and their rationale is (oh it does not affect you as much),btohqsg
Funniest part is one of our superiors who approved this isn't even chinese,btohqsg
And when I raised this up they say,btohqsg
"""I like how yall just reduce him to just being an encik until it's a way to validate racism""",btohqsg
Just ask him to stop whining and take MC,btohqsg
My argument is its more of a lack of connection between regulars and nsfs in comparison to it being a race thingThen I raised the counter example of how Chinese nsfs do not get offs for Hari Raya eve or deepavali eve and stuff like that when they are all already promised a half day off. Apparently those situations aren't racist even though they operate on the same principle of majoritarianism,btohqsg
This is so stupid tho  the half off is non transferable anyway,btohqsg
They can justify why Chinese people should not get a half day off the day before minority holidays on the principle of pragmatismBut they use racism to justify why non Chinese people (when in actuality everyone is affected) when people are forced to take leave on a majority holiday eve,btohqsg
"""ill reformulate my opinions when i get the full picture""""but it definitely doesnt seem very fair right now regardless of whether the lack of equitability is of the race flavour  the majoritarian flavour or something else""",btohqsg
Should revoke the scholarship at this point,btohqsg
lj liddat just give off la,btohqsg
this one not fucking BMT hv to use off one,btohqsg
Scdf pes E lol best NS life I could possibly ask for,btohqsg
Basic training just 5 days and all stay out,btohqsg
Idk why they can't just give a full day off,btohqsg
Need to turn it into some problematic ass shit like this,btohqsg
The thing is I can understand why people think it is racially motivated,btohqsg
But I feel that there is insufficient data to prove that it is racially motivated,btohqsg
Their only evidence is its on the eve of cny,btohqsg
Dw its some rich Indian kid from india whose dad makes like 10K/month,btohqsg
Damn  he should‚Äôve given the chance to someone else then,btohqsg
This is what happens when paper qualifications triumph everything,btohqsg
I think an A for GP should unironically be a requirement for PSC scholars,btohqsg
Tbf that's cause meritocracy is kinda fundamentally flawed,btohqsg
And the purpose of scholarship is to award merit not necessarily to help people who are poor :/,btohqsg
So like idt there's anything wrong with them getting the scholarship,btohqsg
Just that their argument against me isn't the most logical?,btohqsg
And they don't really attack the crux of my perspective :/,btohqsg
idts  more like commanders dw them at camp on fri cuz they also off on that day  without thinking abt the consequences of making them do so,btohqsg
Lol I didn't get PSC cuz they said they couldn't hear me,btohqsg
They called me back to explain to me why I didn't get the scholarship,btohqsg
Then told me to reapply this yr,btohqsg
(I lost my voice 2 days before),btohqsg
Definitely should try again then. I think a person of your calibre is worthy of it,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt want to be bonded Ah,btohqsg
They give me such a shitty reason to not give me a scholarship why should i waste my time on them,btohqsg
At the end of the day it's their loss not mine,btohqsg
And its not like I can't just reapply somewhere else :/,btohqsg
90Rp I alr have nus merit anyways,btohqsg
Hi guys what should I do now that I accidentally hit myself with a badminton racket cause I failed serving üò≠,btohqsg
