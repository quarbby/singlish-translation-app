But buyer simply will not pay as they judge based on historical price,btohqsg
i like to call it MISMATCH of expectations,btohqsg
Yes perception gap between buyer n seller,btohqsg
So I have 2 choices 1) keep my car and drive or 2) scrap,btohqsg
I choose 1 as my cost is cheap relative to current price,btohqsg

Thanks all for your help. At least we knew there will be issue pertaining to this matter.,btohqsg
No la. Don’t know u copy from who. This is a oversimplification n misjudgment. Stock rims designed to meet general standard only.

Got any good deals for Vios (XP150 2018-2023) model?,btohqsg
And like to ask what to take in mind considering this particular Vios’s problems?,btohqsg
It’s the car CDC uses for Class 3A learners.,btohqsg
Question is... why vios? 13k depre for this car is absurd when theres so many other brands out there,btohqsg
Maybe I had a liking to it when I drive it during practical lessons at CDC,btohqsg
Only 3 other cars I’m looking at which are all learner cars. Can’t look to BYDs for first cars- Honda Jazz/Fit- Honda City- Hyundai Kona 1st Gen,btohqsg
Agree. Why is even a vios so expensive? 🥲,btohqsg
Buy car only need to see 3 things. Upfront and monthly if u can afford it ma.Then after that you see the coe/depre see it make sense ma..,btohqsg

there's also other things to consider when considering the car lor. If it's in good functional condition as everything is working normally. Critical areas like brakes  hydraulic fluid  power plant  chassis condition and so on,btohqsg
Maybe with a downpayment that is below $40 000 and montly cost below $1100,btohqsg
I seen vios and jazz within that bracket,btohqsg
Bro all these is assume to be known de,btohqsg
Before u even buy a car. Pls send for PPI also,btohqsg
No PPI. No buy. Thats my rule. If dealer don’t let me send. I don’t buy.If dealer don’t accept my conditions for PPI  I also don’t buy.,btohqsg
Your down payment $40k and below $1.1k can get u a nice car that is better than vios,btohqsg
Go find a nicer car la bro. Vios don’t drive alr.,btohqsg
U drive for family or work. Got kids?,btohqsg
Most importantly. Don’t take this advice. This is a bs advice 😂,btohqsg
Same range lel. If ure looking at this series. Take Toyota for reliability and fc.,btohqsg
Bro. How about just go test drive,btohqsg
Go test drive. Otherwise. Take Toyota for all time favourite,btohqsg
Then I go for Vios lor  I’m familiar with it and had been driving in CDC for past few months,btohqsg
Only thing is quite hard to find a community for this Vios,btohqsg
Shd be easy la. Go fb or what.,btohqsg
Soon to take TP test. Won’t be driving on roads so soon. But I know the Vios is decent for even a learner.,btohqsg
Anywya. I seldom see vios on the road now. City and jazz also lesser alr.,btohqsg
Now ure new so ure stuck with Vios 😂,btohqsg
There’s also one more car I had been interested lol,btohqsg
Kona 1st Gen Electric which CDC also have,btohqsg
After you got license just go walk around the automobile megamart in ubi and test drive a few,btohqsg
dont forget maintenance cost  insurance and road tax,btohqsg
Maintain your car well  don't screw it  the car cost be fine. The majority of the cost is how much u pay for it,btohqsg
What nonsense advice u need today,btohqsg
Ok. In tht case  please buy a driving school Vios,btohqsg
Anywya. Jason is very senior in this group. Try to read between his lines he is trying to convey something logical.,btohqsg

anyway.. do yall buy detailing equipment like vacuum  brush  those products to clean the interior of the car?,btohqsg
Or yall send to detailers to do for you and if so how much for interior detailing?,btohqsg
Use the $1 carpark vac and plastic shine,btohqsg
Buy car limit to driving school models? Thats new 😆,btohqsg
Give chance. Cos thts e only one of the few cars he touched,btohqsg
His choices all driving sch cars,btohqsg
My learning car in cdc was Honda City,btohqsg
I also ended up buying Honda City,btohqsg
Nothing wrong with driving sch carsss,btohqsg
But u explore first  keep other cars in mind also. See which suits u best,btohqsg
Got 1 colleague c I drive nice car  then say to me “u show off what u lack.”  then I reply “I show off what u lack.”,btohqsg
Vios is a simple car that gets you from point A to B. Audio quality is good and ur average petrol run costs $65+ after SPC and card discounts,btohqsg
Can look for VOGS and get their opinion and lobang if you are considering,btohqsg
Vacuum u can use those small portable ones like Eluxgo.. Sometimes i bring it down to vacuum the car.,btohqsg
Interior i pay ppl to do,btohqsg
But my interior vacuum do in JB once a week so...,btohqsg
That time I go hydrowash detailing,btohqsg
neutral parking brake - shift to park,btohqsg
Wah I better practice this too,btohqsg
No hand brake  no gear shifter how,btohqsg
Dunno what is hand brake anymore,btohqsg
Electronics shifters with electronic parking brake,btohqsg
Jeez... u can only drive so many cars in a lifetime. Pls don waste it by driving vios,btohqsg
Same 13k depre can get vezel. Much better drive and interior. Definitely make up for the toyota reliability. Problem abt buying this type of cars are that the mileage might be tampered due to it being a common phv car,btohqsg
For press button do we still need to follow the neutral parking brake - shift to park,btohqsg
U ask those who invent the steps,btohqsg
Same ppl who ask u off aircon  before u shut down the car and ask u warm up engine for 10mins before driving,btohqsg
And rev it before moving off,btohqsg
no idea if actually NEED to  but i still do in my 2023 vezel,btohqsg
I think this is quite crucial for old cars. Actually when i spoke to the service ppl  they said newer vehicles less impt but is good to do,btohqsg
Also driving without AC saves fuel,btohqsg
If u back all the way to the stopper  shifting to neutral release the vehicle being engaged in a pushed up position against the stopper,btohqsg
So when u engage P  it will be in a more neutral pos rather than it being cramped up against the stopper forcing the brakes in a engaged position,btohqsg
Ok thanks for for sharing experiences,btohqsg
The rules of automotive aerodynamicsBy bending the rules of aerodynamics  automakers can create low-drag cars that slice through the air  which in turn help improves efficiency.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 AMG reviews,btohqsg
But if u shift forward after hitting stopper  then is ok to engage P as theres no pressure on the rear wheels/brakes,btohqsg
Electronic brake n traditional hand brake same?,btohqsg
at long traffic light - have to put to neutral - hand brake on - then don’t step the brake will cost more fuel and damage transmission oil,btohqsg
Sg traffic light nt long enough to affect leh i feel,btohqsg
When I drive to work. Got 3… so total 6 min waiting alr. Sad,btohqsg
The neutral then P is not really for the gearbox but the parked position after u off engine.,btohqsg
Auto brake hold w auto start stop how,btohqsg
Think this is referring to manual cars? No idea abt this but doubt it will make any diff. Nowadayd all cars using electronic brake. Those still using handbrake r old cars. Any problem also can happen lol,btohqsg
Start stop is good if theres long period of stoppage. If turtling  better off it. Will harm the alternator if keep on off on off instead of saving fuel,btohqsg
traffic jam for example  every 30 secs move 1 car length  that kind of thing,btohqsg
Those slow traffic lo. Keep move a bit stop move a bit stop,btohqsg
Ermm not auto-hold? Need to step on brake?,btohqsg
I don’t use auto hold as I like the car to move when I lift my legs off,btohqsg
Not all cars have brake hold isnt it? I know mercs have. What else ah,btohqsg
So got hybrid car  this no longer applicable le?,btohqsg
Korean cars have. Jap cars have,btohqsg
Auto engine start stop is different frm auto brake hold,btohqsg
Cause I got many long traffic light so don’t know what’s the best way,btohqsg
Like engage auto hold  or neutral and engage elyrocnic brake n release brake?,btohqsg
I will never understand anybody who spend 100k on COE and buy a 10k car,btohqsg
Cannot find video on their TikTok,btohqsg
Nice. But as usual  KM specs r rubbish,btohqsg
The Ehev city rs will hit the sweetest spot,btohqsg
The hatchback city rs also a sweet car,btohqsg
As in foot brake hold. Not the button 1,btohqsg
Means when u stop. Press brake harder the car will auto hold brake for u without u doing anything. I noe i asked kia before they don have this feature. Neither does toyota nor honda have,btohqsg
Toyota Chr has it. Honda Stepwagen has it,btohqsg
Half the time the salesman dunno what they r selling,btohqsg
I ask honda salesman  city rs 2 discbrake and 2 drum brake?,btohqsg
But the car on display has 2 drumbrakes,btohqsg
CHR has it?! Then why does rav4 not have it? It is so much more expensive...,btohqsg
This 1 is what? Brake hold or start?stop?,btohqsg
Newer models maybe? But the 1 i referring to is using brake. Not buttons like the mercs type,btohqsg
Just press brake harder can auto hold le. This type still need press button kinda lame?,btohqsg
Its button to activate the hold,btohqsg
U nvr press  the hold wont work,btohqsg
U can on or off it,btohqsg
Oh.. then that makes more sense,btohqsg
Weird my inlaw rav4 doesnt have this button,btohqsg

They will tell u check w LTA,btohqsg
Ahhh I guess it's diff for cars..Okies👍,btohqsg
Ur car need to be present there w the mod installed then they will tell u legal or not,btohqsg
Tedious process for mod to be approved,btohqsg
Copied frm online1. Proposed xos system must/should be certified by the manufacturer to be suitable for use in that particular vehicle model. Very important step IMO.2. Send for emissions and noise testing with TUV certified labs with a sample of the xos fitted onto the particular vehicle model like what Krado mentioned. There is obviously a huge amount of money to pay here  and it is a business risk that any workshop has to decide whether to go ahead with it or not. From what I previously saw on LTA's website  there are only a handful of labs in the region and the nearest one is in HK or something.3. Send test results to LTA for review and approval. This is the part where it gets tricky. If LTA rejects the results  then the workshop that paid the monies for the testing will lose all of it for nothing.Long story short if u want something approved by LTA. In this case  an exo tht is nt appoved on a particular car and yours being the first car w the exo,btohqsg
Partly reason why popular n exp cars have more approved mods to play w,btohqsg

Ermm why from COE become election 😂 I don’t think govt really have any power to control demand and supply.,btohqsg
so dont tell me they cant control demand and supply. they cant control demand is more appropriate.,btohqsg
It has to be scientific. Set by them doesn’t meant figures can be pluck out of thin air,btohqsg
nvr disagree with that. i just say they cannot control demand and supply is incorrect.,btohqsg
i believe they can play with the principles or economics,btohqsg
LW is an economist  he knows full well how to play invisible hand,btohqsg
I doubt even if opposition take over  they can make much difference. Only way is to make singaporean poor again since up transport choices doesn’t curb demand. 😂,btohqsg
How can they control supply and demand?,btohqsg
actually no need to make sporean poor la. the coe thing is mainly due to policies,btohqsg
release the ABSD  let the papa and mama can invest their retirement fund to buy property themselves,btohqsg
eh wait im correct  supply is under LTA discretion. Demand isnt. demand is from us HAHHA,btohqsg
now most simply pump the surplus into property registered under their child name,btohqsg
child can buy any more house they buy new car,btohqsg
house price go up not my issue,btohqsg
car price go up is my issue,btohqsg
is the quotas  they allocate number of quotas. They can control the quotas,btohqsg
quotas is just a number la. important is teh purchasing power,btohqsg
if u think young chap has no money to come out with new car...u be wrong very wrong,btohqsg
those pieces only not even 1000 hor,btohqsg
thats why lo quota control by them ma,btohqsg
They alrdy doing u a favour by giving u future dereg coe,btohqsg
Wa bro i think this is a problem😂😂,btohqsg
U wait somemore  u can forget abt buying cars,btohqsg
Borrow from future plock it here now also risky,btohqsg
By 2030  majority of the lines r up,btohqsg
even if COE is 1dollar  the quotas is fixed,btohqsg
They r going to make COE explode so u r forced to take public,btohqsg
2025 onwards the COE is going to rocket,btohqsg
Actually it’s obvious LTA wants to keep prices stable at around 100k,btohqsg
Using future quota so price won’t suddenly drop with excess,btohqsg
I got a polo for 2 yrs now  love it. Left 1 year coe  renew or not? but then can topup a little bit to get golf COE car and renew at same price. how?,btohqsg

life is short work life balance,btohqsg
I would prefer golf once your driving skills have improved you should try better cars.,btohqsg
golf has really good features  worth the above average price,btohqsg
i would say for all the bad rep golf gets  it is really an enjoyable car to drive.. or maybe.. ppl shud just maintain their car better..,btohqsg
