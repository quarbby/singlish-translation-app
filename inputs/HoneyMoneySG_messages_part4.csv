Credit cards for Fresh Grads:The ideal card will change over timeBut what will not change is:I just want to clarify as a fresh grad with new access to MONEY  first you have to determine your spending pattern  and that takes months.You could easily start with UOB Absolute AMEX + Grabpay to get up to 2.9% easily  while discovering your spend pattern in progress.Meanwhile  just sign up with the best new signup offers (Citi  DBS  SCB  using my affiliate links of course üëç). You don't have to spend on these cards (unless the tncs require you to)  just cancel after a few months to fulfill their tncs  rest for 1 year and get new signups again!,btohqsg
(is it possible to turn off the new joiner notification? cuz I believe there will be a lot of new members to join  so better to avoid the notification floodüòÅ,btohqsg
I think Rose is fine  as she would recall welcome messages in a few minutes,btohqsg
that's sad... but just according to my experience in other groups  some bot can automatically delete these messages,btohqsg
that might be a solution  although you cannot disable it  you can let a bot delete it,btohqsg
haha  thank you Chris for accepting my suggestion üòÜ,btohqsg
Not sure if its working though even if i enabled all,btohqsg
I'm sure we will have new members soon  so just wait and see if it works then,btohqsg
hi chris the latest video on hdb 2 room flexi flats for singles are quite informative. Just to share HDB in a email said it would update the status of application by early sept 2021. Previously was 1 year ! let me see if they indeed improve the customer experience.,btohqsg
Great to hear that üëçIt's honestly tough work for hdb staffs during this period. I could imagine the amount of questions and complaints they receive daily.,btohqsg
Good stuff Chris. Enjoyed your content on endowus,btohqsg
You piqued my interest on moneyowl tho,btohqsg
I might just go straight to moneyowl. Was almost ready to set up with endowus,btohqsg
Yeah MoneyOwl is really good deal for first $10000 with no fees! Above that amount then we can look at Endowus,btohqsg
