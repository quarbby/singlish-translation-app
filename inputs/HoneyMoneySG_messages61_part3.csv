Oh no‚Ä¶ so actually they apply the refund minus amount to refund month? üò± Pls keep us updated once any updates. Thx üôè,btohqsg
Banks usually count posting date instead of transaction date  for example  transaction at 30 June but posted at 1 July  then counted as July transaction.,btohqsg
Applies to the month of refund. E.g. Canceled July purchase and Received refund in Aug $50  need to spend $550 to hit the $500 requirements in Aug,btohqsg
Same rules apply to EVOL cash back also ($600/statement month)?,btohqsg
Hi! New to the CC game. Where do I check the exact date my card resets monthly for earning boosted points?,btohqsg
Isnt that clear that you can‚Äôt get interest on your july spending as such,btohqsg
How can it accrue to your june spending. Sounds quite silly,btohqsg
Insurance and Telco  Amex TCB. Telco  SC Simply Cash. All 1.5%  might have others higher for Telco.,btohqsg
how about tax? all the ipaymy etc doesn't seem to worth it,btohqsg
Tax payments with processing fee seems more for miles card  as 1.5-2% cashback cards can barely cover the fee charged.,btohqsg

Anyone knows for lady‚Äôs card. What‚Äôs the miles per dollar for spending beyond the first $1000?,btohqsg
Paid $83 500. Withdrew $37k before.Now account value is 75k inside (inclusive of bonuses). If surrender will only have 21k cash value,btohqsg
Coz it‚Äôs airticket‚Ä¶ can split payment.,btohqsg
did u try solitaire my friend w like 70k income managed to get it,btohqsg
If not urgent then try should be able to get card within a week,btohqsg
I recently made a MYR charge (haircut) on Maybank FnF and it is reflected under other spending. Wouldn't it be eligible for 8% cashback under MYR spending? Min spend has been reached,btohqsg
Oic. About 30% loss. Then you need to see if you can make $25k using $$58k in next many years.,btohqsg
Category fulfillment and the MYR promo are 2 different things. If you spend at Msia supermarket  it will fulfil your grocery category.  you will see a separate MYR CASHBACK row later in the month,btohqsg
Hi  can ask if cimb 3.5% rate is for 6 months only?,btohqsg
The haircut charge is not part of my 5 categories so will I still see a separate MYR cashback row?,btohqsg
According to the CSO  he said that it will still fall under other spending but for the MYR transaction 8% cashback will be applied which I find the application process quite weird,btohqsg
Yes. I have a MYR charge which is outside of my 5 cat too. And I got the MYR cashback separately,btohqsg
Ah ok. I guess it‚Äôs not reflected for me yet as per the screenshot,btohqsg
In the statement itself.. it‚Äôs a separate promo,btohqsg
ahhh the cash back is reflected in the statement not in TREATS app,btohqsg
Hi all  I just receive my uob debit card. But I do not have an acc for their tmrw app. Will they give me or I need to register myself?,btohqsg
by the way  if you surrender and get 21K  and put it in any blue chip US stock  GOOG or MFST  SPY or maybe even TSLA for 24 years  what do you think are the returns?,btohqsg
Not sureü§£ can‚Äôt tell for sure,btohqsg
Do excel  compare the projections for the ILP vs you buying the same funds using platform like ifast/poems.See worth to surrender or not üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi all  I‚Äôm planning to get an everyday card to get 4mpd. Will you guys recommend Citi rewards + amaze or HSBC revolution is better? What are their pros and cons,btohqsg
Hi anyone know where to check which transactions qualified for the cashback for uob evol?,btohqsg
I know amaze has no Apple Pay  HSBC revolution can use Apple Pay?,btohqsg
citi reward MUST pair with amaze card in order to get the full potential. In addition to that travel and hotel is excluded from reward  so you have to use a secondary card to cover that. The only reason how Citi Reward + amaze could be better than HSBC is you go overseas very often and you use Citi reward + Amaze for overseas spending...,btohqsg
Previously Amaze unofficially allow users to add the card to Apply Pay. But they quickly revert back. So now at we least know it's on the way  not just say say only.,btohqsg
"And one important thing to take note. This overseas spending would work because Chris calculated his cost per mile to be 1.25 cents per mile. So that worked out to be 5% ""cashback"". As Amaze has about 2-2.5% spread. That's how he still able to earn ~3% with amaze on overseas spending. So in order for you to benefit from citi reward + amaze  you need to calculate what is your CPM.Watch this video to find outhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faKTziNGHGI&t=417s&ab_channel=Chris%40HoneyMoneySG",btohqsg
That‚Äôs including the ‚Äúcashback‚Äù from using amaze card overseas from points accumulation?,btohqsg
If you really want to surrender policy  can try approaching those companies that buy over Ilp. They may give you more than the official surrender value from the insurance company. I did that once  with a prudential policy..,btohqsg
hi hi! sorry am new to all these  wdym by buying over an ILP?,btohqsg
sorry to butt in. But recently one agent of my wife introduced some form of unit trust kind of product which gives out dividends on monthly basis with sales charges of about 2.5% which actually we can purchase the fund itself thru poems or other platforms.However after asking more. It seems nowadays ILPs had been repackaged kind of into so called unit trusts purchases and FOC rebalancing with the insurance company itself that is managing?,btohqsg
Which company did u go to? I asked. Mostly they take life insurance,btohqsg
No company take over ILPs. Only life insurance,btohqsg
Think they sell ur units to keep paying 'dividends'. Investmentmoat has an article on it  u can read it to find out more. And even if u wan to buy  dont buy from agent or bank. Go through endowus. No sales charge and lower recurring fees,btohqsg
Thanks. Yah was thinking about the downside of it.,btohqsg
Buy from endowus  they give you back the trailer fees and charge you a fixed fee that is lower. Every time I get charged by endowus and then see that the rebate I get back is higher than their charges  I feel good.,btohqsg
Any credit card or banks offer 0% interest instalment payment of insurance premium (annual lump sum kind)?Previously POSB Everyday card was offering‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Will I get 6mpd if I use UOB ladys and pay using NTUC app?,btohqsg
Charel  what was your takeaway answer? Haha,btohqsg
Should be   but usually I pay with mobile contactless,btohqsg
