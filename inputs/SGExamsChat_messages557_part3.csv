nah i know its not ok  but as many say 1.7k is like bottom of the barrel type of salary,btohqsg
like kuro is alr so depressed,btohqsg
Thats why the income is 20.4k but bank only has 16.32k..Because of cpf,btohqsg
The expenditure i choose was $20 a day for food and $50 a month for medical,btohqsg
this is just the stats of a single,btohqsg
Yeah Ryan u only live half the age of 45 eh,btohqsg
Now u might not be tired,btohqsg
But once u go out there,btohqsg
But at 45 years old its the price to buy a 5 roomIf you want a 3 room  its possible 10 years before at 35 with HDB loan which just so happens fit directly into the govt plans,btohqsg
at least im somewhat planning for a future,btohqsg
but yea this will def be better,btohqsg
i accounted that for the fact you have 1.7k a salary for 20 years,btohqsg
others have told me to start with 2k as a starting salary..even,btohqsg
im ready to yeet myself of earth,btohqsg
@SagenanamichinesBruh my calculation had a fatal error lmao,btohqsg
I overestimated my income by 8x and underestimated my expenses by 8x,btohqsg
I saw 720K on food i was like,btohqsg
yep did the maths  after 20 years..you will have around 200K in your Bank and 160K in your CPF,btohqsg
u forgot to account for inflation,btohqsg
Fixed it  inflation was accounted for by 1.7K a month for 20 years,btohqsg
I don't see the price of the hdb,btohqsg
they have money..tf im giving them money  i mean if i dont rent i got a extra 200K im saving..if they need some i can give them,btohqsg
i mean yea but like i said..if i decide to stay 20 years with my parents..i got enough money to spend on them,btohqsg
the idea is solely off CPF you can get enough money to get a 2 room at 35 with grants,btohqsg
Maybe it is slightly faster with a raise,btohqsg
housing price inflation isnt regular inflation,btohqsg
ur hdb is gonna cost 1mil+ in 2040 lol,btohqsg
singles can only buy a 2 room from the govt...they dont need a 4/5 room,btohqsg
im talking abt 2 room hdbs,btohqsg
unless you talking resale..which make no sense,btohqsg
cos saf is filled w skivers like@chemcer,btohqsg
1 mil for a 2 room...inflation struck harder than hong kong,btohqsg
they shld pay nsfs more ðŸ‘¿,btohqsg
20 years ago the 4 room HDB im in now was at 250K+,btohqsg
The same type of apartment fully furnish cost about 700K-800k now,btohqsg
So a 3 room in 20 years..prob would be like the cost of a 4 room now on resale,btohqsg
red flags study/teach/cleanse themselves in physics everyday,btohqsg
just reduce that by 25% and youâ€™ve got green flag,btohqsg
but its gonna rise back up,btohqsg
@chemcerCan you make a NS version of this copypasta,btohqsg
How to avoid telling people my major?When people ask me what my major and school is  I'm hesitant to say. It's probably rare for them to be graced with the presence of a student at the top cs/ engineering school (NUS) in singapore  the no.1 in Asia. Especially a cs major  the major with the highest cutoff and the most prestigious program at said school. I feel a bit guilty  as meeting someone so much more accomplished  yet their same age  probably crushes their self image.How do you guys go about avoiding the question  or what other major do you usually say?,btohqsg
1000pax get into nus cs every year and this guy wants to flex,btohqsg
How to avoid telling people my rank?When people ask me what my rank and formation is  I'm hesitant to say. It's probably rare for them to be graced with the presence of a graduate from the top most elite Officer Cadet School in singapore  the no.1 in Asia. Especially a commando officer (Lieutenant)  the appointment with the highest cutoff and the most prestigious program at said school. I feel a bit guilty  as meeting someone so much more accomplished  yet their same age  probably crushes their self image.How do you guys go about avoiding the question  or what other ranks do you usually say?,btohqsg
by the time we reach 45,btohqsg
wait kenna medical stuff then how,btohqsg
then if you want to start a hobby,btohqsg
itâ€™s not feasible to live like this,btohqsg
8.6K a year$700 a month to spend on whatever you want after accounting for expensesFood is counted at $20 a day  $600 a monthMedical is at $50 a month,btohqsg
@immaslothWith Rent  your Bank balance is like 5k after 20 yearsIncluding Insurance  it will cost $24K...Means you are in the negativesWithout Rent and living with parents is like 86k after 20 years,btohqsg
