Hi~ any bro/sis got call from uob to do ‚Äúbalance transfer‚Äù ( can‚Äôt remember the exact terms) from cc at the rate of 2.x %?  Wondering if it‚Äôs a good idea to‚Ä¶ since now a lot of high interest deposit accounts available .,btohqsg
Your rates seem to suggest that you‚Äôre looking at the wrong direction. SGD->USD,btohqsg
As long as you‚Äôre aware that the rate quoted is always meaningless and only the EIR matters. Pretty sure it‚Äôs almost always going to be above 5%.,btohqsg
Can share why is it in negative position? Due to the fees or?,btohqsg
Hi  is there a way to tell how much u spend for online and mobile (separately) for UOB evol card?,btohqsg

quick Q abt IBKR - is it better to convert US$ in my own bank first then TT to IBKR - or just transfer SGD first and do the US$ conversion on IBKR directly? so far i‚Äôve only deposited US$ via TT once and there‚Äôs about US$40+ fees. however when i checked the IBKR conversion fee for SGD > USD  it seems much less attractive (0.715) vs. the bank (0.738). any advice appreciated to reduce costs in the long run. tyvm!,btohqsg
Hi can I check amaze link master card earn insta point rate is 0.5 per dollar?,btohqsg

any idea if xnap transaction is counted for the above dbs promo,btohqsg
I doubt u r looking at the rate for the same instance  or maybe the bank rate u see is just indicative,btohqsg
unfortunately that‚Äôs what is shown when i was about to convert and i compared w the rates on UOB hence i‚Äôm confused. ;(,btohqsg
i‚Äôve converted many times on UOB and the rates are transparent and direct. so i‚Äôm quite shocked by the wide gap between UOB & IBKR when i cross checked at the same time.,btohqsg
Hmm if i alr have 80k earlier  then cant qualify for this new one?,btohqsg
That was not what I u derstood.  I was told can withdraw and participate.,btohqsg
Ibkr should be cheaper. I compared with dbs earlier,btohqsg
Anyone apply uob Kris flyer card recently... good?,btohqsg
Topup 50k for 5.8% for 80k in 60 days,btohqsg
anyone knows why when topping up petrol need to tap card twice ?,btohqsg
FWIW - i called Moomoo to ask about if I already have $80k subscribed  rather than the top up cases which keeps getting mentioned here. Topping up doesnt make sense in my case since the promo is capped at $80k. The officer asked me to withdraw my $80k after the previous promotion ends  withdraw it  click on the events banner again then redeposit the $80k to qualify for the new one.,btohqsg
first is to register which bank card use  second is the payment,btohqsg
can i tap with UOB one for the discount  then use UOB lady for the payment to enjoy 6mpd ?,btohqsg
if u are using uob lady just tap with uob lady  the uob one discount dont work the way u think,btohqsg
Did u ask if withdraw to universal account is acceptable or must withdraw to bank account?,btohqsg
didnt ask. to play safe  can withdraw to bank?,btohqsg
How do we know we have completed the 30 days period? Is there any indicator show?,btohqsg

One way is to wait for the top up to come,btohqsg
