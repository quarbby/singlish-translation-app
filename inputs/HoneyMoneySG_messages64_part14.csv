So even i leave the account at $0  that is fine right? And i wun incur a fall below fee?,btohqsg
Can check this article by Bino (iwander)https://iwandered.net/best-mooncake-2023-singapore/,btohqsg
Actually last time my joint account dropped to below 200K  as I moved my investments to my single name acct. the other joint acct holder was charged $50. Had to call RM to appeal.,btohqsg
CRMC Amaze if u willing to forego UOB Lady's (since u mentioned about not wanting too many cards),btohqsg
Is UOB ONE on Apple Pay?,btohqsg
yes  no fall below fee. But u still need to fulfil the total relationship balance which I assume is transfer $15k as salary monthly (can transfer out),btohqsg
u mean the credit card? yes is on apple pay . i use it on a daily basis,btohqsg
I see... got it thanks alot!,btohqsg
Hi all  I intend to charge in-store purchase through Kris+ to Google Pay which is linked to UOB Evol. Is that considered online or contactless? 🤔,btohqsg
that card i'm absolutely not sure about it lol. i dun have that card lol,btohqsg
Good for insurance and transport I guess,btohqsg
transport i think UOB One CC better haha,btohqsg
Provided if insurance allow payment using AMEX,btohqsg
using apple pay on shopee counted as online or contactless ? or contactless just means paywave?,btohqsg
I see rebate for transport 1.7% for UOB Aboslute  but N/A for UOB ONE.,btohqsg
UOB One CC got extra cashback for simplygo and also for grab... so yeah,btohqsg
Contactless means you tap your card or phone against a terminal and it beep beep,btohqsg
Transport as PHV or bus/MRT? For bus/MRT cannot tap AMEX cards (UOB Absolute is AMEX),btohqsg
I think UOB One higher. 3.33% +5% if u hit min spend haha,btohqsg
Got diff cat for min spend? Very high le like that wow,btohqsg
min spend for UOB one is by tier de ... $500/1000/2000,btohqsg

"Hello  can I check for Maybank family and friends card  malaysia ringgit spend is additional category? For example if I pump petrol and did not select the ""transport"" category  will I still get cashback for malaysia ringgit spend?",btohqsg
Hi guys  I recently bought from an online overseas website. The MCC is digital goods. Can I link this with Amaze + Citi Rewards to get miles? Is it considered under online spending? Any advice would be great. Thanks.,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is trust bank and youtrip foreign currency spread?,btohqsg
Don’t have so no idea  maybe someone can answer,btohqsg
generally around 0.8% off spot  you can use the mc/visa currency converter pages to get an exact amount,btohqsg
But u still need to hit the monthly 800 spend requirement,btohqsg
I see. Does the Malaysia ringgit count towards the $800 minimum spending?,btohqsg
Can I check whether anyone has tried buying Disneyland Japan tickets from their website using amaze + citi rewards? Is it considered travel mcc so using hsbc revo more worth if amaze + citi rewards doesn’t work?,btohqsg
