Are you interested in pursuing Medicine?This post is for everyone interested in studying Medicine in the future  but mainly aimed at those in JC2/Poly. I created a Discord server back in2018/2019for JC/Poly students interested in applying to Medicine. I advertise the server every year during the admissions period and we have had 4 batches of applicants. Here are the posts from 2021 and 2020.The purpose of this server is to bring together Medicine applicants to tide through the application process together. Applicants will also be able to clarify any queries with the seniors in the group who are currently pursuing medicine (they were the applicants who joined the server in the previous years  we have a few doctors as well!)Everyone is welcome to join! Even if you aren't applying this year  I suggest you join and take a look if you're interested :-)Link:https://discord.gg/bCmUdjkInstructions: When you join the discord server  please read the instructions and get a role or you wonâ€™t have access to the other channels.,btohqsg
