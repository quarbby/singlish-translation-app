Same question for SRS (account with DBS),btohqsg
the only way to invest in the S&P 500 using CPF is by using Endowus which allows you to invest your CPF balance into LionGlobal infinity US S&P 500 Stock Index Fund which tracks the S&P 500.,btohqsg
Thank you  is there a YouTube tutorial on this? I tried but they created a portfolio with amundi funds instead,btohqsg
The Amundi Prime USA Fund is an SGD-denominated unit trust that tracks Solactive index  with a fund-level fee or total expense ratio of just 0.05%. You can invest in it using cash  CPF  or SRS. Solactive US Large & Mid Cap Index spans the biggest 530 companies in the US  and closely tracks the performance of both the S&P 500 index and the MSCI USA Index,btohqsg
Just choose fund smart for the portfolio then select your preferred fundhttps://youtu.be/it7ymAYMjJU?si=koyxKMmmMWEwQk51,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can advise me? Trying to set up card up recurring payment for my insurance premium.. if let‚Äôs say my premium start every 1st in the month  and premium paid to date is 01 Jan 2024.,btohqsg
Is there a way for my wife to transfer her CC earned points into miles into my krisflyer account? Reading up that it‚Äôs not directly possible..,btohqsg
Any good promo for SC card ?,btohqsg
I mean new sign up promo,btohqsg
UOB ladys. I know OCBC/SC allows,btohqsg
Uob don‚Äôt try. If audit  your kf account will be suspended,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the amount? If small they usually don‚Äôt check,btohqsg
Just look for the most recent premium invoice and use that as a reference (add a month and minus few days). It doesn't matter if you paid the premium few days earlier  they will consider it as paid once the actual premium date comes.Last monthly repayment just put when you intend the repayment to actually stop.,btohqsg
HiHow about using dbs cpf oa? Any advice/ sharing is appreciated üôè,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt make sense for it to be such a big deal also.. just trying to book the flight together,btohqsg
Briefly read up bout this. This is just using your own account to book a ticket for someone else right? Not pooling miles into 1 account.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right. Redeem into her kf account. Ask her nominate you,btohqsg
Polling is not possible. Another way is to buy your own miles. Nowadays can buy easily,btohqsg
I see  but before I set up in cardup  do I have to log in to pruaccess for example to change the payment mode first ?,btohqsg
Definitely.. easiest way is to switch to giro then cancel giro on the bank end  then it'll become cash already.,btohqsg
The best investment is invest in yourself,btohqsg
Before all these  do a financial check on yourself first. Important is what's your current lifestyle budget  what are your expenses and how to cut unnecessary spending.If you intend to be passive investor  look for index funds  ETFs instead of picking individual stocks. Set aside small amounts now to dollar cost average. Increase the amounts once you have an income.Don't rush  time in the market is always better than timing the market. Don't let emotions sway your decision to invest.Don't fall into the trap of lifestyle inflation. You don't need that latest phone your friends have  you don't need to attend every outings your friends ask you to. Just budget yourself well and pay yourself first.,btohqsg

Hi all  would like to get some opinions on accumulating vs distributing ETFs. Distributing sounds attractive  but if I invested in accumulating ETF and just sold some shares when prices reach an amount I would be happy with  would that be a similar comparison to receiving dividends?,btohqsg

so their limited time promotion has been so for at least 6 months? haha,btohqsg
