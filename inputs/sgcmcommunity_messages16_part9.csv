Cupra. I wonder how long they can last,btohqsg
Actually a lot of people know of it,btohqsg
It was a part of SEAT back in the day  acted as their AMG/RS/M  then it became its own brand using the SEAT cars and selling as a performance variant. They are sold out of the SEAT dealership itself,btohqsg
actually Cupra Leon is quite good  gives an alternative to the Golf GTI.Might love the Cupra Leon abit moreü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
Precisely  they are similarly priced as well and the Cupra Leon actually offers 55bhp more than the GTI and they use the same powertrain essentially.,btohqsg
Since the Tiguan R isnt arriving in SG  glad we still have the Cupra Ateca,btohqsg
We also have the Leon Sportstourer and the Formentor,btohqsg
there's no direct comparison on offer as such apart from the octavia rs which is a sedan,btohqsg
If the mazda 6 wagon 2.5NA selling less than 200k then it is a good deal,btohqsg
isnt it selling much lesser than that?,btohqsg
Tempted on that but the road tax,btohqsg
pretty good I guess for what you get at that price,btohqsg
Haha still okay la  2.5 and 2 is not tht big of a difference. I think CX5/M6 and above need the 2.5  2.0 really abit weak,btohqsg
Additionally its NA  cant tune or anything,btohqsg
M6 need tune if not slow,btohqsg
but for tuning  anything with forced induction is preferred,btohqsg
how do you like getting gapped by 1.0 turbos,btohqsg
M6 warranty over put in a turbo,btohqsg

around 2019  there's such offer when many mazda 6 were used to ferry delegates,btohqsg
