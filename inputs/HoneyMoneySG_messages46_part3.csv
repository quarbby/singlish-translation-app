Hi All  need your advise and thank you so much taking time reading this. Anyone are foreigners but holding a sg credit card? I have a Philippino friend who is getting a new home. She will spend alot on big items. She is working in sg. Also her expenses in sg is very minimal. So perhaps after buying all big items she will back to her usual spending pattern and preferred no minimum spending.,btohqsg
What is your question? üßê u got credit limit just use lah,btohqsg
She wanted to apply a credit card in sg that has no minimum spending and yet will earn some rewards to spend on big items for her house in Philippines.,btohqsg
Any recommendation of which card to get?,btohqsg
Any idea when HSBC revo bonus points will be credited?,btohqsg
Mine still seem like 1pt per dollar,btohqsg
For ocbc saving account such as 360  can we set sms notification for incoming $ such as salary,btohqsg
Noted u r quite specific in the purpose for the ocbc titanium (new notebook). U might want to apply one last time and specify that u ask for $5000 credit. If that doesn't help  see other card bah,btohqsg
How can you check if your card is still earning boosted points? Example Citi rewards is 1k monthly cap for 4mpd. How to know if you‚Äôve already earned the max  since not all transactions will earn 4mpd.,btohqsg

going down to the branch wont do anything because the application is reviewed by a credit department and branch has zero value add to you. banks will never let you know the reason for rejection  so have to just move on,btohqsg
Ocbc cards damn hard to get,btohqsg

was thinking of changing $5 to get the scratch card then realised that the exchange rate need 19500 capital stars (worth $19.50) to get 750 KrisPay miles (worth $5). Hope it's not my math got problem.,btohqsg
