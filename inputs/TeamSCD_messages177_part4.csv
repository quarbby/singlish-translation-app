This one is because you uncle also,btohqsg
Guaranteed you go cycling  back also will pain,btohqsg
It's just a number... You see you still yp,btohqsg
Who the fuck is this. Where is our friend Roi,btohqsg
My foldie feels more comfortable then the flat bar road,btohqsg
The fame has hit him hard,btohqsg
Its really just the seat to bar  height and so on,btohqsg
The distances on your foldie are better for u that means,btohqsg
I feel the handle distance also matters,btohqsg
The vertical height from pedal to seat to bar. The horizontal distances,btohqsg
These days the bike just leave as a display piece,btohqsg
But the kick scooter is in the car,btohqsg
If really doing distance cycling the seat forward/back slide will be adjusted also,btohqsg
Last week I flew off due to wet surface,btohqsg
My cheapass decathlon road bikes are parked outside the flat,btohqsg
Stupid floor  hit brake it just slide... But that one my fault,btohqsg

The $370 maybe a bit heavy. But still,btohqsg
Brompton can catch up with mountain bike  feel like Conti of all bicycle,btohqsg
That's because mountain bike meant for mountains üòÅ,btohqsg
Mountain bikes are not fast bikes,btohqsg
A lot of resistance when rolling  also their gearing is not for speed,btohqsg
But they are the most cushioned ones,btohqsg
Brompton use road tyres  and the gearing more for speed,btohqsg
Commuter bicycle cant be compared with MTB,btohqsg
U try cycling both up a hill,btohqsg
Brompton easy up hill very fast,btohqsg
But grass Brompton need dismount HAHAHA,btohqsg
We are thinking of different hills,btohqsg
Foldies in a proper setup are not inferior to road bike actually,btohqsg
