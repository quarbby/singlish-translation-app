"Keith Toh  a partner at Novo Tellus  a substantial shareholder of ISDN  answering investor questions during ISDN's 3Q20 update call:On Novo Tellus selling some ISDN shares and buying back some later: ""Our approach to investing is very clear and very consistent which is  we back companies with very strong long-term potential and we're long-term investors -- that's never changed. We always reserve the right to run our trading operations the way we do but I have one job as a member of the board of ISDN  which is to help the company build as much long-term equity value for all shareholders as possible. Our strategy in that respect has not changed for ISDN  has not changed for Novo Tellus  and certainly has not changed for me and my team as we work with the company to build ISDN for the long run.""On how the partnership works: ""We have a deep respect for CK‚Äôs (Teo Cher Koon) long experience with the company and the industry and so the way we have built successful partnerships are really around that kind of mutual respect. So we bring ideas to each other  we discuss them together  we make decisions together but we typically won't try to come and  you know  force our view. It's been a very good process that's beginning to bear fruit we think in the performance of the company.""Can Novo Tellus persuade ISDN to give forward guidance the way AEM does? ""What's most important to us right now and one thing we're quite proud the company is accomplishing behind the scenes is that ISDN has been consolidating its financial systems. Christine has done a lot of work with the team to roll out an ERP to consolidate financial controls and administration around the region for ISDN and that provides the company with better controls obviously but more importantly a more agile view of what's happening in the business. Together with that there's a roadmap for rolling out an upgraded CRM system so we understand our customers better. That really is the critical infrastructure for making a decision on whether to provide forward guidance or not. You know  I'm not going to pre-empt whether we will do that in the future -- that's up to CK and the board.""",btohqsg
ISDN could be the next AEM the way i read the report,btohqsg

Recent data points support ISDN‚Äôs optimismrecord2020As China accounted for c.64% of ISDN‚Äôs 9M20 revenue  recent positive economic data bodes well for ISDN‚Äôs potential performance in 4Q20F.According to data from China‚Äôs National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)  industrial production grew 6.9% yoy in Oct 2020.Within industrial production  manufacturing grew 7.5% yoy and within manufacturing  production of new energy vehicles rose 94.1% yoy  while production of microcomputers and integrated circuits grew 28.0% and 20.4 % yoy respectively  as China stepped up efforts to grow its domestic technology sector.We think ISDN will be a potential beneficiary of this trend as the company  being Singapore based  is a neutral party in the US-China trade dispute and also  ISDN‚Äôs products are non-US in origin.,btohqsg

Reiterate Addwilliamtng4.14William Tng  CFA.We reiterate our Add rating and target price of S$0.65 based on 12x (46% discount to peer average) FY22F earnings.We believe ISDN is on track to deliver a 5-year record high revenue and net profit in FY20F despite the Covid-19 pandemic.Potential re-rating catalysts for the stock could come from stronger-than-expected sales orders for its mainstay industrial automation business and profit contribution from its hydropower segment.Downside risks are order delays  cost overruns in its hydropower business and a prolonged Covid-19 outbreak.,btohqsg
