Onsen town i would reco toyako / noboribetsu  they also hv onsen hotel (w onsen tax),btohqsg
Yea they charge onsen tax (iirc $300 per person),btohqsg
So it is wasted if u dun use their onsen facilities in the hotel,btohqsg
kinda crazy I usu nvr do planning B4 one,btohqsg
Tokyo easier to deal w I feel,btohqsg
I planned the last 2 jpn trip and ya had some screw ups,btohqsg
Prolly cuz at least kinda got go b4,btohqsg
Also more similar to sg in a sense?,btohqsg
I was there 10 days and only managed to cover half or less of hokkaido,btohqsg
We prolly don't go to alot alot of places,btohqsg
Just pick and choose some good ones then slowly vibe,btohqsg
Cuz we don't like to rush ard,btohqsg
Erm definitely tokyo and kansai trains are higher level than sg,btohqsg
This is a part that is different between me n my familyðŸ¤£,btohqsg

I went Taiwan for 1 week. Literally went to 1 7-11,btohqsg
Oh mine i also took overnight flight,btohqsg

I did not really sleep on my flight  but got really tired in my 2nd leg fr hnd to hkd so somehow managed to fall asleep on my 2nd leg,btohqsg
I went to more family Marts but still it's like 15-20 convenience stores,btohqsg
Not really but i think tourists attractions there include onsen  hell valley  jidai date village,btohqsg
I think i cannot convince my family to go japan at least for 1-2y,btohqsg
Hokkaido is also pretty good to go during flower blooming season in summer tho,btohqsg
Im salty this yr i miss the peak blooming by a month,btohqsg
In fact a few days coz now it has more flowers alreadyðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
that â€˜s true. I visited twice,btohqsg
Definitely hokkaido cannot compare to kansai and tokyo for number of tourists,btohqsg
Yea but it is also a nice place to visit,btohqsg
I hv not covered the northern half of Hokkaido,btohqsg
And i would want go furano again during peak blooming in july,btohqsg
do u get around by train or car rental?,btohqsg
Yea i took a domestic flight fr tokyo (even ANA does not fly direct to Hokkaido coz i think not as demandful as some other areas),btohqsg
In hakodate we use the city tram then rented a car  drove down fr hakodate to sapporo  then in sapporo we take train / tram  and 2 day tours out of sapporo,btohqsg
A boo boo is uk the japan expressway has got a digital speed limit sign  so we were following that  then realized how come cars ard seem to be driving faster  are they speeding,btohqsg
Then I googled and realized the speed limit is for heavy vehicles not normal cars,btohqsg
And the speed limit is actually 100kmh,btohqsg
I think they assume everyone knows,btohqsg
But ofc im not the one driving  it is my dad,btohqsg
but during winter   hokkaido speed limits seems to have reduced,btohqsg
I hv a driving license but i think lemme master my driving in sg firstðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
ah but it â€˜s still a good exp nvrtheless,btohqsg

Im actually looking out for japan companies in sgðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Oh there is a japan bank in sg??,btohqsg

the only diff is they donâ€™t do consumer banking,btohqsg
Mutiple lmao the biggest one is probably MUFG,btohqsg
There are 10365 employees w singapore airlines as of linkedinðŸ˜±,btohqsg
