"This was a Singapore taxi ""queue"" at changi airport",btohqsg
^this is why fares at changi from taxis are so high,btohqsg
sometimes drivers can sit and wait in the queue for hrs,btohqsg
Changi airport has always been infamous with a taxi queue tho..not new,btohqsg
However..the worst offender is this taxi stand in bugis,btohqsg
So what ‘s the topic now? Fried Chicken or Taxi?,btohqsg

Ya if you fire extra rounds than what the instructor said then db,btohqsg

I also had one b4 but the mo see that he got very good ippt and some uniform group smth then ask if he wants pes E or b4,btohqsg
Bro I am just saying what I know,btohqsg
Alright so not very common ah,btohqsg
its always based on the condition and how the MO evaluates ur pre enlistment medical,btohqsg
theres not many things that declare alr guaranteed u get x pes,btohqsg
The practice of down PES cos of sexuality is based on an outdated definition,btohqsg
That treated it as a medical condition,btohqsg
guys you wont believe who just dmed me on insta,btohqsg

I bet she’s hiding here somewhere,btohqsg
Slay I only got twice in my lifeSec 4 was scholarshipSec5 was merit busary,btohqsg
Ya pri sch me ego inflated,btohqsg
Got knocked down real quick when sec sch come,btohqsg
Wah then he's rly quite the cheebai,btohqsg
Who urm were toxic to me la,btohqsg
I got 237 then dudes like,btohqsg
it's my middle finger to them tbh,btohqsg
It's cuz I mugged quite abit,btohqsg
btw this is smth I wish I didn't do,btohqsg
I kinda wish I had more fun,btohqsg
But at the same time ah,btohqsg
I wouldn't be whr I am tdy without effort la,btohqsg
Oh bruh my sch got quite extreme examples,btohqsg
Ya prefer to not say here,btohqsg
Oh wow I shouldn't be here. Everyone here is so smart 😅,btohqsg
Doesn't matter + pri sch means nth,btohqsg
No? I am not smart I just work hard,btohqsg
My psle made me irritated I got 199,btohqsg
Aiya psle don't matter tbh at least all of us tried so....,btohqsg
I had a friend who got a score he considered poor and went into the stream he didn't like at first he didn't care about tscore but after spending time in his sec 1 class he got tired of the environment mugged and promoted,btohqsg
Now he is one of the best in his current class,btohqsg
Wow great achievement for himI think it's becuase the idea of not doing well for psle has made him more motivated to do well in sec sch so he will not leave another regret in life .,btohqsg
Own goal still not a good reason though ☠,btohqsg
lol I slapped someone in assembly in sec sch,btohqsg
just cos he was an asshole,btohqsg
we met again in uni year 1,btohqsg
because it was trendy at that time,btohqsg
she played everyday with her friends,btohqsg
Also I like how y’all talked about psle,btohqsg
I’m the no 1 hater of it,btohqsg
idk how but she told me she got addicted to it,btohqsg
Literally me except I didn’t flex,btohqsg
because eveyrone else in my class was getting 240-260,btohqsg
I use myself as an example of how the system is broken,btohqsg
my fr got 261 and went ri,btohqsg
the next time i saw him he was talking about how he learnt high level physics,btohqsg
ok but there were also outliers,btohqsg
even though the diagram wasnt drawn to scale,btohqsg
each one has a grade from f-a*,btohqsg
i thought math can get a*,btohqsg
HAhaha I got one a* three cs,btohqsg
feel like I’ll sound like I bragging lol,btohqsg
only studied for science out of interest and I’m not joking,btohqsg
i think its more of the meritocracy issue,btohqsg
do results look at the effort we put in?,btohqsg
they  wan u to be well rounded lor,btohqsg
to me it’s that they are telling you how much potential you have at the age of 12,btohqsg
When most people haven’t fully developed their capabilities yet,btohqsg
It rewards the people that develop things earlier,btohqsg
not all ppl have a knack for studying tho ...,btohqsg
you don’t need a knack for studying to do well in psle is the thing,btohqsg
but the answer is that yes we are meritocratic but the method they establish merit at that age is flawed,btohqsg
in fact it’s way too young to use merit,btohqsg
i feel like i didnt even know what i wanted to do at sec 2,btohqsg
263 in psle -> 67.5 RP in A levels -> first class uni -> PhD,btohqsg
Take a guess when I started taking studying seriously,btohqsg
"sec sch me : does bad for humanitiesthe sch: ""we cant give u sci stream cuz u failed ur humanities  u will be put into humanities""",btohqsg
everyone has a few (or more) toxic behaviours in general,btohqsg
it just depends how well they manage it,btohqsg
"my core geog teacher: ""hi ____'s mom  can you get your daughter to drop out  shes getting f9 and all the f9 students already dropped out but her""",btohqsg
my geog teacher always told us to strive for a1,btohqsg
she dc ah i was also rebelious,btohqsg
then she said that every day,btohqsg
is it in sg as well ah,btohqsg
and whenever she entered the class she said 'hungry(for geog)! its geog time!',btohqsg
I feel its a common trend,btohqsg
But tbh no matter where u go,btohqsg
The top 10% are all always gnna be diff,btohqsg
i see  im not in sg but intended to go there  i heard stories of how their finance industry is very competitive,btohqsg
Finance here is extremely limited and extremely small and interconnected,btohqsg
Most finance ppl know each other,btohqsg
Coz the circle is that small,btohqsg
my friend did his coding project in 7 hrs hoping to just pass n got 97,btohqsg
i want to yeet him off this sch,btohqsg
When u see ppl more talented than u working harder than u,btohqsg
hard work beats talent until the talent works hard,btohqsg
when u see people more talented than you working smarter and not harder than you,btohqsg
Im just taking solace that she probs will die younger than me,btohqsg
I’ll die younger than most of y’all,btohqsg
I also expect to be bald by my mid 30s,btohqsg
i think u will cry the day u lose hair,btohqsg
Can’t have bad hair day without hair,btohqsg
i think i have a possibility ill die mid 30s so,btohqsg
My hope is to not die before my gf,btohqsg
i mean mine is other than that ah,btohqsg
reminds me of a certain someone lmao,btohqsg
SO SORRY  OH MY  MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES!,btohqsg
I’m at 5-6 people by now,btohqsg
what the fuck 263 in psle????,btohqsg
dw before I kill myself I'll change my bio,btohqsg
I couldn't even get 25+ for psle,btohqsg
Have yall see before people emitting steam after their 2.4?,btohqsg
Like legit can see steam from their head,btohqsg
What you see is called mist,btohqsg
in fact i think 260+ for psle is more common than 90rp,btohqsg
which is also again not that rate,btohqsg
I see around me people left rite centre 90rp wtf,btohqsg
basically everyone in ri hci rgs nygh r >260 for psle,btohqsg
i say basically everyone becos there r ppl who dsa and dont hit 260,btohqsg
this adds up to about 1600,btohqsg
compared to 90rp which is about 1000 in total,btohqsg
yea my sec sch was a lot of people 260+ too,btohqsg
mine dunman high btw. less than like ri and hci but still,btohqsg
est maybe 1/2 of DHS is 26+?,btohqsg
but dunman not that many ppl,btohqsg
my year the cut off is 260,btohqsg
basically all of ri hci rgs nygh get 260+ for psle,btohqsg
WAIT this only for raffles and hwachonh,btohqsg
true but theres a ton more who get 260+ but no 90rp,btohqsg
I think that's the thing that takes away most 90rps,btohqsg
so boom ur down to 25% of cohort,btohqsg
then some people get fucked by PW,btohqsg
1 of them will fuck you over,btohqsg
have seen of people getting fucked over by all 3,btohqsg
as long as you need to write essay,btohqsg
hence don't take subjects that need to write essay,btohqsg
I'm still confused as to why there's essays in h2 bio,btohqsg

As in I'm loyal like a dog to SG but I still want to play a role in shifting the culture,btohqsg

Rare SG police cars: SPF Land Rover Defender 110 with a soft tarp,btohqsg
"collectors? idk  there is a term called ""Asian land rovers""",btohqsg

I just saw Dover poly ig,btohqsg
but i only take 6th off,btohqsg
No wonder got red camp every year sia,btohqsg
ig i go np for free shit if i got time then,btohqsg
each poly got diff strengths and shit,btohqsg
i went to this shady af korean shop earlier,btohqsg
the grape juice was in between the alc,btohqsg
i was questioning whether i accidentally bought alcohol 💀,btohqsg
Walau that's so impossibly general lol,btohqsg
If you want the answer the best polys by cut off on avg per course isSpNpNypTpRp,btohqsg
Wait how do they grade RP people,btohqsg
I actually said to myself while doing Os that if I do bad for Os and I’m only eligible for RP courses I’ll retake O levels,btohqsg
all ik is nyp’s engineering sucks ass,btohqsg
Need another number than can add,btohqsg
maybe pocoyo has another sim card,btohqsg
I see  which poly is preferable for engineering? Which has high number of graduates proceeded to uni,btohqsg
I once deleted account then create a new one using same number,btohqsg
but honestly if u want my honest honest opinion,btohqsg
just go jc if going uni is ur superior concern,btohqsg
No you don't get it if a person wants to hide her true identity then ofc she will type things differently,btohqsg
Haha my grades cannot make it!! I'm not mugging material too,btohqsg
most of my classmates in poly,btohqsg
engineering course is like this one,btohqsg
I am already suspect ING If you are pocoyo,btohqsg
my jc friends keep telling me i shd have gone jc,btohqsg
If you are not then I am sorry,btohqsg
if im gonna study that much,btohqsg
Ah I see  so both same same,btohqsg
so u must be highly disciplined or u must have prerequisites,btohqsg
for me i dying bcos i nvr take amath and physixs,btohqsg
and i also a bit hyperactive,btohqsg
i study like 8hrs a day just to do one page of work,btohqsg
Planning to go for open houses in Jan.. but not sure which to attend. I've already been bombarded with NYP's open house advertisements on my social media,btohqsg
u cone to nyp open house on friday u will see me Hehehe,btohqsg
and nyp engineering’s materials are horrible,btohqsg
When's that? Oh you're from NYP?,btohqsg
Because it's quite close my house  so it was an option,btohqsg
2 classmates of mine came to nyp engineering along w me,btohqsg
Ah I see  heard the same from my many seniors from there.,btohqsg
2 of us have a gpa of 2+,btohqsg
nyp screwed shit ton of ppl over in my cohord,btohqsg
but of course thats just us ah,btohqsg
if uw u sure can do well,btohqsg
You sound pretty hardworking tho haha,btohqsg
i got 3 Cs for sem1,btohqsg
and alot of my grades for sem2 are C+,btohqsg
i just did an mcq today,btohqsg
inside all grammar errors and qn phrased super vague,btohqsg
if i were u i go SP or smt HAHAHA,btohqsg
Oh you mean the test itself had errors,btohqsg
and we have lecturers that keep making mistakes also,btohqsg
u only get to learn from videos,btohqsg
Okay I'll consider other polys then 🙈,btohqsg
other poly i not sure if they teach,btohqsg
but so far all negative comments all nyp,btohqsg
Most poly is self directed learning,btohqsg
I've heard that their learning environment is quite slack  good if you're there to get a diploma  not preferable for a degree in the future.. is that it?,btohqsg
I mean my class got few slackers,btohqsg
but their grades better than mine,btohqsg
