Hello all Iâ€™m new here !Just want to ask for advice as Iâ€™m first time applying for cc.Soon I will need to book flight to US May I know which card is better to accumulate miles in the mean time ?Thanks in advance !,btohqsg
But if you're new just apply for the Altitude VISAhttps://hmsg.link/dbsaltvisafirst  get free lounge visit too,btohqsg
Also have this additional 5% Cashback on DBS *DEBIT* cards for foreign currency and online spend,btohqsg
Register on Paylah app  selective individuals only,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice think might go for DBS one,btohqsg
You can tag multiple cards  but Other cards donâ€™t get rewards with amaze.,btohqsg
You can get the Citi Cashback + to link with amaze also 1.6% cash back,btohqsg
Yes  for Amaze Linking Unlimited rewardsâœ… Citi Cashback Plus MC for 1.6% cashbackâœ… UOB PRVI MC for 1.4 mpd or Uob Krisflyer 3mpd for SIA spend,btohqsg
Is that correct? Eg I don't get the 8% cash back on my maybank for overseas grocery spending thru Amaze card?,btohqsg
Does applying for too many credit card at one go hurt your credit score? What is a good enoigh credit score to maintain at,btohqsg

You will get on FnF with amaze,btohqsg
At one time yes  try to spread. Don't put so much focus on credit score unless you're getting a big loan soon e.g. mortgage,btohqsg
1.2 mpd since amaze converts to sgd  but you save the 3%+ fcy fees,btohqsg
Sweet I have that. It's been great for my Bali trip,btohqsg
Is it competitive to use this as main card.. if spending is less than 2k monthly,btohqsg
Can get 4mpd for topping up shopee pay via citibank premier milesvia amaze or dbs women's world mastercard?,btohqsg
Yes  if you want a no frills cashback card.,btohqsg
Does anybody know if I can use grab card to pay for credit card bills on AXS ?,btohqsg
Chris  u got any referral for applying amaze card?,btohqsg
ðŸ’´ Instarem Amazehttps://hmsg.link/amazeMore promo codes att.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
Thanks. Is there like some cash back or reward points?,btohqsg
Yes  you can but no grab points earn for spending on AXS,btohqsg
But think can still pay income tax on axs  credit card payment doesn't allow payment using cards,btohqsg
Don't think will get 2mpd. Despite foreign but will be recorded as local bcos is processed in sgd,btohqsg
Hey guys... So I am guessing  the 3 best cards with instarem amaze would be  citi rewards  hsbc revolution  uob ppv / uob vsYes?As all would allow for instarem to convert normal POS to online yea?,btohqsg
Also additional note  would ocbc titanium work with Amaze?,btohqsg
You have to spend aboard so overseas spend earn 2mpd which is fairly standard but all foreign currency transactions are subject to a 3.25% fee. Suggest use amaze card as to avoid FCY hence it will based on MC fx rates,btohqsg
Canâ€™t eh   AXS consider grab as credit card so cannot â€¦,btohqsg
any way to withdraw to bank from shopee wallet?,btohqsg
hello  i have recently applied and received for my first credit card being UOB Absolute cashback. however  its an AMEX card so its a little annoying having to use it for some merchants that do not accept AMEX. i learned that using the card to topup to grabpay could potentially allow for double cashback  and was wondering if there were any other options that could be provide more benefits or should i just get a second master / visa credit card to use at merchants that do not accept AMEX?,btohqsg
Anyone tried to use amaza + SC unlimited? Will I be able to receive cashback from SC?,btohqsg
Watch Chris video on top 5 credit cards,btohqsg

Hi  can I check which card give the most rebate on MRT/bus? Thank you.,btohqsg
Wonder too Citi mrt card vs SCB Smart,btohqsg
Mastercards only  VISA not for Amaze (for now),btohqsg
Literally you get the Grabpay card top-up with AMEX to bypass that,btohqsg
Is there any cash back when using or topping up to grab pay?,btohqsg
If I buy iphone on apple website with 24mths installment  does it qualify as online spend for dbs womans word?,btohqsg
Is youtrip or revolut better for purchases in overseas currency?,btohqsg
Yes. As what i said in the video,btohqsg
Installments are generally excluded from all cc rewards,btohqsg
Alternative: find store that support atome,btohqsg
I see. Atome is not considered installment?,btohqsg
I sign up Amex true cb card after 15 Aug.What's the best way to hit the 5k spend for 3% cashback?,btohqsg
