Hello guys  new to this group.Would like some advice on my first credit card.Iâ€™m working overseas  so I donâ€™t spend locally  Iâ€™m more towards accumulating miles.Iâ€™m considering DBS Altitude VS UOB Privy  does anyone knows  like for hotel and travel booking which is better? Seems like DBS Alt only can choose from like one website right?I do understand PRIVY have more miles but I feel the terms and conditions is more.Thank you guys!,btohqsg
As stated by Anthony  that's the assumption that your OCBC 360 is empty. More accurately is to check the exact OCBC 360 ADB (do not self calculate)  add 3096.Suggest you transfer asap as once passed today's cut-off timing  it'll be taken as Monday's (2 Sep) transfer.,btohqsg
What about uob lady/lady solitaire travel or dbs woman world master card for online booking of flights/hotels?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hi everyone  quick question about the DBS Altitude 5mpd promo:Do I need to spend $1000 in both September and October to qualify for the 5mpd rate? I'm planning to book a hotel through Agoda in September  but I don't think I'll be able to hit the $1k mark in October.,btohqsg
Hi can check for moomoo new user promo the deposit of cumulative amount 3000  10000 and 100000 is it just need to deposit 100000 will get all the reward or need to deposit 113000?,btohqsg
If I pay UOB credit card bills using UOB Krisflyer debit card  can I earn the miles?,btohqsg
Thank you  can check what is the easiest way to clock the cumulative buy trade?,btohqsg
I saw the reward 2 is to complete 3 while reward 3 is to complete 8,btohqsg
hi hsbc got promo for next mth? do we need to register already ? I realise August is only for one mth (instead of 2),btohqsg
it has been 2 months recently,btohqsg
Questions on UOB Visa Signature1) For spends below the $5 block like $3 etc does it also contribute towards the min 1k spending?2) Does it make sense to clock transactions below $5 block since the 9X bonus UNI$ is a combination of all transaction before rounding the nearest $5?,btohqsg
"Hello all  now that UOB has ""banned"" amaze from earning miles from 1st Oct.My original plan was to use amaze with UOB KF but now that transaction with amaze tagged no longer earn miles.What is the next best cards for overseas shopping with no cap?",btohqsg
Always been 1 month. Just that you register for 2 months. They might only release Sep promo on Monday.,btohqsg
Based on the last nation of savers promo by UOB  do i need to move out my funds by today to prepare for the next possible promo on 1 Oct?Understand that it is based on the average daily balance of the previous month which is Sept.,btohqsg
it COULD be Trust Cashback... we are still observing and assessing this card.,btohqsg
ORAny UOB PRVI card at 2.4mpd2.4 miles x 1.5 cents - 4% FX = 0.4% net cost  but it could be positive if your miles valuation is above 1.5 cents per mile,btohqsg
Oh Maybank horizon card. 2.8mpd for fcy spend. UOB still has advantage cuz UOB uni$ pool.,btohqsg
this one i have bad experience so i won't use it unless no choicethey exclude SNACK by Income without any notification,btohqsg
i would stick to Amex PRVI because have free limo and potentially Loyalty Miles if exceed $50k,btohqsg
Should be per month. Each month has their own 1k spend requirement and 2k cap.,btohqsg
Maybank if 2.8mpd = 2.8 x 1.5 - 4 = Positive 0.2% benefit.Potentially same as Trust Cashback card if your miles valuation is 1.5 cents.,btohqsg
UOB Visa signature will award 0.4mpd when posted then add all your spends at the end of statement month  round down to 5 and award 3.6mpd. So not too bad with trnx under 5$.,btohqsg
My issue is that for shopping with UOB KF  it has to be online. Now that UOB no longer reward miles with amaze. I am lost.Planning to do lots of shopping on my trip in Dec,btohqsg
I have no issues with dinning and others with UOB KF  I can just use direct. but shopping is the problem.,btohqsg
Like how much. Under 2k above 1k can use UOB visa signature. Else consider UOB Prvi or Maybank horizon VS as above.,btohqsg
so can kinda consider the below $5 to be at 3.6mpd instead correct?,btohqsg
actually Amaze + UOB KF wasn't the commonly used shopping card UNLESS you aiming those high value luxury goods like Bags or Watches because those would most likely fall within the white listed MCC.For smaller value items  UOB VS with $2k cap should be sufficient and you get your miles faster.,btohqsg
Or any rounding. Like you spend 38 dollars. 35$ get 0.4mpd and 38 dollars get 3.6mpd. the diff is very minimal so I just tap. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Trust cashback suddenly becomes good ðŸ˜Š.,btohqsg
Yea  was looking to purchase a bag for my wife  And a watch for my self,btohqsg
yes if tens of thousands:UOB PRVIsMaybank Horizon VSTrust Cashbackthese are the ones I can think of for now.,btohqsg
I have checked out those cards  but I think I will go with HSBC T1 as is it able to pool points and free transfer till end of year.2.4 mpd for foreign spending,btohqsg
From other dps so far  it's gonna be good for a year ðŸ˜ƒ. Better rounding logic too.,btohqsg
"I am highly disappointed with Maybank for now... so even if higher at 2.8mpd i tend to avoid.... even though i have Rewards Infinite with no expiry.being scammed due to invoking of the ""bank has the right to exclude transactions without notice"" leaves a very bad taste",btohqsg
Many HSBC t1 holders cannot waive their AF 2nd year onwards,btohqsg
i think if he whack tens of thousand ... can la,btohqsg
I think 20k can confirm waive for hsbc t1.,btohqsg
I think already over 20K.I didn't know that HSBC T1 doesn't earn miles using services like Ipaymy and cardup. So I paid my ID through Ipaymy. I panicked after that and tried to cancel the payment but could not.But for some reasons I did receive miles according to the amount I spent on Ipaymy.So win-win I guess,btohqsg
Is it correct to say that even if we cannot hit the 3-month consecutive spend  TrustCashback still wins TrustCC hands-down for overseas spend  because at least there is 1% rebate?,btohqsg
Oh   not compulsory to hit 2 months 1k? Then its fine for me,btohqsg
Ya it said so in tnc. Promo period is 1-30 sep so oct is another promo period. 1k only needs to be in sep.,btohqsg
Is Mari Invest limited by the $100k limit of the Mari Bank Account?Where is the interest from the Investment credited daily?Can I have $90k in Mari Invest and $20k in the savings account? How would that work?,btohqsg
Just curious for Singapore saving bonds  when I participate is 3%. Will the 3% be fixed or it will move according to mkt rates?,btohqsg
"I recalled i read up on this 4yrs ago. What i recalled from the tnc was that the ""essential occupier"" cannot buy any other private property. Supposed to declare to hdb and sign on it. Now sure whats the process now. So to me its like ""do but dont get caught"" kind of scenario",btohqsg
For each SSB  there is a table which shows the yearly rate for 10 years.,btohqsg
Now essential occupier is free to buy private after the MOP.,btohqsg
Fixed based on the table provided when u applied.Basically locked in (government promises to pay those rates for 10 years).,btohqsg
All along is like this.Only during mop period  essential occupier cannot buy another property.,btohqsg
Was referring toWSwho said cannot 4yrs ago. I also think all along is can. Just a matter of will kenna ABSD or not...,btohqsg
