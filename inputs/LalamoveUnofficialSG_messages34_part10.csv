"Means they dispatch out to drivers nearbyAll these drivers have 8s to ""opt in"" if they want the jobAfter 8s  system will look at the drivers who opted in and pick most suitable driver for the job",btohqsg
think now just wait till 1st april do surcharge jobs la,btohqsg
now have to camp somewhere liao ah?,btohqsg
"""Most suitable""  which according to them means have sticker  low cancel rate  and i believe things like ratings  places u went b4  etc  also plays a part",btohqsg
Shud be with sticker they prioritise more...,btohqsg
Still will have mods  but even if mod accepts the job fast  still have to wait 8s then system will select driver,btohqsg
A and B accepted the job. A got sticker but B no sticker so A get the job.,btohqsg
Now also camp mahBut ya i think this means it will be even more location-sensitive,btohqsg
