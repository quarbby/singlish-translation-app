go back to slp guys too early for this,btohqsg
but to others it may seem like flexing,btohqsg
it's getting annoying when u go offtopic to bash someone,btohqsg
i met a few ppl like this in uni,btohqsg
uh and u project it on some stranger online?,btohqsg
if u think uni is impt,btohqsg
but ultimately it is up to u to chart ur own life,btohqsg
venting ur problems here wont help u much what,btohqsg
but what did i expect from an exams-centric chat fml,btohqsg
i think i have been quite polite so far,btohqsg
swearing is just an alternative form of communication,btohqsg
Walao chill leh... now 10mins to 10,btohqsg
because u realised u kept repeating the same thing,btohqsg
saying it once is enough =.=,btohqsg
yeah cuz i repeat sth for 10 times u oso dun understand,btohqsg
and u keep directing to off topic stuff,btohqsg
is not i dont understand lol  is just that saying the point once is enough  everyone can see it and read it  why do u repeat it for 9 times more and flood this chat,btohqsg
u understand why u still divert topic to completely unrelated shit just to piss people off,btohqsg
i know arguing with people online is often abt winning it and not abt stating your point and backing it up with actual logic thats why i hate arguing online,btohqsg
it's all about beating the person down even if none of your arguments actually make logical sense  and thats what this jay person keeps doing,btohqsg
I mean  uni is cool no?,btohqsg
you get to learn what you like,btohqsg
The lies uni students tell themselves,btohqsg
so. what does your parents do?,btohqsg
Ya sia  i wanna know what your parents do,btohqsg
Uni is not just about grades and the degree man,btohqsg
What if I have no experience,btohqsg
Not experience as in work experience  but experience as in the holistic experience,btohqsg
True that  it melds your days and weeks and months together  but the people you meet along the way  amazing.,btohqsg
What if I'm lonely and have no friends,btohqsg
if only our uni had face to face lessons for most courses,btohqsg
For the first time u get to specialise,btohqsg
A small price to pay for salvation,btohqsg
At the end of the day  what have I gained? And... what have I lost?,btohqsg
Someone tell me when the fk I will know how the analyticity of exp(x) is useful,btohqsg
My experience is  others are daily muggers/s,btohqsg
I kinda face difficulty for a math and e math,btohqsg
Im taking o level as private,btohqsg
Should i do it next year,btohqsg
if you feel you don't have enough time,btohqsg
If you are taking it as a private candidate  why not take it this year and see how it goes?,btohqsg
If it is not that good you can retake it next year,btohqsg
But idk whether can do well this year also,btohqsg
But if you don't do well  then disregard this year's certificate and try for next year.You get the real practice for O levels this year  then next year you will be even more prepared,btohqsg
Let's not get political here. And I don't see the relevance anyways,btohqsg
off topic  just thought it was a kewl video,btohqsg
The cockles of my hearts are frozen,btohqsg
Can you get the exam fees back if you decide to not take it this year?,btohqsg
Then you can just take it this year as a trial run,btohqsg
