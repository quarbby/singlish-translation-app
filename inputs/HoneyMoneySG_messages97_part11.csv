Hahaha he say to get max MAB,btohqsg
well you cannot have your cake and eat it..should have planned for Wed and Thu withdrawal and pump up accordingly to still hit $100k ADB for entire month of March.,btohqsg
i still remember people who played RHB and HSBC EGA... always have to move out in $200k blocks days ahead of month end... i cannot remember liao.. was RHB $100k or $200k limit.. feels like eons ago,btohqsg
Hahaha we know how banks are infamous for stopping double dipping,btohqsg
it was S$200K  and then got one day RHB app went down,btohqsg
$200k la. If $100k u have to spend 10 days moving each month  the EIR will be quite diluted.,btohqsg
wah you have $1m ah.. so pro so whale so powerful so macho,btohqsg
how many credit card we can have in/personspore?,btohqsg
1 Jan 2023 - the day the RHB whales panic 🤣,btohqsg
I dont think there is a limit. At my peak i had 27,btohqsg
I will be worried abt late charges😂,btohqsg
No late charges if you set giro 🌚,btohqsg
y u need 27 cards? MS or high spending lol,btohqsg
anyone here have successfully waive annual fees for uob evol (when you didn't do 3 transactions a month) ? I want to get back to using this card but annual fee coming in May,btohqsg
My view is we should keep 100k in UOB one account since the bonus interest does not apply above 100k. Unless we also want to use UOB one account as a holding account to to buy into FD  SSB or T-bills. In that case  I rather have another account like Trust to earn the 3% when the money is not being used. The trust account will be used as emergency fund or war chest.,btohqsg
One Account not ideal as a transactional account given that $100k MAB is the sweet spot for 5% EIR.,btohqsg
How do you know uob will bill you annual fee?,btohqsg
I don’t  but I am expecting the fee to be charged to credit card when the time comes?I didn’t fulfil the auto waiver criteria (3 transactions a month),btohqsg
have you heard of cashier's order? clear t+1,btohqsg
Young and ignorant. Was earning 30k a month when i was 23 years old and just sign up all cards that have promotion gettint multiple free suitcases like a dumbass,btohqsg
depending on the receiving bank  you might end up losing 1 day of interestalso may need to pay for the cashier order  and go bank branch physically  not to mention need to answer questions / checks on size,btohqsg
No I haven't. I quite suaku one 🥸,btohqsg

but the reason you're transferring money to another bank is that the initial bank isn't giving interest for that month.,btohqsg
but if you do $200k blocks days ahead of the month-end you don't have to pay anything  you don't lose anything  and you don't need to go physically to the bank.,btohqsg
"but the receiving bank may not be ""ready"" or may look at incremental balance",btohqsg
I play these games too...and sometimes using cashier order is just the best option. banks won't ask too many questions if it's in your name,btohqsg
there is always good old Esaver at min 3.6% p.a. to accept,btohqsg
hm...assuming you have two accounts to move between,btohqsg
i'll probably look at corp bonds like SIA  Capitaland  Keppel etc. the problem is you can't seem to buy these without paying some sales charge to bank or platform,btohqsg
you can if you do IPO,btohqsg
hm...was looking at Wing Tai at 4.6% guide but came out at 4.38%,btohqsg
there are better SGD bonds recently. Check with your RM for a list.,btohqsg
I'm thinking of BREIT...it's USD though but one of the best real estate teams,btohqsg
Hi  if I am new to Citibank and have no credit cards and I apply for citi premier miles card on moneysmart promotion (for the 5100 points to redeem iPad)  does that mean I will not get the 8 000 or 30 000 miles welcome bonus from Citibank because I didn’t apply directly on Citibank website?,btohqsg
can I check for AIA recurring creditcard payment  does it count for the OCBC 360 $500 spend bonus interest? read the TNCs  but kinda confusingi saw someone mentioned above that insurance recurring payment is eligible for UOB One min. spend  but not sure for OCBC,btohqsg
If it explicitly states that it's excluded then it's excluded. Else safe to say it's not. Maybe check the tnc again under cc spend bonus interest.,btohqsg
UOB one account has additional explicit term that allow recurring insurance to count for interest. despite that it would not be considered eligible transaction in CC. No such thing for OCBC (i thought insurance count and not really checking the bonus given  for years. Damn painful).,btohqsg
ahh i see  thanks for the valuable infoi shall park the recurring payment under UOB One CC instead then,btohqsg

Any reason why nobody interested in HSBC 4.6%?,btohqsg
I am interested  using it to park excess after maxing out UOB one,btohqsg
Only 1 month 4.6%  the rest 3.6%. Probably it takes too long to receive the interest,btohqsg
hi i was reading on redeeming krisflyer miles and saw the t&c that if the sq flight does not have premium economy  it would be an economy seat. to prevent wastage of miles  does anyone know how to verify the flight you going to book for with miles has premium economy or not?,btohqsg
When u redeem u will select the available class,btohqsg
"i do see here the option to click. so then it means confirm have right? bcos i was confused why the t&c said 'if no premium economy  your seat booked would be economy""",btohqsg
Maybe in the event they change plane,btohqsg
does that mean SQ can easily change planes which doesnt have your seat type and then too bad you have to just 'waste' your miles?,btohqsg
Why not? Some people have suites  then got changed to first class,btohqsg
Hi  guys quick question:If I am new to Citibank and have no credit cards and I applied for citi premier miles card on moneysmart promotion (for the 5100 points)  does that mean I will not get the 8 000 or 30 000 miles welcome bonus from Citibank because I didn’t apply directly on Citibank website? Or is that included as well,btohqsg
