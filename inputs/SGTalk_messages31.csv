Indian chief bring 自己人。Mom will not check the authenticity of the certs as it is the job of the employers to do so.What about the garment sector?

I want to visit S'pore and travel around ASEAN in a year or two  will COVID basically be over by then?,btohqsg
It won’t be overIt will stay with us for decades as mutation and variationsVaccination wil help to reduce the seriousness of the illness though,btohqsg
I use the wordbasicallyto suggest that it will be reduced to the level of a seasonal flu shot,btohqsg
I remember hearing about a S'pore travel bubble with Australia and Hong Kong. Is that discussed at all with other ASEAN nations?,btohqsg
Anyone here know how to unlock Grab suspended account?,btohqsg
When is the bubble policy expected to end  or to expand to other countries,btohqsg
I don’t think other asean nations can reach the level of vaccination small cities like SG and HK can achieve  to be honest,btohqsg
So maybe australia gov won’t be so readily granting travel bubbles with other nationsThey are very strict  even forbidding their own citizens from flying back to Australia if they were in India,btohqsg
That's fair  most of ASEAN may have to wait on India,btohqsg
Since the US/Japan/Aus/India Quad arranged to send 1 billion doses to ASEAN  but that was interrupted by India's spike,btohqsg
I assume China and COVAX are helping provide shots too  but that 1 billion from the Quad would have made things go much faster,btohqsg
Interrupted because India was supposed to be the producer  but aren't shipping shots out now,btohqsg
Is India's spike winding down? I haven't kept track,btohqsg

"WHO approves SINOVAC but here are 3 things you should think about🤔1️⃣ WHO has approved vaccines with lower efficacy rates such as Sinovac  Johnson & Johnson  AstraZeneca/Oxford through COVAX emergency use listing  the global programme to provide vaccines to countries  which currently faces major supply problems. 💀💀For a start  countries with no access to vaccines to date will finally be able to start vaccinating 💉 their health workers and populations at risk  contributing to the COVAX Facility's goal of equitable vaccine distribution "" said Dr Mariângela Simão  WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. 🌍🌍This actually means that the approval for a vaccine to be listed for emergency use is not actually a stamp of quality.😅🤯WHO is approving these vaccines to also allow them to be included in COVAX so that countries who have no access to vaccines (i.e. poor countries) can have them. For the WHO  it is better for these countries to have a vaccine than to have no protection at all.🆘🆘👉https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/who-approves-sinovacs-covid-19-vaccine2️⃣ Singapore 🇸🇬(and many other countries) have set a high 📊 which is currently more stringent than WHO's.SinoVac's efficacy rate is 51%.Some Singaporeans already choose Pfizer over Moderna because Pfizer is 1% better. Why do you want to settle for less and take something that's over 40% worse than our current options? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️HSA has already shared that it cannot approve Sinovac yet as its safety and efficacy data was incomplete.👉https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sinovac-vaccine-will-not-be-used-without-hsas-approval3️⃣Despite all this  Singapore still gives you the choice to take Sinovac if you die die still insist on it la. 🔆❣️If individuals wish to take it  they can do so via a private provider under the Special Access Route.

After all  nothing to fear if there's nothing to hide. Them doing so would give you  the consumer  the ease of mind too. 😌🕊️✌️Tio bo?✅✅✅,btohqsg

We are starting this food waste project…,btohqsg
We hope the neighborhood dwellers can participate in this project…,btohqsg
What the people need to do is segregate out the food waste (veg trimmings  leftover food etc) and bring down to this particular area where the equipment is located to recycle the food waste…,btohqsg
If can waive off our conservancy fee 😂😂,btohqsg
That is what I am trying to know,btohqsg
What will make neighbours willing to participate,btohqsg
I am actually working in a food waste company,btohqsg
Maybe for those who participate only,btohqsg

It seems our first conversation with Sembawang TC shows they are headless where and how should they go about,btohqsg
So collecting some data to give some pointers to them,btohqsg
You may propose everything nicely for them,btohqsg

The reason why the drum full of maggots is due to user throw in frozen food…,btohqsg
Yah man… suddenly just shoot up…,btohqsg
People who are working 9 to 5 job would not have a lot of times to cook. If they do  it’s usually quick and simple.After cooking they have to wash the dishes and throw the rubbish and I’m not sure would they still have the energy to sort out the food waste.Besides  a household that frequently cooks a large portion has domestic helpers. Getting the helpers to buy in the idea or expect the owner to educate is an even bigger challenge.Your low hanging fruits are SAHM (stay at home mom) and retired grandparents. But their percentage is low and thus might not worth the effort.,btohqsg

I am just commenting on your posting that you are heading to Golden Mile for drinking after 2230hrs. And now you delete your past posting and accusing me of lying and posting fake information? Maybe you should change your nick to BLP.,btohqsg
No doubt what you said is true… just sensing how the ground will react. After all  the various PAP TC already appointed their “India Chief” to work in this direction. I am just sensing the ground to feel how is the response and how not to let implementation like this become a white horse eventually. End of the day  implementations of solutions might not come from the company I am working currently as these are consider government projects and usually will be done through tender. Just trying to collect possible outcomes and views so the various IC can have a better visualization of how to go about doing it at a community level. Hope you understand where I am coming from.,btohqsg
