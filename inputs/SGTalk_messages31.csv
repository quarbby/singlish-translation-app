When is the bubble policy expected to end  or to expand to other countries,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think other asean nations can reach the level of vaccination small cities like SG and HK can achieve  to be honest,btohqsg
So maybe australia gov won‚Äôt be so readily granting travel bubbles with other nationsThey are very strict  even forbidding their own citizens from flying back to Australia if they were in India,btohqsg
That's fair  most of ASEAN may have to wait on India,btohqsg
Since the US/Japan/Aus/India Quad arranged to send 1 billion doses to ASEAN  but that was interrupted by India's spike,btohqsg
I assume China and COVAX are helping provide shots too  but that 1 billion from the Quad would have made things go much faster,btohqsg
Interrupted because India was supposed to be the producer  but aren't shipping shots out now,btohqsg

"WHO approves SINOVAC but here are 3 things you should think aboutü§î1Ô∏è‚É£ WHO has approved vaccines with lower efficacy rates such as Sinovac  Johnson & Johnson  AstraZeneca/Oxford through COVAX emergency use listing  the global programme to provide vaccines to countries  which currently faces major supply problems. üíÄüíÄFor a start  countries with no access to vaccines to date will finally be able to start vaccinating üíâ their health workers and populations at risk  contributing to the COVAX Facility's goal of equitable vaccine distribution "" said Dr Mari√¢ngela Sim√£o  WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products. üåçüåçThis actually means that the approval for a vaccine to be listed for emergency use is not actually a stamp of quality.üòÖü§ØWHO is approving these vaccines to also allow them to be included in COVAX so that countries who have no access to vaccines (i.e. poor countries) can have them. For the WHO  it is better for these countries to have a vaccine than to have no protection at all.üÜòüÜòüëâhttps://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/who-approves-sinovacs-covid-19-vaccine2Ô∏è‚É£ Singapore üá∏üá¨(and many other countries) have set a high üìä which is currently more stringent than WHO's.SinoVac's efficacy rate is 51%.Some Singaporeans already choose Pfizer over Moderna because Pfizer is 1% better. Why do you want to settle for less and take something that's over 40% worse than our current options? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èHSA has already shared that it cannot approve Sinovac yet as its safety and efficacy data was incomplete.üëâhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sinovac-vaccine-will-not-be-used-without-hsas-approval3Ô∏è‚É£Despite all this  Singapore still gives you the choice to take Sinovac if you die die still insist on it la. üîÜ‚ù£Ô∏èIf individuals wish to take it  they can do so via a private provider under the Special Access Route.

People who are working 9 to 5 job would not have a lot of times to cook. If they do  it‚Äôs usually quick and simple.After cooking they have to wash the dishes and throw the rubbish and I‚Äôm not sure would they still have the energy to sort out the food waste.Besides  a household that frequently cooks a large portion has domestic helpers. Getting the helpers to buy in the idea or expect the owner to educate is an even bigger challenge.Your low hanging fruits are SAHM (stay at home mom) and retired grandparents. But their percentage is low and thus might not worth the effort.,btohqsg

No doubt what you said is true‚Ä¶ just sensing how the ground will react. After all  the various PAP TC already appointed their ‚ÄúIndia Chief‚Äù to work in this direction. I am just sensing the ground to feel how is the response and how not to let implementation like this become a white horse eventually. End of the day  implementations of solutions might not come from the company I am working currently as these are consider government projects and usually will be done through tender. Just trying to collect possible outcomes and views so the various IC can have a better visualization of how to go about doing it at a community level. Hope you understand where I am coming from.,btohqsg
