Probably if you stay until Japanese 6  then you can probably try N2,btohqsg
Do take note I didn't Japanese in NUS so....,btohqsg
Oh damn  added an extra hiraganaðŸ’€,btohqsg
Anyways the Lang mods especially Korean and Jap very popular,btohqsg
At least close enough after 1.5yðŸ’€,btohqsg
Then coming to the higher levels  people generally hate it,btohqsg
And you see the enrollment drops,btohqsg
I received an email that they decided to expand the class due to overwhelming demand,btohqsg
I think by Japanese 3  should cut by way a lot,btohqsg
My one is just overbidded always,btohqsg
Like 10/2 for the weird timings,btohqsg
Yea after L2 u can get the elementary cert liao,btohqsg
It is hard but fun at the same time,btohqsg
By Japanese 3 can try N4 liao,btohqsg
I tried conversing in japanese a bit in japan,btohqsg
Actually early Japanese 3 can try N4 liao,btohqsg
Sometimes i actually understand what they saying but dk how to reply,btohqsg
Probably a bit broken as well,btohqsg
Those ppl do it cuz they actually wanna work in Japan,btohqsg
N3 Japanese is basically daily life Japanese,btohqsg
Or like they speak too fast for me to catch,btohqsg
U need to go through how many levels to N3,btohqsg
U need to seat for exams for everything right?,btohqsg
U cant learn then just take the higher level exam,btohqsg
I took N5  N4  N3  N2,btohqsg
Ngl my score is not that good but I pass everything la,btohqsg
I actually love Kanji a lot,btohqsg
There is this kanji exam called kanji kentei,btohqsg
And I do until level 4,btohqsg
But then most signs in Japanese are in kanji,btohqsg
But some kanji is v recognisable coz like it literally means the same as what it means in chinese,btohqsg
The hard part is knowing the japanese pronunciation of it (in hiragana),btohqsg
I take out the primary school exercise book and then practice writing it and all,btohqsg
I mean granted my Chinese is considered quite good as well,btohqsg
So learning Kanji isn't that painful,btohqsg
Its only interesting when you have kanji words that does not have the same meaning as the counterparts in Chinese,btohqsg
Learning languages is only fun when u do it under a linguistical study,btohqsg
Well at the end of the day,btohqsg
For my stage I am just doing it for the sake of my career,btohqsg
I probably know enough Japanese to be able to understand the materials in Japanese,btohqsg
Plus I am working from home,btohqsg
So good I slowly losing my sanity to the commute,btohqsg
Nah my supervisor is in Sendai for business trip,btohqsg
I am craving ramen suddenly :/,btohqsg
Can you ship some to SG,btohqsg
But the weather is too hot that its probably not a good time to eat ramen,btohqsg
Ngl I can't tell cuz the office is airconed like an igloo,btohqsg
Which also means I am slowly failing asleep cuz the temperature is cozy,btohqsg
Now afternoon liao... 2 more hours till I get to go home,btohqsg
Its morning if i just woke up,btohqsg
