aw i see. i shall go check out on both Amaze and CRMC. thanks :),btohqsg
When are you intending to go overseas? Cos the card applications may take weeks,btohqsg
There are ways to gain tax credit in my country of residence  and on average (not this year of course)  my return is well over 2.5-4% even accounting for capital gains and dividend tax.  Therefore  I am aiming to just meet the $60k minimum CPF life contribution.,btohqsg
It 1% FCY + credit card reward,btohqsg
planning to go in mid march. not sure if i want to do the amaze paired with CRMC.,btohqsg
currently i have UOB one credit card,btohqsg
Wouldn't advise to use UOB one credit card as visa cards cannot pair with instarem amaze. Think should be able to get approval for both CRMC and instarem by march. Another alternative is youtrip.,btohqsg
i see. i planning to get air tix by this week  probably use uob one cc first. meanwhile shall apply for amaze and CRMC.,btohqsg
SC Smart limited to following categories (not all online spending)Fast Food dining promotion : Burger King  KFC  Mcdonald‚Äôs  SubwayCoffee and toast : Fun toast  Toast Box  Ya Kun Kaya ToastDigital subscriptions : Disney+  Netflix  Spotify  YoutubeDaily commute : Bus and MRT,btohqsg
On the contrary  I had successfully applied for such increase  usually under travel expenses. Sometimes I may receive a msg saying it was rejected. But somehow  it would be approved later on in the day,btohqsg
Not able to withdraw therefe.rr.alincentive to main balance account.Need to be used with local or international merchants.e-Wallet top up and transfer not applicable. only 10% cashback meaning need to spend min $100.Just wondering if anyone found a work around?,btohqsg
hi  guys. i'm a cashback person  is there anyway to use amaze card for cashback? (eh crcc is not suitable for me,btohqsg
Just browse when u have time,btohqsg
You can do their cashback master card,btohqsg
I guess  the results are mixed.Not sure what‚Äôs the hidden Criterias too,btohqsg
Yeah and you can just pair it up with amaze,btohqsg
noted  i think cc with good cashback rate is always visa(live fresh  evol)  really frustrating,btohqsg
Yeah and not all accept amaze,btohqsg
it's kinda ha... because cashback+ is kinda for all catagories  so i can direcrly use it hahaha,btohqsg
At least you still can use that card oversea with amaze and still get rewarded,btohqsg
that's true! hahaha  can spend it in jb at the weekend,btohqsg
I supposed if you use it in sg visa is also ok unless is overseas use,btohqsg
amaze card can pair with visa credit card?,btohqsg
is Friday counted as weekend for revolut?,btohqsg
Pair with amaze best is for overseas,btohqsg
I think together with SingSaver this is more beneficial since we get SGD 100 from SingSaver + USD 150 from WeBull,btohqsg
Nope it based on when market closed Monday - Friday,btohqsg
Maybank family and friends  citi cashback (not cashback+)  hsbc premier all higher cashback but have min spend,btohqsg
telco yes  utilities no.hsbc revolution? petrol not in mcc whitelist,btohqsg
Curious why Citi cashback is 1.6% and Citi rewards is at 2.25%. why would people still go for cashback?,btohqsg
the CRMC welcome gift of 40 000 Citi ThankYouSM Points  does using Amaze card consider eligible spend ?,btohqsg
maybe cos citi rewards excludes travel and 4mpd capped for $1000. Guess some people want simplicity instead of higher cashback. Then again cashback+ is not simple cos need to sms to redeem cashback. Maybank Barcelona easier,btohqsg
CRMC only good with instarem amaze. Not many know this hack,btohqsg
A lot will know since in HM SG,btohqsg
just spend it lor e.g. buy shopback voucher,btohqsg
Any card to gain 4miles per dollar on petrol and utilties,btohqsg
If pair with amaze card will it mask the spend?,btohqsg
No amaze is not a magic card. MCC will be pass through to the underlying card,btohqsg
I used Amaze + CRMC  bought smth via favepay hoping that it will give me 4 mpd  but I dint get any reward points at all ): lesson learnt that Citi still regards it as mobile wallet spend haiz,btohqsg
hm. Mobile wallet should be referring to in-app online payment via google/samsung/apple pay. What u described is not mobile wallet leh.,btohqsg
are we still in time to top up medisave for the year ?,btohqsg
Oh  i thought any wallet apps will be considered mobile wallet haha! Nevertheless  still dint get any reward points. What i did was i used favepay to pay for kopi ü§£,btohqsg
Just did a google search  singsaver classified favepay as mobile wallet üëç,btohqsg
I see. What would be the best cash back for online and paywave without min spend or rebate cap?,btohqsg
Would recommend SC Spree or amaze + CRMC. No min spend and high rebate cap,btohqsg
If u can meet 600 min spend  then can consider uob evol,btohqsg
Surprised. Could it be that the favepay transaction MCC is travel related?,btohqsg
Nope! I bought kopi with it. Ill check my transaction again in a few days  hopefully the points are just not updated or smth haha!,btohqsg
The bonus points should reflect latest 1 day after the transaction is posted,btohqsg
if amaze card is in Gpay or Apple pay  does that mean same issue will occur? since they are also mobile wallets? sorry a little surprised and confused by this,btohqsg
