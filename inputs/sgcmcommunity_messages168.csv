Guys  is it true that one needs more than 2 years driving experience in order to get a replacement car?,btohqsg
is it written in the policy?,btohqsg
or is it the workshop say one,btohqsg
replacement car is subjective to availability  and i dun see insurance policy having this requirement,btohqsg
so u can ask the ws go fly kite if its not in ur insurance policy,btohqsg
"it says ""requirement for the insurance of rental cars""",btohqsg
then bopian if his insurance got that clause  but its for him also not for u right,btohqsg
"quote:We cant arrange for a rental car for you as you have less than two years of driving experience. This a requirement for the insurance of rental cars""unquote",btohqsg
They should be able to arrange,btohqsg
And if they cannot arrange rental,btohqsg
i more than one year liao leh,btohqsg
my insurance or the other party,btohqsg
i dunno what insurance he took up,btohqsg
Unless you're claiming your insurance then asking them to claim from him,btohqsg
And if your insurance also never allow then bopian,btohqsg
and he told me they will arrange a replacement car for me within these 2 days,btohqsg
now then tell me i less than 2 years???,btohqsg
Whats ur carplate or his carplate,btohqsg
nothing in my policy says that i need to be 2years and above for rental leh,btohqsg
high beamed me while i stopped and then he still continue to ram,btohqsg
What happens if replacement car also langga,btohqsg
Bruh that one another insurance HAHAH,btohqsg
But see before u take rental car,btohqsg
i checked with my insurance and they said i can get replacement car leh,btohqsg
They will tell u NCD and stuff one,btohqsg
Ws prolly no car thats why give u nonsense,btohqsg
but the issue is i took my car to my own workshop,btohqsg
got leh  say will give me once liability is out,btohqsg
the workshop says their insurance dun allow to let drivers who are less than 2 years driving experience to drive,btohqsg
easy then go to a different workshop,btohqsg
If no car just claim travelling vouchers,btohqsg

Bmw  merc especially...these drivers drove as though it doesn't come with signalling lights switch and the orange lamps are just accessories,btohqsg
Given the standard nowadays new drivers passes  they would be in chaos,btohqsg
Wide junctions such as the Bartley flyover confuses p plate drivers,btohqsg
Sad to say most phv drivers I encounter are rude and ungracious,btohqsg
Ya BMW drivers always like that one,btohqsg
They really don’t know how to signal one,btohqsg
Lately I’ve seen alot of toyotas doing that 🤔,btohqsg
BMW and TOYOTA ARE THE SAME!!,btohqsg
Dunno how to keep to their lanes also when doing right turns,btohqsg
This is the only country I've driven in where people speed up to cut you off when you try and merge into the next lane,btohqsg

Same behaviour when you try to cross road as a pedestrian lol,btohqsg

🤭🤭🤭 drivers like serene pass in an era where road infrastructures in theory are more or less gone...e.g. roundabouts,btohqsg
Oh kallang wave mall there has 3 of them,btohqsg
tbh that's the only place that has them really,btohqsg
Doing a bit more research on Tivoli. Nice looking car. Quite keen on the XLV model for more boot space. Are there any similar PARF cars in the same price range I should consider too?,btohqsg
Heard its a problematic car but that's because it's in the getgo car sharing range,btohqsg
the getgo cars are probably pretty abused though,btohqsg
Lol renters who dun wan to dirty their own car rent those,btohqsg
It should be cheaper than owning a car but expensive enough to keep irresponsible users and cheapos out of reach,btohqsg
I actually think carsharing is pretty expensive  if u damage car or get into accident your liability damn high,btohqsg
walau!! the first car claim 16k from me!,btohqsg
looks like minimal damage leh  $7k for this? crazy,btohqsg
GG but insurance should cover ya,btohqsg
go malaysia take half cut and fix should be wayyy cheaper than $7k SGD LOL,btohqsg
if u ask me getting into accident in SG is more and more like trying to out-scam each other nowadays,btohqsg
I mean if the insurance companies continue to pay  it’ll keep happening,btohqsg
You have guys out there full stock  get into minor fender bender suddenly 2 months later come out stage 3 mod gao gao,btohqsg
Rental still pay even though car in workshop? 😱,btohqsg
Be prepared  though  that your insurance company will. You won't pay la  else you buy insurance for what 🤭🤭🤭 I mean you can dispute  but hearing is between their lawyers and will without prejudice settle for payment,btohqsg
Wa no wonder our insurance claim so high,btohqsg

It's cheap  provided renter uses it with utmost care,btohqsg
No lo if her insurance fight good is claim from behind car,btohqsg

Overhaul itself 5k to 10k nia,btohqsg
Yalor. But no tears come out 😂,btohqsg
If you can find a good one  vezel can consider. Preferably is non PHV one  if not choose the one with good condition,btohqsg
Parts plenty  suspension is meh for the older model but I think quite reliable,btohqsg
cos of the hatchback  i guess. the back quite cramp leh,btohqsg
u sure? fit very small leh,btohqsg
but the height and shape different mah,btohqsg
got the EV version of vezel..,btohqsg
A Nissan qashqai should be a much better alternative at a slightly higher price at 12.5k depre. Definitely more reliable  similar cargo space.,btohqsg
The new vezel also nice leh,btohqsg
That time drove it from getgo,btohqsg
Qashqai is nice for a moving brick,btohqsg
Honda Fit interior is not as small as you think,btohqsg
I still like the old look like transformers,btohqsg

Qashqai the 1.2 engine like have alot of complaint  dunno about the new model but the older one like many people keep saying to get the 2.0 variant instead of the 1.2,btohqsg
I am sorry but I dun get what you mean,btohqsg
how do you feel a bigger car is smaller because the chassis is small?,btohqsg
Don't think Vezel interior feel small at all.,btohqsg
Okok. I rest my case. I delete my comment,btohqsg
Chassis is chassis.Car body and interior spaciousness is different from the chassis size.,btohqsg
The new vezel body is massive but interior is small for what you expect,btohqsg
I feel that way also  when sitting at honday city it feel bigger than vezel dunno why,btohqsg
But what do I know  I avoid buying honda like the plague,btohqsg
I sat in both new Vezel and old Vezel.they are designed differently.You can see that old Vezel is maximise interior space.new Vezel is designed to be cozy and more inclined towards comfort as compared to old model.,btohqsg
you are talking about car body size and interior spaciousness.so why has it got to do with chassis?,btohqsg
I never say anything about chasiss did I?,btohqsg
what i saw was Vezel same chassis as Fit.so Vezel feels small.and you said it's relative.,btohqsg
so suddenly chassis is not in question,btohqsg
FFS stop putting words in my mouth. All I'm saying is interior space relative to body size,btohqsg
Hi gurus  so in short for PARF a more affordable + reliable SUV  .. would be vezel/hrv only?A newbie trying to get SUV here 😫  tried getgo for older vezels  have feedbacks from wife and sis that the back indeed stiff  quite bad when going thru humps and bumps,btohqsg
huh that's me. i said share shame chassis. LOL dont fight.,btohqsg
anyway just saying we can't determine exterior size to say interior is spacious or small. not trying to fight with anyone.many people sit in Jazz and Fit and realised how spacious it is for a small hatchback.corolla hatchback is bigger  try sitting in 1 and will realise the rear leg space is really really bad.so it really boils down to how they design the interior.,btohqsg
Open vtec and noone will argue,btohqsg
Civic more ex than vezel and jazz 😂,btohqsg
Nowadays PARF car also like 14-16k depre already 19k for new car is like expected 😞,btohqsg
How about Citroen? Avoid at all cost?,btohqsg
Ah yes ... paiseh I wasn't clear.. I was meaning to ask what other options haha,btohqsg
Bruh.. this is used civic 1.5 turbo,btohqsg
Can I also ask a noob question sorry.. why are most parf hybrids having arf at 5k only?,btohqsg
So sad the subsidy for the hybrid next year less 10k 😭,btohqsg
