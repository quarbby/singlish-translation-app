Anyway regarding CPF  in my opinion  if I give you $80 and you can't even manage it properly that you have to protest to get your $20  meaning if I give you extra $20 you will also mismanage it. Rich people are trying to get govt to increase the top up limit into CPF because to them the interest rate is high and guaranteed. Why do you think the government put a limit cap on it if it's main point is to swallow your money?,btohqsg
