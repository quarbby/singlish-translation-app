Not even FAANG  but technology as a core product,btohqsg

Semicon is slave labor industry  they have cyclical periods and it’s too narrow skill set.Boom/bust cycle and Taiwan/Japan/Korea culture means wages suppressed  advancement is slow  culture is bad,btohqsg

meanwhile my mom still buying random shit,btohqsg
random shit that ends up in the storeroom,btohqsg
So a break for your wife every other year?,btohqsg
Rip..my parents seem like they dont even acknowledge or care,btohqsg
I doing house reno. 10X that amount,btohqsg
Above average reproduction  and also can tahan 3 kids  hats off sir,btohqsg
how much of it was shipping,btohqsg
Hahaha probably not  more likely to be net negative,btohqsg
i honestly need parents like that...cause i literally had no direction in life,btohqsg
Close shop alr  I think 3 is more than enough right,btohqsg
my parents never put any pressure for me to do well..so i literally did the bare minimum,btohqsg
Or got chance still one more,btohqsg
yall rlly think the pioneer generation got morals meh,btohqsg
stay at in laws place which is a terrace. We are lucky that my wife is only child,btohqsg
no like..where am i suppose to even find motivation to do anything when i was basically served a platinium spoon,btohqsg
How come you and wife on the same wavelength until can have 4 kids ah,btohqsg
yea..technically you can say that  but i dont take them for granted,btohqsg
we know each other since JC2,btohqsg
Like  y’all both make so much money 4 kids not an issue financially,btohqsg
dont make much money. We just don't spend much,btohqsg
Then on top of this both of you can tahan all the stressors that come with kids,btohqsg
3rd one onwards not much diff,btohqsg
I think about marriage itself alr stress  don’t talk about kids,btohqsg
Whoa  how did you do it?If you're Malay I would say Black Magic ah but nvm,btohqsg
their parenting style for my brother changed so i can see how the effects of both parenting style affected each of me and brother's life,btohqsg
idk if i said before  i dont request anything from them either,btohqsg
My personal experience with life teaches me that marriages have high variance  so I don’t want to engage with it tbh,btohqsg
"to me i feel like i dont ""suck at things""..like im actually decent",btohqsg
I also haven’t ever felt like I would die for someone so it’s like  it sounds like I haven’t yet achieved full emotional maturity lol,btohqsg
It shouldn't be about feeling like you want to die for someone. That's too drama,btohqsg
no that is my parent's expectation..for me it was basically do the best i can,btohqsg
Also never feel like when I look at another person that wow we really should make some babies,btohqsg
It's okay  aromantic asexual people still get married too,btohqsg
I'll see it as  this is someone I can live with and talk a lot too for the next 50 - 60 years,btohqsg
Well maybe not die  but I think I learned to be a bit too calculative  and I think it’s not right. Wouldn’t want to marry until I can see the world more holistically,btohqsg
no im legit thinking..but i right now dont even know what i want to do in my future..let alone what events i could join in school etc..to help aid me in the journey to discovering my future industry ill be keen to work in,btohqsg
Maybe  but I wouldn’t want someone who is married to me to do it to me  so I’m working on myself first lol  so I don’t do it to others.,btohqsg
no point alr...my perception of them is alr fixed,btohqsg
Another way. what subjects u like to know more of  if there are no exams on it,btohqsg
I personally see it as  it's a 2 person thing.,btohqsg
Don’t worry  it’s normal.I wanted to drop out of Uni so many times but tahan and now I think I make pretty decent money for my age group,btohqsg
Yeah  I'm convinced the second person for me doesn't exist.,btohqsg
you know what ...ok i got a goal  pass my ippt,btohqsg
Yeah  so I guess I’m working on becoming a better human first before I consider marriage. Also dependent on other person la  but I only control me.,btohqsg
sounds like binary stars formation vs lone stars 🙈,btohqsg
ive seen plenty of them alr,btohqsg
should i focus on my poly now or focus on my future goals,btohqsg
What is the highest  job paying salay y'all can think of?  Just wondering...,btohqsg
Is okay  just let the power-hungry NSF trip the shit out of him,btohqsg
actually now that i think about...it  my interest is cars,btohqsg
I think I was attached to the reservist unit before,btohqsg
yes somewhat  im alr doing some of it alr,btohqsg
yep doing that  alr putting it into my poly graded assignments,btohqsg
It is the same quality on tb,btohqsg
if i can most of my poly graded assignments will have the influence of cars,btohqsg
Have y'all ever had the existential thought of like who the fuck cares if I die tonight?,btohqsg
No one but me n the shop,btohqsg
My convo W the shop owner,btohqsg
Like if I just jump down and disappear  it's not like it gon matter to anyone  right?,btohqsg
Life goes on and your death changes absolutely nothing cause no one cares about you,btohqsg
aint this just a higher tier of intrusive thoughts,btohqsg
Been thinking about getting CFC the easiest way  hmmm,btohqsg
unless your death was not caused by you,btohqsg
See  at the end of the day  I'll only be remembered as that weird CDO NSF,btohqsg
Who cares? I've always felt so alone,btohqsg
for 6 year old and 4 year old leh,btohqsg
Excess money  can pay one. I'm in a house that is not a home.,btohqsg
The SCDF admin must have had a slow day to post this,btohqsg

Yeah  Safety Committee told us about it,btohqsg
So idk if I want get double deck,btohqsg
I was in the POW training just before this incident,btohqsg
People will always have something to say,btohqsg
Not everyone in this world is understanding and forgiving,btohqsg
Most of the people I'm surrounded with are as such,btohqsg
that carpet would drive me a headache,btohqsg
I did almost choke on the water that time,btohqsg
@TanJunWeiI got a stupid qnAre your study room connected to the bedroom or are they in one same room,btohqsg
I'm just tired of being alone  isolated and misunderstood.,btohqsg
I haven't finish arranging but for now should be same room,btohqsg
Kids will ltr sleep > study,btohqsg
I wasn't even thinking about that,btohqsg
kids are small  it's just extra table,btohqsg
This is just life  ain't it?,btohqsg
I like separate rooms cuz more space ig,btohqsg
yead a hand of closefriend can alr,btohqsg

bro got many friends but none from a uni...have you found your ogls yet,btohqsg
no im actually asking a legit qns  because i see you have been asking if there are any uni ogls,btohqsg
to me  if you have alot of friends you are outgoing...so a outgoing person to me should have no problem finding someone if they need to,btohqsg
I've been speaking to camp counsellor so yeah,btohqsg
i rmb my sec school counsellor calling me to attend a session..i legit entered  he ask me qns i said like 3 words and walked out,btohqsg

i get paid 1k a month and i have to save people's lives 💀,btohqsg
"Paid like 5K+ just to scream and point ""This is not safe!"" to PTEs where nothing gets done afterwards",btohqsg
The real answer to this question is to sack the project manager for poor timeline and cost/effort estimation for completion,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know how to do this question,btohqsg
Also  each day he delay there are LD (liquidated damages) contractually,btohqsg
I wanted to say there but then like would confuse the poor soul asking for HW help,btohqsg
The answer is not to hire more people,btohqsg
It is to manage them better,btohqsg
At least as upper management this is what I would say,btohqsg
thats if u can afford 2 rooms to 1 person...,btohqsg
I can’t help myself liao  once I work and see the stupid stuff corporate gets up to and all the shady stuff in projects,btohqsg
I myself am such a man who has to complete a project,btohqsg
They just make you work later and harder,btohqsg
That’s the most unrealistic assumption of the whole question,btohqsg
“How many more men does he hire?”,btohqsg
None  he just squeeze all of them work more .,btohqsg
“9 mothers don’t make 1 baby in 1 month”.,btohqsg

Actually ah knn  they should just put out a hiring notice for “super star construction workers”“Able to work under pressure”“Fortitude in the face of adversity”“Appreciates Fast paced environments”“Takes initiative”“Adheres strictly to timelines”,btohqsg
Min number of men to hire: 1,btohqsg
the fact that you said dirty and not clean means that you probably know its q dirty,btohqsg
like all over the place will hv tape to secure stuff,btohqsg
also got q some dust all over alpha,btohqsg
Oh I was thinking really dirty like puke everywhere,btohqsg
unless the patient damn cb decides to do that then,btohqsg
Yea I mean I know y’all will have those emergency bags,btohqsg
“The grass may be greener on the other side but you don’t know if it has been spray painted”,btohqsg
Same but I want to at least visit it once in my lifetime and never again,btohqsg
Yea the best one we can learn from them is setting bail,btohqsg
Only in the Us  60 felonies still can post bail and get released on the streets,btohqsg
US is actually okay. It's just that the media often blow it out of proportion. For example the idea that most Americans don't know geography. That's mostly satire but many people take it seriously lolIf look at MSM  china has their fair share of fked up moments that reach the headlines sometimes  especially their tourists but we often don't bat an eye to that,btohqsg
been to us on a few occasions. If you go to Chicago and New York  yeah I understand what you mean but elsewhere  many Americans are actually genuinely nice people and welcoming to tourists. Often times comparable to australians,btohqsg
idt its just those 2 cities,btohqsg
depends more on the part of the city ur in,btohqsg
lol my csm 3wo alr buy merc haha,btohqsg

I mean it is possible tho,btohqsg
iirc he’s in his late 30s,btohqsg
I mean I got navy friends 30+ 4.5-5k w only Os,btohqsg
Usually age of 32-35 u will get me3-1,btohqsg
But it depends on performance and years of service,btohqsg
i mean yea  if you leave the big cities  life is actually decent,btohqsg
having to go for so many just to ck,btohqsg
I left cos of spam like the notification was annoying,btohqsg
Fun Fact: China has poured more concrete in 3 years than the US had in the whole of the 20th century,btohqsg
In sg it will be:1. “stare what stare  not happy wan fight isit?”2. “settle tomorrow  4pm at pioneer mall”,btohqsg

pls that time i ask for a summarised chap from my teacher she said i cant do everything for u,btohqsg
ill do that for 2 weeks,btohqsg
yea after prelims F9-C6 solely based off doing tys multiple choice,btohqsg
ive been focusing on eng math too much lol,btohqsg
you doing the tys for emaths?,btohqsg
science and maths both just spam tys,btohqsg
but if you are looking for A for science you have to memorise,btohqsg
but i asked here bfr it is more recommended to use humanities,btohqsg
n levels i everything 4 except 1 subj...got 3,btohqsg
i have to mug next week alr,btohqsg
next week i plan to go for mon wed fri coursework,btohqsg
you have yet to finish your art?,btohqsg
4am 4 days in a row..4th day will fall sick alr,btohqsg
everyone ard me is sick and i am so prone cause my immune system is kinda weak i got covid twice,btohqsg
i cant man and they refuse to wear a mask 😭😭,btohqsg
thats why i said try to avoid any possible way to fall sick like mugging,btohqsg
oh i can do the long pomodoro method,btohqsg
you done your writeups for art?,btohqsg
ohh art no worries just do in sch i just damn tired when i come home,btohqsg
but i need to redo my annotations cuz i used chatgpt,btohqsg
aint there a portfolio..like you have to do,btohqsg
i think thats only if uw go nafa or laselle,btohqsg
my tutor cut down to 4 chaps for me to memorise,btohqsg
i think u meant for the boards,btohqsg
for board just need redo annotations on docs,btohqsg
Stalin and Hitler will be the major ones...both are content heavy chapters,btohqsg
so eg:mon 2 h math then 2 h sciencetue: hist 2h math 2hwed : ss 2h science 2,btohqsg
Japan..cuban missle crisis (they are theoretically easier because most of it is common sense),btohqsg
i am supposed to finish memorising stalin by today,btohqsg
oh..was abt to ask if you alr did the memorisation for the 5 yr plan,btohqsg
oh i js spam consults w online teachers and my sch for eng,btohqsg
hahahs i am still at rise,btohqsg
cuz i use pomodoro so i dont burn out,btohqsg
looks like its time for you to actually start,btohqsg
one is like mentor and ex cca teacher,btohqsg
my teachers just spam yt vids in class,btohqsg
i been asking for my history practice paper to be marked and my teacher took 2 weeks and still ask extension,btohqsg
in the hope that some shit goes into our minds,btohqsg
and he was like “wah u ask for deadline also”,btohqsg
like yes cuz i need feedback,btohqsg
my humans is lanjiao to the max,btohqsg
if on docs sure i can on paper maybe not everyday,btohqsg
cuz it will grammar check right,btohqsg
i like to cram a lot things into a day and i find that i cant finish,btohqsg
end up push back all then i simply cant do anything,btohqsg
and how long does it take to memorise 1 history chapter,btohqsg
oh do i devote 2h to both sciences? or,btohqsg
when is there a subj without memorisation 🫠🫠,btohqsg
so i devote at least 4 hrs of studying everyday?,btohqsg
You can try that and see how it goes,btohqsg
i did tried 6am-9pm but end up i wake up 11am start at 3,btohqsg
You see the history textbook 20+ pages 💀,btohqsg
The prob with history is knowing how to tell which factors is the easiest to understand and write down,btohqsg
Because at the end of the day  the qns is not going to be “List down all the factors that led to Stalin’s rise in the Soviet Union” rather “List down TWO factors that led to stalin’s rise in the Soviet Union”,btohqsg
ye it is better to know everything which is certainly impossible to memorise everything before i sleep,btohqsg
that why sort out the long and short factors,btohqsg
what i would do i memorise the factors that actually leads me to talk more about stalin's rise,btohqsg
like..if you would to ask me if you should memorise Trotsky's unpopularity or Non-Disclosure of Lenin's testimony....i would say memorise Trotsky  because there is more content that will foreshadow stalin's rise to power over lenin's death..where the testimony was sealed and that was basically it..nothing that could be added on to further improve your understanding,btohqsg
there are def more factors  im just telling you like a comparison,btohqsg
time to mug now and memorise everything 💔💔,btohqsg
https://www.slideshare.net/howenglun99/sec-3n-hist-elec-chapter-21-part-2-reasons-for-rise-of-stalinHere is a website to help you,btohqsg
what you expect  bro was born into a golden spoon family,btohqsg
This is what i mean by comparison  the factors will link so its perfectly ok to just memorise 2 ...but if you want to memorise all. Its also ok  just ensure you got the time to do so,btohqsg
i never see them rly test on industrialisation for seq,btohqsg
if you have tys  look at what they test over the years,btohqsg
💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 nahhhhhh helll nawwww,btohqsg
