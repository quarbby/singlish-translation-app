Bro not every ek hatch is a type r,btohqsg
the chances of you seeing one is pretty fucking rare,btohqsg
and all of them are well known within the Type R community,btohqsg
I think this one m3 ah,btohqsg
so if you have a rego/pic that we can go by  that would decide if it's an EK4/EK9,btohqsg
oh my days all these tiktok ‘car enthusiasts’,btohqsg

TSS is mainly where cars go to race after professional EOL,btohqsg
much like the 991s  Bentley  1st gen AMG GT3,btohqsg
iirc it's due to how they routed the exhausts,btohqsg
there was a comparison video long ago showing the difference between both,btohqsg
back to EK9R.unless the one you saw was white  then it's an EK4,btohqsg
both regged are white  one has a carbon bonnet and one is stock-ish,btohqsg
e class so heavy how to beat a EK9R,btohqsg

Any cars at decat rn ?,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxaK-OcSnbc/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==Incase you missed the MCL60 at Chjimes last week ;),btohqsg
everyone can spot the exact same car throughout sg,btohqsg
inherits nothing from the actual mclaren,btohqsg
infact almost the same car they used to showcase the 2022 regs,btohqsg
Same I also depressed cuz coe damn high,btohqsg
no point being depressed if it's going to keep rising,btohqsg
2013 was the highest coe other then this year,btohqsg
So naturally it will peak in 2023,btohqsg
I think people are expecting too much of a COE drop when the supply goes up. The peaks are gettting higher  and the bottoms are getting higher too. Whereas last time COE is like 20k or whatever at its cheapest  i think the lowest we see in the future would be like 50k or something which is still crazy expensive,btohqsg
And I see so many phv like getgo  bluesg and etc,btohqsg
It will drop once people those people who can't afford that pricing,btohqsg
Then cars will be for those will off individuals who can pay 150> for 1.6>cc,btohqsg
Nope trust me it will never drop back to 50k,btohqsg
People who are using Rentals are the reason coe is going up,btohqsg
Exactly we might not even get to 50k,btohqsg
