I’m gonna have to ask you to be more civil and less rude,btohqsg
lol op damn fail she didn't comprehend the message of the post,btohqsg
im pissed off at the implication that grades = to your self worth parts,btohqsg
The poster is playing by the OP’s own definitions,btohqsg
also the implication that if u didnt study 24/7 unlike this ITE guy u dont deserve ur success,btohqsg
The OP himself presents his bad grades as being negative,btohqsg
OP was tryna make a point that grades shouldnt equate ur self worth or should society judge u based on mere grades what,btohqsg
Then why did he talk about getting 90 RP,btohqsg
cuz he say after he get 90 rp everyone aroudn him treat him way differently,btohqsg
whereas when he used to get shit grades ppl just treat him like ...,btohqsg
u claim im wrong then state 0 points,btohqsg
when u have 0 points there’s nothing the opposite side can rebut on,btohqsg
did people really treat him like trash tho?,btohqsg
lol ive been on the side of having both awesome grades and terrible grades,btohqsg
he got treated the way he deserved to be treated what  you go to school  your teachers advise u to study hard udw listen to them,btohqsg
yes  peoplet treat u damn differently,btohqsg
i don't think he will be envious leh,btohqsg
did u see his previous history,btohqsg
even i will also don't care about you what,btohqsg
i 好心好意 give u good advise,btohqsg
u lan lan dw listen to me,btohqsg
why shd i care abt you,btohqsg
Personally I feel that teachers have way better relationships with poorer performing kids cause they need to interact with them more,btohqsg
ppl r human  why u expect ppl to not treat u different when u ignore their good intentions,btohqsg
yah  i can attest to that LOL,btohqsg
Better performing kids just use their teachers as QnA machine,btohqsg
i dont think teachers treat u less of a human just cos ur grades r bad lol,btohqsg
i think whatever OP wrote in his/her previous post is just his/her own delusion,btohqsg
him trying to fit his own victim narrative into the story,btohqsg
i think OP super melodramatic lol,btohqsg
this type of stupid a level sob story,btohqsg
its basically an attention seeking  melodramatic hit piece to get attention  ~positive vibes~ and self validation,btohqsg
omg i overcame my non-problems and inability to get my shit together because i was short sighted and ill disciplined despite being in a privileged position to achieve 90 rp at an elite jc,btohqsg
how is that a good story,btohqsg
which is like 80% of the sob story posts on sgexams,btohqsg
U rejoined just to say this,btohqsg
lol she couldn't take the heat,btohqsg
so common among a level grads  particularly those from better JCs,btohqsg
an inability to accept that maybe their worldview might not be correct,btohqsg
lol this is exactly the hostility that got me pissed off at u,btohqsg
and then u failed to address any of my points  so lemme throw that back at you,btohqsg
i left cuz i dont wanna fucking deal with bullshit from interweb strangers without even a dp in the first place,btohqsg
Friends let me remind you all to not be rude to each other,btohqsg
it’s cuz ur a fucking nobody to me  and i dont want to reply to a goddamn who knows who is behind this username stranger,btohqsg
is that not an open for me,btohqsg
im very chill its u keep roasting me,btohqsg
i qn ur narrative u explode,btohqsg
bruh im the most fucking open minded person ever  my best friend is literally someone politically directly opposite to me,btohqsg
i literally complained to someone online for releasing a lvl stats earlier (illegally) and got massive downvotes I also liddat,btohqsg
but it just shows that singaporeans are 3rd world citizens,btohqsg
