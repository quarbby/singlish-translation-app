quality is also very good. love it,btohqsg
U are not the first one who I heard comparing mazda to conti cars and praising it,btohqsg
that fuel economy is liek toyota vios for a mazda 6 2.5,btohqsg
Conti cars are popular for it torque and power   or those luxury version like an s class or 7 series,btohqsg
If compare to like 218 or cla 180   some Japanese cars are really better or way better,btohqsg
218 got a immediate failure from me,btohqsg
When I wanted to upgrade my mz3,btohqsg
Most of the conti on the road are coe car or entry level like such   so perception is generally wrong,btohqsg
wish it had more power though but overall great luxury\,btohqsg
Power come at fc   might as well get ev,btohqsg
Low power   poor interior    poor insulation   cramp,btohqsg
Compare to it signature version like 535 and such,btohqsg
And coming from a sedan  218 is a diesel mpv‚Ä¶ the drive sucks,btohqsg
Not only drive sucks   it is so noisy i thought the engine is breaking down when acceleration,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to pay money just for badge,btohqsg
Actually entry level u see the 2nd car market can be lower then jap car haha,btohqsg
Hahahah i sat in a Audi Coupe before LOL. Not bad,btohqsg
Some are just for brand ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I drove a cheapo version Kia koup,btohqsg
Actually a lot of people are not aware that they can't pump 95 on foreign cars?A quick fix is basically any foreign cars pump 95  just charge at 97 ron price lor,btohqsg
Las time I pump at jb u  u need to inform the cashier then can pump  so defiantly they just trying to bypass intentionally,btohqsg
Could be that over the 2 years  got used to pumping ownself at kiosk,btohqsg
i think its mostly intentional. there was a big paper pasted on the pump saying singapore cars cannot pump 95,btohqsg
The petrol kiosk ppl see sg plate won‚Äôt allow u pump95,btohqsg
but im talking about before covid  not sure about now,btohqsg
back then people pumping 95 was rampant. every pump had a paper pasted  but most people ignored it. and because so many cars are pumping . no one enforced the rules,btohqsg
The jacking up the car to get extra drip of petrol is very jia lat,btohqsg
Actually goverment also know la u see the 3/4 tank rules really got enforce Meh,btohqsg
But these pplToo greedy and thick skin   by pass 3/4 rules   pump 95,btohqsg
When 1 day Malaysia also fed up then no more benefit,btohqsg
But I have to confess la  I wasn't aware foreigners cannot pump 95. After reading  it make sense. Malaysia subsidize the fuel for Malaysians who really need fuel as a means of transportation. Malaysians do not enjoy the vast public transport network Singaporeans have Most other countries tax on fuel. Only Malaysia subsidise fuel for their Malaysians who need as a meant to live.So yea  Singaporeans should not be basket to go pump 95 in Malaysia. It is shameful.,btohqsg
frankly i think the policy decision to restrict some grades of petrol based on car nationality is one of the stupidest ones i have ever seen. They expect the people collecting money to enforce the rules which is ridiculous. Then you couple that with heck care sinkies and this is what you get,btohqsg
Kia is actually quite üëç especially the just 10 year old ones on 6 speed,btohqsg
There is a reason why Malaysia's RON95 is significantly cheaper than RON97,btohqsg
similar to SG imposing 3/4 Tank Rule. By right it should be against the guidelines to International law of Monpolising the petrol,btohqsg
i'm not sure about this honestly. The way i see it singapore soil  singapore law applies,btohqsg
Thats why we drove on the left sided of the road. ü§£,btohqsg
they can make whatever nonsense rule they want and apply it to you as long as you're here,btohqsg
Why would 1 country wanna impose a 3/4tank rule,btohqsg
in fact you can even take drugs overseas and get charged here,btohqsg
U see this in any other country?,btohqsg
All fuels in Singapore are taxed. Just like your tobacco.,btohqsg
OK so they are taxed so ?,btohqsg
why u think cannot carry msia cigarette in,btohqsg
so they want their money. not saying i agree with it  i dont. but thats why it is like this,btohqsg
U can when u pay tax at custom,btohqsg
tax money recieved  do what you want,btohqsg
Actually sometimes I wonder why these ppl so thick skin and risk it   now social media so powerful ppl keep take photo and post   just for that few $ worth it Meh,btohqsg
i used to smoke last time  and paid tax on cigarettes when bringing in from overseas. you do save a bit of money doing this  but not a huge amount,btohqsg
Now SGRV really expanded to Malaysia. ü§£Gan,btohqsg
