i thought it was obvious tho,btohqsg
by any chance anyone hv the ans key to this,btohqsg
I thought the answer key comes tgt as a set,btohqsg
that's the problemit's either w my teacher or i lost it,btohqsg
had  threw away last yr tho sorry,btohqsg
i didn't rly do the questions either,btohqsg
do you guys know what's wrong with this code?,btohqsg
"System.out.printf(""%13s11s11s11s11s11s11s ""City"" ""Monday""  ""Tuesday""  ""Wednesday""  ""Thursday""  ""Friday"");",btohqsg
All the ads can skip one,btohqsg
Hooked to the game alr uh?,btohqsg
🙏🙏 pls dm if u find out!,btohqsg
as for my qn 3a i got the final change in length with negative value which is compression. Not sure if this was correct while I saw my other friends they got the final ans for change in length positive which is elongation instead. Not sure if it matter if the change of length ans was negative or positive or if is compression or elongation.,btohqsg
You might want to send in the study grp instead,btohqsg
i have little motivation to studyyyyy,btohqsg
o levels practical is in less than a week and aaaaaaa,btohqsg
Have u met ur goal in prelims?,btohqsg
You can do it!I wish you and everyone all the best for national exams!😊,btohqsg
Mood  I used to work 6h shift but bluff people one. Expected to OT anyway.,btohqsg
My internship was 12h shifts but only work 3 days a week.Super rabak tho coz when phase 1 opened we had to OT even after 12h WITHOUT DINNER,btohqsg
Was glad when 3 days was up smh,btohqsg
There's always secret tools uses by HR,btohqsg
I applied full time there but lucky they weren't hiring full timers,btohqsg
U planning to stay after internship is over?,btohqsg
Did they pay you for 6h or 12h?,btohqsg
I also expected to do OT as my station is one of the busiest stations in my department  but I think I don't have to do OT soon as I'm now doing things quite fastMy mentor will finally come back tomorrowShe will have to choose either me or my teammate as her mentee permanently and either one of us will be transferred to somewhere else  which might be a little bit boring yet also one of the busiest stations. I hope my mentor will choose me as I really like doing this kind of lab work,btohqsg
well not really  though i always failed math but this time i passed by a bare minimum. i really don't know what to do for math,btohqsg
thank you so much! means a lot ☺️,btohqsg
but so far i got a lot of Bs,btohqsg
maybe after going thru ur paper u can reflect like what went wrong? if its conceptual error  go through with your teacher/research online/watch videos  and then after you are extremely clear on the topic  attempt some revision questions! once you are confident  move on to practice papers.you can also try explaining the topic to a friend because it also helps your own understanding as well!!,btohqsg
alright thank you! i'm weak in coordinate geometry  and idk how to study on this topic to improve,btohqsg
Spend this last 2 weeks to consult with your teacher,btohqsg
Maybe ask for a zoom session to ask what you need to know,btohqsg
okay! sometimes i also dk what to ask bc i'm so confused myself,btohqsg
Uncle think Louis is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg

Any thoughts on the nlvl phy paper?,btohqsg
That time yea I got ask if they hiring but the senior chemist told me they weren't  think coz of hiring freeze during covid that time  the workplace only can have x amount of people present then maybe tough to hire and arrange around the manpower limit,btohqsg
Ooooo  I get what you mean  but internship is a good time to learn outside of the dept. I think the OT thing really is see your supervisor  like for my side now  my supervisor told the intern actually cannot let him OT  but if need be it's up to the intern whether he wants to stay or not.,btohqsg
I left them when my internship over and never apply back HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I'm working for their competitor kek,btohqsg
But funny is they say if I want extend internship can,btohqsg
How often do y'all buy sports shoes//sneakers? (I'm curious),btohqsg
My mum more insane  she buy every year just to wear once during her company's team building event,btohqsg
If she is insane I think I'm worst...,btohqsg
Err I mean i got friend doing sports shoes collection,btohqsg
equals free clothes when he gets bored,btohqsg
But keep buying also idk how to season the shoe,btohqsg
Coz idk shoes will tend to season according to your feet and all so sticking to one might actually be better,btohqsg
Plus your feet muscle memory it,btohqsg
I am tempted to buy new shoes,btohqsg
The thing is I got 20+ pairs ale,btohqsg
it was so fkd up 😭😭😭,btohqsg
investigating specific heat cap. of oil,btohqsg
graph of total energy supplied for 1°C temperature rise of oil against temperature,btohqsg
everyones answers were so different sia,btohqsg

You guys wanna be a pilot?,btohqsg
Ehh how to apply for compass test sia,btohqsg
I want apply in y3 eh,btohqsg
Unless you plan to stay in military only.,btohqsg
10 years come out i think not bad,btohqsg
If this vaccine passport + PCR test rule exists for 10 years  straight   more or less screwed.,btohqsg
Airlines will have very few flights..,btohqsg
hello your residential aviation expert here,btohqsg
if you look at europe its basically back to business for them,btohqsg
they are at about 80-90% back at precovid capacity,btohqsg
the airline i worked for Air France KLM,btohqsg
opened routes back into spain and other holiday destinations within europe,btohqsg
all you need is just a pcr test within 72 hours b4 ur flight,btohqsg
Europe is more open and relaxed..,btohqsg
i study in aviation management LOL,btohqsg
Ay my friend in that course,btohqsg
Even trains in Europe can run into each others countries and some will even cross multiple countries.,btohqsg
cuz europe has freedom of movement,btohqsg
depending on what level of the EU they are integrated in,btohqsg
im not doubting that it does,btohqsg
but its not for all of euope,btohqsg
but europe has been traditionally more lax in their covid restrictions,btohqsg
because to them its just another flu season,btohqsg
You know in Europe   the trend for themnow is not air travel but night trains.,btohqsg
Somehow the one that takes longer to reach is more popular.,btohqsg
air travel is very competitive in europe,btohqsg
depending on where you go and where u fly it may be cheaper to fly lcc internally than take a train,btohqsg
For Germany is a special case..,btohqsg
heck certain routes its cheaper to fly BA than ryanair LOL,btohqsg
The airline place the flight number on a number of train services,btohqsg
Ireland   you gotta fly since it ‘s isolated from continental Europe.,btohqsg
idk how it works for them HAHA,btohqsg
fucking brexit dumbest shit the uk pulled in recent history,btohqsg
I think they got tired of taking in immigrants.,btohqsg
But then again   U.K have nothing much to offer as a country.,btohqsg

I can use my instagram but not whatsapp,btohqsg
My whatsapp came back for like 1 second to deliver a message then was gone again,btohqsg
For my case  I can only send message to myself but cannot send to others in WhatsApp  and I cannot use WhatsApp desktop at all,btohqsg
I cant open whatsapp at all,btohqsg
Seems like they need several hours to fix this issueHaizz,btohqsg
Also i think its not an issue,btohqsg
AhThen how sia? I need to use WhatsApp for discussing some important stuff😭,btohqsg
Most people go for ig and ws,btohqsg

facebook stocks are like a rock in the ocean,btohqsg

I think gtx 1050 can run it,btohqsg
2 GB of VRAM won't cut it  it looks bad even if it can run.,btohqsg
sysreq says gtx 760 minimum  so gtx would probably run it on low settings,btohqsg
Like the essays are “do you agree tourism has more benefits”,btohqsg
Didn’t ur prelims gone thru that ?,btohqsg
EOY then refer to the school syallbus,btohqsg
Ur school should have given u the exam format,btohqsg
If it’s not o lvl it’s diff ?,btohqsg
sec 3 wouldn’t have learnt the whole syllabus,btohqsg
And each school teach diff stuff,btohqsg
How do you all revise for practical,btohqsg
I got notes you want ?,btohqsg
had a fking 3 hours zoom,btohqsg
until they throw you some plasticine shit,btohqsg
that doesn't work cuz they thought up the experiment in 15 deg weather,btohqsg
hearing all the physics horror stories made me thank god i nvr take physics in sec sch,btohqsg
i suppose u started with q3 first,btohqsg
That’s why as a physics student,btohqsg
Before you start the actual experiment,btohqsg
I read the qns once i done,btohqsg

Half my class dropped their ldr when taking the basket,btohqsg
So we spent half the practical finding and sharing ldr lol,btohqsg
Bruh my physics deproved i read ldr as long distance relationship,btohqsg
Nah im just bad at it,btohqsg
Tbh i just hate seab in general,btohqsg
No one likes them. I think they are only in charge of you till Sec 5 or so.,btohqsg
R u taking As or Os this year?,btohqsg
No. I am done with mine. I am doing my internship.,btohqsg
Ohhh. Okay la. I used to do that anyways.,btohqsg
If they remove it  u will have more time for the rest od the paper,btohqsg
In the end it’s basically no choice,btohqsg
SEAB doesn’t exist in Poly   ITE and Uni. Thank goodness,btohqsg
They never have that in mind.,btohqsg
Later they infilitrate kindegarden to give KSLE,btohqsg
