I have no affiliation with u uwu,btohqsg
That can be used as evidence,btohqsg
If by collaborating they mean adding people without consent  then yeah  I guess,btohqsg
"As i quote one of them""Telegram stores deleted messages""",btohqsg

It’s because you posted ‘wats this group about’,btohqsg
Because he saw you and him have a common group,btohqsg
And he figured you were one of those added from SGExams,btohqsg
It’s a fair assumption that you were not,btohqsg
He just forward me deki msg,btohqsg
guys no offence but isn't this your study group rules,btohqsg
"they seem to be ""feeding off"" sgexams",btohqsg
is their group logo  MOE's logo?,btohqsg
who do they think they are,btohqsg
apparently these boomers dk how to create their own thing so they copy from others,btohqsg
That’s why they’re taking our stuff,btohqsg
the quality of answers given for qns in their grps is lower than the study grps,btohqsg
I’m guessing they just act as answer keys rather than teachers,btohqsg
I said weird  the rules look familiar,btohqsg
they rather have 550 muted people,btohqsg
lmao what's going on at the sgcovid group,btohqsg
MOH updates their website slower than straits times and cna,btohqsg
yeah maybe they email the info to the media first,btohqsg
oh man I wish we don’t have to use the extended cb,btohqsg
like we defeat covid earlier so the restrictions can lift earlier,btohqsg
But u have to be sure that covid is truly defeated before you can lift restrictions,btohqsg
Oh this isn’t too bad at all,btohqsg
Lmao THE PINNACLE GUY USED THE SMILEY STICKERS,btohqsg

Well it’s not possible to rename the sticker pack,btohqsg
create watermarks at the bottom of each sticker,btohqsg
I have many plans for the sticker pack tbh,btohqsg
that chats r filled w old people,btohqsg
And I was hoping he would use it,btohqsg
But first flood this chat so he can’t see my comment haha,btohqsg
He prevented us frm sending stickers sksks,btohqsg
