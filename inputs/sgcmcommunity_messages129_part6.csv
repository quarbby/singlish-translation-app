if nobody buying won't increase also nia,btohqsg
Sure increase la don't make money now then make when?,btohqsg
Just put in the market lor,btohqsg
See if got willing buyer then sell,btohqsg
Tell you so many times alr,btohqsg
You want sell now to make money then don't buy anything,btohqsg
where‚Äôs all the ‚Äúrecycled COEs‚Äù from 2013,btohqsg
all not scrapping their cars anymore,btohqsg
depends leh. ytd that straits time article come out. suppose to dampen Car market or smth. then suddenly now shoot,btohqsg
now the main issue is whether sell high  the buy will be higher anot,btohqsg
i think if they willing to slash their margins,btohqsg
then the Buy won‚Äôt be high,btohqsg
Likely higher purely based on interest rates,btohqsg
Higher compared to what you have for sure,btohqsg
i think anyhow any dealer also will quote 2.78%,btohqsg
the 1.68 or 1.88 days are over alr,btohqsg
Cause that‚Äôs the ‚Äúmarket rate‚Äù now,btohqsg
Because most cars held by a few big players,btohqsg
dunno where all these COEs stuck there for what,btohqsg
Scrapped in lots to control the values,btohqsg
maybe left pocket in right pocket out,btohqsg
If car sharing co.s and phv co.s dumped one shot,btohqsg
but ya.. Got what Cat A cars can even encourage so much demand sia,btohqsg
And not good for their business,btohqsg
Most starter conti cars are cat A now,btohqsg
i mean they cannot be infinitely expanding their fleet right,btohqsg
speaking of this  i think the only decent one for this starter conti is the 2 GC or the 1 series from BMW,btohqsg
That's what they want to do  if the COE is high they can discourage car ownership and the demand for taxis and car sharing automatically goes up,btohqsg
the Audi A3 and A class all these totally is so bad,btohqsg
In terms of equipment Merc quite ok but that's about all they offer,btohqsg
the BMW 1 is really not bad leh,btohqsg
Need to see what powertrain you get,btohqsg
Good enough for a man like me,btohqsg
Standard on the a class as well,btohqsg
but i think now only got 116 right,btohqsg
but 116 now itself 200k alr,btohqsg
if u gna get 116  might as well get 216  gran coupe,btohqsg
ok lor. see see look look 1st next time,btohqsg
