@furion07what is the meaning of “R”? I found it repeating in a few article. thank you,btohqsg
correct me if i got you wrong. so your lengthy views are based on value investing instead of just going for the hype?,btohqsg
I won’t consider myself value investor. I go in search of price catalyst that could affect share price. Could be short or long term. Depend on nature of catalyst,btohqsg

Market cap too small some funds won’t inject anything,btohqsg
Nonetheless market cap doesn’t necessarily mean high price. Could happen with big float too.But fund raising is a definite,btohqsg
some key numbers on aspen. of course many will argue is the outlook and support by gov on their gloves factory and chua ma yu name etc etc. nonetheless the picture remains clear. it trades at 2X of NAV with only 1.7 cent cash on hand.,btohqsg
to do anything sizeable they have to do many fund raising be it placement  loans  convertibles or rights (likely so. Mr Chua can put money where his mouth is)however are the retail investors willing to do that though,btohqsg
