Because 1k pts for 5 dollars is not worth it,btohqsg

Good morning  wondering whether has anyone considered investing in s&p500 via unit trust instead of ETF?For example:dca into Endowus unit trust ishare us index fund s&p500 instead of voo / cspx / spylCalculationsIshare us index fund s&p 500 expense ratio (ER) 0.05 + Endowus platform fee 0.3 = 0.35% pa (no dividends hence no dwt)Voo ER 0.03% + dwt 30% x 1.3% = 0.43%Cspx ER 0.07% + dwt 15% x 1.3% = 0.27%But don‚Äôt forget for voo and cspx you need to pay transaction fees to buy and also you get exposure to usd and forex spread  voo got estate tax whereas Endowus is denominated in SGD,btohqsg
May I know which is the most recommended place to dca CSPX? (SGD 100/mth),btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs Ireland domiciled and listed on LSE so you don‚Äôt have that many options - ibkr poems Saxo fsmone ‚Ä¶Wah if you only gonna do 100 per month then not worth it. The best is ibkr but there is usd 2 fx conversion fee and usd 1.7 transaction fee. Even if you enable recurring payment you still need to pay 1.7 usd,btohqsg
Good morning Sifu's.ü´∏ü´∑Has anyone got problem with receiving 1% Everyday+ cashback from hsbc ega account? I got my last cashback on 9/10/24 and till now I dont get any despite I have credit card spent and giro payments.,btohqsg
This is interesting. What is their fund size and the buy-sell spread ? Wonder if there is any catch ?,btohqsg
Hi  looking to get 0% installment plans from gain city etc.. and deciding btw OCBC titanium or dbs altitude..1) if I'm using dbs altitude for the 0% installment will it earn miles?2) if I'm using OCBC titanium rewards card will it the installment per month amount be count as part of the OCBC $500 credit card spending/month requirement for extra interest gain?3) what cards would u recommend for bulk buys?,btohqsg
So then does it count under your monthly $500 spending requirement to earn extra interest rate for OCBC?,btohqsg
Hi guys can i check if i have a purchase viaTrip.comof about 7k  what cards should i use to maximise the miles ah? Can i just use DBS vantage for the payment to get 1.5 mpd?,btohqsg
I can't spilt the payment as i will be staying in a hotel for 7 nights,btohqsg
Ocbc 360? Dont think so. In general  installment ipp are not eligible for minimum spending cuz u r splitting the bill anyway,btohqsg
If its not under any promo and must book today  I'd do 2k on dbs altitude  1.5 on wwmc  2k on uob lady solitaire and rest on whatever card if any balance left.Meaning i will do split bookings  2-3 nights on each cards.,btohqsg
I cant spilt hahaha cuz my other cards like WWMC  Altitude  UOB and HSBC all maxed out for this month le,btohqsg
And its a pretty last minute trip so i dony have any other general card except Vantage :(,btohqsg
Who say cant spilt lol. Spilt the hotel night,btohqsg
He meant the rest of the cards are max out liao  so cant split,btohqsg
I've maxed out my other cards le,btohqsg
There is also synthetic s&p500 ETF like I500 which you can buy onhmsg.link/ibkr,btohqsg
I think u have no choice but to put on vantage,btohqsg
And because the 7 nights is on peak period that overlaps Christmas and new years :(,btohqsg
Its okay la  sometimes no choice. Think of it this way  u still get something hahhahaha.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a unit trust so no buy sell spread. Asset under management is 3 billion sgd. the catch is that it is synthetic.,btohqsg
Sir Chris  what‚Äôs your own practice? Do you invest in s p 500  if so how ?,btohqsg
Must have missed this video. I usually watch your videos religiously!,btohqsg
