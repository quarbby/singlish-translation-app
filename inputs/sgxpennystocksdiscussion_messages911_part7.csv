"to be fair  same for Singapore which extends our law to Singapore citizens overseas.https://www.cnb.gov.sg/educational-resources/myths-and-facts-about-drugs/cannabis/singapore%27s-anti-drug-laws-on-cannabis*note  the article states ""Chinese citizens"". Which can be confusing - i think the article meant ""China citizens"".",btohqsg
Anyway impossible to enforce the China ban - will we allow PRC police to be stationed here on our sovereign soil? And there is no extradition treaty between PRC and SG?,btohqsg

S&P 500 hit another record close. Markets are concern with two central banks decisions.🎉Pika World Breakfast Updates- 20 March 2024🎉1) The Fed is expected to keep interest rate unchange in today's FOMC decision. At 2.30am   the FOMC conference will give Uncle Powell a chance to discuss the future monetary policy direction. Traders will hunt with an eagle eyes for details on the dot plot. Also  we might gain insights on the tapering of bonds plan.2) The BOJ latest move to pivot away from bond yield control will set the stage of a normalisaiton of policy. This policy effect is not as direct as before. The move away from negative interest rate is in line with market expectation who is worried that BOJ might go for a more aggressive move. This sent Yen to weaken against the greenback.The effects to Japanese equities is likely to have disparity. Pika World believes that BOJ might not be in a rush to remove the purchase of ETF operation. Given such circumstance  investors might be well positioned in reducing exposure to Nikkei Average index and shift allocation to Topix.Suppose the reverse happens  such that the BOJ reduces their exposure to Japanese equities  then Nikkei 225 might have an outsized impact than Topix index. Basically  Topix has greater sensitivty toward the dollar/yen movement given that it contains more value stocks.So far BOJ is observing consumer price carefully and has not project further rate hikes. A more aggressive stance might derail the bull market thus far.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
