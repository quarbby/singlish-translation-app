I only started for a few months too. But I realise stacking can be a bit hard on Lalamove due to the 1-hour restriction.Two scenarios I will stack:1. When the two orders are both same/very near to each other both in pick up and drop off point. (Doesn‚Äôt happen often but they do.)2. I tend to check for new orders when I‚Äôm nearing the drop off location (5-10min away). So if there‚Äôs one pick up that‚Äôs super near the first drop off  I can decide if I should pick up the order first (without risking being late for the first drop off) or pick up the order soon after I drop off (without being too late for it i.e. 20min to pick up),btohqsg
Also there are clients who are clear that they don‚Äôt need us to meet the 1 hour KPI. I‚Äôve clients who explicitly tell me that  e.g. ‚Äúyou can take your time as long as you send before 10pm‚Äù,btohqsg
I agree. What I tend to do is call and check with customer. Most of the time   they are flexible with timing as long as you check with them.,btohqsg
Yeah. There are many nice and reasonable clients among the some self-entitled ones. Sometimes we may not have the energy to talk too much to them  but I do realise good customer servicing like talking to them nicely usually can in turn benefit us sometimes.,btohqsg
Yup. I dun even call  them. Just whatsapp. Besides   that chat log will also serve as proof should customer twist  the story against you.,btohqsg
Oh one more thing: Oodle orders will write the time it is to be delivered  so be very careful when you take them. Quite a few times I know I can‚Äôt reach on time  I will make sure to let the client know and collect evidence to keep e.g. screenshot of GPS that shows ETA  photo that you‚Äôre at the pick up location (that you‚Äôre not late)  etc,btohqsg
It helps also to put ‚Äúarrive‚Äù the moment u reach the location before the doorstep. I mean technically that‚Äôs not wrong right ü§™,btohqsg
