Revolut not accepting Amex payment for topup,btohqsg
Not sure about TNG  but I guess not  as wallet top-up is not eligible for Citi Cashback+,btohqsg

Anyway to withdraw money out of youtrip?,btohqsg
i'd like to know too  which is best/ lowest rates&fee for overseas spending among Revolut  Youtrip  Bigpay SG/MY  or Amaze? thanks,btohqsg
For overseas and revolut for others,btohqsg
Youtrip rates is good.  But no cashback from cashback card.Amaze card is 0.3% higher than youtrip rate but if you pair it cashback card   you get 1.6% cashback which is better off,btohqsg
I used to use youtrip too but recently start to use amaze as will have cashback,btohqsg
Use Uob cashback top up grab top up YT then at least have 1.7%,btohqsg
Will try to look into amaze,btohqsg
Ok looks like the play is for me to get the grab pay card then as I already have the uob cash back card,btohqsg
Link amaze with master card works also,btohqsg
Is grab card still useful? I just got mine,btohqsg
