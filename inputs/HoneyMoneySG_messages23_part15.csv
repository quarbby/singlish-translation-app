o man  that's 40k worth of miles,btohqsg
Trying to buy appliances today before gst rise ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
just 1 percent  comparing with 40k miles!,btohqsg
Normal retail spending like clothing  dining using contactless payment ok to have 4mpd rite,btohqsg
once u use your citi reward tag with amaze  the status will reflect from pending to inside about 3 buisness day  then u will see your points all is multipled by 10,btohqsg
If use as physical card canâ€™t?,btohqsg
Hi all  deciding between hsbc revo and Citi rewards+amazeâ€¦ thoughts?,btohqsg
watch honeymoney for guide. bro  u use citireward card tap contactless is 0.4mpd,btohqsg
just get both lol  revo has no annual fees  but u be better of spending with citi because of that long expiry points  and also more exchange partner. but till amaze is being nerf ya.,btohqsg
Depends on your spending per month,btohqsg
hey hey  can i ask a stupid question  using uob one card to spend on klook  will it has any cashback?i also recently signed up CRMC + Amaze card too. not sure which one is better to spend on Klook.,btohqsg
If its less than 1k den go for reward + amaze,btohqsg
If more than use revo for contaless spend and reward for online,btohqsg
In this case no need amaze,btohqsg
So if I want to spread out my application (so that the credit score wonâ€™t tank)  which should I go for first? Hahaha,btohqsg
yo  Depends on what u wanna clock leh  u want miles or cash back? LOL ,btohqsg
bro just get citi reward first. don't think too much  honemoney has the video for 1 card solution. follow that one can le. no need so much headache,btohqsg
hm. i never use CRMC+Amaze card before.,btohqsg
waiting for the cards to arrive. haha,btohqsg
Klook is a online spend  meaning u dont even need amaze  once u apply in citi when approve  can use it virtually already.,btohqsg
Citi rewards points are in block of 5yrs. Take for e.g you activate ur card on 01012023  all points earned from 01012023 to31122027will end on31122027,btohqsg
i see i see. i just need to learn more on the miles or points this CRMC,btohqsg
yeah read more   and see more youtube  answer all there le. haha is quite simple  just rmb citi reward cant use for travel.,btohqsg
i see alot  but still have some doubts for certain spending method. easiest for me will be cashback,btohqsg
yea. i think amaze card cant be used for instore spending in korea right?,btohqsg
Just afraid that Citi rewards will go down the path of WWMC once amaze gets nerfedâ€¦ hahahaha,btohqsg
bro offline spend is no no  don't even talk about contactless LOL!,btohqsg
i don't recall can't leh. u should be able to use it,btohqsg
is it? i thinking of getting youtrip card just in case. as i planning to go korea in march  i heard now dun really uses cash alr. many places start to use cards or cashless payment mode.,btohqsg
Korea widely accept cash and cards. Donâ€™t worry about that. Also you can use youtrip or amaze. No issue with that too The only thing u have to consider is that the fcy spread for YouTrip is better. But amaze earns you point when tag with Citi rewardSo you have to weight for yourself. But for me I always use amaze for overseas and local spend. It is worth to spend more for the spread in exchange for the miles. But some may not be comfortable. So you have to dyod,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we can check OCBC rewards before statement?,btohqsg
Maybe u can call ocbc and try your luck,btohqsg
While my request to increase perm credit limit approved in 3 hours a few days ago  submit 8am and approve 11am,btohqsg
Got it. So far Iâ€™m still trying to explore the crmc amaze. I will try spending in local first.On safer side  I will just bring both cards and cash for my trip.,btohqsg
Always bring some changed cash and Sing dollars. Cause cash is king  ,btohqsg
