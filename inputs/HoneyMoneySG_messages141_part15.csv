Hi Guru  I heard from friends thattrip.comalways have promo going on 21 of every month   the discount can be substantial  is it true ?,btohqsg
I feeltrip.comhas promo every other day. Different days have promo for different locations. You have to keep checking.,btohqsg
Personally I wonâ€™t buy air tickets from them. If there are any flight cancellation  delay etc  itâ€™s hard to get them.Hotels still ok to book from them.,btohqsg
anyone using iChange app  want to know do I need to convert to overseas currency before I can use the debit card? or does it work like Youtrip  just top up SGD will do?,btohqsg

Hi anyone have experience cancelling uob credit card application  while not forfeiting the sign up bonus? So that can use next time,btohqsg
What do you mean? ðŸ¤”Do you mean card churning? It's kinda pointless doing with UOB.,btohqsg
Not card churning  my friend accidentally applied for a UOB card for a big payment  but found a better alternative to get more miles. But now sheâ€™s wants to cancel the application before itâ€™s even approved so that she can sign up again in a few months for the new to bank sign up bonus,btohqsg
Call UOB I guess. But can't control. once her card is approved  timer for new to bank will start. And she may not get approved again in the future.,btohqsg
I see  so will it be better if she cancels after getting the card and waiting for 6 months to refresh her new to bank status?,btohqsg
not what i meant. I suggested calling uob/go to branch and try to cancel the application.,btohqsg
No so straight forward â€¦ most of the T&C state u cannot cancel a card within 12 months prior to the application . Some only require 9 months (like maybank). Some offer existing custom with small onboarding giftâ€¦. But if u cancelled and apply during the 9-12 months period   u r neither a new applicant nor an existing customer â€¦ ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Oh  but worst case scenario after 12 months she can be considered new applicant?,btohqsg
Typically she cannot have any existing cards or account with the bank   if I recall correctly,btohqsg
i just want to say. Get approved for a card then cancel it right away may affect your future application  even if you refresh ur new to bank status.,btohqsg
Really need to read the T&C carefully,btohqsg
I see  ok thanks all  I will ask her to go to branch to cancel the application if possible,btohqsg
Yea this is good. Hsbc ultra short term bond earns a return of avg 4.2% / p.aBut their 1.8% booster is only good for $50k. Not to forget there is another coupon 6% for 7 days cap at $100k.I wonder how much will be the nett return with moomoo if we buy this bond. Will it yield better returns than Tiger's Project play 6.8% 60 business days?I just received Tiger's 6.8% interest boosted coupon and $30 shopping vouchers yesterday 18 Nov.,btohqsg
Probably September u donâ€™t qualify so no bonus interest.What were your money amounts like inAugustSeptemberOctoberU can use fake but proportionate numbers to illustrate,btohqsg
Hi all  if I only choose to have 2 cc  is it better to have one visa one master. Or having both same master card is fine too. Any pros and cons? Thanks for answering,btohqsg

90% of the time visa and master are interchangable,btohqsg

Where u get the hsbc promo 1.8% and 6%  info?,btohqsg
Inside moomoo app. Earlier I invested in high risk equity  now want move the profits from it to bonds. I feel hsbc gif ultra short duration bond is ok. No need to go merry go round hsbc bank accounts and still get 1.8% fund coupons,btohqsg
Hi  which card did u end up using,btohqsg
Strange  I donâ€™t have this. I only see this. No 1.8% or 6% promo.,btohqsg

Once hit 1k spend on amaze + rewards. What would be the next alternative,btohqsg
Anyone knows UOB Nation of Saver promo interest is given once Only like 1k if the amount put in is 150k ? Or it will give 1k every month for the duration of the promo (e.g 5-6mths) ? Assuming you meet the 2 criteria.,btohqsg
1k once (gift) but you continue to earn interest(4%) every month.,btohqsg
Hi Which bank credit card best to be used overseas for spending ?,btohqsg
Do you like cashback or miles? Any countries in mind?,btohqsg

Donâ€™t bother. Current moomoo promo is pretty lousy,btohqsg
Have anyone tried to apply for the UOB Prvi 5mpd promo? Will they inform you that the application is approved? Currently they have only reply by thanking me for my interest but idk if this promo has been activated for me,btohqsg
