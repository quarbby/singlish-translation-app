btw for ios user  what card is better for xnap pay? since amaze card can't be added to apple wallet,btohqsg
I m a user of it..I chose it over other miles card is because it recognize up to 0.17 spending  coz their formula to the points calcution is roundup($ x 3) = ptsSo 0.17 x 3 = 0.51 round up as $1 means 3 ptsThen 25 000pts = 10k milesSo I can sorta recognize those .90 purchases whereas alot of banks r $5 block  means 4.90 no miles/pts awarded or 9.90 only $5 recognizedThe other bank u can consider is citibank miles card as they recognized round down but $1 blockOr hsbc revo also $1 block,btohqsg
Ooo which promo code is this?,btohqsg
hsbc revo 9x point no $1 block,btohqsg

Is UOB Preferred Platinum Visa good or no? It seems to earn 4mpd on almost all transactions via mobile contactless  but I don't see people recommending it in this community,btohqsg

If you spend $4.99  how many miles you will get?,btohqsg
Zero  it's per 5 dollars block,btohqsg
If my UOB EVOL approve at the start of this month and the statement is on 15th. Does that means my spending so far does not have cash back,btohqsg
Call in to ask to change date,btohqsg
Usually firsts months hard to Match,btohqsg
‚Ä¶.and also call in to appeal 2 months later.,btohqsg
Can appeal ? If no 6.67% Cashback it's like useless just to get the 5% interest on UOB one,btohqsg
