This clause has been there for years lol,btohqsg
i meant if they want to exclude other banks credit cards cashback on giro  they wouldn't just state HSBC credit card.,btohqsg
CSO verified insurance payments will still be eligible. üéâFor now.,btohqsg
Sorry how does this work?Start from 95k. Then each month increase the balance by 500?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best premier banking account you guys recommend? Currently have ocbc 3.3% so want to see if there‚Äôs better deals,btohqsg
Like I said  that clause wasn't changed since day 1. They can even remove it because HSBC themselves are a financial institution lol,btohqsg
Maybank Manchester United Card (you can skip this if 1. You are not a Man U fan 2. You can't be bothered to wait till they win a game),btohqsg
Anyway i just texted my RM to clarify  her response is paying other bank credit card NOT affected.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows what is the best credit card for $1800 travel agency fee? Leaning more towards cashback cards,btohqsg
Ya I hope so too that my RM is good and correct with her response. Also too lazy to change the GIRO even if it's excluded. Nothing we can do if HSBC nerf it  just hope for the best,btohqsg
Called in to the call centre  cc bill payments still eligible  as long not self initiated on online platforms,btohqsg
So no need change GIRO to cc billing organisations ü•π (for now),btohqsg

I redeemed/exited moomoo sgd money market fund today but cannot withdraw it to my bank account. Was told it takes 1-2 days to be withdrawal. Is this normal?,btohqsg
usually they said wait for 7 days,btohqsg
yes if you have additional funds since you won't get the funds from the sale. Also  you risk not being fully allocated,btohqsg
what card do you guys use to pay town council?,btohqsg
will you get points for amaze wallet foreign currency transactions ?,btohqsg
Yes if it is not excluded mcc,btohqsg
Yes  but make sure redemption amount >= application amount,btohqsg

Just walked out of HSBC Branch.Everyday+ 1% for Insurance & Credit Card payment is safe!Only crypto and investment brokerage accounts that people have been gaming the system is excluded.Before this people just giro $50k in & cash out the next day.,btohqsg
anyone knows the exchange rate for amaze wallet for SGD to USD ?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so  from website FAQ  allotment date when cash is deducted is before the month end‚Ä¶,btohqsg
so sad they closed the loophole but it was inevitable...,btohqsg
OLD everyday+ HSBC T&C  for future reference in case anyone wants,btohqsg

Noted  so i dun need to do anything till 1 may  thanks,btohqsg
Does anyone know what‚Äôs the MCC code for CTC Travel?,btohqsg
Interesting update. Maybe due to my previous query to their cso. They removed the possible fee comment. I just withdraw sgd from interactive brokers today. No fee comment.,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs 4722 if it‚Äôs non kris+Some one mention it before. Can search for 4722,btohqsg
If u have already maxed out ssb  cannot.. u redeem liao  must wait for the next mth then can apply. If haven't maxed out  yes can apply in same mth,btohqsg
Not true. I done it before.,btohqsg

thank you for confirmation. Effort of filling up form didn't go in vain,btohqsg
If you are new then you might apply for a high interests salary crediting bank account which likely is UOB one. Best to choose 1/3 cc to spend $500/month. UOB Evol  UOB Lady or UOB One,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fine as there‚Äôs official guidance.https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/singapore-savings-bonds#:~:text=Yes. Individual%20Limit%20of%20S%24200%2C000.If I have reached my Individual Limit but have submitted a redemption request  will I be able to apply for new Savings Bonds within the same month to bring my total holdings back to the Individual Limit?Yes. You can redeem your holdings in SSB and apply for a new bond in the same month  provided you are within your total Individual Limit of S$200 000.However  you must ensure that there is sufficient money in your bank account at the point of application as your redemption proceeds will only be returned to you by the end of the second business day of the following month from when you¬†submitted the redemption application.,btohqsg
UOB one getting nerfed already   may want to consider OCBC 360  currently got 5.2% promotion for first 2 month on new acc opening,btohqsg
hi guys  is there anything similar to gxs savings account with better interest and no minimum amount? thanks,btohqsg
its for the first 2 months of account opening,btohqsg
DO note 2.88% is until end of Jun,btohqsg
ahhh okay thanks  any idea what it‚Äôll drop down to after that?,btohqsg
The promotion is until end of May,btohqsg
why not consider MMF at 3.6~% right now,btohqsg
It is likely banks will revise their interest rates this year. But you should still take advantage of the promotional interest,btohqsg
Hi  is this 3.57% cashback on HSBC Revolution extended beyond 31 March 2024? It currently reflects that the the conversion rate of $10 for 2800 Reward Points on the HSBC app.,btohqsg
ah i‚Äôll look into it  thanks!,btohqsg
I will contribute one more#dp!CSO reply:As per checking further in the record  from 2nd May 2024  GIRO for financial institutes that deals with Trades  Stock Exchanges and Crypto. Some examples are: iFAST  moomoo and Interactive brokers is no longer eligible for the cashback.Credit Card bill payment to other banks credit card will still be eligible to earn the cashback.,btohqsg
"but MMF is considered an investment ah   so there will be ""risk"" even though its very very low",btohqsg
Now specific institution names also have ü§™,btohqsg
yep! may i ask what mmf you invest in?,btohqsg
most people are using moomoo fulerton SGD cash fundi am not using MMF because i am using UOB one currently @3.85%Once the UOB nerfs comes in then i will consider changing to MMF or OCBC,btohqsg
Yes  redeemed yesterday 1/4 at this rate too. Though specified nowhere,btohqsg
GurusIf I want to trade sgp  Hk and USA  stocks predominantly. Currently using std chart as platformIs ibkr the best platform to go for?,btohqsg
Do note the difference between saving account and MMF in terms of liquidity  capital guaranteed. You should have at least one saving account with fund for emergency purpose,btohqsg
Heard SC bonus$aver interest rate got nerfed  Is OCBC 360 our last fort left?,btohqsg
i believe that MMF could be considered emergency funds as well   cause it takes 3-5 days to withdraw which is quite decently liquid. As for emergency purpose   i think it differs from one person to the other   in my case there won't be any emergency funds needed. which i do keep 5-10k aside,btohqsg
this one is low chance  but in the event of a financial crisis.. a money market fund has the right to halt redemptions.,btohqsg
ohhhh because the MMF not enough cash ?,btohqsg
yeah MMF doesn't hold your cash as cash in the bankMMF will use your cash to go invest in short term bonds  fixed deposits  fiduiciary deposits.. etc..so example if 50% of the investors want their cash back.. impossible for them to return in 1-2 days time,btohqsg
AND MMF has no SDIC insuranceto be fair.. i would say both bank accounts and MMF are definitely low risk..but cannot assume both are equal.. they are still different,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  my meaning is that you must have sufficient funds as stated. One cannot use the redeeming funds to buy new ones in the same month,btohqsg
With the drop in UOB and Standard Chartered interests.. where is a good place to park 200k idle funds? Is there any changes to UOB stash account which sits at 5% for 100k savings..,btohqsg
UOB One Bonus interest in! (second final 5% month)Magical figure = SGD420.62,btohqsg
Yup  your application can‚Äôt even go through if u have insufficient funds. I was addressing OP on whether SSB will reject the application (due to max cap) despite the same month redemption.,btohqsg
Another cso sayWe advise the GIRO payment to pay other bank credit card bill is excluded transactions.,btohqsg
we should STOP ASKINGjust observe from May 2024 what happens...,btohqsg
Serious? I thought it was 5% when you put in a 100k but you can't perform any withdrawal.,btohqsg
It's always been 3%  you rather have 150k in UOB One for 4% in May.,btohqsg
See the EIR and not what they promote,btohqsg
Im sorry I can't send photo here.. but I've read it carefully that it is 0.05 base interest + up to 4.95% when MAB remains the same or increase.,btohqsg
Yes I got that figure too.. it doesn't add up to 7.8 as well.. weird.,btohqsg
Lol there‚Äôs different rates for tier. Just see the EIR instead,btohqsg
Yes I did. The 5% only eligible for 100k deposit,btohqsg
5% is only for the last 30k,btohqsg
Oh so that's how they add up? Hah... Okay guess I'm done with UOB,btohqsg
You did not see the tiers properly then..,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what the tiers are for lol,btohqsg
I started the account in the UOB branch and I was told by the staffs la...,btohqsg
That's why I took out from Moomoo cash plus and put in UOB.. maybe it's time to find a better one..,btohqsg
uob v good giving false impression.. hahah..,btohqsg
You guys going for T-bills and SSB ?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not false impression. It‚Äôs true that it gives 5% or 7.8% but on different tiers. All banks does this,btohqsg
if you go for v v v secured way to park money,btohqsg
just give us the final % as a way to count the final return.. i see it as marketing gimmick imho,btohqsg
It‚Äôs in their website known as EIR  isn‚Äôt that a clear enough indication? They didn‚Äôt state it‚Äôs 7.8 for the whole 100k,btohqsg
Yea I want to be secure.. I already have about 100k in high risks investments and I prefer security for what I have now..,btohqsg
Maribank 2.5% after 30 June if no extension. GXS Pocket 2.68% will be higher then.,btohqsg
UOB One is 5% p.a. on $100k now.UOB One will be 4% p.a. on $150k in future.,btohqsg
Then you can go for either mmf or syfe cash+,btohqsg
my biggest regret was not to buy SOLANA coins when it was like $10..,btohqsg
Thank you.. maybe I'll just try the 150k one first..,btohqsg
Possible they will extend since it‚Äôs still one of the lowest at 100k balance,btohqsg
I'll read about it. Thanks for your input bro.,btohqsg
I also can say I regret not buying BTC when it was $123 lol,btohqsg
Hahaha yes definitely. It was once below a dollar..,btohqsg

After completing the deposit task and becoming eligible for the 40-day 6.8%p.a. guaranteed return  at least one Cash Plus purchase must be made to start calculating the returns,btohqsg

Oh.. wha. Kinda disappointed with the UOB interest drop.. I know it's a sooner or later thing.. but I didn't expect it to be so fast.. I just started this for 3 months üò¢,btohqsg
Maybe the best option now is to invest in equities.. if can afford small risks.,btohqsg
UOB Stash account at 3%* p.a. you mean? You can put 150k to UOB One account for 4% p.a.. And participate in the earmark promo.,btohqsg
It is good that government launched SSBs and it allowed many people in Singapore to easily invest $100-200k of their funds into no-risk instruments paying 3% p.a. ish..Rates when come down  can really come down fast and we end up looking at 1-2% p.a. accounts.,btohqsg

That's why CardUp to bypass the exclusion. Another problem is it's Visa which not a lot will take for recurring premiums  so CardUp.,btohqsg
Serious ah!? Okok! Thanks later I try!,btohqsg
Yup. For me  GE accepts visa. So I split 50-50 to save on cardup fees instead of 100% cardup,btohqsg

i have never seen this MMF dropits considered an investment so its for sure not guaranteed capital,btohqsg
If you want capital guaranteed go for savings acc,btohqsg
There is a risk to MMF as it is not capital guaranteed and not as liquid as saving accounts but in return it can give you better returns. So you have to decide what are you looking for.,btohqsg
Anyone able to advise. For UOB EVOL  when will i get the cash rebate?1) The first billing month?2) The following month for the previous cashback?,btohqsg
i think it should be installment plan offer by Amex itself when you pay a big amount transaction (e.g 1K from flight) - Not from atome/shopback (installment)just like other card bank have offer installment plan interest free -when you pay big  amount transaction. (if you convert to installment plan - Mostly it will not eligible for Cashback or Mile),btohqsg
For condo owners...1. Any recommendations to get essentials or all cost home insurance? If I'm looking at GE  the premium is about 2x for all cost. But I'm not so sure if it's worthwhile.

Hi  for uob one card  if I use it at uob$ merchants  does the spend get included for:1) uob one card cashback tiers ($500/$1000/$2000)2) uob one bank account interest ($500 per month)?,btohqsg
This means that is more worthwhile to use other bank credit card now then the equivalent HSBC card cos other bank I can still giro the bill to get 1% rebate,btohqsg
1 in Jan and 1 is Apr okBoth in Jan or both in Apr no,btohqsg
After the countdown ended  can you withdraw all the fund back to the bank. Then register the 6.8% promo and deposit from the bank to enjoy the latest 6.8% promo? Thank you üôèüèª,btohqsg

Question. If I link Amaze card with UOB Lady and use it to pay for overseas travel expenses (MCC4411)  when Amaze charge UOB  will it be the same MCC code to earn the 4 miles/ dollar?,btohqsg
Thanks. I thought Amaze will charge UOB using their own MCC which may not get the 4 miles per dollar.,btohqsg
Never have been this caseIt only change offline to online transaction,btohqsg
So  I will get the 4 miles per dollar. Right?,btohqsg
Yes correct if the MCC under is under the category you selected  so yes,btohqsg
So now we know the reason why HSBC decided to nerf it lol,btohqsg
yes basically doing nothing at all and money just flow into the bank account.,btohqsg
Shopee = Uob one for 10%,btohqsg
If go for miles.. which is better? üôèüèª thanks for sharing,btohqsg
What options are there ? Dint know we could giro Cc payments and get rebateÔºå interesting,btohqsg
Can use HSBC Revo for Shopee as well. One of the last few safe use cases,btohqsg
this is why bank payment will eventually will be nerfed too. aiya don't discuss this. hsbc rep reading comments and taking notes.,btohqsg
Can always pay revolution using DBS card then giro DBS bill from EGA,btohqsg
Pay using Dbs card will incur cash advance fee isn't it ? Quite risky imo,btohqsg
hi  a question about the uob one nerf  lets say i have been maintaining avg of 100k in uob one thus far (til 30th apr)  so after the change even if i have 150k on 31st may  will i only have an avg balance of 110k (100*4+150)/5?,btohqsg
Sorry what? Why did you calculate like that?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not an annual monthly average!,btohqsg
ah my bad  i thought it was avg of end of month balance to date  so its an avg of the balance of only the whole month?,btohqsg
May i know how starting a business can reduce income tax?,btohqsg

those who participated in the uob promo and locked up 100k will be very sad in May if they do not have another 50k to topup to 150k. this is a good example to show future generations what are some possible risk they need to accept when they lock their money.,btohqsg

Hi! Anyone knows how I can upgrade to HSBC Premier for the EGA account? Tried submitting the form via their website but have not heard back from them,btohqsg
For this ocbc 360 promo  i assume that the save criteria will also be able to stack right? Just that no x2 the interest on first 75k. Just follows normal 360 rates?,btohqsg
no i dont think can stack,btohqsg
After the end period  closely monitor if the agreed 6.8% is credited to your account as coupon.1). If the coupon is not credited by Moomoo  remember to chase Moomoo.2). If the coupon is partially credited by Moomoo  remember to chase Moomoo to topup the difference.3). If it is fully credited  remember to click the coupon to redeem it.Failure to do so may result you getting 0% instead of 6.8%.Good luck to you.,btohqsg
Meaning if im new to ocbc 360 if i hit the ‚Äúsave‚Äù criteria i dont get additional interest?,btohqsg

Consolidate your miles and keep both UOB cards you‚Äôve listed. The rest depends‚Ä¶. WWMC has 12 month expiry only but if you can accumulate enough a year to transfer 10K miles out then no issue  CRMC is quite strong with only travel being excluded  HSBC recently got nerfed but still useful for dining or ride hailing.I would say CRMC covers WWMC and HSBC Rev. The travel that can‚Äôt be covered by CRMC will be covered by UOB KF cardComplement with UOB lady‚Äôs and you can charge dining or travel to it too. 9X points not subjected to $5 blocks for lady‚Äôs so that‚Äôs a good thing,btohqsg

Anyone got review on thisHugo Platinum Visa Debit Card is a numberless card,btohqsg
Looks like a card for people who can't save their own money ü§°,btohqsg
Waivable. Bonus miles also came in early at 2 months before AF for me,btohqsg
Why not buy gold directly from a bullion store?,btohqsg
How about the bonus for the last 2 months? It will be credited the next year?,btohqsg
Not too sure  but no impact to me since I only use it for Kris+ during those two months,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtwithdrawal either over the counter or electronic transfer (havent tried this but bank teller told me even if have mccy account in dbs still got charges as its usd to usd),btohqsg
USD Cash Withdrawal at the counter. I believe almost all banks will charge for this.USD electronic transfer depends on which mode you use.A) I can confirm 100% that SCB USD Remit into Interactive Brokers USD account is 100% free of charge.I SUSPECT the rule is as long as you remit into a US domicile USD account  it is free of charge. I have not tried remitting USD from SCB SG to say DBS SG. I suspect that SHOULD incur a charge especially from the receiving bank side as they need to go through a correspondent bank.B) I can confirm 100% that if you issue a local USD cheque from SCB USD account to a Singapore Bank's USD account  SCB will charge you USD3. Whether the receiving bank wants to charge you  you have to check with them. My receiving bank did not charge me but it was an investment account so maybe they are more relaxed on that.,btohqsg
I also just got mine for ocbc credit card. 6 months sia.,btohqsg

Anyone able to tell the difference between crmc w/ amaze & UOB lady‚Äôs w/ amaze?beginner towards miles card!,btohqsg
amaze+uob lady only give 4mpd for merchant category codes (mcc) that fall under your selected category.amaze+crmc give 4mpd so long mcc is not excluded and not travel/transport,btohqsg
Tng recognise trust card as credit card even if u switch to savings acct mode,btohqsg
OP sounds like lady.. should open lady savings account now.. and can earn 6mpd if $10 001,btohqsg
For spending of $10 001? Or for deposit for UOB one account?,btohqsg
maintain MAB of $10 001 for uob lady savings account can earn you BONUS 2 mpd for up to $2k spend a month if you are lady solitarire.,btohqsg
Lady can choose travel cateogry for 4 mpd which is N.A. for citi rewards,btohqsg
Go china   use what payments method. Anyone can recommend me ?,btohqsg
Understood. Thanks!btw for UOB lady savings account  it does not have any interest aspect like UOB one account right? lady‚Äôs account will be for additional bonus miles?,btohqsg
uob lady savings accounts pays negligible cash interest 0.05%.. take it as 0.Only use it for the bonus miles  and keep your balance at the minimum of each tier. With $10 001 being the sweet spot,btohqsg
I'm trying to cancel my Citi credit card. They are offering me to stay spend 300 in May and rebate 150. Is it considered legit or good deal?,btohqsg
Essentially if keep $10 001 in lady‚Äôs account  with lady‚Äôs card + amaze  will be 6mpd for selected category  capped $2k per month.And crmc w/ amaze  just 4mpd no selected category but not applicable for travel/transport.++ both cards have no minimum spend / month.Right? üòÖ,btohqsg
Can . After get then cancel,btohqsg
Which credit card would ideal be the best to take. I drive  local groceries shopping.,btohqsg
Yeah will need to remove and link my trust card again  on TNG wallet app,btohqsg
thank you!if I link my lady‚Äôs card to my lady‚Äôs account  can I still ‚Äúuse‚Äù the same lady‚Äôs card to UOB one account as $500 eligible credit card spend?,btohqsg
It only worth if you confirmed u will spend $2k on that month.,btohqsg
if I spend <$2k  would the $10 001 be btr sitting in UOB one account rather than lady‚Äôs savings acc?Doing a little maths seems like $10 001 btr for sitting in lady‚Äôs savings account right?,btohqsg
TLDR: open Uob lady savings account. Put $10k. Make sure u max close to $2k per month. The extra 4 000 miles is worth $60. Can offset the $10k opportunity cost which is approx $33 per month at 4% pa.,btohqsg
thanks a lot!if I link my lady‚Äôs card to my lady‚Äôs account  can I still ‚Äúuse‚Äù the same lady‚Äôs card to UOB one account as $500 eligible credit card spend?,btohqsg
Can you imaging if you only spend $200 on Lady that month  you are paying $33 for 400 miles.,btohqsg
They didn't announce any changes to it so safe to say it's going to work,btohqsg

Got a call from DBS RM. Apparently  knowing the interest rate for UOB and OCBC will likely be revised they ask me if I want to consider put the funds into DBS. Their saving account offer is not attractive. Also  I dont know if they have funds comparable to UOB United SG fund which you can get some returns on monthly basis. The only thing I taking advantage of DBS is their once in a while 3.6%FD for 3 months which I dont know if they will still continue.,btohqsg
If they cannot offer something decent  why are they calling you in the first place?,btohqsg
I recently did a 3.3% SD for 3 mths with DBS. But its for fulfillment for some new member rewards then i did this. Adding up about 6+%.,btohqsg
That I wont know. But if they observed my account history  I have been moving money out from my DBS out. And I have a few FD with DBS that is going to mature soon and I will probably move the funds out as well.,btohqsg
Legit. Your offer is damn gd  I‚Äôll use it. The best I got before is spend 100  get back 50,btohqsg
Physical or google pay can  but apply pay still doesn't recognize amaze card,btohqsg
Mari Invest giving 3.64% daily interest,btohqsg
take and cancel it 2 mths ltrüòÇ not sure does it work this way,btohqsg
Once you use this rebate offer for not cancelling  citi cso says can only cancel 12mths later,btohqsg
hmmmm prob not as good as cancelling and waiting it out to become a new customer and get a new ipad or smthg?,btohqsg
You are right. I was enticed by even that $50. Should have known better üòÖ didn‚Äôt realise got to tie down another 12mths to cancel  they purposely didn‚Äôt mention,btohqsg
yeaaa cos cheaper to retain u then welcome u back as a new customerüòÇ,btohqsg
actually curious question anyone knows how does singsaver make money through their promos for new customers though?,btohqsg
Who still putting 20k in core account (formerly chocolate finance) for 4.5%.,btohqsg

Hi all experts  is the subscription take time to reflect. I see the countdown alr started but my subscription still $0? TIA,btohqsg
Not sure if it works. But you can use the cashback. Make the account zero then cancel. That way they have no way to get anything back.,btohqsg
have but lousy...you might want to consider taking out everything from 1st may onwards.. then wait for next promo before earmarking against an empty (or $1000) account,btohqsg
I emptied out on 28mar waiting for new promo. now haven't put back. since no promo  I put back first and empty again on 30apr? what's the 1st May thingy?,btohqsg

Then which earmark amount u going for?,btohqsg
Am thinking since by May 1  new amount is $150k  so i can earmark $150k.Base capital now is $100k. But Mar MAB was lower due to some debiting of funds trf,btohqsg

actually UOB ONE card has minimum 3.33% cashback (equal to 2.22mpd) for ALL (except the usual exclusions) spending  so it is actually really almost THE ONE.don't think there is any miles card that can beat this for LOCAL SPENDING (all types whether Insert  Online  Paywave  or Applepay).

Nice details.Just to add  need to have spending from 4th statement onwards in the PRINCIPAL CARD HOLDER for the rebate to offset the bill.If Sub card spends  but principal card holder has $0 spend  the cash rebates will not appear (or only appear up to the principal card holder's spend).,btohqsg

in app exclusion is referring to using citi rewards via apple/google/samsung pay in apps. Shopback is online if use citi rewards directly,btohqsg
You can search TnC of CRMC. Restaurants is not excluded.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best card that earns most miles when buying SIA tickets totaling more than SGD20 000 per annum?,btohqsg
Hi. Does any credit card offer free travel insurance if we book flight tickets using the credit card. Thanks,btohqsg
As I have similar situation for 10k air tickets decided to go with cimb VI as I am not splitting cards. Although is cashback,btohqsg
UOB KF credit card. It allows u to earn an uncapped 3mpd which means 60k miles for u.,btohqsg
Thought in China most places only accept wechat and alipay  does amaze cc still accepted?Also can we use cc to top up wechat or alipay wallet?,btohqsg

Looking into getting lasik done at private clinic (eagle eye). what are your thoughts on the strategy of AMEX krisflyer for the welcome bonus to clock miles?

hi  what's everyone opinion on first CC if i were to compare between UOB lady card vs citibank premier miles?using the card for daily spending (more on dining & food/online spending) and looking for miles/conversion of milesand whether i should pair with AMAZE?,btohqsg
Lady is specialist card. Premier miles is general card. Can't really compare. U can pair citi reward with Amaze for 4mpd.,btohqsg

Hi all  looking to confirm some queries on OCBC 360 account.1) Just opened OCBC 360 account yesterday. For the Save criteria  i‚Äôm assuming this will qualify as long as my MAB goes above $500 for the month as reference to ‚Äúprevious month‚Äù will be to $0 as account is newly opened is that correct?2) also on the Save criteria  is the MAB in comparison to balances following calendar month? (ie. 30 Apr  my MAB is $100 000  on 1 May if i top up to $100 500 and hold no lesser than that for the entire month of May  my MAB would have been said to increase by $500?3) on Spend criteria of spending $500 on 90n card  is the spending criteria counted based on posting date or transaction date? (eg. If i paid via paywave on 30 Apr  and the transaction is only posted on 4th May  does it count as Spend criteria for May or Apr?)4) on Salary criteria  does it matter on which date in the month salary is credited to your account? eg as long as salary is credited ($1800 and above) via a corporate bank account between 1st Apr and 30 Apr  it qualifies and fulfils salary criteria for Apr?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Hi Trazora  Stash account March monthly ave bal has $1k  can just deposit 100k on 30 Apr to participate April slot promo to receive cash credit in May  and earmark end 16Aug? Must still keep Mar bal 1k throughout the 4 months? Thanks,btohqsg
ALTERNATIVE VIEW:If you have big foreign currency spending ($50k per year) you can consider using PRVI Amex... get free limo as well as 20 000 bonus miles as well as guaranteed annual fee waiver,btohqsg
2) Yes  u can track ur save balance on ocbc website ibanking  app cannot. if 1st of the month is PH or weekend it wont count so be careful on that  if u only top up 500 on the first of the month and the 1st is weekend  average increase wont be 500. will be less cos the first few days balance still using the previous month end balance which wasnt ph or weekend3) posting date. May4) doesnt matter. yesu can also double check with ocbc via hotline but this is how it works for me,btohqsg
How about uob krisflyer + amaze combo? Is it good?,btohqsg
this in my opinion only good if you happen to have a MASSIVE luxury goods spend that is within the white list MCC (better double check and triple checked with amaze+empty wallet before you do).e.g. branded watch or branded bag.,btohqsg
and of course you must spend $800 within SQ Group,btohqsg

Your earned cash back will be stuck if u don‚Äôt use it the next month,btohqsg
It‚Äôs Plunging Chicken and it‚Äôs rather bad promo now,btohqsg
Hi all sharing ghe new big saving promotion for uob one. I am now in the current rising dragon promotion. As I already got earmarked 100k for march until june does this means I have to topup 50k is the best so I can enjoy interest still to max 150khttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/promotions/save/index.page?s_cid=grm:sg:owned:onl:pweb:productpg:bu:na:casa:010124-300324-:Q1SAVE24:na:na&vid=na&pid=CD07Q1SAVE24,btohqsg
is this more worth it than converting to miles? how should we value this at?,btohqsg
Some balances cannot be converted to KF miles and will be stuck as KrisPay miles,btohqsg
For uob salaryplus promotion if anyone can share what's direct credit service on cdp dividend? If I just buy t bill and get interest does it count? Thanks,btohqsg
When signing up cc to get bonus miles from paying annual fee  when does the annual fee get charged? On 1st statement?,btohqsg
thank u ! if can convert to KF miles is more worth than the 20% miles back right?,btohqsg
Depends on the camp you‚Äôre on  but since I value miles @ 1.25c each  I rather keep them as KF miles and for events like these.. I use it to burn off krispay only miles that I cannot convert into KF üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Oic! I value them at arnd 1c ea only  do u think I value them too low? haha,btohqsg
KrisPay miles are usable in KrisPay at a rate of 150 miles = S$1 soooo(Sauce)But yeah overall of course must see if you collect miles to begin with la (a pure Cashback fella most likely wouldn‚Äôt have much miles collected before it expires in KrisFlyer),btohqsg
For UOB frequent flyer conversion program (ad-how)  I just need to register once and I can proceed to redeem miles right? I don‚Äôt have to fill up the form every time I want to redeem  is that right?,btohqsg
Yes once can Liao. Then manual transfer using Uob app,btohqsg
This is from OCBC.. let's just put salary and save .. (with 100k) ..Is it accurate that a 6.4% will be given?,btohqsg
Of cos will spend more than 500.. so does  it make it 7% ?,btohqsg
What categories u plan to do for the 7%?,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt add like that. Look at the EIR Effective interest rate. Salary and save is 4% for 100k.,btohqsg
Where did u see the 6.4%?,btohqsg
Just purely savings salary crediting and spending,btohqsg
The website lo. I screen shot that couple minutes ago,btohqsg
If 7%  the whole Singapore will dump their money into OCBC,btohqsg
Will it did when UOB had that offer lol,btohqsg
I see here see there. Don‚Äôt know how u get 7%,btohqsg
7% Only reminds me of the GST we used to have,btohqsg
As@leechee2advise.. I was wrong. My apologies.,btohqsg
Shall we enter moomoo after this month with UOB?,btohqsg
6.4% is only applicable on your $25k out of $100k.,btohqsg
If you really want 5% or more  you can‚Äôt really get from HISA  you have to get bank or reit stocks.,btohqsg
Oh I see! Thanks thanks. Im just seeking the best interest and it's not easy to get a good deal...,btohqsg
If you can do Spend + Save + Salary  you can consider OCBC. Only hassle is you need monitor your MAB. So you may want to have another account for holding and deploying purpose without disturbing OCBC MAB.,btohqsg
It is easy to read uob mab but not sure about ocbc,btohqsg
But now ocbc 360 and hsbc ega is highest interest now...,btohqsg
You spend extra time just to get that extra percentage of money. You know how much time is worth and decide yourself. HISA to me is just to have a monthly source of passive income and don‚Äôt have to earn the highest. My time is better spend deciding what to invest in. MMF  stocks  Tbills etc. these can earn more.,btohqsg
Summary of some high interest bank account changes from may 2024:1. Uob one change from 5% to 4%2. Standard chartered change from 4.68% to 3.68%3. Hsbc ega no more 1% credit card spend rebate,btohqsg
my man mouse hunter spent that extra time to figure out so those who wanna earn that interest gain don‚Äôt have to  mad respect üôèüôè,btohqsg
Now is whether OCBC will revise. If they do  it will likely in May,btohqsg
i opted for ocbc 360 at first becuz it‚Äôs the most hassle free as compared to uob etc  now it‚Äôs one of the highest interest ones lol  the nerf is coming for sure,btohqsg
They usually give 1 month notice. So if nerf should be 1st Jun onward,btohqsg
I started with UOB cos I don‚Äôt want to monitor MAB.  Maybe if OCBC don‚Äôt revise then I consider changing to OCBC. Anyway any of 3 banks doing well  I will be happy cos I bought stocks for all 3 banks üòÇ,btohqsg
Sry dont know if this is a stupid qn regarding ocbc 360‚Ä¶ transfer to my OCBC 360 account today(sat) will be reflected on saturday right?eg if my day end balance is 5k on friday  i top up 8k today  my day end balance for saturday will be 13k right? Or will the 13k be only reflected on monday and it assumes my balance is still 5k on saturday,btohqsg
Transfer from other banks? I don‚Äôt think so. Bank don‚Äôt work on weekends. You should do on working day to be safe,btohqsg
"hahaha banks dont ""work"" weekends  but the funds transferred are reflected. was just wondering how they account for it on the MAB standpoint for OCBC360. seems that there's conflicting...",btohqsg
That is the part. If they operate similar to UOB  the UOB one interest tracker will syn on weekdays and sometimes a-3 days later. It is best to do earlier  you don‚Äôt want to lose your interest just cos they syn a few days later,btohqsg
So MAB does it operate the same? We don‚Äôt know unless you call their customer service to ask,btohqsg
so if i change the context from above to 5k day end on sat  and i put in 8k on sun  will my day end balance for sun be 5k? or only on mon ?,btohqsg
thanks sir. so safe to assume that any funds added inbetween day ends will always settle and reflect in the day end balances except for funds added on sunday  where it will only be reflected on monday day end?,btohqsg
Are u prepared for not having the money back?,btohqsg
You want the interest. He want your principleüòÇ,btohqsg

Received Citi Cashback statement today. They adjusted bonus for Grocery to 5.8%  but none of my private commutes (CDG  Grab & TADA) received the bonus 7.8%. They must forgot to add it in their code ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
You have to use for the month after the 2nd quarter statement to use the cashback. Maybe like use $50 then pay the rest with EVOL?,btohqsg
You might want to calculate again. It should still be 8% cashback from groceries and 0.25% cashback from private commutes.,btohqsg
No. My calculation is correct. Refer to TnC,btohqsg
So your statement date is today and your transactions for private commutes from 1 Apr till 5 Apr are not 8% but instead 0.2%/0.25% only? Are they posted already?,btohqsg
All private commutes before 1st April got 0.25% and after 1st 0.20%. My base cashback is correct. Bonus given only for Dining & Grocery at 5.8% (I have few transactions only). And read TnC: bonus is for entire statement  not 1 Apr till 5 Apr,btohqsg
Here‚Äôs the explanation of how to calculate according to Citi:https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/cashback/citi-cash-back-card/pdf/cashbackFAQs.pdf,btohqsg
Ah I missed out that portion on computing. Maybe you need to call CSO to check on the system already. Assuming you didn't do wallet top-ups.,btohqsg
Private commute  petrol  dining and groceries transactions will earn the revised bonus cash back rates if yourstatement date falls after 31 March 2024 as bonus cash back is computed on your statement end date based on yourtotal spend amount.,btohqsg
You didn't do wallet top-ups right?,btohqsg
I think the issue is because they implemented Transaction Description for Private Commute. But it‚Äôs not always same as they put in the TnC. These are the descriptions on my statement:Cabcharge Asia Pte Ltd SINGAPORE SGGrab* Awith some referenceTADA RIDEwith some reference,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not a newbie. And my calculations is exactly if I remove bonus for Private Commute. And it‚Äôs excel  not manual calculations.,btohqsg
I think as long MCC and partial description is the same  the transactions should be part of their calculations. Maybe ask CSO  maybe they will readjust and deposit on a later date?,btohqsg
They put it in their TnC. And since asterisk (*) is missing (e.g TADA*)  it looks like it requires exact match. Anyway  I‚Äôll need to contact and appeal,btohqsg
"They put in TnC after the table  ""starting with description""  no need exact match. So definitely something is wrong with their system for the calculation on their end",btohqsg
Yup  there‚Äôs a bug in their code üòÇ,btohqsg
Their CSOs probably getting spammed for the last few days ü§£,btohqsg

Yes coz lazada is in the whitelist specific out in ocbc titanium tnc,btohqsg

hi  any thoughts on AMEX singapore airlines krisflyer Ascend CC? is it a good card?,btohqsg
For the current sign up promo for new and existing card holder looks attractive. You can read the review by Mile Lion. For the 2nd year onwards  it is not attractive for my spending habit due to compulsory annual fee.,btohqsg
is it advisable to hold both cashback and miles card? or shld i focus on one,btohqsg
Hi all. For income tax payment via cardup/ipaymy  do i need to disclose personal details (i.e NRIC) to perform the transaction?,btohqsg
Yes  if you are born after 1958. Based on the amounts you have in your RA  less cash top-ups/CPF transfers through RSTU  government grants and the unconditional $5k you can withdraw. So you will need at least $20001 in RA that is from your mandatory contributions  profits from investments and interests  on top of the $5000 unconditional withdrawal (withdrawable at 55)  which is a total of $25001. Reference can be foundhere.Take note that withdrawing from RA will reduce your monthly payouts from CPF Life.,btohqsg
Yes. Your tax reference is your NRIC.,btohqsg
Depends on your goals and how your spending can be split to the different cards.,btohqsg
For this uob promotion Am I eligible if I pay credit card bill payment (non UOB card)  via UOB banking portal ? I did not see the description GIRO-Inward Debit after my payment for the credit card bills via UOB banking portal. I guess not eligible ? Any idea ?,btohqsg
"Does the transaction start with ""Inward DR - GIRO""? My GIRO deductions usually start with that.Now I also feel kuku for not registering for this promo lol.",btohqsg
did u fill up and send interbank giro form?,btohqsg
I clicked on this and submit this form together with my UOB bank account number,btohqsg
Per the terms and conditions  monthly (set up with bank) giro deductions is not applicable for this promotion. Nope my transaction description is BILL Payment xxx.,btohqsg
Anyone facing issues submitting the form for the UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion?,btohqsg
"Read the tnc again. Itdoes notstate that. It states that you must not have any GIRO arrangement on any of your UOB accounts from Oct 23 to Mar 24.You must perform the bill payment viaGIRO form. Transactions starting with ""BILL Payment"" isnotvia GIRO and will not be eligible.",btohqsg
Oh okay. So GIRO form will need to be filled up meaning on and on going basis  giro deduction will happen due to the application solely for this promotion (?). I thought just filling up the participation form suffices. Just wanna be sure.Thanks!,btohqsg
If you already have any GIRO arrangements on any of your UOB accounts before Apr  you can just forgo that part of the promo already.,btohqsg

If your spend enough for cash back usually they have minimum spend per month,btohqsg
Probably can consider those unlimited cashback cards without minimum spend. While their main spending goes to miles card.,btohqsg
