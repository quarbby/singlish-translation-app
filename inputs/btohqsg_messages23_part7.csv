Thanks for sharingPer the article  it is not really PPVC doesn't have OCSRather  typically OCS refer to sanitary fittings  flooring  wall tiles etc in some roomsApplicant can choose whether to purchase OCS during flat selection  if that is applicable for the projectHowever  PPVC will come with sanitary fittings  flooring  wall tiles etc too  so there is no need to offer OCS again,btohqsg
