Lifelong learning must be advocated in full by authority. Use skillfutures to offset also can. ðŸ¥¶,btohqsg
I feel that if someone is taking slightly more time to move out from the turning box on a right turn without green arrow  it is still ok as you don't know what's visible from their angle and they might feel it is better to wait for a few extra seconds because of a previous experience possibly,btohqsg
Encouraging only those who donâ€™t drive for a long time doesnâ€™t really address the competency for the entire driving community,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s also the cause of why some get impatient before the turn on green arrows too,btohqsg
And the impatient ones also beat lights,btohqsg
So make everyone go back to basic 101 on a regular basis.,btohqsg
Yeah  goes both ways. But in the end  patience is important when on the roads. Don't anyhow honk at people who are trying to turn as well but might be waiting first to get a clearer view of the oncoming traffic,btohqsg
If car is being advocated for regular inspection check up  i am sure humans need that more,btohqsg
Indeed. Driving is not meant to be fast and furious but to take a slow moments to enjoy what others who cannot own and drive ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what the old unkers and aunties are doing on expressways lane 1 ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
The unspoken rule for driving fast on expressways these days are those of the trunk lanes,btohqsg
They drive faster than those on lane 1,btohqsg
A friend of mine recently got tailgated by the smaller lorry as well,btohqsg
Scary how they're getting so impatient and driving like that,btohqsg
Donâ€™t play playâ€¦ they are rushing for delivery? I will give way as they indicated their intents,btohqsg
I'm all for increasing the speed limit for the smaller lorries but they must do it in the right way because they certainly don't have the brakes to stop if anything goes wrong,btohqsg
Just give way. No point challenging a vehicle trying to go fast,btohqsg
Esp if one has no intent to move faster.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s not the case for those on lane 1 ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
You have to cut them on their left to pass them and watch your rear view mirror to observe and os about their slowness as you move along,btohqsg
Just let the cctv catch them and fine them accordingly,btohqsg
Way too many road hoggers in lane 1 nowadays,btohqsg
I have never seen anyone get a fine for road hogging  because it isn't an objective rule to apply like a speed limit,btohqsg
Most forgotten they have to give way if they are slower than 80kmh on lane 1,btohqsg
I notice old uncle and auntie lose to toxic ppl with family man sticker like kids on board,btohqsg
Like the case of section 377,btohqsg
High beam ppl when over take,btohqsg
I think the unsaid rule is just give way if someone flashes their high beams at you or turns on their right signal in lane 1,btohqsg
Give way if you see someone ocming up behind you who is faster than you  then merge back behind them when you have the chance,btohqsg
I like that idea of the signals that is well accepted in msia nsh,btohqsg
I notice those road hogger scare of super hogger like me,btohqsg
If they drive 70 and hog the road,btohqsg
I will go infront of them and drive 73,btohqsg
U see them get impatient then try to over take you,btohqsg
The high beams work more than signals in Singapore but a lot of the times  the hogger really turn a blind eye,btohqsg
The best way to deal with them is over take them and drive slower,btohqsg
I also turn a blind eye on those who donâ€™t even bother to turn on headlights at night,btohqsg
Let them have a taste of own medicine,btohqsg
I believe in calmer driving in most cases,btohqsg
They got the excuse to drive slow ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
ya but some time see your rear mirror and see thier frustrated face is funny,btohqsg
Yeah. Where got time to slowly move. Waste my petrol efficiency,btohqsg
they will compalint to thier wife  why i drive so slow,btohqsg
The wife will lame why you drive so slow to let other over take,btohqsg
Speed up then slow down a bit for Regen power,btohqsg
can waste thier petrol if they get agreesive by trying to over take,btohqsg
And there are those who brake too earlyâ€¦,btohqsg
then see thier frusstrated face again then stay in middle lane,btohqsg
Wear my brake pads unnecessarily when slowing down is all it takes,btohqsg
but road hoggers give u fair share of frustration  and entermaintment on the road,btohqsg
