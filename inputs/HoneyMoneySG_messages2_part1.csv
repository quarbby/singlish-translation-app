and I found that with PayPal  I had to pay the CCY conversion fee even for purchases in SGD (on Steam)🤔 no idea why,btohqsg
Then just use Citi cashback + with instarem amaze,btohqsg
👌 ok  thanks. I will try it,btohqsg
My Citi cashback is a VISA card and unable to pair with Instarem amaze. Do you know if Citi allow me to change to MasterCard ? Thanks,btohqsg
Just apply for a new one using my links🍯,btohqsg
And keep the visa one since it is discontinued. Then u have two cards to choose from if you need to max it out one day,btohqsg
seems that MasterCard is gaining some edge over VISA  especially for GrabPay top-up fees🤔,btohqsg
Buy 100 Qcoin then have 2%,btohqsg
Now that I just checked  they seem to have removed that 100 Qcoin option,btohqsg
How about q0010 gift card  still got 2%  can buy gift card and use for ownself?,btohqsg
Qoo10 $100 gift card still has 2% off. Can top up to own accountQmoney can also be used to buy Qcoin anyway,btohqsg

Need keep some spare cash if not no money buy in hahah,btohqsg

By the way anyone knows when uob absolute credit cashback  I have been topping up grab pay wallet but haven't received any cashback since sept,btohqsg
"Hi guys  I know in times like this it is really tough and I'm not going to sugarcoat things here. The stock market has been correcting/crashing hard the past few weeks and is at ultimate Fear  Uncertainty & Doubt. In times like this when you don't have spare cash it is pointless to say things like ""buy more into the dip""  so I will just share some things you could do.1) Cut loser stocks which you have low conviction in  and add to your high conviction stocks which may have fallen too. Consider it a portfolio slimming diet2) Do nothing and diamond hands all the way. Sometimes doing nothing is better than doing the wrong thing.3) Sell a portion of portfolio that enable you to sleep well enough. Nothing matters more than your own health.But whatever you do  just don't sell your winners and add to your losers  things rarely work out that way.#NOTFINANCIALADVICE",btohqsg
Bonus: Have some crypto as diversification  though they have pretty run up these two weeks as well,btohqsg
I think the cashback will automatically be credited in the following month’s statement. ie cashback of sep’s spendings will be credited in oct’s statement,btohqsg
@yumsushiis right. Usually 2 months after spend,btohqsg
It's abit unfortunate that when I start investing this happens. But before that  market had a bull run since mar 2020,btohqsg
I would say it's fortunate to see the market crash as a beginner 🤣 cuz now I'm young and not rich  so the impact of market crash will be very limited,btohqsg
the market is doomed to crash at some time  so the sooner the better,btohqsg
i think etfs still quite ok now,btohqsg
Can we enjoy the cashback benefits when using the instarem card be used to pay bills and insurance. Then link to a cashback card,btohqsg
Bills no  insurance unknown for 1% amaze cashback.For the linked card  if your card doesn't award rewards then linking it to amaze woudnt change anything too,btohqsg

What are the reccomend best cash back credit cards for students Vs new working adults?Uob one?,btohqsg
Student: maybank evibes/cimb awsm > grabpayNew adults: uob absolute amex > grabpay,btohqsg
This qn might be subjective or depends on own perspective but i just would some opinions. Does the normal cashback from say Evol or Frank card better or absolute amex > grabpay better?,btohqsg
Since Evol & Frank cards has cashback from online aka grab transactions  i can get cashback right? 🙏🏽,btohqsg
as long as you can hit their spending minimum..,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Alright thanks guys ☺️🙏🏽,btohqsg
Saw@ChrisHMSGYouTube poll about syfe's explaination email for their poor performance  anyone convinced by that ?,btohqsg
Anyways the market lately is not doing well so definitely will be hit  I am curious why they need to have an email explanation to justify their poor performance? Like they feel guilty or something 😅😂 hahaha,btohqsg
Is the email to all customer?,btohqsg
Yes  sent around 11am.I'm also suprised why they need to explain. It's not an active fund like ARKK,btohqsg
Perhaps because 100% of their portfoilios are negative returns? (for ordinary people without referral bonus).Be it core growth  equity 100  retis  custom  thematic  you name it  all negative returns regardless of DCA or lump sum.,btohqsg
Market in general not doing well.. probably money creeping towards crypto,btohqsg
if arkk explain i get it,btohqsg
Most popular but 100% portfoilios slumped into bear market? Strange !,btohqsg
Not surprising since they have the most outreach in social media,btohqsg
Just look at IG posts tagged with Syfe,btohqsg
