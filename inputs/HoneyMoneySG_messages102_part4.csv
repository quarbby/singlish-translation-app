I think this issue was discussed a while ago and the concluded is that the table has bad phrasing.Conclusions:You get bonus interest if your subsequent month month-end closing balance is more than current month.You get paid bonus interest on the average daily balance of the month you qualifiedMay I know what is the issue now? Since it is a 2023 promo?,btohqsg

Hi  I just received my amaze card + Citibank rewards. Iâ€™m still a little confused how to use it. Do I just carry my physical amaze card and use that all the time? Can add it to Apple Pay?,btohqsg
My opinion is only the $12k part is wrong. The statement shall use although the MAB of current month is higher than previous month MAB  but will not entitle the bonus because  current month end balance is lower than previous monthâ€™s month end balance.,btohqsg
Add ur Rewards card to ur amaze card thru Instarem app. Carry ur physical amaze card and tap it. Apple pay does not support adding amaze card in yet,btohqsg
Using the Citi rewards on apply pay doesnâ€™t earn you 4m is that right? Was a lil confused about the tnc re Apple wallet.,btohqsg
Nope its not considered online. But citi rewards does give 4mpd for some shopping MCC those pay thru apply pay can get 4mpd,btohqsg

Hi all  if my statement date is 19th  means 20th then will start afresh right?Also  for citi cashback credit card  the cashback is based on the transaction date  not the posting date is it? The tnc writes that it is based on posting date. However for the past few cashback that im receiving shows the transaction date on my bill,btohqsg
Anyway we all know. No idiot bank will pay interest for the whole month based on one dayâ€™s balance.But it is possible for one dayâ€™s balance to determine whether you are qualified for bonus interest or serve as a benchmark to calculate bonus interest rate.But the rate is always going to be applied on the average daily bank balance.,btohqsg
