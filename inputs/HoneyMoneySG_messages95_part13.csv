Ask them what is the difference between Majestic Leisure n borneotravelnetwork dot com website. This website accepts credit card. Likely mcc is 4722 n exclude by Citi rewards. U need a different credit card.,btohqsg
I was linked to borneotravelnetwork  but asked to use paypal to pay in MYR. Does ocbc titanium rewards works for 4MPD?,btohqsg
I‚Äôll just need a cc that accepts MCC 4722 yeah,btohqsg
Use Amaze empty wallet to confirm the mcc first.,btohqsg
Any idea if this will incur the 1% fee from amaze?,btohqsg
Check what is the mcc and google ‚ÄúAmaze 1%‚Äù.,btohqsg

Term provides the actual coverage truly needed  life is more of an add on,btohqsg
Thank you for replying..but i dont get what you mean. So after the earmarked amount has been kept by uob  is it ok for me to withdraw the balance amount that was left in my account?(which tally to my 31st dec balance),btohqsg
So is it ok to withdraw or not?üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
I would not.I would obey the rule where account balance = 31 Dec balance + $100k throughout entire earmark period.But I‚Äôm a play safe person. And I have not faced any issues with reward fulfilment.,btohqsg
Cos u already got the $558 and ear marked 100k,btohqsg
If any doubt just consult the CSO...,btohqsg
U can also compare this situation to signup gift. Official tnc says u have to keep the card for X months even after receiving the gift.Is it ok to cancel the card immediately after u receive the gift.You read the tnc and decide yourself Loh.,btohqsg

What is a better card for overseas spending  approximately 500 to 800 monthly.  A lot of online apps spend on transportation.1. Youtrip  Trust  Revolut2. DBS live fresh3. UOB Absolute4. Cimb visa infinite,btohqsg
Yes correct. But you miss out on the credit card quarterly cashback,btohqsg
If i use grab paylater and link to my uob absolute amex  still eligible for 0.3%?,btohqsg
SIA is selling some bonds right? can we buy them?,btohqsg
They are issuing not selling though,btohqsg
Did you attempt to raise your average balance to 100k? Thank you for asking as I am also wondering when would they clear the transaction since 29 is good friday,btohqsg
It's put up for primary placement. Like IPO on Thursday,btohqsg
Can you show us how to link Grab pay later to UOB Absolute?,btohqsg
Can you also indicate in the rewards/miles/cashback % you will get in each of the card for easy comparison?,btohqsg
Did not try. U mean they dont accept?,btohqsg
Hi seeking opinion on UOB Visa infinite card,btohqsg
I did not try. You can try first n if you encountered problem  then can post your question here  I believe some kind souls here will help to provide solution to you. If you can provide screenshot will be better.,btohqsg
Yes  I was calculating the monthly average balance for this month to get the 5% and would withdraw on 30th as it will drop significantly if I do it on 28th,btohqsg
And then they take the 588 back from the earmarked 100k after the earmarked period. ü§°,btohqsg
