"🎉Pika World Bite-Size Update - 9 June 2022🎉⛳Global central banks take stage🗽Wednesday showed weak performance across indices  partly due to the lack of conviction to take on more risks before the CPI on Friday. Moreover  market participants were concerned that central bankers are increasing rates to slow growth and cool inflation.Pika World is focusing on the Eurozone area. Their first-quarter GDP growth was 0.5% compared to the fourth quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year  the economy grew 5.4%. The strong figure may lead ECB to lay down their plan to move aggressively on interest rate hikes to fight inflation.🧨Interest rates  bond prices and economic activity🧸This is consistent with the expectation of the Fed to raise the interest rate by 0.5% in the next two meetings in June and July. Similar to the European bond  the US bond yields are rising sharply. Nonetheless  the lure of US bonds tends to depreciate in their attractiveness when overseas bond yields climb  prompting investors to sell their US bonds. The mechanism is such that US bond prices fall and their yield rises.The result is a gloomy one. A rising rate opened the can of fear that consumer and business spending will fall and affect corporate earnings. This threat lingers as there is no apparent data on how much the economic activity will decrease as the rate slows down spending considerably. A lack of conviction on the economy's direction deters market participants from moving to risk-on mode.🍄Bye Facebook  Aloha Meta🛎Today trading should see the ticker Facebook gone and replaced with ""META"". The new name is part of the company's realignment to its new growth engine coupled with a rebranding exercise.So take note as we begin a new wild ride in the market.It is 9 June  Thursday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a moonatic week!",btohqsg
