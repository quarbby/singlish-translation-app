Let X the no of heartbeats in 1 minute. Then X is a Poisson random variable.,btohqsg
Its apparently just a global parameter,btohqsg
Which makes it poor because they dont have a solid way to determine λ value,btohqsg
Or at least i cant find it in the paper,btohqsg
Wtf are we flexxing in chat group now,btohqsg
Basically  the healthier you are  the lower your heart rate,btohqsg
Yeah and idt it requires any maths to reach that conclusion,btohqsg
Clearly your definition of mathematics is too narrow,btohqsg
Which isnt required on day to day basis,btohqsg
To a lower limit  of course,btohqsg
I dont see a reason for math to exist ofher than to be a hidden layer and weights in a computer,btohqsg
That’s a pretty good reason to exist,btohqsg
Imagine needing maths to calculate calories,btohqsg
wtf you never cite the Nature Deep Learning paper,btohqsg
anyone planning to EAE to Poly ?,btohqsg
I think those planning to EAE are sleeping,btohqsg
Mcm   but kinda conflicted btw poly & jc... reading some articles too,btohqsg
What course do u want to pursue in uni,btohqsg
In certain industries  hands on experience is preferred more than theoretical understanding. In such fields  a poly to uni route is more valuable than a JC to uni route.,btohqsg
haha nice i applied there last year,btohqsg
not sure honestly  if I were to continue in the comm side it’ll be comm studies in wee kim wee/ba in comm suss,btohqsg
Did you get in there ?,btohqsg
50% of the intake is eae,btohqsg
Oh damn so where are you in now ?,btohqsg
only realised it didnt fit me during the interview haha,btohqsg
i asked the lecturer how close mcm was to a journalism sch,btohqsg
and then she gave me a weird look and started going on about how it was more on advertising and pr as well,btohqsg
and i didnt rly wan to do marketing so i noped outta theree,btohqsg
Honestly not sure on what I wanna do in future.  I have a knack for hosting programmes in school but not sure if something I enjoy to do can be something I can pursue as a career. Kinda wrecking my head since EAE is coming up and I had my eyes on MCM since Sec 2 until recently when I started having questions about what I mentioned above and whether job security would be there. Plus I wish to earn a decent salary as well. Some say go to JC is you are nt sure what to do. Here in Sec school I’m kinda struggling in A-Math and not sure if I should go JC.,btohqsg
Oh damn very brave of you !,btohqsg
Moreover I wish to also enter Uni and get a degree too...so I’m really conflicted at this point haha,btohqsg
Anyone out there who shared the same sentiments please do hmu yea ! Could really use some help,btohqsg
tbh u should just go for it and try first,btohqsg
unis nowadays also accepting more poly kids anyways so idt the stereotype is very true today,btohqsg
and everyone fails at amaths haha i was failing all the way until olvls,btohqsg
Wheres my 2:48 am gang at,btohqsg
Hello it is actually 2:50 am,btohqsg

Pretty sure kb applies for cs didnt he,btohqsg
Relief hahaha it means ntu fucking slow,btohqsg
Afaik that's the impression I got of him,btohqsg
Not sure what kind of subjects he likes,btohqsg
Have u seen his ABA personal statement,btohqsg
My bunk fucking burst laughing i tell u,btohqsg
Uh obv not HAHA I dont even talk to him,btohqsg
