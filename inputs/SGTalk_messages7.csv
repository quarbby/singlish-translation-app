By Mak Yuen Teen dated 20octIt was 18 May 2000. The share price of Kosdaq-listed Littauer Technologies in Korea had just reached an all-time high of KRW362 000. It had been trading at around KRW5 000 between November 1999 and February 2000. The Financial Supervisory Service in Korea began an investigation into Littauer. Littauer’s CEO  Heo Rok  was arrested for violating the Securities and Exchange Act and the share price collapsed in 2001.Sang Cheol Woo  a minority shareholder of Littauer  was livid. In 2003  he filed a lawsuit against Yoo Shin Choi  alleging that the latter had caused Littauer to enter into a self-dealing merger with a Bermuda-based company valued at some US$1.3 billion that Choi and his business partners controlled.Choi reportedly fled to Hong Kong. Woo won a civil judgement for US$4.5 million against Choi in Korea in 2011. This was the start of a drawn-out attempt by Woo to enforce the judgement across four jurisdictions – U.S.  Hong Kong  BVI and Singapore where Woo believed that Choi has assets in.By May 2018  Choi had exhausted all avenues open to him to challenge the Korean judgement which is final and conclusive. But to this day  the Korean judgement remains unsatisfied.In June 2016  Woo commenced proceedings in Hong Kong to recognise the Korean judgement. The trial was rescheduled from earlier this year to September 2021.In May 2017  Woo started proceedings in the State of New York to recognise the Korean judgement. In July 2018  the Supreme Court of the State of New York entered judgement in favour of Woo for the amount of about US$13.8 million.Woo then commenced proceedings in the BVI in April 2019 to enforce the Korean judgement and in June 2020  the BVI Commercial Court entered judgement in Woo’s favour.Choi challenged jurisdiction when Woo commenced action in Singapore in February 2019 to recognise the Korean judgement but was unsuccessful.Woo then applied for Mareva relief in the four jurisdictions of US  Hong Kong  BVI and Singapore. In April 2019  the BVI court granted Woo worldwide freezing injunctions against several BVI entities for up to the value of US$13.8 million.  The BVI entities are challenging the injunctions.Worldwide Mareva injunctions against Choi and Richard Lee and domestic Mareva injunctions against several BVI entities were obtained in Singapore in April 2019.On 15 September 2020  the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Court of First Instance held a hearing to determine three summonses: (1) the summons dated 4 June 2019 for continuation of an ex parte worldwide Mareva injunction obtained by Woo against Choi and the three respondents to the summons  Richard Lee  Azur Investissement and Trinity Capital Advisors Limited; (2) the summons of Choi dated 11 June 2019 to set aside the HK Injunction; and (3) Woo’s summons dated 18 June 2019 to lift the stay of Yoo Choi’s disclosure obligations under the HK Injunction.The HK High Court found in favour of Woo. The court judgement is available online here:https://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/ju/ju_frame.jsp?DIS=131421&currpage=TIn writing this latest article  I have drawn extensively from the court judgement.Who is Yoo Shin Choi?Unbeknownst to many  Yoo Shin Choi is known by another name - Charles Choi Spackman or Charles Spackman in short. Spackman is an American citizen and a permanent resident of Hong Kong. He is the son of James Choi Spackman  who was adopted by Americans in 1955 after his biological parents died during the Korean War.James Spackman was the first President of Prudential Life Insurance Company of Korea and in the early 2000s  served as president of the Group’s Asia Region  later becoming both president and CEO for the region.Charles Spackman (hereafter referred to as Spackman) graduated from Harvard University with an Economics degree and worked in a number of investment banks before establishing Spackman Group Limited in 1997. He is known for his generous donations to this alma mater.Let’s try Crazy Rich (and Easy) SingaporeDespite his legal tr,btohqsg
oubles  Spackman was able to list Spackman Entertainment Group Limited (SEGL) in July 2014 on the Catalist board through the placement of 69.44 million shares  comprising 50 million new shares and 19.44  million vendor shares at S$0.26 each. The issue manager  sponsor and placement agent was PrimePartners Corporate Finance (PPCF)  which also acted as its continuing sponsor until 7 March 2018. RHT Capital took over as continuing sponsor and remains its continuing sponsor today.The 32 risk factors discussed in the offer document did not mention the legal troubles faced by Spackman  who was appointed as Executive Chairman. Spackman did not own any shares in SEGL  only having a small deemed interest as an officer of another company which owned 3% of Spackman Equities Group  which owned 44.9% of SEGL before the placement and 39.1% after.The offer document listed Spackman’s name as Charles Choi Spackman and Charles Spackman. His Korean name was not disclosed at all.It would seem that the issue manager and sponsor  PPCF  was none the wiser about the troubles that Spackman was in. If they had known  would SEGL still have been allowed to list? I am not sure given the number of questionable companies that have passed through the listing process and landed on SGX  especially on the Catalist board.The share shuffleThe attempts by Woo to enforce the Korean judgement shone the spotlight on numerous transfers of shares of HK-incorporated Spackman Media Group Limited (SMGL) across different entities incorporated in BVI  Cayman Islands and Singapore  some in breach of the injunctions that had been obtained.SMGL has its genesis from Spackman Media Group Pte Ltd (SMGPL)  a Singapore subsidiary of Singapore-listed Spackman Entertainment Group Limited (SEGL) which was incorporated in April 2015  with SEGL citing “internal reorganisation”.  The following month  SMGPL started issuing new shares  and SEGL’s shareholding was diluted following multiple share subscription agreements with various “independent investors” whose identities were not disclosed. SEGL received gross proceeds of US$7.1 million from these share issuances.In May 2016  SEGL completed a share swap  transferring its remaining 45.8% interest in SMGPL for a 27.4% interest in SMGL  which had just been incorporated in Hong Kong. The amount regarded as being paid for each SMGL share in this initial share swap was HK$3.3747 or just under S$0.60.  SMGL thus became an associate company of SEGL. SEGL said that SMGL was considering a listing on SEHK. The proposed HK listing never happened.SMGL shares were also sold to three BVI companies  GD Enterprises Holdings Limited (GD)  Azur Investissement Ltd (Azur) and DVG Limited (DVG) at low cost. DVG then transferred some of these shares to another BVI company  Trinity Capital Advisors (Trinity)  also at low cost.These four BVI entities then resold the SMGL shares to SEGL at 23 times their purchase price through five share swap transactions at US$3 per share. Through these share swaps  other individuals and entities also sold shares to SEGL at the same US$3 per share.In all  a total of more than 283 million SEGL shares were issued in exchange for SMGL shares between March 2017 and August 2018. The total number of new SEGL shares issued was equal to 71% of the 398.77 million issued shares of SEGL as at 31 December 2016.  Not surprisingly  SEGL’s share price had fallen from S$0.174 per share just before the first share swap  to S$0.057 by the time the fifth share swap was announced. As of 30 October 2020  its share price was just S$0.007  compared to its peak of S$0.515 on 24 July 2014.Spackman-price-chart.pdfRichard Lee enters the pictureRichard Lee started in SEGL as Head of Business Development and was disclosed in the offer document as residing in California  USA. In the offer document  annual reports  and other announcements by the company  Richard Lee is referred to as just “Richard Lee”. SMGL’s Register of Directors lists him as Korean. Like Christopher “Dracula” Lee  Stan “Marvel” Lee and Spike “Mo’ Better Blues,btohqsg
of the five share swap transactions.On 20 October 2020  it was announced that SEGL  in consultation with SGX Regco and the sponsor  appointed Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Pte Ltd to undertake an independent review of the transactions. There is literally a treasure trove of public documents available online that provides extensive details about these transactions and it should not take too long for the independent review to be completed. Hopefully  further regulatory action will follow.The five share swap transactions I have written about here are just part of a more complex web of transactions. There is enough material in the court documents for several spinoffs. Woo’s battle to enforce the judgement has now gone on for almost 10 years and is not over yet.On 10 September 2020  SEGL announced that a movie produced by its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Zip Cinema topped Netflix globally. The movie is called#Alive. Shareholders of SEGL are#BarelyAlive  with the share price at S$0.007.,btohqsg
y a RHB Securities analyst called Jarick Seet. One of the “gems” was published on 3 January 2017  which called SEGL one of the “Quality Names in the Small Cap Space”. It estimated that SEGL’s then 27.2% stake in SMGL to be worth US$45 million  which was about 85% of SEGL’s then market capitalisation. I have no idea how that estimate was arrived at  but based on the NTA  NAV and profitability of SMGL  I had questioned the price being paid for the SMGL shares in my article posted on 11 June 2018.Seet had set a target price for SEGL of 32 cents in 2017  then lowered it to 27 cents  then 23 cents  then  20 cents and then 10 cents in May 2018  and consistently maintained a “buy” recommendation on SEGL shares. RHB Securities ceased coverage of SEGL shares on 21 November 2019  with its last call a “Buy” and a target price of S$0.10. Today  SEGL shares are worth just S$0.007 each.Yet another lesson for investors to be skeptical of analysts and do their own research.The rest of the castUp to now  the board of SEGL has remained behind the scenes. Surely  one would expect the board to ask some tough questions about the share swaps.So  who are the rest of the cast? When SEGL listed in July 2014  Tae Hun Lee was a substantial shareholder owning 8.2% before and 7.2% after the placement. He was also an ED and CEO.  One of the risk factors in the offer document said: “Our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Tae Hun Lee and Eugene Lee”. Tae Hun Lee resigned in 8 March 2016  so that was one risk factor crystallising.Eugene Lee’s full name is Eugene Yoo Jin Lee (Ms). She owned 6.7% before and 5.9% after the placement. She is an ED and Chief Producer of SEGL and continues to hold these positions today.Jessie Ho is the lead independent director and remains so today. She is a member of SEGL’s Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC). Her full name is Thong Yuen Siew Jessie and she was also referred to as Jessie Ho-Thong in a Prestige magazine feature and as Jessie Thong in the list of directors at Halogen Foundation. Her profile describes her as an ED of JHT Law Corporation  which currently does not have a functioning website.Ho-Thong did not own SEGL shares at its listing but her brother  Thong Soo Kheon  was the shareholder and director of Belview Investment  which owned 2% before and 1.8 % after the placement. Her nephew  Thong Sing-Hau Daniel  owned 2.9% before and 2.5% after the placement.Anthony Wei Kit Wong has also been an independent director of SEGL since its listing. On 19 December 2017  he took over as independent chairman of the board after Spackman resigned. He also chairs the ARMC. He did not own any shares of SEGL on its listing.Another independent Ng Hong Whee has also been an independent director since its listing. He is the third member of the ARMC.Among the management  Kay Kyoungwon Na started out as CFO of SEGL at its time of listing. She was appointed as COO  President and ED from 20 February 2019 and continues to hold those positions today.John Jihwan Ko is the current CEO of SEGL  being appointed on 20 February 2019. Unusually  he is not a member of the board  while the COO and Chief Producer are.Suk Young Jung joined as an ED on 1 September 2016 but left on 20 February 2019.There are also several individuals involved in the share swaps  some of whom were original shareholders of SEGL at its listing  shareholders of SMGL  and/or also participated in SEGL’s placements. They may well be like “extras” in a movie but perhaps like the Marvel movies  a background character could turn out to have quite a significant role to play.The story continues….Following an article I posted here called “Watching Spackman Entertainment”  on 2 September that dived into the five transactions  showing the involvement of Spackman’s brother-in-law and wife in the BVI entities that were swapping SMGL shares for SEGL shares  SGX issued a notice of compliance (NOC) to SEGL on 3 September. The NOC requires SEGL’s Audit and Risk Management Committee to perform a “holistic review”,btohqsg
” Lee  it seems that is his full name.The HK High Court judgement published on 20 October 2020 said that there is ample evidence that Lee is Spackman’s nominee.  He was Spackman’s classmate at Harvard University  is a long-time associate/friend of Spackman and helped pay his legal fees and US taxes amounting to US$300 000.Lee  resigned as SEGL’s Head of Business Development on 30 September 2016 to become a director of SMGL in HK. On 18 January 2018  he returned to SEGL to become interim CEO and Executive Director (ED)  shortly after Spackman resigned as both Chairman and CEO in December 2017. He remains as a director of SMGL  while also being interim CEO and chairman of Spackman Equities Group (SQG) listed in Toronto  Canada.Spackman was Chairman and CEO of SEGL during the first two of the five share swap transactions while Lee was ED at SMGL. By the third share swap transaction  Spackman had resigned. Lee returned to assume the position of interim CEO and ED of SEGL for the fourth and fifth transactions  while also concurrently being ED of SMGL.The HK High Court judgement indicated that Lee was also the corporate secretary of the BVI-incorporated companies DVG  Azur and Trinity  which had resold SMGL shares to SEGL at 23 times the purchase price.Whodunnit?There was another man and a lady behind the BVI entities involved in the share swap transactions. It was like three men and a lady  instead of baby.According to the HK High Court judgement  Jae Seung Kim is the beneficial owner of DVG  GD and Azur and sole director of Trinity  the four BVI companies which had acquired SMGL shares at low cost and then swapped them with SEGL shares at 23 times the cost as part of the five share swap transactions.Kim also turned out to be Spackman’s brother-in-law. He resided in Spackman’s residence in Hong Kong and was the registered account holder for water supplies for both the HK residence and office premises used by Spackman. In the judgment  the Judge found that Kim’s claims that he was the beneficial owner of GD  DVG and Azur and his explanations “do not withstand scrutiny”.The sole beneficial owner of Trinity turns out to be a lady by the name of So Hee Kim  who is Spackman’s wife and Jae Seung Kim’s sister.In other words  at least four of the BVI companies that swapped SMGL shares with SEGL are controlled by Spackman’s brother-in-law and wife  and not just any “certain existing shareholders” or “unrelated third parties”  as SEGL claimed in its announcements.  Further  Spackman and/or his nominee Lee were holding key positions on the boards of SEGL and SMGL during the share swap transactions.Watching not actingPerhaps both PPCF as the continuing sponsor  and RHT Capital which took over from them  should have flagged concerns with the five highly questionable share swap transactions that were to take place between March 2017 and August 2018. Or perhaps they didn’t notice or thought it’s not their job to question “business decisions” of the board of directors.As an outside observer  I was waving the red flag and privately communicated my concerns to SGX. The transactions simply made no commercial sense to me.It was ludicrous to me that a company could refuse to disclose the identities of the parties who were swapping SMGL shares for SEGL shares at such a high price by citing “confidentiality reasons”. I thought that as a frontline regulator  SGX Regco should be entitled to know who the “third parties” are. Otherwise  how would it enforce interested person transaction rules  for instance?Eventually  SGX queried SEGL. However  I felt that the queries and the responses were inadequate and made my views known in an article I posted on this website on 11 June 2018 titled “Query System Needs to be Reviewed”.Cheering from the sideSEGL provided several justifications for the high price paid for the SMGL shares  one of which was a RHB report by an unnamed analyst who SEGL said had estimated SMGL’s value per share to be between US$4.70 to US$8.00. On the websitesginvestors.io  there are a series of reports b,btohqsg

hi anybody can recommend cheap and reliable fish tank movers,btohqsg
May I know how would big tech benefit from Trump? Big tech had been censoring Trump a lot. It seems that big tech will benefit from a Biden's administration. Right now  all the major news outlet is touting Biden's victory; hence the sharp price increase in big tech's share prices.,btohqsg
quite expensive.. i asked already.. thanks !,btohqsg
The best thing of Singapore is too many Singaporean are too nice to be easily treated  that is good thing   keep it,btohqsg
Always got small group bad man that is not evitable,btohqsg
Lets have more compassionate to help people around us,btohqsg
Eh... Tax benefits does not only benefit big tech. It benefits majority of the companies  especially SMEs.A continuation of Trump presidency could mean a breakup of big tech company under anti trust laws. (R) had just scrutinized big tech two weeks ago.Between the two evils  I think big tech would prefer not to be broken up.My 2cents.,btohqsg
What I concern is if all media keen on one side  it will be high possibility free speech is constrained  that is why I support trump  to break up those big tech,btohqsg
Amen... Big tech has became the oligarchs of this new age. The worse thing is  is that they will not only have influence over one country but they will have global influence.,btohqsg
I don't like Trump  but compared damages he made if 4 more year than monopoly of big tech  typhoons  I will choose less evil one  Dem ruin the Democracy,btohqsg
Ya.. Trump needs to have more self restraint. The power big tech has is way too much.It is not too hard to imagine if one day zuck or dorsey decides to run for president. FB and Twitter will singing all of their praises and blocking their opponents'. You can already see how Bloomberg was doing it on his own network. Why would any of his workers say anything bad about their own boss unless they ahd already intended to quit.,btohqsg
As long as you have their stock and it keeps going up  why complain?,btohqsg
Yar. A lot pipol taking grab/taxi. Karchiiiiing.,btohqsg
