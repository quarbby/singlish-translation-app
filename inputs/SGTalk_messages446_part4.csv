"In part of her reply  Cheng said that because the women come from a ""less well-off country"" - this part I agreeand may work in a job that is ""generally frowned upon"" - she meant the sex trade - this is offensive and wrong- the men who provides for their lifestyle get to tell the women what to do  where to go and what to wear. - this is also not correct. We don’t tell them what to wear but cos they are posssesive partners  they make extra effort to maintain their looks to keep their men",btohqsg
