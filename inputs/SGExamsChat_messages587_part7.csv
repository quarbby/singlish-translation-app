I calculated for my insurance agentlife insurance bought at 1 year old to cover till 99almost same as term insurance bought from 30 to 70 yrs old,btohqsg
yes but for 1 Yr old I did the maths,btohqsg
and you still get returns after that,btohqsg
but there's a difference  which is term insurance gets cheaper at higher coverage. I used a lower coverage to calculate,btohqsg
for guys  term insurance go with MINDEF Singlife oneBest value,btohqsg
I didn't know that until few years ago then got back in,btohqsg
