Might as well pass than u risk,btohqsg
But tys ones can help with some ideas but dont take the style of writing,btohqsg
can share some tys model essays ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
To a small extent.Some of the argumentative and expository essays from the tys publisher I have aren't that great - lacking evidence to substantiate their point  points are narrow....,btohqsg
I mean this kind of things,btohqsg
Reading will only do so much,btohqsg
Do and ask teacher is the best thing u can do,btohqsg
But if u despo/never do ur work ah then this will help u alittle lor,btohqsg
I can only write argumentative essay well LOL,btohqsg
er i actually think reading would be the best way to score well yakno,btohqsg
Is not the best way to do this,btohqsg
Practice and getting constructive feed back is the best way,btohqsg
with reading you kind of gain experience... vicariously,btohqsg
Yea but reading u gain too many ways of writing,btohqsg
youâ€™re right in that you have to practice,btohqsg
but if you arenâ€™t well-read  you wouldnt be able to write either,btohqsg
when are your exams  by the way?,btohqsg
Then your purpose of reading is to learn one's writing style.,btohqsg
yes you do learn their style,btohqsg
I stick to my writing style but I read other's essay to gain more evidence and point of view.,btohqsg
But if u dont have a style u follow,btohqsg
U during exam wont be able to produce,btohqsg
ive never actually thought of it in terms of style,btohqsg
So wat i mean by reading is u read and get some ideas but u dont entirely take wat they write word for word,btohqsg
U urself need to have a way of writing,btohqsg
Means u need to practice to develop,btohqsg
Those are mainly novels and stories,btohqsg
Those wont be good for compo stule,btohqsg
