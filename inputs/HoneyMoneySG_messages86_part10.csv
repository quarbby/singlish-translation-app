Same here. Just check 3 of my transactions amaze + crmc on 22nd only earn 1 point for 1 dollar spent. Not 10 points for 1 dollar spent anymore.,btohqsg
well  amaze still has it's primary function and that is to bring overseas and convert foreign transactions to local to remove the FCY fees,btohqsg
Amaze still can show you the mcc code  shield the UOB$ merchant.,btohqsg
Is it comparable to trust fx rates? Wanted to sign amaze but I just saw all the messages üòÇ,btohqsg
you can see Chris's videos where he did comparison between Trust Amaze and Youtrip and Wise if im not wrong,btohqsg
If Citixamaze nerf  what cc would u guys use for offline purchases like food/restaurant  shopping?,btohqsg
ladys card still gives out 6mpd and will likely give out 4mpd after 29 feb,btohqsg
HSBC Revo for shopping. UOB Ladies if you choose dining as a category,btohqsg
Paying with CitiRewards using Shopback & FavePay will still earn us 10x points right?,btohqsg
Thanks! This is taking into the account the recent changes I assume?,btohqsg
there are more recent videos on the nerfing of Amaze but none concerns abt the FX rate,btohqsg
Asking for recommendation for credit card with best cash back and no minimum spent requirement   thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Just wondering  if lady‚Äôs card will only have 4mpd for one category after 29 feb  won‚Äôt it be a pretty bad miles card compared to the other miles cards?,btohqsg
not really. hence  it is super dependant on each person's needs and transactions,btohqsg
DBS WWC and HSBC Revo both offers 4mpd to limits of $2k and $1k respectively as well,btohqsg
If you spend a fair bit on travel  it‚Äôs probs the only miles card left along with DBS WWMC which itself is restricted to online only. Might be a good card if you have a UOB one savings account and need to meet the monthly spending to get bonus interest,btohqsg
But then for lady‚Äôs card it would be 4mpd for just one category right,btohqsg
The lady mile pool with other UOB card. If you attend to earn UNI$  you shall hold other UOB mile card too.,btohqsg
Combine w ppv and vs to pool pts,btohqsg
yes unless u hold the solitaire  which allows u to have 2 categories,btohqsg
still a good card to hv tbh as i pool tgt with my general spending card  the UOB Privimiles,btohqsg
DCS Ultimate Platinum  either MasterCard or UnionPay. 2% cashback no min spending  capped at $200  but shouldn't be a problem if you're looking for no min spending lol.,btohqsg
Hi everybody  I saw somewhere that says the HSBC EGA gives the 1 percent cashback for credit card bills. Anyone can confirm this?,btohqsg
Hi guys I got 10x points on Grab/ShopBack transactions on 21st Jan but 1x points on Amaze transaction.Seems like it‚Äôs true ü•≤,btohqsg
Try my best to use shopback+crmc/wwmcWhenever not possible use Hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Checked from DBS digibot amaze still convert to online,btohqsg
Most probably Citi reward blacklist amazeSince Citi reward portal also closed at that day,btohqsg
how to check whether 1x or 10x on Amaze transaction?,btohqsg
Since Jan 20  it has been 1xWhether this changes in the future who knows,btohqsg
If I use ShopBack with Apple pay(link to CRMC and WWMC)  can I clock 4mpd too?,btohqsg
Don't think cmrc works w apple pay,btohqsg
Citi rewards doesn‚Äôt work with Apple Pay.Just add your card on ShopbackWWMC works with Apple Pay tho.,btohqsg
Use citi rewards for in-app credit card payment on Deliveroo grab shopback etc. but not via Apple pay,btohqsg
Can I ask if I add DBS woman world mc and pay hawker center  XNAP with Apple Pay linked to DBS woman world mc  I still get 4mpd in $5 block?,btohqsg
Yes XNAP is fine. Not Fave tho,btohqsg
Sorry I think I messed up with these mile cards,btohqsg
Oh wait my bad. Is $5 blocks.,btohqsg
Yup $5 block but it doesn‚Äôt round down to the nearest $5 block before computing the reward points. It takes the whole transacted value divided by 5 and multiply by 9 (for local spend bonus) before rounding down the reward points.,btohqsg
Any 4mpd card I can pair with Card Up?,btohqsg
4mpd card only citi rewards doesn‚Äôt has $5 block I ü§î cmiiw,btohqsg
There should only be one webull securities to select from and only one type of outbound FOP transfer to choose from. Just follow the instructions carefully and send both webull and IBKR an email to confirm they you have initiated the process,btohqsg
Hi all. Can I check if FairPrice app in-app payment directly using CRMC will get 10x pts? I have been using it with Amaze card linked to CRMC. With the recent potential Amaze nerf  I‚Äôm considering to add CRMC to FairPrice app directly instead.,btohqsg
Yes linked directly will be considered online spend,btohqsg
Fave should work with citi rewards if you add it as a card in-app.Fave won‚Äôt work with wwmc,btohqsg
Does M1+ app bill payment qualify for livefresh 5% ? Anyone knows M1+ merchant code?.,btohqsg
Means now I'm using dbs Altitude with cardup. 1.3mpd. Is 1 of the better deals ?,btohqsg
Depends on many factors.You need to calculate miles earned divided by how much you paid in CardUp fees.Generally Visa and Mastercard is better because CardUp gives more promotions.UOB PRVI miles visa gives 1.4mpd. Some cards also give 1.6mpd but they have a much higher income req.DBS altitude is not bad at 1.3mpd,btohqsg
I thought amaze only pairs with Mastercard and hsbc revo is visa?,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt need amaze for HSBC revolution.It gives 4mpd on online as well as contactless spend.,btohqsg
Does my new strategy make sense if amaze is excluded from CRMC?Main:1. Contactless Payment: UOB VS‚ÅÉ 4MPD  min spend $1k  capped $2k‚ÅÉ Apple Pay (Follows Blacklist)‚ÅÉ Statement Month2. Shopping/Online Txn: Citi Rewards (Amaze?/Shopback/FavePay)‚ÅÉ 4MPD  capped $1k‚ÅÉ Follows Blacklist (no travel  etc)‚ÅÉ Statement MonthExcess1. Specialised: HSBC Revolution‚ÅÉ 4MPD‚ÅÉ Follows Whitelist (Online/Contactless Shopping & Dining)‚ÅÉ Calendar Month‚ÅÉ No expiry2. General: Citi PremierMiles‚ÅÉ 1.2MPD‚ÅÉ Follows Blacklist (no travel  etc)‚ÅÉ Statement Month‚ÅÉ No expiryFCY‚ÅÉ Shopping: CRMC + Amaze‚ÅÉ Others: CPM + Amaze,btohqsg
