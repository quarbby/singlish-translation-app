As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals  it is bent at a 22° angle  creating acircular halo aroundtheSun.,btohqsg

why the sudden influx of bitcoin ppl,btohqsg
hopefully because bitcoin shot up in price,btohqsg
Wow daysandbox actually did its job,btohqsg
Dropped vs last month tho o o,btohqsg
I mean the stock market is crashing pretty badly now anyways,btohqsg
If these bitcoin advertisements are essentially scams then the low price would benefit them as they can attract more people to fall for their scams,btohqsg
To buy bitcoin  the first step is to download a bitcoin wallet  which is where your bitcoins will be stored for future spending or trading. Traditional payment methods such as a credit card  bank transfer (ACH)  or debit cards will allow you to buy bitcoins on exchanges that you can then send to your wallet,btohqsg
Seems like you have bought bitcoin before.,btohqsg
