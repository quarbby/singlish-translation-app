we won't know until it happens,btohqsg
heard the astons have good straight line  mclaren are hiding their floor  merc are hiding their rear,btohqsg
redbull havent shown the car at all too,btohqsg
Aston had decent cornering last time  good straight line could make em a surprise package,btohqsg
i think the midfield would be tight,btohqsg

hoping that aston pull a shocker,btohqsg
Hope it's tight at the top too,btohqsg

More importantly Ferrari lost him ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
ferrari had no future with him tbh,btohqsg

He defo better than many on the grid atm,btohqsg
arguably he won his F2 title with consistency,btohqsg
but to some extent i agree,btohqsg
Coming back to Aston  imagine it's as competitive as RP 2020,btohqsg
