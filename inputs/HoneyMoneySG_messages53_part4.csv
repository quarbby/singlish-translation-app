Just to confirm  to clock credit card spend for OCBC 360 is based on calendar month but date is based on posting date?,btohqsg
Best place to put SRS funds? Stashaway lock in?,btohqsg
Most ppl do not gain from buying ILPs due to the high fees paid to advisors at the beginning of the policy years  underperformance if the underlying funds  etc...,btohqsg
You can search my previous post and understand why,btohqsg
private usually can. you likely even can get the uob one quarterly cashback too if spend every month. since $5k don't forget to opt in for the free apple airpods by UOB. just need to spend 1k more.,btohqsg
Just buy a straight up life or term insurance.Keep your investments separate.,btohqsg

Thanks.. the $500 minimum spending can be split between 2 OCBC cards?,btohqsg
Is there a need to keep 2k for minimum balance in EGA if I have yet to receive the BI that is in aug?,btohqsg
For the OCBC 360 category of â€˜saveâ€™ (Increase your average daily balance by at least S$500 monthly)  what happens if for a particular month I make a withdrawal resulting in not hitting the requirementâ€¦? Means I will miss out on that bonus category for that month only? So most ppl will just keep growing the account even when maxed out past 100k?,btohqsg
Does this mean minimum need to deposit 10K and trade 5 times to get this 5.8%?,btohqsg
miss for that month. can plan to reset to $100k or slightly lower in a month after accumulating for a few months,btohqsg
Yes. Pls read T&C in detail to see if u qualify as existing customer,btohqsg

Does anyone know if I have spent $250 uob one cc and $250 on uob lady cc  will I meet the UOB savings account $500 criteria?,btohqsg
No capital gain tax. But I believe the value of your RSU would have been added into your assessable income where it is taxable as part of salary,btohqsg
The tax for RSU given is calculated based on the value vested at that date defined in your RSU plan. Your HR will file that in your IR&8,btohqsg
If you hold it longer time and the price increase  that delta wonâ€™t be taxed,btohqsg
Yes was file in ir8 cos now I have resigned 2 years ago... I don't have the payslip  with me  as they change hr systems,btohqsg
Cos it's a USA co.  In USA .. definitely we have to pay taxes under.1042-s..,btohqsg
Noted. Cos I am thinking of vesting already.,btohqsg
