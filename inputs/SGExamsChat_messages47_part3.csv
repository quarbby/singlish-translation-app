So we need to campaign for it first,btohqsg
And get smashed with eggs and tomatoes on the streets of course,btohqsg
Israel is in a situation where the women either served NS or risk getting ravaged by the countless Arabic countries out there in the event that the nation fell  you tell me,btohqsg
is that a Freudian slip suggesting that you need a man instead,btohqsg
Guess the infrastructure ugrades wont be cheap,btohqsg
The allowance cost will be negligible though (sadly),btohqsg
I mean some dude jokingly said he wanted to egg shammugam,btohqsg
And got hunted down by the popo,btohqsg
Hmm it can be argued that sg is surrounded by religious countries but i can see why israels situation is way more drastic,btohqsg
But people here take for granted how we arent being annexed by literally anyone else,btohqsg
sg got a lot religious ppl tbh,btohqsg
Yes but our govt is supposed to be secular,btohqsg
But itll be interesting to see if young people are religious,btohqsg
Depends on what we mean by religious,btohqsg
a lot of my friends who are religious are really really religious,btohqsg
I can confidently say that most Christians in Singaporean society know barely anything about their religion  but we can't blame them  the churches choose to teach what they agree with  and put aside whatever they don't,btohqsg
yeah i really dont like that,btohqsg
So its basically either extremely religious or not at all,btohqsg
Id say its not limited to singapore though,btohqsg
even the non-religious may not be pro-lgbt,btohqsg
Anecdotally  i havent met anyone around my age that is homophobic,btohqsg
Not homophobic may not mean pro lgbt though,btohqsg
They wouldbt mind but they wont afvocate for it,btohqsg
I am homophobic  I feel uncomfortable around gays but there's a difference between one's personal feelings and the law.If majority of Singaporeans don't like apple pie  should we ban apple pies in Singapore? A law doesn't stand purely on the feelings of the majority  a law has to stand on some form of reason and evidence.,btohqsg
And in a world where BTS becomes increasingly popular in Singapore and the xmms swarm the Parliament to enact BTS in our Constitution  should we oblige?,btohqsg
Well  if the xmms want it,btohqsg
Is there a malay word for xmms,btohqsg
Would you be in support or against legalising lgbt marriage,btohqsg
I can't say that the science on LGBT is absolutely conclusive  but assuming that LGBT marriages (and the ensueing intercourse) do not have a negative impact on our society's healthcare system  and assuming that LGBT parents do not have an adverse effect on their children  then yes  I'll support it,btohqsg
If I have to be against LGBT marriage one day  it'll have to be for a very good reason,btohqsg
Meaning at the moment you don't believe that there is any particular harm from having LGBT around,btohqsg
At the moment yes  I'm looking forward to be proven wrong,btohqsg
But when I joined WAAPD Facebook to look for any constructive reasons to object LGBT  I left feeling disappointed,btohqsg
It's like a boomer community there  they send those edgy cartoons or links to tabloid articles about some LGBT happenings,btohqsg
It's not a public group I believe  and for good reason,btohqsg
omg i just saw the screenshots,btohqsg
I had to fake being against LGBT  of course,btohqsg
i fake being alt right to join an alt right group before,btohqsg
Dont mind doing an AMA now,btohqsg
i had to write a very fake convo,btohqsg
The fact that this isn't satire,btohqsg
YESS this is gonna make the ratios more favourable,btohqsg
Guess I just have to become nonbinary,btohqsg
Then I can go out all I want,btohqsg
ya but i was an active member in an alt right group for like 1 month,btohqsg
then i just rage quit cuz buey tahan,btohqsg
God doesn't approve of not loving thy neighbour,btohqsg
Okay  at least I've found one reasonable post,btohqsg
although it's leaning on the side of group blaming  at least it's not mindless ramble,btohqsg
Although I don't have enough knowledge to poke the holes here,btohqsg
