crmc excludes mobile in-app (which is a form of online transaction actually  just that it is excluded in TnC). Can get 10x points on dbs wwmc.,btohqsg
Anyone managed to apply for a DBS credit card recently?,btohqsg
Website seems to prevent anyone from applying for any credit card,btohqsg
I see! So this magic number $102 000 mainly stands for the CPF contribution cap only right? RSTU & VCMA are both still available for its tax reliefs,btohqsg
Yes  ytd night applied and approved immediately,btohqsg
RSTU to SA and VCMA are not part of the annual limit of $37740.The annual limit of 37740 is for mandatory contribution from employment and voluntary contribution to 3 accounts.,btohqsg
U applied via Singpass or thru the DBS account,btohqsg
Do take note that with current high interest rates  not worth doing the 37 740 contribution as not all the funds go into SA  MA at 4% interest rates. Your OA at 2.5% will get most of the allocation,btohqsg
As much as i favor cpf  I don't support VC3A at allhttps://youtu.be/xPNokZ8e1Jg,btohqsg
Is there any benefit for VC3A? I know that RSTU and VCMA has tax relief.,btohqsg
the only benefit for SEP i presume. Reduce tax and build cpf. But SEP i think would better build on MA and SA better,btohqsg
The main objective for rstu/vcma is not to enjoy higher interest  but for tax deductions.,btohqsg
Anyone tried for AIA  if my monthly premium I scheduledGIRO  and before the deduction is done and before premium due  I do a manual payment  will AIA still deduct the paid premium for the month?,btohqsg

Didn't get my $3 Paylah Cashback today. Here's the storyhttps://vt.tiktok.com/ZS8u3ec1G/,btohqsg
Why not wait until lunch or dinner to pay with paylah instead?,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you guys use Starbucks app? To top up money inside what card do you use?,btohqsg
If you plan to do manual payment all the way just login bank portal to cancel GIRO and it will automatically become cash/cheque payment.If I'm not wrong they will still deduct GIRO if their end don't receive the money fast enough to update the system that they have already received payment.,btohqsg
Today cashback was quite slow for me,btohqsg
It wasn't immediate  I thought I didn't get the cashback also. I walked back to office then the app gave me back the cashback,btohqsg
The list for what each of our transaction is on the Instarem amaze,btohqsg
if use uob one or hsbc revo to buy / renew contract get new phone which card will get cashback?,btohqsg
uob 1 u need 3 monthsrevo only give u for the first 1k,btohqsg
unless singtel cna spit the total amount like 500 hsbc 500 uob?,btohqsg
u see if singtel can spilt 1k and 5k a not  but that will means uob 1 u need to maintain at least 500-1k for the next 3 months,btohqsg
ya wonder if singtel can spit up\,btohqsg
if not then LL ask to pay in full on hsbc,btohqsg
since uob need to maintain 500 or 1k,btohqsg
ya if u only have 1 option  maybe revo would be a better choice,btohqsg
amex only 1.5 while hsbc higher %,btohqsg
Reason why I want to keep GIRO is in case did not manage to do manual payment  GIRO will still go through.  The most is don't get the Cashback instead of missing the payment. Double payment is fine since I believe it's either they refund or use to pay the following month then I manual adjust accordingly. What I don't hope to happen is that they ignore manual payment and continue to GIRO every month. ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Any experience anybody with CardUp for paying tax rent etc? Is it worth the fees?,btohqsg
Anyone have concrete data point for payment of teleco online and get cashback for Citi smrt? There is mix data point at other group,btohqsg

hihi  anyone know what is the best credit card that we can use to pay SP group bill via AXS? Also  is Citi PremierMiles Credit Card (1.2 miles per dollar) eligible with AXS expenses?,btohqsg
ii) I think it must be recurring,btohqsg
AXS no rewards unless pay a fee  which is not worth it. SP group can pay using uob one card or posb everyday/ocbc365 recurring payment.,btohqsg
in this case this is well established fact based on datapoints,btohqsg
Pay exact amount  it works for my axa annual premium  they did not deduct giro,btohqsg
"hi  sorry what u mean at this setence "" AXS no rewards unless pay a fee? """,btohqsg
Pay via AXS Pay+Earn earns rewards but incur 2.5% fees,btohqsg
No  you'll not get the discounts associated with the credit card... You'll get the discounts with the petrol card though...,btohqsg
oh I see  thanks for the info,btohqsg
