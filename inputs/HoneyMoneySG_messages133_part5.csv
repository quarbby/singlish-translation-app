let me do step by step firstI saw you mention open account online however need to go to the branch for e-signature,btohqsg
it seems I used to have hsbc account and unable to login so may need to go onsite,btohqsg
If you can't open online then just go to a branch and open. They will also setup signature when opening the account.,btohqsg

For those who buy gift card from wogi  we can‚Äôt see if each voucher has been used  but have to open each voucher  I bought multiple Sheng Shiong $10,btohqsg
Best to save it to ur e-wallets and remove them whenever u used them,btohqsg
If the recurring instructions take place  on a Sat / Sun / PH  will it still fulfil the EGA requirements ? Eg if set on the 1st of each month and 1st Dec is a Sunday,btohqsg
How to save to e wallet? Or what e wallet? Or you mean screenshot?,btohqsg
Both samsung pay and gpay allows u to add gift cards to it but samsung pay's is more flexible where u can input url as the voucher. If u do use samsung pay  save the sheng siong voucher as url and copy and paste the url that directs u to the qr page,btohqsg

Hello@ChrisHMSG  I would like to know what‚Äôs the best card (be it credit card or non credit card) to use for big ticket overseas spend? About 3k sgd. thank you,btohqsg
Hello. Anyone find using amaze + citi rewards card is not as good compared to uob lady‚Äôs card for overseas spend? I got the worst exchange rate when using amaze card  other uob card was better. Like ppv  uob lady‚Äôs.,btohqsg
Depends when u spend. As weekend there will always be markups.But usually amaze still better using naked,btohqsg
So far only two cards with around 30mins apart   uob ppv seems better 111yen vs amaze+citi 108yen.,btohqsg
ppv not yet include 3.25% fee,btohqsg
Ya pending transaction doenst have 3.25% yet.,btohqsg
Wait for transaction to post then please report back if the rate is indeed better,btohqsg
Thanks this is really good question. I checked again the rate is about the same with uob ppv slightly lower. At the start I only compared amaze transaction and heymax>card section. The pending transaction and heymax showing a different amount. Weird thing is that heymax shows that I only have 120points for a $95 transaction when dining is in the uob ppv mcc. Should have been 190 points instead.,btohqsg
Thanks all for the replies will check in few days üôèüèª,btohqsg
Rate lower but in the statement there may be additional mark up.,btohqsg
Not UOB but once I changed like $1k. The amount of forex I got was very good. But end of month statement amount was more than the $1k due to fees.,btohqsg
Pending amt does not include bank fee,btohqsg
Anybody has experience with citibank giro deduction? If due date is mon it will deduct on thurs/fri beforehand or it will deduct on the actual day? I know it is 1 day beforehand but forgot the day before is sun.,btohqsg
