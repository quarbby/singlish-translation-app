Got it. Clear - thank you. Would there be any downside to having more reserved amounts in SA just in case? I know shielding doesn‚Äôt exist anymore but I am wondering if there are any other gotchas to think about ?,btohqsg
Does it work for citi smrt 5% if i pay my food at kopitiam using fairprice app link to the card ? ü§î,btohqsg

I had a giro deduction yesterday  the 1% cashback credited today.,btohqsg
Thanks! I got mine finally too üôÇglad to know it‚Äôs not an issue,btohqsg
think can show till last billed statement. Only show the 1x point. All transactions should show  those with no points will show 0 points. Note that those transactions below $5 will show 0 points cos need min $5 to get 1x point.,btohqsg
Your previous videos 2023 2024 are still valid also no regrets topping up on the Jan so far. üëå,btohqsg
Hey guys  if I topped up an amount to my spouse‚Äôs CPF (assuming she has not hit the 8k relief)  will she still get the tax relief as it‚Äôs coming from my bank account?,btohqsg
But provided if ur spouse inc is less than 8k/yr,btohqsg
And no  recipients do not hv tax relief,btohqsg
If we keep doing VCMA/RSTU ($8 000/yr) and transfer OA to SA (e.g. $10 000/yr) until MA reaches BSH and SA reaches FRS one day  what will happen to our employer and employee‚Äôs CPF contributions? Can my employer still pay to my CPF account or the monies will be refunded back to my employer since it‚Äôs already full? Thanks!,btohqsg
It doesn't matter where the money comes from  as long as the contribution is using her singpass  she will get the relief if total vcma+RSTU less than $8k,btohqsg
Great! Thanks for this  meaning she logs into her CPF and I do the top up via my bank account by scanning the paynow QR generated there  she will still get the relief   am I right? üôèüèª,btohqsg
If both BHS & FRS is reached MA will go to OASA will still go to SAOA will still go to OA,btohqsg
I recall getting $800Sorry I got $1100 in my last participation.,btohqsg
I see. Just to clarify  my employer can continue to make CPF contributions to my CPF MA  SA  and OA accounts even if both the BHS and the FRS have been reached  correct?,btohqsg
Yeap. Don‚Äôt worry. You will still get your CPF contribution üòä.Excluding the yearly salary cap of ordinary wage & additional wage though.,btohqsg
They very sneaky. Still 6 months lock in but smaller and smaller bonus,btohqsg
Ya. But better than nothing. Hope UOB stays strong for the next few months.,btohqsg
Uob will stay strong. The 4% pa‚Ä¶. Dunno man.,btohqsg
Hi happy new yearCan I check for UOB one; if I have pending uob one card transaction on the 28.12(currently still pending)  will it count towards dec credit card expenses to eligible for uob one interest?,btohqsg
Guys to reduce inc tax wld u top up own CPF so can pay for house also but only 62.17% goes to OAorcash top up to ur grandparent since not under cpf life scheme  can wd in mthly payouts so like the money is considered yours too haha,btohqsg
Hi Guru  can I ask a question ?This is my 1st time trying to top up cpf to do tax reduction however it seems that it divided into OA SA and MAIs it normal for this ?,btohqsg
if not posted by today then not counted to dec,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think you get any tax relief if you top up your 3 CPF accounts unless you a self employed.,btohqsg
so need to choose either SA or MA to get tax relief right ?,btohqsg

Dear all  if I like to prepare for uob one next quarter promotion - April to June 2025 (if have)  is it correct that I have to move the funds out by 28 Feb 2025?,btohqsg
Try the CPF app! I alw get this error prompt on phone or desktop so annoying!!,btohqsg
Why not do both then if you plan to reduce by more than $8k up to $16k,btohqsg
Thanks for the info  any idea how long the fund will be locked in?,btohqsg
This is optical illusion.The truth is 6 months because u need to fund it before 31st and u should only withdraw at month end (even though lock is released on 17th).,btohqsg
First month u need to fund on 31st let‚Äôs say and that‚Äôs cutting it close.Practically for a deadline of say 31st January  a min/max approach would be to fund on 1st January itself so that u also get the max 4% pa for January itself.So it‚Äôs actually 6 months lock-in if u want to min max 4% $150k + get the cash reward.,btohqsg
technically the funds is not locked in  can put in other places that earn more than 4%,btohqsg
Uob one is actually a pseudo fixed deposit due to the interest payment structure that‚Äôs why I usually prefer HSBC EGA that‚Äôs a true ‚Äúsavings account‚Äù that u can touch anytime.Uob one the moment u deviate from $150k adb u will never get the 4% pa Liao.,btohqsg
Apart from tax savings for doing VCMA  are there any other benefits for doing so?,btohqsg
