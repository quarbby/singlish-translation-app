"A Singapore-based real estate investment trust that owns more than 5M SF of U.S. offices is looking to sell off one of its most valuable assets as it looks to reduce its debt obligation.PlaceholderGoogle MapsPhipps Tower in Buckhead  home to the children's clothing maker Carter's.Manulife US Real Estate Investment Trust is in talks to sell Phipps Tower  a 20-story  glass-clad office building above the high-end Phipps Plaza mall that serves as the headquarters of children’s clothing manufacturer Carter’s. The REIT  which trades on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited  has agreed to sell the property to its manager  The Manufacturers Life Insurance Co.  in a deal that could close by the end of June.Manulife US REIT disclosed the agreement on May 24 as an update to a strategic review the landlord initiated in November.The transaction for the building  which was 94.5% leased to 10 separate tenants at the end of 2022  would be for a price determined by the average of two independent appraisals  the REIT said in the update. Its most recent internal valuation of the tower on Dec. 31 was $210M  while the Fulton County Board of Assessors assessed the tower at $176M last year.The parent company has agreed to waive the divestment fee on the sale  according to the update. It's the second transaction in which a Manulife subsidiary has agreed to acquire an office building from the REIT it manages.Earlier this year  Manulife US REIT sold Tanasbourne Commerce Center in Portland  Oregon  for $33.5M to John Hancock Life Insurance Co.  which Manulife purchased in 2004. Manulife US REIT had acquired the three-building  133K SF office park in 2021 for $33.9M  The Registry reported.The sale of Tanasbourne and Phipps demonstrate the parent company's ""commitment to the REIT "" a Manulife spokesperson said in a statement to Bisnow.“Proceeds from these divestments will be prioritized towards near-term loan maturities and essential capital expenditures ” Manulife US REIT CEO William Gantt wrote in the update.Phipps is the fourth-most-valuable asset in Manulife US REIT's portfolio and its second-newest  according to its website. The building is considered to be “one of the gems in the portfolio  which has historically shown resilient cash flows ” DBS Group Research analyst Derek Tan said in a report  according to Singapore publication The Edge.“While the potential sale of the property with strong attributes could mean that the impact from occupancy challenges faced by [Manulife US REIT]’s other existing properties is amplified  we see this as a potential bitter pill to swallow in order to bring forth more stability for the portfolio ” Tan said in the report.Manulife hired Citigroup as an adviser for its strategic review last fall  after which it entered into talks with Korean investment firm Mirae Asset Global Investments  which was eyeing a purchase of Manulife US REIT's shares  Gantt wrote in a March release.In the update published last week  Gantt wrote that the exclusivity period on those talks had lapsed without a deal.Mirae’s U.S. REIT  Mirae Asset Maps Frontier US Private Real Estate Trust No. 5  recently posted losses of more than 70% due to value struggles in its portfolio  including a 75% value loss on a Washington  D.C.  office building.Manulife U.S. REIT's efforts to pay down its debt come as the domestic office market sours from spiking interest rates and uncertain corporate demand for office space. As of the first quarter of this year  Manulife U.S. REIT's gearing ratio — the measure of how much of a company’s equity would need to be sold to pay off its debt — was nearing 50%  according to a May report by DBS.Companies with gearing ratios above 50% could face tougher financial conditions as the economy weakens. Manulife US REIT's spokesperson said that a pro forma gearing ratio will be determined once a purchase price for Phipps is agreed upon.The gearing ratio was expected to drop to a low 40% level if Mirae were to acquire a majority stake in the REIT ",btohqsg
