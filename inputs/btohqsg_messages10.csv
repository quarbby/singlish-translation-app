Who knows grant amount will change in next 5 to 10 years,btohqsg
I see  then I cannot advise too much on bank loan. Just take note that if you keep money in CPF OA  it should be growing at 2.5%. if you take it out  you need to return the money intoYOURcpf (not return to government) with the added accrued interest.Balance your choice between the (2.5% interest rate)x(CPF OA amount) and the (bank interest rate)x(bank loan amount). It's slightly but not too complicated math  some bank rep or financial agent should be able to advise you properly.If you take HDB loan  you are required to clear your CPF OA including grants with the choice of keeping up to $20 000 for your own use. Of course when selling the house you still have to return it back to YOUR own cpf with the accrued interest,btohqsg
Hi hao long  thanks for the information. I am fully aware of this. But undecisive. Not sure where i can get consultation on this matter.,btohqsg
if you *have* to buy resale then just take the grant  it has extra $30~$50k on top of the EHG,btohqsg
plus if you planning to buy BTO in the future maybe your income also increase by then so EHG even lower,btohqsg
Sounds good. But i heard some said if grant is taken  next bto bid will cound as single entry instead of 2 entry?,btohqsg
Thanks. I think i more or less get it already. üëç,btohqsg
if I'm not wrong once you are owner of resale you are second timer already  unless you don't put your spouse as co-owner  next time he/she can apply to be owner of new flat and you be co-applicant. this is the common workaround for ABSD as well.,btohqsg
is it üòÆ not sure haha I don't have personal experience but their explanation also very grey,btohqsg
Is it big differences for bto ballot first timer vs 2nd timer?,btohqsg
It is like 2 chance over 1000 bid. And 1 chance over 1000 bid. Still based on probability,btohqsg
save for your first timer status upon balloting,btohqsg
and unless the home owner never took any grant  they'll be counted as second timer,btohqsg
2nd timer only have 5% chance for mature estate compare to 1st timer at 95%,btohqsg
Not 5% chance  5% of units available,btohqsg
2nd timer only have 30% allocation for mature estate compare to 1st timer at 70%  for 2r and 3r  while 15% for bigger flats,btohqsg
while 1st timers are allocated 85% for bigger flats at non mature estate,btohqsg
Actually I want to know like hdb say for non mature estate if ballot for 2 time unsuccessful  then ballot again for non mature will have high chance for FT?,btohqsg
What if like first time ballot non mature then second time ballot mature then third time ballot non mature does that count as another ballot chance?Or must be consecutive 2 time unsuccessful?,btohqsg
Logically should still have extra chance but you can call hdb to be sure,btohqsg
I think he's asking if have to be consecutively non-mature. Btw you will only be second timer if you give up twice,btohqsg
Cancel twice become second timer for 1yr,btohqsg
Hi all any updates on fernvale glades?,btohqsg
quite a number from FG eh,btohqsg
Any reason for HDB not releasing the keys for the completed blocks even it was TOP-ed. Called HDB   they always give template answers. So,btohqsg
TOP liao they will give keys to hdb than hdb will check for defects and have to rectify,btohqsg
thought BCA is the last to check for defects since it gives HDB the green light for TOP,btohqsg
the last time I saw was like not even in the mid floor,btohqsg
these windows do not look nice obstruction of view from inside,btohqsg
Where to get a detailed floorplan for a bto unit which ceiling height included?,btohqsg
May I ask after get the number for bto? Then the next step is do wat?,btohqsg
How can I check the selecting process? Is it start to booking a flat? Or can check which floor is been choosing not?,btohqsg
We already have the Q number...,btohqsg
detailed as in with the measurements?,btohqsg
when you have selected your unit,btohqsg
but I think it does not state the ceiling height,btohqsg
you can see the last queue only after you are given a selection date,btohqsg
to wait for your selection date to be given  then shortlist 10 units based on your needs,btohqsg
do your HLE 2 weeks before your selection day,btohqsg
Yeah. Including the ceiling height of various area. Not sure if possible to know.,btohqsg
tiagong it's 2.6m for HDB ceiling height,btohqsg
youll get your floor plan with measurements when you are selecting your unit,btohqsg
Hmmm.. don't recall the ceiling height. Is it 2.6m?  I am worried if I order my tailored furniture of 2.6m but in the end cannot fit.. haha,btohqsg
better give an allowance of 50m lol,btohqsg
Hi guys...I am Umi Khadijah. May I ask the sale launch of BTO for Aug  has not been launch yet right? HDB will do it by this few days?,btohqsg
I just saw HDB website. I think it is on 13 Aug,btohqsg
how to see load bearing and non-load bearing beam?,btohqsg
must the entrance door be fire-rated?,btohqsg
Ways wrong with bedok reservoir one,btohqsg
Underwater development. Now 7th month  fully applied,btohqsg
71 votes yet none chosen reservoir  the scenery would be good,btohqsg
Wow but the price for Kovan don‚Äôt seem very non mature üòÖ 4room going for 400+-500k hmm,btohqsg
Bedok reservoir and Tampines West mrt not the same thing?,btohqsg
I think the vote shows that keen applicants in tampines understood me lol,btohqsg
have to be fair since I separated kovan and hougang too,btohqsg
The tamp one side by side,btohqsg
Most people who apply for Tamp will be ok with either,btohqsg
The hougang one is different because people will give up when the kovan one is full,btohqsg
"""The ballot results will be made known to you by Early September 2021.¬†""",btohqsg
Yea but usually BTO priced lower mahüòÇ I thought at most starting price 350k but wow 400-500k bueypai,btohqsg
Ignore the mature and non mature label  the price is not based on that,btohqsg
No lah I not getting Kovan lol I alr booked a flat üòÖ,btohqsg
now all the prices mostly starting at almost half a million liao :<,btohqsg
hi guys  can i still try for Aug bto if i‚Äôve gotten a queue for May bto alr?,btohqsg
700m walk to mrt from reservoir side,btohqsg
as long as you have not done with selection,btohqsg
okie! thank you! juz afraid the previous queued one wld be affected,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone have any idea how the mcps scheme will work in this way if I apply for kovan 4rm? Since the application lumps the 4rm for 2 different hougang project together. And for the hougang project I am beyond the 4km,btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôm in the queue for my SBF but I doubt I will get the house since my queue is really really far. Can I still apply the Aug BTO? Or do I need to cancel my SBF first?,btohqsg
i think they count as nearest block in the project,btohqsg
they will just take the nearest block to your house,btohqsg
not sure you need to cancel but yeah you can go ahead with this BTO,btohqsg
as long as u havent selected a flat u can apply,btohqsg
Doesn't matter. Just need to be near any plot for MCPS. You will be able to select either,btohqsg
actually it's not a long wait for those projects completing in 2026,btohqsg
but might have more delays also,btohqsg
dunno if is factored in alr,btohqsg
wa boon keng flying under the radar,btohqsg
best plot for boon keng is already occupied by st George towers,btohqsg
my colleague is so proud of staying there since it is so convenient to him,btohqsg
anyway interestingly  hougang is the first to be completed in 2025   37 monthsof wait,btohqsg
i guess another pro of going there,btohqsg
hougang PCD by 1q2025 while kovan PCD by 3q2026  1.5year later,btohqsg
First timer here! If I submit an application now  what's the timeline for me in getting my ballot number?,btohqsg
Will be 3 weeks from closing date,btohqsg
Does not matter when u apply as long as u do it by the closing date,btohqsg
So is see lor.. some ppl like to just apply then dunnid think about it le,btohqsg
Some ppl die die want 1 particular area,btohqsg
Then some will wait and see application rates to see which has the highest chance,btohqsg
Can i ask if this is accurate? Can we use the Enhanced CPF Grant for downpayment?,btohqsg
Yes. Stamp duty all can used by grant.,btohqsg
2pm updated  Kovan 2x in half a day,btohqsg
If I apply under PHPS   is it also under public scheme?,btohqsg
Hi may I know hle when do I need to apply,btohqsg
Cos my bto starting to call out number already,btohqsg
Is ur no very close or very far,btohqsg
So when will I need to apply hle?,btohqsg
Because when I applied I did select PHPS  but at the end of application it stated public scheme,btohqsg
The Parenthood Priority Scheme (PPS) under HDB gives priority allocation for new HDB flats to first-timer married couples expecting a child  or who have a citizen child aged 18 years and below  by setting aside a proportion of flats to better meet the housing needs of this group.,btohqsg
HLE is valid for 6 months i think,btohqsg
so u want can apply now also,btohqsg
Flat allocationUp to 30% of BTO units and 50% of SBF units are allocated to applicants under this scheme.,btohqsg
Balloting process scenarioNow  let's get back to the balloting process and why its so hard to get a good queue number. As a first timer applicant  70%-95% of the flats are set aside for you depending on the type of flat and the location. Within the 95%  30% are set aside for PPS and another 30% for MCPS.Let's take for example the following scenarios:Location: Toa Payoh (Mature Estate)Flats available: 1000Total number of applicants: 2000 (Oversubscribed)PPS applicants: 400MCPS applicants: 400Other first timers: 400Second timers: 8001. Flats for first timer: 950 (95%)Flats for PPS: 300Flats for MCPS: 300Flats for other first timers: 3502. Flats for second timer: 50 (5%)Now  with the above scenarios  we can predict how the ballot process will work. This is just based on my understanding but it may not be exactly how it is done.First  HDB will shortlist applicants up to 100% of the flat supply. There are 1000 flats available in this instance.Step 1:PPS applicants will be shortlisted first. 400 PPS applicants are shortlisted for 300 units set aside for them. This means that 100 PPS are out of the shortlist.Step 2:MCPS applicants will be shortlisted. 400 MCPS applicants are shortlisted for 300 units set aside for them. This means that 100 MCPS are out of the shortlist.Step 3:Other first timer applicants will be shortlisted. There are 400 other first timer applicants plus 100 PPS who failed in step 1 and 100 MCPS who failed in step 2. They will probably be shortlisted in this step 3 as well. This part is unclear as I could not get any information from HDB. If the PPS and MCPS are put in this pool as well  we have a total of 600 applicants who will fight for 350 units. This means 250 first timers (regardless of priority schemes) will be out of the 1000 queue number.Step 4:Now  second timers will be shortlisted. 800 second timer applicants will be shortlisted for 50 units set aside for them. This means that 750 second timer applicants will be out of the shortlist. As a second timer applicant  you must be really lucky if you can get shortlisted within the 100% supply of flats.Final step:The final step is all those who are shortlisted (first and second timers) will now be assigned random queue numbers. A first timer applicant can still get the last queue number 1000 and a second timer applicant can get queue number 1. Those who are out of the 1000 flat supply will still be assigned queue numbers as HDB gives out queue numbers for 300% of the flat supply.By now  if you managed to follow the above scenario  you would have realised that the balloting process is completely based on luck to get a good queue number. It doesn't matter if you applied under any priority schemes. The priority schemes only increase your chance of being assigned a queue number but not your chance of a good queue number.,btohqsg
only GRO and  MGPS are not public scheme,btohqsg
PPS is like MCPS  my bad,btohqsg
If this application is still on going  isit still possible to apply the aug bto?,btohqsg
can as long as you haven't booked an unit,btohqsg
Q15 out of 7 leh ü•≤,btohqsg
ok then go for this BTO,btohqsg
so aiming for hougang or tampines?,btohqsg
But currently staying in Yishun with my parents and my workplace also Yishun üòÇ,btohqsg
The rest alr quite out of place,btohqsg
either wait for next SBF launch or somewhere nearby yishun plot next time,btohqsg
When do we know nov got what sbf ?,btohqsg
I'm not so familiar with sbf places,btohqsg
thought it's the same every launch,btohqsg
In February 2022  HDB will launch about 2 000 to 3 000 units of BTO flats in towns/ estates such as Geylang (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-room)  Tengah (4-/ 5-room)  and Yishun (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-/ 5-room). This number is subject to review as more project details will be firmed up closer to the launch date. We will provide more details at the next BTO exercise.,btohqsg
but see if u can wait so long hahaha,btohqsg
Wonder if Geylang one will be at mbt,btohqsg
the soil needs to be stabilized for couple of years,btohqsg
Don't rely on the percentage too much! It's not accurate and can jump back to under 90%,btohqsg
Aiyo jialat I applied the wrong bto   any idea how to cancel and choose the correct bto?,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ nvm I donate to hdb,btohqsg
Oh need email ah? If you wish to cancel your flat application  please submit the request viaMyRequest@HDB.,btohqsg
Login My HDB Page > My Flat > New Flat > click on reg no > Scroll down and click on Change Family Nucleus / Cancel Sales Application,btohqsg
Hi new applicant  for down payment of the bto unit  roughly when will it be  a couple of months before key collection or when you comedown to choose your unit?,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone got latest picture of fernvale glades?,btohqsg
so many residents here from FG,btohqsg
Queenstown the location and design subpar ah,btohqsg
Kovan one really is good I feel. At least to me what U want also have. Everything within your reach,btohqsg
What do you guys think of Hougang Citrine? Like push and pull factor?,btohqsg
the prices are included of the component schemes,btohqsg
it seems that its 2r flexi type 1 is the biggest of all BTO projects,btohqsg
and if one wants 5r  only Citrine and the two tampines projects have it,btohqsg
5r is a matter of 20sqm difference compare to a 4r,btohqsg
it‚Äôs literally themed after an orange üòÇ,btohqsg
living room size matters for some ppl (like me) I guess,btohqsg
yes it matters for a family with kids,btohqsg
Some ppl don‚Äôt care for the extra ‚Äústudy room‚Äù size tho  and many projects now don‚Äôt offer 5 rm so it‚Äôs quite a headache. Especially in premium locations like South/Central areas,btohqsg
oh and initially I thought the facing of the estates do have a nice view towards defu lane but I was wrong  all the stacks like no view,btohqsg
premium location to have 5r  not sure bddr is it considered one and AMK BTO from Aug 2020,btohqsg
Depends on the resale value of the estate I suppose,btohqsg
High chance of being invited for selection,btohqsg
provided u are even within supply first ba,btohqsg
but i feel like citrine not worth it this launch,btohqsg
since u can apply in nov anyways,btohqsg
and nov will be that area for the whole hougang,btohqsg
If u apply 4 room  queue number at 150% of supply should still be ok,btohqsg
i feel like ur losing out lor,btohqsg
i mean provided ur goal this aug is to maximise ur chances,btohqsg
this probably the biggest factor sia,btohqsg
I assume current flat selection process is very slow and draggy  any idea have all May bto done flat selection?,btohqsg
Feb still ongoing. May just started,btohqsg
Hi new applicant here  can we apply for more than 1 location? Interested in both hougangs.,btohqsg
They are combined during application. During flat selection you choose,btohqsg
Ohhh what about if i want tampines and hougang?,btohqsg
Cant apply in 2 separate applications?,btohqsg
First timer easier than second timer,btohqsg
Hi I have an problem Filling the form  it keep say enter valid income  what happened ?,btohqsg
even toh guan 4r application rate is higher than Queenstown,btohqsg
Where to see application rates?Proximity to mrt (current and upcoming) matters,btohqsg
Some fields u put dollar sign. Some didn't. You should omit the dollar sign.,btohqsg
Remove dollar sign still cannot ah,btohqsg
I even put dollar sign and put all zero also cannot,btohqsg
Remove all put zero also cannot,btohqsg
Do again lor lol. Also don't need to insert another token for another try,btohqsg
then retry lor since ballot for BTO is not a FCFS basis,btohqsg
The application is putCo application OrOccupied,btohqsg
Depends on you? Is your other half going to be joint owner?,btohqsg
Is it because we both self employed?,btohqsg
Don't put in the dollar sign,btohqsg
you can see the dollar sign just below the month and year  you don't need to input in the dollar sign yourself  just numbers,btohqsg
Lol got tell him just now le,btohqsg
I do so long just like that tell me I‚Äôm first timer ?,btohqsg
I want buy Tampines flat ah,btohqsg
So u finally removed the dollar signs.,btohqsg
How to apply for the new launch Tampines BYO,btohqsg
are those out of the 1000 flat supply be getting queue number beyond 1000 or can they also get numbers from 1 to 1000?,btohqsg
Like how to get the q number,btohqsg
2nd timers  does this include those who are existing house owners?,btohqsg
Just make sure you don't give false information,btohqsg
yes HDB will issue 3x the supplies,btohqsg
think you better redo and edit it to 3000,btohqsg
Short answer is yes. They do give our numbers beyond the supplies. They do drop off and not select any units when it comes to them. Hence  those given numbers beyond supply may have a chance.,btohqsg
I wanna go to HDB to ask more accurate and faster  but they ask me go do online  I‚Äôm not good at it  anyone can guide me ? Like get q number or something,btohqsg
Yeah agreed  you could potentially disqualify yourself frm the flat application,btohqsg
Just submit this application and wait til early september for the queue number  that's all,btohqsg
Don't think you want to be spotted on the ship of false declaration. Suggest you do it with actual numbers. Hdb has direct links to iras and other info sources of your income.,btohqsg
hello! based on this screenshot  it seems like you are on the wrong page. That page is to check for your eligibility to apply. The page to apply is:https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/bp13/bp13005p.nsf/BTOAug2021?Openpage,btohqsg
So the Tampines 13 launched now cannot apply or what ?,btohqsg
If 3k prevented u from getting a 'favorable' result..  There must be a reason.,btohqsg
Launch now means it's open for application.,btohqsg
What are you checking for btw?,btohqsg
U filling in this form in the hopes of obtaining what information?,btohqsg
Are you trying to apply for the Tampines BTO?,btohqsg
Anyone know  is it need to work then can buy flat? Both my wife self employed can apply Ma ?,btohqsg
Well you just applied. Self employed people can buy flat,btohqsg
But we are both doing online business  never declared can consider self employed?,btohqsg
you just need to provide proof of your incomeRead here:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-from-hdb/income-guidelines-and-other-documents,btohqsg
Make sure you declare what needs to be declared to get the required documents  or else you might be rejected to book a flat if you don't provide the documents,btohqsg
nice reg number triples and 2 sets of doubles,btohqsg
hello  if i just quit my job  can i apply for hle as employed since i have past 3 months salary slips?,btohqsg
as long as 3 months continuous working unless you are taking grant,btohqsg
grant is only applicable for income up to the day of application,btohqsg
as I found out for my own application üòÖ,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs closer to something like May  Jun  Jul 2021 if you‚Äôre applying for Aug 2021 (now),btohqsg
it‚Äôll lock in and not regard any changes from Aug onwards,btohqsg
but will they get numbers from 1 - 1000 since it is random number? Or are their Q number be from 1001 onwards?,btohqsg
impossible for 1 at least starts from 20?,btohqsg
based on luck the smaller the better,btohqsg
Hi  if the HLE letter is valid till 16 Aug 2021 but I am applying for August BTOwill it still be valid or will I have to reapply HLE letter again,btohqsg
No  HLE for appointment date which is 3-4 months later,btohqsg
You should just apply when it expires  no rush to do it now anyway,btohqsg
best is to apply a week before your appointment,btohqsg
Am I allowed to apply for BTO  get queue number and later still apply for SBF? Advanced thq.,btohqsg
sbf launches in Nov  in unison with BTO launch,btohqsg
you have to see the timeline   see how good is your no,btohqsg
sbf launches every year in may and Nov,btohqsg
Aug results will be out before 8th Sept (2 months away to Nov BTO) if your number is good  maybe your selection date is earlier than the Nov launch so wait and see,btohqsg
otherwise if selection is later than the launch then maybe you can consider to apply for the sbf,btohqsg
will Sbf have the same price as current BTO?Assuming  it is a same project but reapplying again.,btohqsg
paying more in an exchange of shorter waiting time,btohqsg
Is there a range of total income between yourself and partner before you‚Äôre able to apply between a 4-room bto or a 3-room bto?,btohqsg
To apply  I think they just want to see whether u can secure an active hle or loan or not. Don't think that they are that stringent at the flat selection phase.But the key is whether u think u can get hle for a loan or an ipa for a bank loan that is enough to cover the price of your bto flat. If you can't pay at that point  u waited for nothing and u lost your down-payment.And considering how expensive btos  are these days.... Ya. Plan ahead.,btohqsg
base salary would be increased years down the road also mah,btohqsg
That's the general assumption la haha,btohqsg
so say if you can get HLE now but upon key collections your combined salary more than $14k  HDB won't stop you from moving to your BTO too,btohqsg
but have to switch to bank loan,btohqsg
that's something new to me  didn't know that!So let's say you already paid your 10% down payment with HDB  when you collect keys and switch to bank loan  how much you have to pay upfront?,btohqsg
that's if your combined is > $14k,btohqsg
sorry I don't have knowledge for this only know that you need to be on HDB loan for 6 months before the conversion to bank loan,btohqsg
Can switch before key collection but downpayment will be 25% including 5% by cash. If switch after key collection I think no such requirement  but can only switch after 6 months.,btohqsg
Note that once u switch to bank loan no turning back. But initial is HDB loan  u anytime can change to bank loan.,btohqsg
so can I confirm that before BTO key collection  if your combined salary is more than 14k  you must switch to bank loan?,btohqsg
based on what@yyx123said  I think if you have the means to pay 20% CPF and 5% cash to switch over bank loan to enjoy lower yet fluctuating interest  can consider,btohqsg
so the 10% downpayment u made to HDB will be returned to you  then you will need to do the 20% CPF + 5% cash directly to bank?,btohqsg
Sorry I can't confirm that have to switch,btohqsg
no worries  I'll call HDB to check later  have to get a unit first else no need talk so much  haha,btohqsg
but no such thing as refund to you bah???,btohqsg
Anyone can access the open flat booking now? Can't seem to see the flats available,btohqsg
Looks like nothing for open booking,btohqsg
strange  i don‚Äôt see this page on the web,btohqsg
it still says 13 August 2021,btohqsg
Let's just wait and see for today,btohqsg
I thought it was at the point of application hmmmm,btohqsg
I also saw is 12pm today,btohqsg
it is changed to 1st sep at 10am,btohqsg
i think was always 1st sep haha,btohqsg
they say today is let us know when will be available for viewing,btohqsg
actually  they did say they will announce the supply today,btohqsg
i think they quietly rephrased the sentence recently,btohqsg
i rmb they said they will announce the supply today,btohqsg
felt like they just did a lot of people dirty,btohqsg
Hello  first timer here.If I apply for Aug 2021 BTO and fortunately given a queue number  but because of various reasons  end up giving up the queue number  can I still apply for upcoming Nov 2021 SBF? or will I need to wait for 1 year cooling period?,btohqsg
You can hold onto your aug queue number and try nov SBF. If you've never rejected an appointment before  you'll be fine,btohqsg
If they call u for aug BTO and you got a SBF queue number.. then might have penalty if you reject aug BTO if you have rejected another appointment recently,btohqsg
That's because selection period for most projects is Oct 2021 to June 2022  and most likely my appointment will be AFTER the Nov 2021 SBF,btohqsg
if anyone curious for the actual numbers haha,btohqsg
just indicative wont be 100% accurate,btohqsg
open booking never release details today?,btohqsg
Nope  the units will be revealed on 1 Sep,btohqsg
HDB just updated their statement regarding OBF on their website just now.,btohqsg
How long does it take for BTO results to be out?,btohqsg
anyone have recommendation of good movers?,btohqsg
how do we dispose large furniture  like 4-door wardrobe?,btohqsg
3 weeks after application period closes,btohqsg
any idea how mover diamantle big wardrobe?,btohqsg
do they dismantle  otherwise how to go into lift?,btohqsg
it will be out within the first week of sept,btohqsg
ask town council to help though got limit how many pieces,btohqsg
Hi just wanna ask. I saw somewhere online before. But just want to confirm. Are we able to ballot for BTO and then after apply Open booking at the same time ? Like maybe we get a ballot number but if afterwards we see an open booking house that we like  can I also apply for it and forgo the BTO Ballot number ?,btohqsg
You can apply whatever you want as long as you never book flat (which is pay the option fees to hdb),btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if there are still units now for purchase ?,btohqsg
Enough with the crypto currency ads...,btohqsg
Hi anyone here waiting fr their bto at sky vista bukit batok?,btohqsg
Hi  I wanna ask if i wanna amend my details to put my partner as an co-applicant do I need to inform them n is there any fees coz during my application last year i put my partner as occupier,btohqsg
Meaning can i change frm occupier to co applicant fr my partner??,btohqsg
log in your HDB portal to amend,btohqsg
I don't know specific which one but I know it can be amended,btohqsg
Because during my 2nd appt which is fr e downpayment i forgotten to inform e officer to amend it,btohqsg
maybe you have to email HDB,btohqsg
Hi can I check  if I select the option to take loan from HDB now  will I be able to change to Bank/Financial loan if I choose to later?,btohqsg
Hmmm 2 more days to go...,btohqsg
Wow 4 room kovan rate üëçüèΩ good luck to me,btohqsg

Hi everyone  while balloting  we apply for both MCPS AND MGPS  2 schemes together? Or have to choose one?Thank you :),btohqsg
Haha yah. But well. Depends on whether get or not üòÇ,btohqsg
not possible to stack those together,btohqsg
MGPS means your parents have to downsize to either 2r or 3r  and seems like this scheme bao jiak one,btohqsg
need to discuss with your folks are they okay to wait few years for a new but smaller house,btohqsg
MCPS is very common and no guarantee to get house,btohqsg
can mcps be use if your parents live nearby?,btohqsg
Pps is for couple with kids or preggers wife.Mcps is for ppl who stay near parents,btohqsg
ok thanks. the competiton is deadly hahaha,btohqsg
we must engage only contractor listed in the Directory of Renovation Contractors?,btohqsg
Got the above. Thank you everyone!,btohqsg
you can stack both together as I have asked the others for you,btohqsg
for mgps applicants  either of these can happen:a) get both mgps and public q nums;b) fail mgps and only get public q;c) fail public and only get mgps q; ord) fail both,btohqsg
for the grant can we choose it to deduct only upon key collection?,btohqsg

Let‚Äôs say we have this scenario:Party A is earning $3k/month for more than 12 months and Party B still studying so $0 income. Hence deferred income is non-applicable.GreenQuartz 4RM is about $450k  after less EHG let‚Äôs say $50k  means $400k to be paid via cash/CPF + loan.However due to Party A only earning $3k/month  bank/HDB can only loan maybe $175k  which leaves a balance of $225k.Would that mean that you have they have to come up with $225k out of their CPF/bank account otherwise HDB will reject your application?,btohqsg
NICHOLASin 5 years time they will reassess again haha,btohqsg
then u will know the final amount,btohqsg
u just think like 5 years later,btohqsg
how would ur income be like,btohqsg
yes take that your pay remain stagnant till then you'd have to cough up the shortfall,btohqsg
u should estimate generally how ur income will be like by then,btohqsg
In maybe 2-3 years  Party B will also be drawing a salary already. So should be okay to cover. They will reassess again?,btohqsg
alot of things can change in 5 years,btohqsg
yes apply HLE again before key collection,btohqsg
i mean touchwood worst case scenario,btohqsg
Understood. Even if now cannot afford to pay for it but 3-4 years time can  no issue?,btohqsg
i mean u should still save now lor,btohqsg
u cant know for sure ur salary in 5 years,btohqsg
my friend purchased a 5r years ago  they then had made the 5% staggered payment  fast forward  they have spent the money and need to cough up $300k if they want to collect the keys otherwise they have to give up and forfeit the deposit of $20+k,btohqsg
best is to treat it no change to your salary,btohqsg
haha i think just conservative estimate like,btohqsg
then u adjust year to year,btohqsg
haha sad to say my pay has been stagnant all these years while waiting for my house,btohqsg
but of course start saving for this lor,btohqsg
dont just assume hdb will loan the full 90%,btohqsg
please factor in the expenses of reno appliances furniture wedding honeymoon and whatnot,btohqsg
normally loan quantum is 66x of a couple's combined salary,btohqsg
Don't even have cpf ah D:,btohqsg
So first HLE apply after application of BTO? Then second just before key collection?,btohqsg
they are holding a resale have to cough up $300k after the proceeds,btohqsg
first hle u see the shortfall,btohqsg
then u see how much u need make up,btohqsg
first HLE to be done a week before your selection,btohqsg
I once heard a wise man that he takes it that he's loaning the quantum based on half of his salary,btohqsg
then buy a house this cheap lor,btohqsg
If let say sell the resale away for 300k to 400k then use the sales prceed to pay for the bto is it like after or before ah,btohqsg
have to see how old is your resale  is it TOP before or after 2006,btohqsg
as I have mentioned before you can't use the proceeds fully on your next property purchase as there's a limit,btohqsg
If sell to agent ask agent do all the work can at least get a little limit I want ? Or is it good to sell to hdb directly,btohqsg
sell to HDB sure confirm kena low-ball,btohqsg
you haven't approached HDB yet ah,btohqsg
Cos hdb told me only sell at 200k only ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
wah how come a 14 years old flat can only be sold this cheap,btohqsg
but hdb ask me if u want higher can find agency but that one is ownwill Liao,btohqsg
I think you got my question wrong  how many years of lease left for your resale flat?,btohqsg
hmm not wise to stick to 4r in mature estate,btohqsg
can try 3r for hg projects,btohqsg
I use the hdb calculator it says at least 289k need cough up,btohqsg
But this calculation is I haven‚Äôt sell away my resale,btohqsg
Would HDB loan or bank loan be a better option? Heard from freelancers they tend to give less loan amount as compared to others.,btohqsg
bank loan u need pay 25% eh,btohqsg
I hear can take hdb loan first then switch to bank loan later  but not vice versa?,btohqsg
then how much if factor in selling the house?,btohqsg
$225k loan quantum if your pay remains the same plus you're the only applicant  otherwise two applicants can surely loan much more  the quantum from HDB is like 66x of your combined salary,btohqsg
Anyone knows if there is a group chat for melody spring?,btohqsg
I tot she was reported earlier.,btohqsg
Lol i just wanna check my bto status only. Why u all wan ban me,btohqsg
Who banned you? Only banned the bitcoin spammers,btohqsg
Lol i thoughy they wanted to ban me,btohqsg
Have . I can add u inside if u wan,btohqsg
Hi guys  So to clarify this point means that we probably taking staggered downpayment  which we have to fork out 5% still during second appointment plus stamp duty etcRight.Then closer or during collection of keys is another HLE assessment plus the second 5%?Should the second HLE assessment fail then we have to fork out cash to topup or forfeit our position and the initial 5% gone.Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Anyone know if there is grp chat for sky vista bukit batok?,btohqsg
Actually i have a question  so my husband have quit his last job. And now he is a self employed. Will this effect the HLE?,btohqsg
i mean when nearing key collection,btohqsg
He is currently insurance agent  so i was thinking whether will effect or not üòÇ,btohqsg
haha i think up to hdb how they wanna calculate ba,btohqsg
cause there's this mortgage servicing ratio,btohqsg
your monthly mortgage cannot exceed 30% of ur monthly income,btohqsg
so the loan amount is calculated in such a way that it wont be higher than 30%,btohqsg
both combined basic pay x 66,btohqsg
eh tiagong 5r cannot get grant?,btohqsg
Can if ur combined monthly income is below 9k.,btohqsg
heard from my colleague grant can only up to 4r application,btohqsg
because she purchased 5r without grant  non mature estate,btohqsg
Im not sure but iirc EHG was introduced in 2019. Prior to that was SHG  which could have the limitation?,btohqsg
I reckon your colleague book a flat before nov 2019 or something.,btohqsg
Hello guys! A quick question  during submission of the application under information for EHG & LOAN  there‚Äôs a question ‚Äúhave you completed your full-time studies within the past 12 months?‚Äù   should I put yes or no if I‚Äôm no longer studying for years.. ü§£ sound stupid but im new to this.,btohqsg
It's asking if u graduated recently,btohqsg
Hi guys if i wanna apply sales of balance flat  how do i do it? Cause it keep showing me  flats that i have to book which will be ready in 6 yrs time,btohqsg
Wait for SBF in Nov lol,btohqsg
SBF is only in May and Nov,btohqsg
Ohh.. but how do i go thru it,btohqsg
It's basically the same process as applying BTO,btohqsg
"Hi guys just another question on this  for the ""Have you completed your full-time National Service within the past 12 months?"" i put wrongly i put yes instead of no cuz i ORD 2 years back  will it affect anything? or do i have to re submit my application?",btohqsg
not sure if it affects anything,btohqsg
best is to call up HDB tmr morning before the application closes tmr 2359hrs,btohqsg
Ahh ok thanks a lot üôè,btohqsg
Hi there I just realised I made a typo error in one of the sections as well.You can actually amend the applicaiton before the end of the application deadline. So there is no need to cancel your current application to apply a new one.,btohqsg
"log into HDB portal ¬ª e-services ¬ª Residential ¬ª which ever option you applied to previously ¬ª Then scroll down all the way and look for ""Amend Particulars""",btohqsg
"""Amend Particulars"" should be on the bottom left",btohqsg
Hi yes! I just found it  thank you!,btohqsg
Hi is there any way for us to view the past sbf prices?,btohqsg
For example may 2021 or Nov 2020 sbf prices and for which floors?,btohqsg
I was looking at clementi  how come I read here that there are some flats going for 800k?,btohqsg
The page shows 5 rm 533k,btohqsg
Bto Is 5xx but if resale should  be,btohqsg
Ooo okay just trying to see anywhere got this info online  how hdb come up with this projection or appreciation,btohqsg
How come can explode until 800k one,btohqsg
duxton can explode more than 1m when the bto pricing was like $300+k back in 2008?,btohqsg
Hi any northshore trio owner here ?,btohqsg

Hi guys im confuse bout my loan and grant all . Can anyone help to enlighten me üòç                              example :Hdb price : 450kHle              : 40 kGrant           :  50 kSo i understand there is a downpayment of 10% of your hdb price . If my cpf only 30k  does it means i need to pay cash balance 15k ? Or i can use my hle loan ?Thanks in advance for the reply !,btohqsg
then you're eligible for staggered 5% payment instead of 10,btohqsg
$460k(incl misc fees and OCS) *5%= $23k,btohqsg
even if 10%  your grant amount covers the downpayment liao,btohqsg
the HLE loan will be assessed for the 2nd time before key collections,btohqsg
yes not to worry since you have grant amount of $50k,btohqsg
Ohoh ok so isit the same for resale ?,btohqsg
if your partner below 30yo also eligible for staggered payment,btohqsg
Resale is cfm need 10% downpayment huh ?,btohqsg
same as in the grant can be paid for the house,btohqsg
Lol ok . So for bto / sbf  the grant all can cover for the 10% . I just need to pay for the stamp duty misc all . Am i right ?,btohqsg
and OCS if you opted for it,btohqsg
Oooo ok very clear now . Thank u so much !,btohqsg
Stamp duty also can use grant right?,btohqsg
i think stamp duty is only paid on 2nd appt. by 2nd appt  the grant should be already transferred to your CPF OA. Since stamp duty can be paid by CPF (correct me if im wrong but that's what I recalled)  basically you can use the grant for the stamp duty,btohqsg
stamp duties confirm paid together with the downpayment,btohqsg
stamp duty i think first payment alr paid.,btohqsg
I just check my docs. I paid using the grant given.,btohqsg
first appt is selection exercise  2nd appt is signing of AFL aka downpayment deposit  3rd appt is keyz collection,btohqsg
Hi guys this appication for bto aug17  the house will b ready aft 6 yrs right,btohqsg
My bto delayed due to Covid  still waiting,btohqsg
Isit right tat sbf launch is on nov,btohqsg
Could be 1st or 2nd week  it's less disappointing to just assume it is 2nd week  haha,btohqsg
so app should be 8 sep,btohqsg
Feb btoClose application: 10 Feb 2021 (Wed)Result day: March 4 2021 (Thurs)22 days in betweenMay bto close date:31 May 2021 (Mon)Result day: June 18 2021 (Fri)18 days in between,btohqsg
There is a 14 working days after closing date to results date,btohqsg
Feb 2021 15/2/21 is a holiday in lieu for cny. So if calculate based on working days  it work out to be 14 working days for Feb and may bto results date,btohqsg
going so details into it ah,btohqsg
Yea. If it's indeed count by working days  in future can predict accurately the results date,btohqsg

You might want to join sbf chat for SBF matters,btohqsg
can i ask is there anyway that i can change to fiance scheme ? because i applied for the august bto but they stated it as public scheme,btohqsg
i didnt choose public scheme and they didnt let me choose any of that option,btohqsg
fiance/fiancee scheme is under public scheme,btohqsg
Can check how open booking works?,btohqsg
sept 1 hdb will release the list of units,btohqsg
will be from a number of areas,btohqsg
you then have 1 week to shortlist the units you want,btohqsg
then usually on application day 12am need camp at the computer,btohqsg
so say u get #1 then you can choose any flat u want basically,btohqsg
Will there be location/ estate given?,btohqsg
u will see all the units available,btohqsg
cause obf is basically those units leftover from bto/sbf or maybe like late dropouts,btohqsg
Hi  are these available flats from the SBF units?,btohqsg
Curious as it is my 1st time knowing this,btohqsg
Hello anyone tried to appeal to HBD to opt in for OCS after opt out during first appointment before?,btohqsg

Telegram Is quiet. Think they are active in WhatsApp group. Capacity maxed. WhatsApp not available.  Only Facebook still have some activities.,btohqsg
Woah might be true that Bayshore gonna have hdb. But the price for this area gonna be expensive,btohqsg
Erm I think they wont build 2 mrt stations just to serve a 'forested area' plus some bits of private estate,btohqsg
So ya  this will be the new 'marine parade' of 2030s,btohqsg
another expensive premium places . But over the past year I didn‚Äôt see Marine Parade having new bto ü§£,btohqsg
So probably gonna be high sub,btohqsg
Marine parade no BTO for decades liao ba,btohqsg
The plot is between two MRT stations on the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) - Bayshore and Bedok South - and is expected to have facilities and services such as schools  shops and an integrated transport hub.,btohqsg
ok lo got new mrt build,btohqsg
Yes  integrated transport hub need to serve high density high rise public housing to make sense.,btohqsg
Lucky I never buy Daffodil condo,btohqsg
The unit was so nice with bedrooms facing complete greenery,btohqsg
Next time it gonna face construction and all high rise HDB,btohqsg
The feel of that estate will be gone forever...,btohqsg
hdb used to be a greenery with trees and plant . Until when hdb decided to build more bto and housing  there‚Äôs goes hdb facing each other,btohqsg
Used to. Now is HDB take over greenery. -> dover,btohqsg
Temasek Poly will see enhanced intake capacity due to all the building up of hdb on that side,btohqsg
East side already over heated island heat effect leh,btohqsg
"The relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase from 2030 will free up 800 hectares of land ‚Äì equivalent to about five Toa Payoh towns. This will be progressively transformed into a ""highly liveable and sustainable‚Äù new town  according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).",btohqsg
So SG still has plenty of land... only thing is how not to affect the liveability in terms of heat buildup  displacement of nature and flora fauna and flooding.,btohqsg
Yes surely hdb will have plenty of land like for the Tengah estate~,btohqsg
Sg now v humidity already. Need air con installed for all new btoüòÖüòÇ but there goes air con bill üí∏,btohqsg
Tengah has central cooling tower option,btohqsg
I read somewhere that it is 'optional'.,btohqsg
my only worry is my retirement plan,btohqsg
World is crises everywhere  with the pandemic and loss of jobs  military action  industrial actions,btohqsg
Each day wake up alive n well is a blessing already.... still worry about retirement? LOL,btohqsg
Hi guys  my hubby just received a email from hbd say that the contractor for bukit batok sky vista  has ran out of money,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can advise normally how long time take for first appointment?,btohqsg
Same my bto project too. Sigh,btohqsg
depends on your ballot number  they would start with only a few and progressively after that,btohqsg
average 9-15 a day overall also depends on the size of the project,btohqsg
5 BTO projects in Bukit Batok  Clementi  Bukit Panjang and Woodlands face further delays as contractor goes busthttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/5-hdb-projects-in-bukit-batok-clementi-bukit-panjang-and-woodlands-face-further,btohqsg
How can contractor run out of money,btohqsg
Hdb never do due diligence when selecting contractors ah,btohqsg
So effects of pandemic and economic strife are start to hit,btohqsg
Their margin is very low. Usually 5 to 15%,btohqsg
The main contractors for 5 BTO projects in Singapore are unable to continue due to financial difficulties. HDB will find new firms to take over construction  but further delays are expected.https://cna.asia/3gAfAQX,btohqsg
No la  all projects are pay as you build. Meaning to say the difficulties unlikely to come from the bto more from their other operations,btohqsg
Which means the financial health of the contractor was not assessed properly before appointing them.. sad,btohqsg
Hope the delay will not be more than an additional year,btohqsg
The main contractors for 5 BTO projects in Singapore are unable to continue due to financial difficulties. HDB will find new firms to take over construction  but further delays are expected.https://cna.asia/3gAfAQX,btohqsg

Hope the exiting contractor don't anyhow build later safety issue,btohqsg
No worries  already during CB last year kena stop work for months.... got gaps or defects already 'built in',btohqsg
