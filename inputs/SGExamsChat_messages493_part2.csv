This one legit true all my ej friends say the same thing,btohqsg
if scgs ip girls were the majority of ejâ€™s population  id understand,btohqsg
but theres only 100 of us,btohqsg
And when i have a choice to avoid itWhy not,btohqsg
thats an average of 2-3 in each class,btohqsg
I swear our ministers are clowns but when shit has to be done  it gets done,btohqsg
Why have to face 100When i can face 0,btohqsg
and theres a chance u wouldnt even know them,btohqsg
u wouldnt face 0 technically lmao,btohqsg

U know scgs has olevel and ip right,btohqsg
pda doesnâ€™t matter so much. we gt more things to worry abt than such stuff,btohqsg

True  I have to content without a disruptive student in my poly class,btohqsg

Coming from scgs i can confirm olevel is vv different from ip,btohqsg
Yea but he is so disruptive  he cuts off the lecturer,btohqsg
I can give yall exampleOlevel if u ask ur friend can copy notes cos u never write finish they prob say sureBut ip when u try ask they damn stingy like pretty unwilling,btohqsg

3 of my classmates from my previous sem alr got disciplined regarding him,btohqsg
ya but not to this extent,btohqsg
this one will be a bit ridiculous alr,btohqsg
Normal  this is what happens in a competitive environment,btohqsg
Ive lived w it for 4 yeatsNever againThats why u see how many olevel track scgs go ejc ðŸ˜‚ less than 5,btohqsg
He legit worse than the other person in my poly that musturbates in class,btohqsg
Ip isnt even competitive there isnt a bell curveOlevel is more competitive cos Iâ€™m literally competing w my own classmatesYet ip liddat,btohqsg
