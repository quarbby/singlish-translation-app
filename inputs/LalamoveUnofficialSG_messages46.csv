U r not wrong for stacking  this kinda apology is not even sincere.You are being greedy and kiasu  when you have jobs on hand liao  still swipe so fast without looking carefully.Hogging the jobs  causing inconveniences to other users,btohqsg

Don't understand ppl just asking for help only. If you not happy about it  don't need to comment since u don't want to help.We also need to earn as much as possible.Humans tend to make mistake. One mistake doesn't means he greedy or kaisu.Since he have explain on it  I don't see any reason you should make that comment.,btohqsg
Do llm and grab tgt. If same destination  good to earn more money also,btohqsg
Sometime grab rider also will ask fellow grab rider to help to send,btohqsg

[BAD RATING NOTICE]Dear Driver  you have received the following bad rating for the order #107552909622 - Late for no reason.If you wish for the rating to be reviewed  please drop us an email with the above order ID along with your explanation toinfo.sg@lalamove.com. the driver operations team will revert within 3 working days. Thank you.,btohqsg
Go back see records and u will know which one rated u,btohqsg
Apparently for lateness as long as it is complete within the hour  llm will remove the bad rating. Bad attitude or other reasons I won't know.,btohqsg
Someone said oddle platform they can't rate u rite,btohqsg
Prefer oddle though... The customer won't monitor you like someüòÖ,btohqsg
Im late On oddle   once I reach they cancel . I quite just move On lol,btohqsg
Food just in front of me only cannot take because cancel lol,btohqsg
U just take lah. Then go to destination call cs say Ur job gone... They still have to pay u. Or pay u with foodüòú,btohqsg
Just now swipe a job  just 3 mins away. Reach there  walk in  then saw job was cancelledüôÅ,btohqsg
They usually give us 1 hr window to complete the order  ditto for customer side  there is a 1hr time frame. It manages expectations and there is usually no drama on either end becos restaurant is just a vendor and customer can't track your route.,btohqsg
Exactly I Kena twice monitor gps all non oddle,btohqsg
I find that home based food cooks are more anal overall. Restaurant if boss made the booking. If just staff  usually chill so have to access and evaluate when you go for pick up.,btohqsg
Usually if i stack i will always call the last PU and tell them i have your food  i am doing another DO first  my estimated time to u is XXXXhrs. Most all ok. Unless restro is already late then have drama.,btohqsg
They add the $2 waiting time and reassign again,btohqsg
Eh no..they did not cancel the previous order..,btohqsg
This is why many of us kena double booking,btohqsg
The late orders got thrown into the open,btohqsg
From a macro pov  restaurants dont like customer call and chase them. So by calling customer  u acted preemptively oredi.,btohqsg
So basically 2 x order close from the same place..,btohqsg
Waiting for them to claw back $16.03,btohqsg
Quite rare for oddle to cancel without CS or them calling u.,btohqsg
I went thru a few oddle jobs cancel..,btohqsg

Usually 2 outstanding..u clear 1 u can pick 1 more..,btohqsg
When u cancel like this do u get 50%?,btohqsg
Doubt so..cause oversize..not like user cancelled etc..,btohqsg
Look contentious thou. U can angle it in a way that they either pay for the extra weight by upgrading to van or mpv price or cancel at 50% car cost.,btohqsg
U can take butuz ask CS to upgrade the price,btohqsg
If u wanna cancel  u muz show proof that u called customer to confirm size,btohqsg
Only then will refund u some money,btohqsg
Wahhhh  how to call to confirm size siah?,btohqsg
Rough dimension n weight  plus foto,btohqsg
I mean i once asked some customers when i take car job cargo size need trolley or not,btohqsg
Most of the time they giggle at me. Got one told me it is 2 shoe box of shoes. U want u bring up the trolley,btohqsg
Most of the time we driving where got time to ask for photo all man,btohqsg
Can't ask then take the risk of ovw,btohqsg
It should be on the onus of the user if their cargo exceeds veh size,btohqsg
I mean for this case is obv a cheapo wanting to save on van or mpv cost,btohqsg
Why should they get away for being cheapos,btohqsg
I once delivered like 12 toyogo boxes lah,btohqsg
But they were empty and can stack up,btohqsg
Obv over size but can fit into car just do lor,btohqsg

Now  even before the existing support measure has ceased or the outlook improves for taxi and private hire car drivers  Phase 2 (heightened Alert) has once again hit drivers‚Äô ability to pick up passengers.On the back this  the one-time $27 million additional payout was announced for taxi and private hire car drivers on 21 May 2021. This is worth $300 per driver per vehicle  or an additional $10 a day. As mentioned  this will be for the period from end-May to end-June.As the top-up payout coincides with the last CDRF payout under the existing scheme  taxi and private hire car drivers will receive $750 in June ($450 [Existing] + $300 [New])  or $25 per day.With the announcement on 21 May 2021  it was mentioned that the government will also be ‚Äúlooking into a further extension to the CDRF beyond the current tranche ending in end June 2021‚Äù.There is no need for taxi and private hire car drivers to apply for this grant  as the CDRF payouts will automatically receive the top-up through their operator.,btohqsg
