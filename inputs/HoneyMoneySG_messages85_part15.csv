Anyway as I‚Äôve mentioned in the original post  it‚Äôs now back to‚ÄòOnline‚Äô,btohqsg
Maybe I didn't use it during the periods it became offline,btohqsg
Maybe  bc it‚Äôs quite a known thing for a few months. Thankfully it‚Äôs back to online now,btohqsg
how many bonus pt will i get next statement month ? if i max out the 2k,btohqsg
3.6k  it is illustrated in the cc tnc. U can read it up,btohqsg
very hard to earn 2000 instapoint in 1 year,btohqsg
Hi Sorry some stupid question on UOB one saving promotion.I plan to put in 100k on 31st Jan so that my ADB will be 100k on 1st feb onwards ( 100k X 29 days/29 days).However   can  i credit my salary to UOB first prior to 31 jan( etc. today) and try to spend $500 first?,btohqsg
Then you will clock the bonus interest for Jan instead. Which won't have 100k inside. You still have to have 1.6k salary credit and 500 spending next month.,btohqsg
Can I ask for an increase to my credit limit  even if my income doesn‚Äôt increase?I have a CC  reaching one year soon but bank didn‚Äôt offer me anything.,btohqsg
You can try calling in ask  they will ask for income statement before any increase can be approved,btohqsg
Hi  is asking for referral code/links allowed?,btohqsg
@sgpromocodeif not here means no referral link or code available,btohqsg
Can uob lady link with amaze to book overseas hotels?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúLady amaze oversea hotel‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Can I check if you have insufficient funds in your bank when a giro payment hits  will it try again in a few days or is it considered a late payment for your giro bill?,btohqsg
Must use it by linking to Amaze Wallet or can linked with credit card instead  when paying with Amaze card?,btohqsg
https://www.instarem.com/terms-policies/amaze-terms-conditions/#the-amaze-reward(b) the Amaze Transaction was made with linked card as the primary payment method or funding source.,btohqsg
Usually will have 1 backup attempt but you should check with the billing organisation if considered late.,btohqsg
Looks like this promo is for linked card only.,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúGiro fail‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
How do you found out this?,btohqsg
I checked uob one card tnc. Insurance is under exclusions,btohqsg
Usually will not try again  and failed giro bill payment will incur giro handling fee (usually waivable if u request to waive). Need to manual pay with another method before due date.,btohqsg
should look at tnc of uob one account  insurance count to card spend for bonus interest but not to the cc rebate/points,btohqsg
Hi all  when put SGD $$ in webull  how do we activate for SGD Fullerton fund?,btohqsg
Noted let me read the account tnc,btohqsg
only self-initiated giro is excluded  egiro NOT excluded,btohqsg
I am referring to UOB One account but not UOB One credit card.https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/chequeing/one-account/uob-one-account-card-spend.pdf,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  where one is reaching the 100k bal in uob 1 account  can one withdraw appropriate sums of cash so not to reach the cap of 100K and still continue with the salary crediting and 500 mthly credit card charged and earn the high interest ?,btohqsg
can withdraw. Btw note that $100k is average monthly balance  not absolute amount in balance.,btohqsg
Yeah okay üëçGood infor to use this to our advantage,btohqsg
Is based on average monthly balance  not based on the last day when uob calculated the interest payout?,btohqsg
uh  of cos not last day  all days in the month considered,btohqsg
I tried to exploit a loophole and it didn't work.,btohqsg
are u sure it is egiro?,btohqsg
if it worked it's a crazy loophole but I can't elaborate further,btohqsg
self-initiated giro/egiro excluded  auto egiro bill payment not excluded,btohqsg
lol  think u tried the wrong way,btohqsg
I'm getting 1% Cashback for my insurance premium which was setup using egiro  no issue at all.,btohqsg
Unless they just amend the TNC recently,btohqsg
yah  ur insurance is auto egiro bill payment so get 1%,btohqsg
My egiro is setup by me electronically  is this considered self-initiated?,btohqsg
My understanding is:Giro= not recurring  it's one time giro instructionEgiro=once setup  it will be recurring,btohqsg
no lah  giro bill payment is recurring. difference between giro and egiro is giro is setup by submitting physical form  egiro is submit application online/in-app,btohqsg
not self-initiated  as the bill payment is auto,btohqsg
Yes  so regarding it's giro or egiro  as long as it is recurring payment  then will qualified for 1% cashback. If it is normal payment via giro/fast  then excluded.,btohqsg
yes if recurring via application where there is link up between billing organisation and the funding bank,btohqsg
This one should be re-phrased to:One time giro payment is excluded. Recurring giro/egiro payment NOT excluded.,btohqsg
Hi expert  I've registered SCB card and participate in card on file cash rewards with spending of 20 dollar on selected merchant within 30days. May I know the 30days is transaction date or posting date.,btohqsg
lol could be one-time but not self-initiated also. If there is some giro/egiro application to link up billing organisation and the funding bank then should get 1%,btohqsg
