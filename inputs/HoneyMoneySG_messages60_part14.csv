Hi  I am a current UOB lady's card holder. And interested in applying for UOB Lady's Solitaire Card with my new salary.  How do I update UOB with regards to my new salary records  since my previous salary didn't meet the 120k requirement.,btohqsg
Always want to ask this question. Does CPF also use end day balance to calculate? If so  we can top up on 1st Jan to get full year 12 months interest right?,btohqsg
Hi guys  does dining/groceries contributes to the minimum spend of $500 for UOB CC / debit?,btohqsg
Don’t think the mcc in any of the categories,btohqsg
Can do now  it’s calendar month,btohqsg
Yes mine is lady's card and spending on dining triggered the $500 for UOB one account interest if that's what u are asking,btohqsg
And must be using mobile contactless/paywave right?,btohqsg
For Citi cashback + card  are we allowed to transfer the cashback to an actual bank account or can it only be used to offset the following month’s credit card bill?,btohqsg
offset credit card bills in $10s only,btohqsg
is DBS altitude visa card still good? just saw the reduction from 3mpd to 2.2mpd spent,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if private hospital shield plan covers ambulance fees?,btohqsg
Depends on ur policies and plans in place  u are under which insurance?,btohqsg
When does UOB credit the cashback for UOB One credit card?,btohqsg
One month after the end of quarter,btohqsg
Thks. It follows month of credit card application correct?,btohqsg
If I visit an aesthetic clinic  do I get miles from using Citibank premier miles card?,btohqsg
Yea. Top up in Jan to let your $$$ earn a full year of interest.,btohqsg
Cpf uses an unconventional computation. You do not get any interest in the month where funds are deposited or withdrawn. So best to always withdraw on first day  and deposit on last day.,btohqsg
It computes based on the lowest balance of the month,btohqsg
Guys  any fixed deposit with min amount of $10 000 with good interest other than DBS?Trying to park my parents extra money somewhere. They don't trust those online bank like GXS and POEMS lol,btohqsg
You didn't get what I mean. Lowest balance of the month for end of the day balance? Or lowest balance of any time in the account. I would think it is more possible for a system to check the account balance at end of day right. Not very realistic for the system to monitor ur account balance at every second.,btohqsg
GXS is also insurance up to $75k. U can educate your parents,btohqsg
Anyway  I don't think anyone here can answer this question  unless someone has top up his/her CPF on 1st of the month previouly and calculate the full year interest on next year.I think I will email to CPF to ask.,btohqsg
Interest calculated based on lowest amount of the month. So top in Jan  will only get the interest in feb,btohqsg
"Yes. I repeat my question. ""lowest amount"" based on end of day? Or based on every single second.",btohqsg
Usually 01 Jan is public holiday. I am not sure how the amount is calculated n when the money will be credited into your account if you initiated the transfer on 01 Jan. I think bank in on 31 Dec early morning will be a better choice.,btohqsg
How is my CPF interest computed and credited into my accounts?CPF interest is computed monthly. It is credited to your respective accounts by 1 January of the following year and compounded annually.CPF balances used for interest computation are affected by the transactions in your account. For instance  contributions (including refunds) received this month start earning interest next month. Withdrawals/deductions in this month will not earn interest from this month onwards.There are strict procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of members’ CPF accounts and transactions (including interest payments). To further ensure that our system is sound and robust  our statutory auditor performs regular reviews of formulas and computations in our systems for accuracy  and conducts independent verifications of the transactions and account balances.,btohqsg
MA/SA not possible to top on 31 Dec if already MHS/FRS. Even the interest of CPF is given on 10am+ on 1st Jan. I presume afterwards can top up. But whether top up on 1st Jan will be counted interest for Jan or Feb is the question.,btohqsg
Dont really get what u are coming from though. If u are concern then don't game the system. Just a few days interest not much diff,btohqsg
It's one whole month of interest. Not just a few days.,btohqsg
There's an article covering this.Tl;DrCPF interest compound yearlyCPF interest computed monthlyCPF interest computed based on lowest amount for the month (just assume lowest amount at any point of time)Best time to contribute is end of monthBest time to withdraw is start of month,btohqsg
So u top on 1 Jan or 31 Jan..no diff to CPF..that's why people suggested to top on 31,btohqsg
Why not ask the staff at the store?,btohqsg
Iirc it is definitely not 'every second'. There were a long argument in hwz last year or early this year where people argue 'lowest amount' then it means:Case 1.  Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Debit 1K on 3 Jan  Credit 2K on 5 Jan.Case 2. Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Credit 2K on 3 Jan  Debit 1K on 5 Jan.If 'every second'  then lowest amount in Jan will be 9K in case 1  and 10K in case 2.But I think they email CPF got different answer.,btohqsg
Assuming top up $8000  that will be $8000 x 2.5% x (31/365) = $17.66.However if your CPF already hit the max in MA and FRS n you wait till 31 Jan to top up  I believe  if you are still employed  your monthly CPF from job and interest earned from last month/year will be credited into your CPF account to fill up the balance. Hence  the amount you can topup will be much lesser.In summary  if you have hit max in FRS/MA  you have only a “very small window” for you top up. Wait till 31 Jan will reduce the amount you can top up.,btohqsg
Yes. That is my thought too. So I won't wait till 31 Jan to top up. Top up has to be done before the company contribution in Jan  which for my case it is 17 Jan. So that at least I can top up the full 3K/2500 to MA. But top up on say 16 Jan confirm won't get interest in Jan. Just want to check if top up in 1 Jan will get the interest or not.,btohqsg
Call 1 of their branch numbers and ask?,btohqsg
So between 01 and 15 Jan  the difference in interest earned is about $4.93 ? I.e. $3k x 4% x (15/365),btohqsg
The 4% is the MA interest or my bank account interest?,btohqsg
For instance  contributions (including refunds) received this month start earning interest next month. Withdrawals/deductions in this month will not earn interest from this month onwards.,btohqsg
I presume bank account because you can put the money in your bank for 15 days to earn the bank interest?,btohqsg
Honestly if you already MHS/FRS  once the window open to top-up  just do it,btohqsg
Anything credited will only start earning interest in next month.Anything debited will not earn interest in the month itself.This is literally what is stated on CPF website.,btohqsg
For bank yes. Tbh the diff is so negligible to discuss. U should be more concern for topping up to reduce the income tax..,btohqsg
The window is very small. Rush for it even if loss $5 of interest. You can earn from tax saving n higher interest from there on.,btohqsg
Yeah. For the past few years  I have been doing it between 7 Jan - 13 Jan  knowing that I won't get the interest for Jan for my MA. So out of curiosity want to check how CPF capture the 'lowest amount' in their system  so to see maybe I can top up on 1 Jan to get Jan's interest as well.,btohqsg
The lowest amount thing should honestly just be ignored lol.We just use your 2 cases  either case is the same.Interest for this month computed with: 9kInterest for next month computed with (before any debits): 11k,btohqsg
I know what is stated in CPF web site. They only state the general scenario. They don't tell you how and when exactly they capture the 'lowest amount' for example. And the 'lowest amount' is not what we general think. Refer to my case above for the hwz argument.Case 1.  Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Debit 1K on 3 Jan  Credit 2K on 5 Jan.Case 2. Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Credit 2K on 3 Jan  Debit 1K on 5 Jan.If 'every second'  then lowest amount in Jan will be 9K in case 1  and 10K in case 2.But I think they email CPF got different answer.,btohqsg
Just take it as lowest of the lowest amount lor. 9k nonetheless. Since any contributions only start computing in the next month lol.,btohqsg
How is it 9K. In case 2  the CPF balance will never drop till 9K. It will be 10K -> 12K -> 11K. There is no 9K.,btohqsg
