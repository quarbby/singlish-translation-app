Hi what is the best card to earn mile point now? Each month will spent around 1k to 1.5k,btohqsg
Women world master card limit is 2K  but miles will expire after 12 months. And DBS exclude amaze as eligible transaction.Citi reward limit is 1k  travel category not eligible  it‚Äôs almost a MUST to pair it with Amaze card. Miles expire 5 years after the upon activation of the card. Has more airline to transfer.HSBC revo limit is 1k  includes travel category  cannot pair with Amaze card  miles expire after 36 months. Has fewer airline to transfer.,btohqsg
All these are 10x reward points or 4mpd. There are lesser reward but miles never expire.,btohqsg
Uob PPV And VS also offer 4mpd,btohqsg
If you use the contactless on UOB selected merchants you will get their cash back reward system instead of miles.,btohqsg
Really find that Citibank service sucks. HSBC is so much better.Informed HSBC to change my statement date. Within 3days is done. Citi on the other hand 2 weeks later still not done. I had to call and chase,btohqsg
Relief to know I am not the only one.Worse thing is when I called Citi  the staff told me the online chat is working fine  ask me to uninstall and install the app again.,btohqsg
lol rare case that HSBC is providing good service,btohqsg
If you watch his one credit card video  he did explain it very well,btohqsg
Have a feeling there will be number of nerfs in 2023 ...,btohqsg
unless citi also nerf Amaze like DBS,btohqsg

Top right corner of the app,btohqsg
Under account tab? Does not have it for my phone. Could it be that I am a new customer?,btohqsg
Not sure. It is quite obvious...,btohqsg
Amex has good customer services. Usually  you do not have to wait at all,btohqsg
hearing impaired. Any other written channel?,btohqsg
Amex tcb users  how long does it take for the cashback to come up?  I know they same same month but I‚Äôve not had a single dollar come up in my cashback.,btohqsg
I thought got quite a hefty fees,btohqsg
Hi all does anyone know if I'm using the ocbc 360 CC  if I book SIA air ticket  do I get 3% Cashback?,btohqsg
I use dbs women master card wanting go check the MCC. Thinking whether if it can used to pair with citi rewards and amaze card to get miles?,btohqsg
When you receive the bill it will reflect.,btohqsg

For traveling what card to use to get the best exchange rate?,btohqsg
May I know am I eligible for 3 % Cashback if I top up ezlink usingocbc 360 CC for land transport category?,btohqsg
Don't think too only u use as simply go,btohqsg
Hi guys do you all still recommend applying for the CityRewardsMC to pair with Amaze now? or do you think it‚Äôll be nerfed eventually?,btohqsg
With so many banks nerfing it a tell tale sign,btohqsg
still worth the shot applying? üòÇ i don‚Äôt wanna apply and then next minute it‚Äôs nerfed.,btohqsg
To me I'm I feel not worth But u factor in if no amaze what u Gina do wirh it or stop using it,btohqsg
Hi all for Citi reward card. If use it with Amaze card on grab and gojek still will earn 10x bonus point ?,btohqsg
Nothing is fixed in CC world. In my case I applied and also foresee if it is nerfed will I still be able to deploy the card in other areas? from there you can decide if you want to go or not instead of thinking when it will be nerfed.,btohqsg
Good morning !Even without Amaze  Citi Rewards is still good for online buys if you do plenty of them.Hi I am Timothy. I like cashback cards so I guess I‚Äôll find like minded folks here.,btohqsg
Cheers guys for your reply üëçüèª thanks for the input.,btohqsg
New to this channel. I got the link from the YouTube video. Does anyone pair Amaze card with UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
After min $800 p.a spend on SIA related. Users get 3mpd on online transactions (dining  shopping  travel  transport),btohqsg
Any noticeable limitation difference between having it only on the phone vs physical card?,btohqsg
Understand that amaze converts transaction into an online transaction. But wonder if UOB Krisflyer have any exclusion (either for amaze directly like the dbs women card  or MCC code for online transactions),btohqsg
Any differences between the 3 cpfoa agent banks? All rates and charges are the same?,btohqsg
No difference onlyt u can top up via apple pay,btohqsg
Newer iphone if no power still can tap,btohqsg
