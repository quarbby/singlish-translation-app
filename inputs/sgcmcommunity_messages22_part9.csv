Like the sg carmart reviewer said u felt like a king on the road with that more torque on the wheel   just a small tap is needed to over take,btohqsg
For such performance in sg   it is very cheap,btohqsg
Look at rs3 and m3 price tag,btohqsg
M3 price tag I can get a model s when it out in sg,btohqsg
Ya not even comparable in terms of price just so worth,btohqsg
have you drove it to malaysiaa?,btohqsg
i just dk how people can drive there sia espcially those kampong area where got no charging,btohqsg
like you literally have to go to townside just to charge,btohqsg
Easy just bring own charger   there got industrial charger socket,btohqsg
his tesla is a baby. he baby him,btohqsg
Actually can  there is a person out there on TikTok who took his model 3 all the way to Langkawi. Just need to plan and will probably take longer than ICE as some chargers very slow  need to leave overnight,btohqsg
take your tesla to malaysia and do a youtube for us la. be a man!,btohqsg
Yes unless is 11 kw and above if u have those like 4 kw is like 8 hours,btohqsg
There so many video lioa loll,btohqsg
dont just buy a tesla to floor in front of traffic lights.,btohqsg
Always got meet up and drive to Malaysia,btohqsg
Can look at this playlist. Model 3 taken to Malaysia,btohqsg
die sia liddat tbh if need to wait this type of time,btohqsg
To me I don’t like go long drive if more then 400 and such I will get a petrol car,btohqsg
Hope the new model s battery pack is way better,btohqsg
Don’t know true anot 1000Km give some discount also is 700Km can drive to kl liao,btohqsg
The claimed range on the model S long range is 600km  realistic tests have shown around 450 to 480km with the 19 inch rims  highway driving,btohqsg
Obviously adding city driving will help a lot!,btohqsg
Yes sure need like 30% reduction   due to spirited driving also   tesla changing the 4680Battery and range should go higher,btohqsg
Not just that I guess  EPA testing conditions also have aircon off  tested on empty testing tracks usually where the same speed can be maintained and manufacturers make sure to set the tire pressured etc. to the best possible setup for the actual day and conditions themselves. Across the board not just Tesla so realistic tests are important,btohqsg
Same as car fc ma haha   we know we never achieve that also,btohqsg
Why not? It’s the tiny round button on the driver side door panel.,btohqsg
A lot don’t have auto start stop actually. You can also code it off.,btohqsg
Yep not even comparable. They are two things. Different vehicles  different drive characteristics beyond brochure numbers.,btohqsg
Yup m3 is one of my favorite car  This is actually a good read just sharinghttps://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-m3-elon-musk,btohqsg
Both good at what they do! I would say that the lap with drifting I would give to the M3 😁😁 because more fun to drift hahah,btohqsg
Take note of the price difference is near I Thier cointry   Singapore price difference is just so hige,btohqsg
Interesting read but cannot compare bah. Like you would never compare an SUV to a sedan as an apple to apple comparison. Same way  both different purpose and different target groups,btohqsg
But Mazda 3 best  no need to change transmission fluid or service you know. Very reliable,btohqsg
mazda made the 3 and 6 into what every middle income dreams of - a stylish and comfortable sedan car that is reliable and affordable,btohqsg
deserved all the awards they got,btohqsg
talking bout mazda. recently a lot mz3 n 6 in my carpark.... all red or white. Mari Kita 😂,btohqsg
their design really keeps getting better!,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/IW_5P3T19NUwah Mr X@Cxspeed.. envy your legend ride man. Give me this any day.. the sheer joy of listening and enjoying the experience of driving such a car must be awesome. That V8  each time that DCT changes gear especially on the rev match downshifts  the enhanced EDC suspension set up and that exhaust… 🥰🥰🥰 wah and that timeless body design 👍🏼,btohqsg

That’s how AD business model works and milk their customers. Hopefully Mercedes are reliable enough not to see them too frequent!,btohqsg
yeah saw this video last year. i like teh shift lights. looks like F1. there is a way to switch it to FASTEST DCT gear shift. level 7 (7 bars). first got to turn off Traction Control Off. Then the shift would be fastest.,btohqsg
Benz is still relatively reliable among the 3 musketeers.  Maybe their customers  mostly matured middle to old age men who dun floor all the time,btohqsg
drift with tesla 3. yes you canhttps://youtu.be/H_AyNQtjOlQ,btohqsg
"""it drifts really good"" with low cg",btohqsg
@bbfasingaporego do this. stop flooring pedal. mai thu liao,btohqsg
So Interesting.. the GTS? where are the shift lights?,btohqsg
Only on the GTS? Yours don’t have?,btohqsg
Wah cool man. Really like F1,btohqsg
How about the DCT shift level bars to the secret 7? Yours also have?,btohqsg
