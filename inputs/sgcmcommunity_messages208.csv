No matter how slow not suppose to side sweep.Cam car doing lane keeping.If all side sweep 50/50  I see people buey song I side sweep so each settle their own repair?This dosent make sense and not in accordance.,btohqsg
Why u bother how pple drive?,btohqsg
So that’s aside slow driving haha.,btohqsg
But if slow driving ya is Hogger.But hogger dosent means ppl can side sweep.So its 2 different matter.,btohqsg
Maybe car got problem? Then u side sweep. Means u right? If see people walk slow during green man  u hit  also right? lol.Slow means can hit ah?,btohqsg
Pple is asking for help about videos not asking comments? I thinking weather is 50/50 or not not we say all goes to TP to decide.,btohqsg
Den u report to TP lah,btohqsg
Or u TP if not wait till u become  tansport minister den u change the law,btohqsg
No wonder Sg drivers have such bad reputations,btohqsg
If want pm  merc would have already stopped.If run  means confirm won’t return. Return for what.Just report to TP.,btohqsg
Forgot  pay so much for a car. Thts y must ego on the road,btohqsg
No wonder so much accident you might be one of the cause,btohqsg
Asking for video u talk do much,btohqsg
Sbs drivers is the worst. Not sg. Is those driving Sbs drivers. Lolz,btohqsg
He drive a tank. Cause he always survives.,btohqsg
Or maybe some rich kid like to get stone chips on your bonnet and bumper than go home and take from parents to do repair,btohqsg
Why u don’t want chase down merc?,btohqsg
Pple asking for video help not asking for his comments.,btohqsg
U jealous pple pay so much for car? And u can't?? 🤔,btohqsg
I tried awhile but traffic wasn’t very clear  and i don want to endanger other road user cause idk what’s on the drivers mind,btohqsg
His ego is spend a lot money on the car and to drive fast at all lanes tailgating ppl,btohqsg
Ya. I poor. Can't afford a car,btohqsg
Wa I so proud of u admit yourself poor,btohqsg
So can only come in thrash talk,btohqsg
Ok. If can update the results here. If 100/0 u win this person comment and judgement alr haha.,btohqsg
U talk need to pay ah? Den u should be rich cannot be poor mah?,btohqsg
I don’t see how is cam car wrong. lol,btohqsg
50/50 is the way insurance sign off for each other,btohqsg
Then charge both drivers premium during next renewal and makan ncd,btohqsg
Then like that I buy comprehensive for what,btohqsg
Camcar has reasonable following distance with front car. Not hogging,btohqsg
I respect u sia. Transport minster also u TP also u now insurance agent also u. 🫡,btohqsg
I like how a video become so contentious. Make the chat interesting,btohqsg
Talk is free ma. Ike some one said,btohqsg

Idk leh. Not I say de must ask the future minister or TP,btohqsg
Find 1 day I really wanna meet the bee guy,btohqsg
Know more this type of high ranking pple very 👍,btohqsg
We are supposed to drive with road conditions,btohqsg
So if means if road all going 90  u R SUPPOSE TO GO 90 unless u are a heavy veh,btohqsg
Otherwise u are required to keep left,btohqsg
If road conditions is 50 and u gng 90 then yes U ARE THE PROBLEM then,btohqsg
Don't say. Ltr they say U talk only,btohqsg
😂😂😂 all the sohai. I just damn disgusted with lane 2 and 3 heavy vehicles hogging,btohqsg
In any lane or ? Land 2 also cannot?,btohqsg
No la. Lane 2 is slow lane,btohqsg
If u really need to ask me this qn means u shud surrender ur license and retake BTT lol,btohqsg
But eitherways to guy who got sideswiped,btohqsg
Report police hit n run and claim insurance lo,btohqsg
For all yk he report to his own insurance liao,btohqsg
Problem  is hit n run n side swipe is 2 separate matters,btohqsg
Both insurance will play 50/50 to close case n move on,btohqsg
So lane 2 must go at 90?,btohqsg
Cos I always stay at 60/70,btohqsg
Lane 1 suppose to be empty n used for overtaking only,btohqsg
Lane 2 is for vehicles travelling to the speed limit of expressway,btohqsg
Actually yes. Purpose of lane 1 is solely for overtaking,btohqsg
So lane 1 is used for overtaking slow pokes on lane 2,btohqsg
But when lane 3 n 4 is faster than lane 2  then tht idiot on lane 2 is the problem,btohqsg
So if u wanna cruise  jt shud be left. In other countries where expressway lane only 2 lanes  lane 1 is solely overtaking slower or heavy vehicles w speed limits. Then if u on lane 1 w a faster vehicle coming  u are expected to give way,btohqsg
Thts the reason why there's always jam,btohqsg
🤣🤣 i ever drove speed limits on lane 3 and i faster than the heavy vehicles on lane 2,btohqsg
I can't imagine if he lane 1 n 2 on autobahn,btohqsg
Actually sg dont need so many lanes,btohqsg
We just need people to actually follow the rules,btohqsg
Other country w x100 of our veh pop also survive w 2 lanes,btohqsg
Autobahn going at 200  I see another car coming in fast I also fo,btohqsg
Frm the amk pie exit  lane 4 can reach Bukit timah exit fastest,btohqsg
But just need watch out for mergers from the sliproads,btohqsg
It's fine can just go around as long as got space,btohqsg
Miss the fun days driving in europe,btohqsg
No lol its some ppl just change without checking,btohqsg
Now can't wait to surrender pink IC and move down under,btohqsg
Down under golf R 40k nia,btohqsg

Want to start the year w a bang,btohqsg
Full cash also full to company UEN,btohqsg
That’s y I say immediate xfer or else cxl,btohqsg
I’m quite confused by this news when I read it actually,btohqsg
But have to say  some dealers love to be cunning,btohqsg
Invoice must write immediate xfer or cxl,btohqsg
But still risky. The dealer still can don’t immediate xfer after u pay him,btohqsg
Anyone knows if they will help install if VEP collection is at paradigm mall ?,btohqsg
So best if buy car is buy from Authorised dealer?,btohqsg
I think best is miw deploy a bot. All $$ n car ownership xfer to it 1st.,btohqsg
Sorry  didn’t get what does Miw mean?,btohqsg
Any DEALERSHIPS by LAW needs to trf within 7 days. Most dealerships do it on the spot. Some trf upon disbursement of loan,btohqsg
In his case since its full cash  there is absolutely NO REASON to not trf immediately.,btohqsg
Went to play w the WRV,btohqsg
the feel I get is like the old honda city gm7 tht became fat,btohqsg
But it's bigger than the Malaysia WRV,btohqsg
That's news article is another side of Singapore Car Culture I never understood. Pardon me if I live under a rock.,btohqsg
The first time I saw the WRV when I was in Batam 🤣,btohqsg
The hit n run thingy lol,btohqsg
that WRV doesn't look that much different from the HRV/Vezel it's based on,btohqsg
roti prata based on egg  but no taste,btohqsg
Tried Prata house ? At upp Thomson ?,btohqsg
not yet la  but I go when I have chance ba,btohqsg
Don’t order the plain… eat alr very gerlat,btohqsg
WRV is shorter  taller and boxy,btohqsg
No  just my opinion after looking at the photos.,btohqsg
But can't fully judge till I see one in person lor,btohqsg
Oh ya… alamak that’s how long I nvr go Batam liao,btohqsg
But by the looks of it  It's like about the same size. but shorter wheelbase  seen from wiki and the spec sheets,btohqsg
How does it look the same,btohqsg
Also like to ask  Does the Honda Vezel/HRV have issue on stability at highway? Cuz my dad said it la and I cannot confirm till I ask la,btohqsg
The a/c can reach to the back one if toggle one mode,btohqsg
The 1st batch of Vezel need add $$$,btohqsg
GL and RU varints of WRV and HRV respectively,btohqsg
Now the current batch some PI give free,btohqsg
Yeah my friend has one ..,btohqsg
The drive is ok la… for norm,btohqsg
If want to go NSHW then no lah.. max out at 178 🤣,btohqsg
Stuck there … so cute sia,btohqsg
Not many places on nshw can go faster than 160 also,btohqsg
Rear AC is overrated. Even if have also barely works. The efficiency is like shit,btohqsg
Have to on very strong fan for rear passengers to feel much,btohqsg
True .. until the road very clear then can,btohqsg
I tried some cars for the past 2 months already,btohqsg
Malacca onwards thru KL have 3 lanes so better,btohqsg
Eh not u. There was a scammer jn,btohqsg
Upper thomson road roti prara hse must order egg. Their kosong prata cmi,btohqsg
More like to regulate the cold air behind,btohqsg
I think my pick is the Suzuki Swift. Rented a few times via GetGo and have to say it's fun to drive and quite nimble for a low-hp economy car. (Disclaimer  Not sponsered by Getgo),btohqsg
Don’t worry sir .. we won’t anyhow,btohqsg
I tried 3 cars from them,btohqsg
BYD Atto 3  Hyundai Kona EV (OS) and Suzuki Swift Mild Hybrid (A2L),btohqsg
That one need Class 3  I only have 3A,btohqsg
That's ok  It's best I start with 3A to get going.,btohqsg
U learn everything at 1 go,btohqsg
Did intent to but don't have the money to support for additional lessons,btohqsg
9 yrs ago I took class 3,btohqsg
But well  I'll definitely consider going for class 3 once I'm in a better financial position,btohqsg
I mean  everybody has a pace in getting started.,btohqsg
Class 1 is for handicap drivers,btohqsg
Now so many different variants of classes liao,btohqsg
Now got 3a 3 and 3C,btohqsg
3 and 3A not that confusing,btohqsg
I don’t mind having 4 and 4A,btohqsg
I went Aussie I manual all the way,btohqsg
but have to pass Class 3,btohqsg
Class 4 is bus driver license,btohqsg
After work drive Volvo Mercs home,btohqsg
You so tired it's as good as you're driving under influence,btohqsg
Or at least those in the 80s n 90#,btohqsg
I never dare to drive a car when I'm super fatigued,btohqsg
You do it lor. Then you know what I meant,btohqsg
U meet w k ns driver on the road  U super alert,btohqsg
Nevermind la  I met some drivers on roads who are very amateurish,btohqsg
Seen too much drama on dashcam footage from SGRV orRoads.sg,btohqsg
seen quite a few in my short experience as well,btohqsg
4A is for public bus drivers,btohqsg
I want go drive bus as part time sja,btohqsg
im taking class 4 to drive bus,btohqsg
4A is not as good as 4,btohqsg
4 can drive 4A (with familiarization training) but 4A cannot drive 4,btohqsg
Remember the pair of bus fans in the news lately? They both have Class 4 under A&S Transit la,btohqsg
But I might get if I possible,btohqsg
But get license means back 2 p plate,btohqsg
isok i drive public bus dont need p plate. but if iw to drive prime mover etc then need,btohqsg
isnit next coe bidding is this wed?,btohqsg
