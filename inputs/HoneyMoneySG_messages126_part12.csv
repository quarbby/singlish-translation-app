Any recommended cards for mile chasers for iHerb?,btohqsg
What card do u have? Or are you applying for new card?,btohqsg
I have most of the usual recommended cards  not intending to apply new,btohqsg
MCC is 5499. You can check against Heymax for recommended cards.,btohqsg
Thank you  will go with wwmc,btohqsg
Only for the 5KExtract from TnCFee waivers are only applicable up to the specified capped amount of S$5 000. Subsequent sums invested will be subjected to Syfe’s management fees.,btohqsg
Oops sorry  realised you have already got the answer.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  I’m thinking to get amaze + UOB lady’s. Selecting “dining” as a preferred category. May I know if I pay petrol  take grab  shopping and etc using Amaze. Will I still get 4mpd? Not getting CRMC due to UOB ONE. Thank you.,btohqsg
No cuz those are not under UOB dining mcc,btohqsg
Thank you for your reply. Could you advise on the category should I choose for online spending? Since  amaze converts all spending as online spending.,btohqsg
What credit card suitable for $7k local spend ?,btohqsg
"There are varying MCCs for online spending on shopping platforms  there is no category that covers all the various MCCs  though some of the MCCs may fall under the Fashion category. Amaze does not change the MCC  only coverts to online. ""Online"" is not a MCC. MCCs for petrol and Grab ride falls under transport category.",btohqsg
As the folks say  UOB 'Fashion' category is narrow covering clothes  shoes and leather goods. May be u like to consider shopping at departmental stores to increase the chance of getting the mcc required.,btohqsg
How should I pay for my credit card spendings in Europe?,btohqsg
Anyone face frequently fraud transactions on Citibank credit cards. Two of my C cards had transactions without activation of cards.,btohqsg
Normal. Just report  get new card  rinse and repeat.,btohqsg
Hi there  would like to check where & when do we see standard chartered smart credit card points in app?,btohqsg
Given how frequent we see such cases with citibank  will locking the card via the app be of any help to deter?Have we seen any cases of fraudulent transactions still going through despite locking the card?,btohqsg
Just curious  why dont people simply use UOB PPV card instead  then use ladies for strictly travel?,btohqsg
yes twice for me  on the same citi card. have never had any cards facing this issue before on other banks in my life. going terminate my citi card as it is a hassle.,btohqsg
Bcuz ppl dont like 5$ block and uob$ merchant,btohqsg
Actually I'm not sure what's the uob merchant about  I still get my 4mpd all the time,btohqsg
I mean if you don't mind locking and unlocking everytime you use lol,btohqsg
UOB PPV is not included in the $500 mthly spend for UOB one account,btohqsg
Because you just haven’t come across one lorh  good for you.,btohqsg
I see  understood. all have different needs. IMO daily essential card is still uob onetravel with uob lady  and extra spending with PPV,btohqsg
Ya that being said. Im using uob lady + uob ppv and the combo works for me. I also have uob kf and uob prvi for other use cases.,btohqsg
Waiting for bank to close outstanding settlement,btohqsg
But there won’t be upfront discount for petrol right?,btohqsg
Citi rewards rounding down to 1$. I feel 2$ and above then the effect rounding loss isn't too bad.,btohqsg
But amaze gets points for above $10 right?,btohqsg
Well I never really paid much attention to it. With so much nerf  will take a long time to even cash out amaze pts.,btohqsg
is there a good welcome bonus for new users if i wanna sign up for a UOB cc?,btohqsg

@mellywellycyou asked at the right time 😄,btohqsg
Will there be additional 2% fx fees from crmc + amaze side on top of the grab 3%?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo  for now  still earn 4mpd on grab and comfort delgro rides right?,btohqsg
Wa that’s a lot of additional cost for 4Mpd  about 5% additional cost compared to paying with cash.Won’t UOB one card be better in this case? 8.33%> all the markup?,btohqsg
yea 8.33% > (3.25% + 3%). So it depends if u value 4mpd-5% more or 2.08%,btohqsg
There is also UOB One offer if you don't prefer mileshttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/221605,btohqsg
Is there any way to bypass the grab 3% foreign payment method fee other than using cash?,btohqsg
Can only use local issued card (eg in MY use MY card) or topup grabwallet,btohqsg
Top up grabpay wallet using youtrip/amaze wallet,btohqsg
