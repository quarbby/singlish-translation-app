The Edge Centurion Club 2020: Avarga‚Äôs name change reflects growing ambition while it generates earnings growthBy Felicia Tan (felicia.tan@bizedge.com)1257 words14 December 2020The Edge SingaporeEDGESIEnglish(c) 2020 The Edge Publishing Pte Ltd. All Rights Reserved.What‚Äôs in a name? Everything  it seems  for Avarga. The investment holding company is named after the steppes where the first nomadic capital of the Mongol empire eight centuries ago was located before it grew to become the largest contiguous land kingdom in history.Before its name change in April 2018  Avarga  listed on the Mainboard in October 1980  was known as UPP Holdings  which stood for United Pulp & Paper Holdings.According to Avarga‚Äôs CEO Ian Tong  the new name is fitting because it reflected the changing nature of the business as the company had clearly evolved beyond being a paper manufacturing company.Avarga of the Mongol empire was not just a capital staffed by administrators and court officials. It had played a more important role as a collection and redistribution centre for goods and resources to the rest of the empire. ‚ÄúI feel that is reflective of our group‚Äôs vision ‚Äù says Ian in an interview with The Edge Singapore.Avarga‚Äôs executive chairman is Tong Kooi Ong  Ian‚Äôs father and chairman of The Edge Media Group  the parent company of the publisher of The Edge Singapore. Ian is also an executive director of The Edge Media Group.From paper production  new businesses are being ‚Äúmethodically‚Äù added  says Ian. Avarga also looks at new ventures ‚Äúopportunistically‚Äù and along with each new addition  an expansion of its asset base.‚ÄúCritically  we also centralise resources at the group level  which means a more efficient use of capital and therefore a better return to shareholders ‚Äù he explains.At this year‚Äôs Centurion Club award  Avarga has been named the company with the fastest growth in profit after tax for the industry sector: Applied Resources; Energy ‚Äî Fossil Fuels; Mineral Resources  which is a first for the company.The companies were scored using their earnings growth over the past three financial years. In FY2016 ended December  Avarga reported earnings of $12.6 million. In FY2019  earnings hit $32.6 million  representing a CAGR of 37.4% during the evaluation period.To be sure  the FY2019 earnings were lifted by a one-off gain of $10.9 million from the sale of a warehouse at 35 Tuas View Crescent. There was also a foreign exchange gain of $3.7 million versus a loss of $6.1 million in the preceding year. More importantly  margins had improved to 11% from 8.9% in the previous year.Ian is appreciative that Avarga has won this recognition. ‚ÄúIt can be challenging for small- and mid-cap listed companies to generate investor awareness on our own  so we really appreciate this event and feel proud to be featured ‚Äù he says.‚ÄúThis award is really an acknowledgement of a phenomenal team all the way down to each member of each subsidiary of our group. This reflects everyone‚Äôs efforts  we‚Äôre thrilled with this  and hopefully  we‚Äôll be back next year ‚Äù he adds.Avarga has three core business activities: Paper manufacturing  power generation and the distribution of building materials. It currently operates across five countries with some 800 employees  and in FY2019  generated revenue of $1.404 billion.Of the three main businesses  Avarga‚Äôs building materials distribution business is operated via Canadian company Taiga Building Products  which is separately listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.Avarga  which holds 69.7% of Taiga  acquired the stake in 2017. ‚ÄúThe rationale was quite straightforward. In terms of strategy  Avarga‚Äôs acquisition of Taiga facilitated a balance sheet deleveraging which allowed Taiga to expand its US network. Building materials demand in the US has been strong  and we feel like our strategy has paid off so far ‚Äù he explains.,btohqsg
‚ÄúWe generally do not get hung up on whether a potential target asset is private or publicly listed  or even if it is a new venture necessarily. The transactional process may differ  but the investment metrics we evaluate are the same ‚Äù he adds.Exploring opportunitiesAvarga was in the news in August after a sudden spike in its share price triggered a query from Singapore Exchange.As the company responded back then  it was ‚Äúexploring opportunities‚Äù for its paper manufacturing business These included the expansion or a potential listing of this business. It was also considering ‚Äúa possible transaction which will allow it to monetise its investment in the power plant located in Myanmar‚Äù. In addition  Taiga had just reported strong earnings growth following strong demand for its products.During that time  Ian had told The Edge Singapore in an interview that the paper production business  which focuses on packaging cardboard  was seeing strong demand because of growth in online commerce  and that the potential listing ‚Äî if and when it happens ‚Äî is meant to raise funds to boost production capacity and capture this growth trend which is expected to continue over some time.In the latest interview  Ian says the demand for paper packaging remains strong and that the company is still ‚Äúexploring various opportunities related to the paper business and will certainly provide updates when appropriate‚Äù.As for Taiga  it did not entirely foresee a jump in lumber prices due to a congruence of two factors: Sawmills cutting back production just as the pandemic spread and more homeowners making use of the downtime during lockdowns to redo or renovate their houses  driving up demand and prices.Putting that anomaly caused by external factors aside  Ian expects Taiga‚Äôs business to continue growing at a steady rate that had already been achieved before this year.‚ÄúThere will always be macro-cyclical dynamics in our industry  but there are a lot of initiatives within our control that can continue to drive gains. These include strategic integrations  technological adoption for better inventory and distribution management  improving product lines and mix  and so on ‚Äî just to name a few ‚Äù he explains.‚ÄúLumber prices presented a short-term catalyst this year and we were in a strong position to capitalise on it. However  it is certainly not something we rely on to drive performance ‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOur profitability does not come from the futures market. Taiga‚Äôs business model is to generate earnings by playing a critical role in the housing supply chain and our focus is on being the most efficient distributor and manufacturer across a wide range of building materials ‚Äù he adds.Since Ian took over as Avarga‚Äôs CEO early this year  he has introduced ways to make the company even more shareholder-friendly.For instance  the company introduced a new dividend policy in June where it would pay out quarterly dividends  which is a rarity among Singapore-listed entities that are not REITs. To put it into context  DBS Group Holdings is the only notable big cap other than REITs to pay quarterly.Asked about plans for Avarga the next year and beyond  Ian says they are pretty much the same for the next five years  which is to enable initiatives ‚Äúto optimise return on equity  increase asset base  and generate better efficiencies in our ongoing business operations‚Äù.‚ÄúThat said  if Covid-19 has taught us anything  it is to always be prepared for the unexpected. However well we plan and prepare  it is all about ability and execution. In other words  it is about the people in our organisation. Our combined efforts led to us winning this award and we look forward to accomplishing greater heights next year ‚Äù he says.,btohqsg
Hope this doesn't affect the share price tmr,btohqsg

Ooo.. this news i din see it üòÇ,btohqsg
Something to ponder:Here‚Äôs some info from the UK government website:1. The vaccine is not safe for pregnant women or women planning on becoming pregnant within a few months of taking the vaccine2) The vaccine is not safe for those that are immuno suppressed3) No testing has been done to determine any long-term side effects4) No testing has been done to determine side effects if taken with long term medications5) It is unknown if the vaccine will cause infertility6) Taking the vaccine will not stop you spreading the virus but will only reduce your symptoms (for years the doctors told us to rest  take paracetamol and drink plenty of fluids to achieve the same result)7) You can't breastfeed if you have had the vaccine8)The vaccine has not been tested on children and may not be suitable for young persons under the age of 169) The vaccine is only 95% effective....meaning 5% of people that had the vaccine still had severe covid19 symptoms....the demograph and outcome of those 5% of people are being withheld...10) Average age of death of persons in UK over past 10 years - 81years old....Average age of death of persons dying with/from Covid19 in 2020 - 82 years old11) If the mortality rate of 0.3% is unacceptable for covid19 virus....why is 5% now an acceptable rate for vaccine failure?12) If the vaccine is safe....why do the government and manufacturers accept no responsibility for death or injury resulting from the vaccine?now before you say this cant be true all this is on gov website herehttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR2L52Cv7dyCPr9ZNAxw3aH933qaWXBW9Sc0_BGsU7w5TxOqQER0owFxbkI,btohqsg
