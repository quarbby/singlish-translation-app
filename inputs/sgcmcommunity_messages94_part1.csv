u charge 3k on a prius,btohqsg
PPL WILL STILL DRIVE THE FKIN PRIUS,btohqsg
3k over 1 year is $250 monthly,btohqsg
He clearly has a prejudice against performance car owners,btohqsg
They think parking too cheap  they rather pay fee evading fine. Contribute to society,btohqsg
"Because you're adding in irrational points and just trying to twist the narrative when a simple principle of ""drive less=road tax lower"" is in front of you",btohqsg
"But you want to make it about ""sports car owners  green plan  high emissions  someone not paying for parking""",btohqsg
I think i shall buy a alpine,btohqsg
Small cc small car  enough to smoke most big cc cars,btohqsg
The higher road tax paid by those who drive more will cover it up.....,btohqsg
Be it small engine  big engine  no engine  etc.,btohqsg
u know whats the best solution,btohqsg
May i ask mr tio  do u drive or own a car?,btohqsg
"No  ""tax the rich  make cars free for the rest  free petrol  free everything""",btohqsg
price go up  ppl will complain until sibei dulanzzz,btohqsg
Read the room. Someone else should die,btohqsg
wait so whats the problem w big cc?,btohqsg
EITHER IM A RETARD OR SOMEONE ISNT MAKING SENSE,btohqsg
yes used to be a geog student  what about ut,btohqsg
Basically the discussion is revisions to the coe/road tax structure,btohqsg
i tell you how to solve congestion  you ready?,btohqsg
But someone decided to throw a spanner,btohqsg
ERP = Mileage. Simple. Everybody pay a fair share. Road Tax remain the same. Big CC boys pay big road tax  small CC boys pay little road tax.,btohqsg
Let ERP cover the mileage  Road tax cover emissions,btohqsg
They should be allowed to have nice things just because they are rich,btohqsg
thats why we have Road Tax,btohqsg
Ok lah everyone buy copen 660cc settle already,btohqsg
Okay so let me tell you the problem with this,btohqsg
No must ban  why they make so big cc in the first place,btohqsg
we all assume big CC = alot of emissions hor,btohqsg
Volvo have 2.0L cars but i believe they have one of the highest emissions,btohqsg
The whole point is  a Ferrari that drives 15k km in 10 years vs Vios that drives 400k km,btohqsg
higher than your 296GTB  higher than any hybrid sportscar,btohqsg
green earth means we all die bro  plants civilisation take over us,btohqsg
WHY ALOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS NOWADAYS,btohqsg
Now if you charge based on usage  I assure you  vios will pay way more than the Ferrari would've paid in 10 years,btohqsg
And the Ferrari is still paying for the 15k km....,btohqsg
I think precisely because the rich are hogging the resource by ‘parking’,btohqsg
plants v zombie irl  pea shooter time,btohqsg
And it's not a fixed cost per km,btohqsg
A component of emissions will still likely be involved,btohqsg
So now we have your problem,btohqsg
so you think the rich are preventing the normal ppl from buying regular car isit?,btohqsg
But you also don't want to be the vios and pay more,btohqsg
"And just put everything on the ""rich""",btohqsg
So you really just want this  got it,btohqsg
Ok tomorrow i email in  whats your email? I cc you,btohqsg
Not just the rich but also the phv companies. Else why would they think it is a viable business to hog,btohqsg
Aiya might as well. Need to appease the green man here,btohqsg
If you think this way  this is from your point of view  but what about from the government POV. You buy the car  you park the car. Easy revenue bro. You not only pay the High COE ARF Road Tax  you contribute to boosting the COE price,btohqsg
