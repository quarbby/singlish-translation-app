If you're headed up north quite worth,btohqsg
Bro  your view of Malaysia really backward,btohqsg
Because Thai can easily buy cannabis and weapons easier to buy,btohqsg
That's why don't use the beat the jam app always,btohqsg
Use camera and Google maps also,btohqsg
Cus alot of us cross daily,btohqsg
But if everyday 200k ppl cross,btohqsg
And only 5 ppl get robbed,btohqsg
If you leave expensive things on your seats all out in the open to steal,btohqsg
Of course will get robbed one,btohqsg
Or stop in very shady places,btohqsg
Guys. A bit late to the track discussion. It doesn’t matter if slow but please watch your track etiquette especially if first time. Everyone starts somewhere. Remember if you see someone coming up fast  just pull to the side and let them overtake. Especially if you see a car going for that hot lap (going for timing). Let them pass early since you’re a slower car. Don’t go and block people. All enjoy and be safe!@SkyAudiA4,btohqsg
Ooo thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
So isit if I were to try and overtake  people will give way?,btohqsg
Be prepared to repair your own damages. Insurance doesn’t cover track drives. You get more respect from other drivers if you have etiquette.,btohqsg
If you’re clearly faster  usually yes. It’s not like in race  I block you block me one,btohqsg
First few times there focus on track interaction and getting used to the lines safely (and your car) before trying to push,btohqsg
I half wanted to but major deterrent is kena so many stone chips,btohqsg
Sly if u go track shud do coilovers,btohqsg
Also  pls prep your car a bit before even heading up. Basic routine ws checks,btohqsg
I hear some ppl got the drop n release bodykits,btohqsg
One for track one for normal use LOL,btohqsg
wa yes i saw one do all the fluid change,btohqsg
Likely get more stone chips driving too closely to people on nsh sir hahahaah,btohqsg
on NSHW either you're too slow to drive closely to someone or you're too fast everyone give way,btohqsg
You so lucky drive behind a truck they can also kick up stones,btohqsg
truck going 100-120 don't tell me cannot overtake bruh,btohqsg
Overtake of course lah but sometimes have to wait mah,btohqsg
worst is the lorries that try to overtake,btohqsg
Malaysians are actually very good drivers with etiquette on highway,btohqsg
They see you coming fast they will just give way without missing a heart beat,btohqsg
SG people always try try and block you LOL,btohqsg
the alphard/vellfire just highbeam from 50m away,btohqsg
Singapore hor…. They either don’t care coz they already at legal speed limit  or they give you fingers all  turn blue in face and extreme one go sgrv submit,btohqsg
Better that than 5cm behind flash you,btohqsg
i tried the right blinker to ask road hogger to move in sg before,btohqsg
I tell you sg drivers different,btohqsg
ya man they gave me the bombastic side eye question me like what i want,btohqsg
I think basic theory got teach: question - if you see car on lane 1 approaching from behind  do you1. Brake check2. Give way3. Signal back right and wave4. Slow down,btohqsg
BOMBASTIC SIDE EYE!  Wkwkwkwk I just learnt that the other day only,btohqsg
Sg got good drivers too lah but just saying there seem to be more ego trips and SDE from drivers here,btohqsg
HUH YOU THINK YOU DRIVE CONTI CAR VERY BIG?? YOU THINK YOU OVERTOOK ME WITH YOUR FASTER  LOUDER BMW YOU VERY GOOD? MY CAR ALSO CAN ONE. I TUNE TUNE ALL. NB I COME TAILGATE YOU ONE TIME,btohqsg
You should see the PHV group where they just pwn each other never ending one,btohqsg
Own people trying to cannibalise each other,btohqsg
EVEN THE MALAYSIAN PHV DRIVERS HELP EACH OTHER,btohqsg
COE creates a toxic driving community  prove me wrong,btohqsg
you ever wonder why some Malaysian Alphards carrying Singaporeans to go JB can cross faster than us?,btohqsg
I PAY MORE TAXES SO I AM BETTER THAN YOU,btohqsg
MY DEPRE IS HIGHER THAN YOURS,btohqsg
Their group chat help spot police in front. No police  lane clear. Use bus lane kekekeke. Then in front they give way and let their buddies come in,btohqsg
