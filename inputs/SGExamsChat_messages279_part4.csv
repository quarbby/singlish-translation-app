Pictures of plasmolyzed cells make my face feel weird ew,btohqsg
It's like those pics of tiny holes in skin or wtv,btohqsg
I'm fine with the holes but they just make my face have goosebumps lol,btohqsg
Can someone help me solve this?Consider a producer who faces a linear demand curve P= 24-Q  where P is the price in dollar ($) and Q is the quantity demanded. The producer produces this good at a constant average and marginal cost of $6. Determine the price and quantity if the producer wishes to maximize profit. Suppose the government imposes a tax if$Tper unit on the producer. How much will the consumer bear the tax burden? Explain,btohqsg
revenue function=Q(24-Q)= 24Q-Q^2 so this means ur marginal revenue=24-2Q,btohqsg
since profit maximisation means MC=MR  24-2Q=6 then solve for Q and sub it into demand curve to find P,btohqsg
after govt impose tax  just minus TQ from the profit function,btohqsg
Hmm okay. Let me try that,btohqsg
Sorry can I ask  what is revenue function used for?,btohqsg
I understand everything else below that. Just don't get revenue function. Why use revenue function? Under what circumstances?,btohqsg
to help you find the marginal revenue function,btohqsg
similarly  you can also find profit function and differentiate wrt to Q and equate to 0 for profit maximising,btohqsg
profit function would be 18Q-Q^2 so taking the partial derivative would just give 18-2Q=0 which gives u Q=9,btohqsg
"So Q = 9P= 15The tax will be shared equally (50:50) between the consumer and producer as their price elasticity of demand is the same.The distance from ""24 to 15"" and ""6 to 15"" is the same.",btohqsg
@adminsis there a rule that says ppl cant just randomly dm other ppl,btohqsg
not rlly but theres rule number 3,btohqsg
if u feel uncomfy or harassed u shld let the admins know bahh,btohqsg
