Is there a Hougang Feb 2024 group,btohqsg
Can kick and block those non related BTO contents user? ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
Hi everyone - just want to check if anyone tried to change the applicant(s) and occupier(s) after getting a unit (after 1st appointment)? Perhaps anything similar ?,btohqsg
My sis bookd her flat and incl my mum afterwards pre-lease signing (2nd appt). They're on the HLE scheme  where grants are evaluated post-booking. Unsure about appealing with the HFE scheme due to its upfront review of grants  loans  and income ceiling  excl those on deferment schemes.,btohqsg
Hi would like to seek advice that if we apply for feb2024 bto and would like to cancel the application  where and how to cancel?,btohqsg
You may submit online. Cancelling application may affect yr eligibility or priority for future application.https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BE15AWMyRequest/BE15PMain,btohqsg
HiAnyone know if there is any group for resales of HDB group?,btohqsg
I heard hdb wont reassesed ur income when key collection. They will finalise in regards to ur hdb loan  during the signing of lease agreement,btohqsg
Its the same thing. Now they call it hfe. Before it was called hle.,btohqsg
Hi all  my application does not have loan for the feb 2024 bto. Can I add in the loan later?,btohqsg
I beg to differ... I just experienced reassessment of income before first down payment from HDB,btohqsg
"Took about 5 months back and forth for them to ""reassess"" your income zzz",btohqsg
So really depends on your luck I supposed,btohqsg
hfe (hdb say) will not reassess  hle will reassessyours is under hle?,btohqsg
Hle and Hfe may look similar but diff.  Hfe considers income among other factors to give a more holistic view.  Applicant are required to cxl Hfe if wanted higher loan thus may affect yr qualification for purchasing certain HDB flats along with the related benefits and subsidies.,btohqsg
Yes. Hfe is abit different compare to hle. Hle is the old version. Hfe is the new one. Hdb just change its name from hle to hfe. Its the same thing in term of analysing ur financial capabilities  grant and etc,btohqsg
Yes can differ. No problem. Open to discussion anyway..i think what u mean is before the key collection stage,btohqsg
Recent Feb 24 webinar by Cpf and Hdb.https://youtu.be/gkEixjxvn3I?si=1nUgHmzj6eAW2SiIlisten to 40:00 onwards for those on HFE,btohqsg
During our booking appt on 1st Mar it was clarified by the HDB OIC: HDB financing eligibility (HFE) terms are fixed to ensure prudence. For higher loan amounts  applicants can consider bank loans.,btohqsg
I see. U applied for the dec 2023 launch?,btohqsg
Wah quite long ah the waiting time for booking of flat. I thought 1 month after result release,btohqsg
So u mean whatver hdb had stated in the hfe letter thats all we get? Cannot appeal or request for reassed again?,btohqsg
Hv to cxl current HFE if want reassessment,btohqsg
Since ours was within supply we recd q result in Dec and appt date was only given 2wks prior booking.,btohqsg
At the 45 min mark  The HDB officer mentioned that they will review the income but it is to ensure that thebuyers have the financial means to finance the flat purchase and it is NOT for the purpose of giving a higher housing loan.,btohqsg
eligible for those on deferment scheme,btohqsg
I see. So no point going for appeal to get higher loan. Because they are all fixed during the initial stage,btohqsg
May need to seek bank loan as alternative if want to get higher amount,btohqsg
Like u point out just now,btohqsg
Hi guys  how can I cancel my bto applications ? I have two - one I have queue number for but not yet selected flat (December 2023) and one from February 2024 (awaiting queue number). ðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
Donâ€™t need cancel. Once you select  remaining ones will be forfeited,btohqsg
Iâ€™m cancelling both as im breaking up with my bf.,btohqsg
yes  just a little bit  definitely not to cover the whole floor again,btohqsg
You can always purchase tiles direct from the supplier   get the contact from bsc.,btohqsg
New tiles might have alight difference in terms of color tones so go for it if you don't mind,btohqsg
Hi guys let say that if I would to change company of employment do I nÃ©ed to inform hdb?,btohqsg
u need to inform HDB shld there be any changes in ur income,btohqsg
i think increase also need lei  cuz will affect ur loan + grants,btohqsg
Now grant and loan all upfront and wonâ€™t change liao cause of HFE,btohqsg
i think my case just suay  got increment  then just nice my HFE expire  apply new one got new loan + grant decreased,btohqsg
Hmm depends on the person. But from my understanding if you have a valid HFE with a ballot  you cannot amend the income already. If wanna amend HDB will ask you to withdraw and re-apply which will auto ban your first timer status for 1 year,btohqsg
I think the hfe is good. Its helps people who lost job or income before the flat is completed. For eg. 1 year before flat completion lost job. So its good they finalise the hfe and income early,btohqsg
Some people also want to take career break while waiting for bto. So its good for them as well..i heard one couple went to live in bali while waiting for their bto,btohqsg
How long on average does it for BTO ballot results to be released?,btohqsg
feb one will announce on apr,btohqsg
Hi is there a chat for Macpherson Weave?,btohqsg
Is there a chat for rail green?,btohqsg
Is there any updates on rail green? I have my queue number but havenâ€™t yet received any news to book a flat,btohqsg
