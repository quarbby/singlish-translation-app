Wait. I check TnC and come back to u. U ok with cash rebates?,btohqsg
yup both miles or rebates are good,btohqsg
Once you get Instalment from bank  the mcc is no longer 5944 n likely not qualify for any miles.If you plan to buy watch or Jewelry  try charge to UOB KF in full n payonline.if you can meet SQ related $800 spend  get 3mpd else 1.2mpd.Other general card 1.2-1.4mpd should be ok for non-instalment.,btohqsg
nothing to do with mcc  instalment is excluded explicitly,btohqsg
is uob krisflyer debit card like the best to earn miles as for debit card,btohqsg
There should be something like this in your statement. This example for Citibank cc.,btohqsg
How abt posb passion debit card+yuu? assuming you can meet the minimum spend,btohqsg

https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/bnpl-nxt-card.pageIf your (big) purchase amount for installments falls into the qualifying spend  can consider use this card and earn up to 1% cash rebates if your big purchase is >$6000,btohqsg

Hello guys  im looking to seperate my Credit Card payment for monthly spendings and payment for monthly insurance. Is this a good idea? Is there a credit card under uob that i can use to pay off these bills?,btohqsg
why uob? these bills as in insurance bills? aim is to get miles/rebate or bonus interest?,btohqsg
Hi  is there a way to use my DBS credit card to pay for my Mari Credit Card bill. Any info you can share would be greatly appreciated!,btohqsg
Aim is just to have a dedicated card for my insurance premium spendings.,btohqsg
So if the bill is 500  then annual fee waiver let say 200So u need to pay 500 first ? Or only pay for 300?,btohqsg
Ya I try by selecting phone option then cannotThen I don’t know how to become talk to customer serviceThen help me waived already,btohqsg
Then now my current statement vs bill statement got differences already,btohqsg
In this case  you pay $700 first.I’m assuming $500 is your statement bill and $200 is your annual fee.They will waive it in the next statement billing period  it will reflect on the Citibank app and in your latest transaction history,btohqsg
Pay according to your current statement balance  they will offset your 196.20 next statement,btohqsg
Unfortunately no… you need to get confirmation from your bank which can take days to months. Also for DBS the confirmation must come before your statement is issued (unlike other banks).,btohqsg

No. You just tell the cashier you wish to clock link points and let them scan the app. Then pay by card or cash. You can't use the app to pay these link merchants anyway,btohqsg
Yes but not too far away. I have seen ppl claimed to get approved at 100k annual income. Oh they also have existing relationship with UOB.,btohqsg
I see... I always use other UOB cards  not sure if got a chance to have this one. 😅 lol just try luck,btohqsg
