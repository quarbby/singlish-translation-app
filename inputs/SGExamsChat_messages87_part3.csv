Python almost everything u use is an object of certain class.Java u have to declare what is it that ure defining,btohqsg
Good one  i think no of terms = 431-1 right,btohqsg
Yea arh but the main diff is still static vs dynamic,btohqsg
so would yall recommend me taking cs2030 and 2040 if i get like a B+ in cs1010e?,btohqsg
And of course java have stuff like abstract class and interface,btohqsg
honestly thats what im expecting most likely,btohqsg
what grade are u aiming for,btohqsg
yeah so oop is a lot more common in java?,btohqsg
Hahaha but its useful. A lot of things can be solved using unconventional methods in CS courses. Its only if its allowed or not,btohqsg
tbh i didnt aim for anything during this sem,btohqsg
but recently my friend is talking me into taking cs minnor,btohqsg
U and ur bs methods hahahahaa,btohqsg
My methods dont overheat processors until can cook eggs on it like ur profs,btohqsg
but my friend really complains to me about cs2030 everyday lol,btohqsg
i have to admit im kinda scared,btohqsg
I havent started teaching h2 maths la,btohqsg
If u dw heavy workload dont do it,btohqsg
Try viewing some 2030 notes online,btohqsg
The formula isnâ€™t really apparent if you arenâ€™t good friends with sigma notation,btohqsg
ok i think i still have a lot of time to decide on my paths,btohqsg
I will standby answer key too just in case i do careless calculation somewhere,btohqsg
In that case I can tutor any subject,btohqsg
i tutored an o level kid a math as well and i was basically playing phone while doing her papers,btohqsg
If I do a maths question 2 times and my answer disagrees with answer key both times  probably answer key is wrong,btohqsg
Not necessarily  we may have blind spot. Usually when it happens  seek a third party opinion,btohqsg
Y u trying to keep me jobless only got a few bio tutors only,btohqsg
Not really. I cant spk for other maths tutors but for me i focus on method n steps.,btohqsg
How long have u been tutoring,btohqsg
If have to check to the finest accuracy of calculation  is a bit micromanaging,btohqsg
usually i will just check with initial conditions if possible,btohqsg
Student understanding the concept is key,btohqsg
if the initial conditions fit then ur ans is probably correct regardless,btohqsg
As long as my hair ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
How long ma  i did address the length no??? Lol,btohqsg
Thats why must play by certain rules,btohqsg
U can tutor h2 computing instead,btohqsg
But if have to  do it to 6 significant figures,btohqsg
Ur prof will go crwzy with an influx of efficient answers and methods,btohqsg
Wait till final answer then round off,btohqsg
I wonder if it is allowed in a level,btohqsg
I dont know. Alevel computing is a scam from what i see,btohqsg
Their questions a bit scammy also,btohqsg
Dun even dare to show ur real name n face,btohqsg
U got see papers before arh,btohqsg
I got h2 computing freinds hahaha,btohqsg
Who taking ur course this yr,btohqsg
Useless. Mostly on physical aspect of computing and understanding random concepts. Rather can coding,btohqsg
Imagine if that staircase qn i sent you,btohqsg
Is in a h2 computing paper,btohqsg
Not much python from what i see,btohqsg
