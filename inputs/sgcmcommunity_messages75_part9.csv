what feature do you have in mind sir? - J,btohqsg
would be nice to be able to subscribe to be notified when a car of a certain condition gets listed for sale,btohqsg
instead of having to check daily 😂,btohqsg
but just thought it'll be easier to be notified maybe via email when there's a car that matches your requirements,btohqsg
could you elaborate on this? what are the parameters of your 'certain condition'. Because we don't handle used car listings. But  I'm super steady  if it's a function we don't have  I'll feedback for you,btohqsg
