My understanding on HSBC ega.Just put in fresh fund. Earn 4.3% PA for 3-4mth.First mth get extra 1% for everyday+ if u perform 5 fast transaction.,btohqsg
If second mth put >2000. This 2k will earn 4.3+1%. The existing 4.3%,btohqsg
MaybeMay 100k +5 transaction (5.3)Jun +2k +5 Tran (100k 4.3. 2k 5.3)Jul +2k +5 TranAug +2k +5 Tran.Then Oct collect all yr interest,btohqsg
Or just hoot 100k +5 Tran for 5.3% one mth. The rest collect 4.3%.,btohqsg
Seems quite a lot of ppl prefer hsbc revo here  what's really good about it? hsbc advance also offer 2.5% cashback without the need to convert points to cashback  less hassle.,btohqsg
So ega every month need add 2k and spend,btohqsg
No need spent. Just transfer $10 to yr other bank acct for 5 time.,btohqsg
But need top up 2k monthy,btohqsg
you know the deposit 2k is withdrawable right üò¨,btohqsg
U need to spend 2k to get 2.5% that's the difference,btohqsg
but revo only gives 2.5% for online and contactless only  other than that is 1/10th of it too...,btohqsg
but.... where will u not use online/contactless üò≥The card swipe one abit nowhere to be seen le,btohqsg
I only Revo to do 5x tranx..get the extra 1% that's it.Don't see a point to spend so much,btohqsg
makes sense.. I was still thinking about the old limit for paywave where it does not allow payment above $100 and needs to put cards in,btohqsg
interesting point and valid  but i think this limit would have raised by now bah else go shop for groceries abit funny le,btohqsg
HSBC Revo to me is only to use when overflow on your usual cashback / miles cards.,btohqsg
what's your usual cashback cards then? usually other cards needs min spend,btohqsg
Hi all.Would like to check  which card is best to pay for road tax for max rewards/cashback?,btohqsg
NIL. Or you use CITI payall.. But got admin fee,btohqsg
Which miles cards are better than Revo other than UOB lady?,btohqsg
Hi all  wanted to check the HSBC revolution card  what‚Äôs the cash equivalent for reward points? e.g. 4000 points = S$10?,btohqsg
Nothing beats UOB lady‚Äôs 6mpd. Comparable to Revo and versatility is Amaze>CRMC. I understand OCBC Titanium/ DBS WWMC is for gd for online / shopping transactions for 4mpd.,btohqsg
If you do a quick search on YouTube review  it‚Äôs about 2.5% cashback (rebate off your next credit card bill),btohqsg
So the cashback isn‚Äôt necessarily a direct points to cash conversion  it rebates off the next bill,btohqsg
Wish I can use that but last I checked my D is still there üò¢,btohqsg
From what I understand is if I make an eligible spend of $10  I will receive 100 points due to the 10x points. So is the cashback in the form of 2.5% cash rebate or points redemption?,btohqsg
There is an option to choose either cashback rebate or keep points for transfer to airline carriers‚Äô miles program.,btohqsg
Only for ladies  to be bad for us üòÖ,btohqsg
Do simple search on YouTube  if I‚Äôm not wrong either Chris/ Demi Zhuang talks about this points conversation and calculation.,btohqsg
Road tax use paypal  add uob absolute to paypal,btohqsg
yeah usual cashback cards are the ones with min spend... hence once hit.. you go for the overflow cashs with no min spend since usually last minute cannot hit min spends .,btohqsg

Dun think is going to be instant withdrawal for moomoo.

It takes 3 days for the money to be reflected in my account.Hope that helps.Any one here has experience for sgd withdrawal from moomoo to bank account,btohqsg

Can I add on: over-leveraging. This the young millennials and zoomers are guilty of. They buy nice stuff like branded goods and go on fancy holidays all on credit or BNPL just because#yolo. Not having a debt is the fastest way to build net worth.#debtfree,btohqsg
