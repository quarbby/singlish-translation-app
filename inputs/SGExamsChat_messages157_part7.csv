Anyone has titration notes haha I memorise QA until forgot titration,btohqsg
just know how to record it in the table will do :),btohqsg
Just know that the acid goes into the conical flask at 25.0cm ^3 and the alkaline solution goes into the burette :),btohqsg
just follow the instructions given :),btohqsg
I just scared the solution is a mix of 2 compounds,btohqsg
my prelim is on mixture of two salts tho :/,btohqsg
My school paper prelim come out like inside sodium hydroxide solution there's 1g/dm3 of another compound dissolved then they titrate sodium hydroxide with that dissolved compound so it just messes up the eqn,btohqsg
And the physics prac SF everywhere this one I scared the numbers all weird but yolo I guess,btohqsg
just try yr best. good luck guys :),btohqsg
i wrote that hot air rises in the mantle to form convection currents lmao,btohqsg
materials in the mantle are heated up by the core causing them to expand   rise and spread out,btohqsg
I thought convectional current form due to difference in densities,btohqsg
Like hot air expand and rise,btohqsg
for ROR did yall draw line or curve,btohqsg
What is the other compound of R,btohqsg
or one of the spa carbobates,btohqsg
my classmates got different reading soz,btohqsg
They said displacement of water shldnt it be downward displacement,btohqsg
Then for the change in setup isit gas syringe,btohqsg
It’s your collection of gas method,btohqsg
U need use a glass jar to collect the gas,btohqsg
Btw what was your concentration of the acid ah,btohqsg
I go and use 1100 cm3,btohqsg
Erm I got something like that,btohqsg
But to calculate mr of sulfamine acid is take the vol of gas divided by 24dm3 then take mass of solid HA divide by no of mol right,btohqsg
But must do mole to mole ratio,btohqsg
But rmb to convert to dm3 first,btohqsg
Huh what thing need convert to dm3,btohqsg
but the rate of rxn avg for unit what yall write,btohqsg
theres no upward displacement of water,btohqsg
i put mg/min idt its correct,btohqsg
okay well all the best guys its over i guess left w bio now,btohqsg
Oh you took triple sci ah,btohqsg
I took double sci and double humans,btohqsg
bio cant predict whats coming out,btohqsg
Istg if you got pure lit or pure history,btohqsg
Which i will do it soon,btohqsg
Sg flag is not the only thing that is hanging outside,btohqsg
U can narrow down based on the past 2 yr olevels prac,btohqsg
gg liao my chem is shit smh,btohqsg
Yea lol I changed to g/sec,btohqsg
And I thought it’s too simple if u use mg/min,btohqsg
But it should be correct too,btohqsg
Bruh I put soluble salt as copper(ii) carbonate,btohqsg
oh i found the data abt bordeaux and burgundy,btohqsg
mine is way far off this,btohqsg
