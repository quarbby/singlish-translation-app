I think ppl see us buy attrage at 100k they laughing at us alr,btohqsg
Those who diy ; do u coat 9H first then wax ?,btohqsg
Sgcarmart warranty only last 6 months after purchase?,btohqsg
If we look at it  honestly  none of us owns a carðŸ¤£everyone is just long term leasing,btohqsg
Yes Tks bought the polisher   9H   wax   claybar  iron remover try to diy,btohqsg
Take your time! Better to be slow and thorough than rush and botch it,btohqsg
Question: if you had the option to buy a COE thatâ€™s transferrable to ANY car and would have no expiration to it  but would cost you a kidney  liver  half a lung  and your partnerâ€™s half a pancreas  would you?,btohqsg
Normally after polish and wax ist let it cure for 24 hrs then Coat 9H ?,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve never cured between a wax and a coat  but I cure between coating  but not 24 hours,btohqsg
Coating just takes a long time generally. Then again  Iâ€™m OCD.,btohqsg
Oh pls do it slow. Coating cannot rush,btohqsg
Nope. Now the new cars be like :o,btohqsg
But then you only pay ARF and OMV etc.,btohqsg
Actually we are the only country with ARF and OMV no?,btohqsg
Our cars here are taxed like 3 4 times more,btohqsg
Eg gst applied aft arf and omv,btohqsg
Coe is a luxury tax on a majority non-luxury good. But in the flip side our income tax is low for a developed country  while our public services are among the best world wide,btohqsg
Yes direct taxes we are considered very very low. Pls consider indirect taxes too,btohqsg
Yeah that's fair. Like our cpf,btohqsg
So if CPF Gets deducted  but we are still taxed on our gross not nett income. Essentially  lesser amount of cash ON Hand,btohqsg
Indo has 200-400% on luxury cars,btohqsg
Bro u alr said luxury cars,btohqsg
Isn't cpf tax deductible? At least that's what I see in my iras statement. I think not full relief though,btohqsg
Yes tax deductible for Compulsory contributions,btohqsg
Ours no matter what still whack. Altho our ARF is staggered so luxury cars get taxed more. Similar to indonesia ah based on what u say,btohqsg
I mean Indo tax still cheap,btohqsg
There's an 80k relief cap on personal income. So no more than 80k cpf eligible for relief which I think 99% should qualify for!,btohqsg
Itâ€™s relief on contribution right? So income tax only on your take home,btohqsg
Yes my bad. I forgot abt that relief,btohqsg
So compulsory contributions are not taxable,btohqsg
But we pay tax everyday   where got low ?,btohqsg
The accumulation of tax you pay all add up is consider massive amount,btohqsg
Add up is what u said,btohqsg
5 room resales HDB want to sell 1.5m   omg,btohqsg
Every thing in sg all expensive,btohqsg
When grants increment went the opposite way of what you intended,btohqsg
I tot xin is a female,btohqsg
Our hDB is similar to car,btohqsg
Public buses and Taxis also pay PQP?,btohqsg
or xin is just pete trying to parody xun,btohqsg
No because they actually make sense,btohqsg
That's why I go with they,btohqsg
They're not luxury goods  the government doesn't classify vehicles as luxury. It's more of a non necessity I suppose,btohqsg
Also if taxis and buses didn't pay pqp,btohqsg
Wah your gahmen supported company no need pay tax one,btohqsg
Like everyone yell about COE right now,btohqsg
who knows he learnt after getting banned 4 times,btohqsg
And yell about people being able to buy multiple cars,btohqsg
He came back as S and didn't,btohqsg
S got banned already ah ahahaha,btohqsg
