honestly electric cars shouldn’t have the m badge. bmw should make another performance brand for their EVs,btohqsg
A bit too early. Until motorsporta embraces EV in the future  making an electric M car feels like a cash grab,btohqsg
I think that Thier dilemma also but your point is very true haha what is ev to do with m,btohqsg
But the m badge also too misuse liao,btohqsg
Now even i140 can have a m badge,btohqsg
It still isn't a full M car,btohqsg
It is along the lines of an m340i  X3 m40i  X6 m50d  etc.,btohqsg
It is a m sport model not a purebred M model,btohqsg
Like the m240i and m2 are different,btohqsg
The difference is well defined by bmw themselves too,btohqsg
M bage is like AMG badge216GT M series comes with h the M series steering wheel  bodykit.Just likeHonda RSHonda Mugen 😂👍,btohqsg
So rather than a M X5  yea screw it just buy a mx-5,btohqsg
comfortable convertible life > huge road presence and daily errands,btohqsg

Must as well say go kart also in motor sports  all cars should be go karts,btohqsg
Exactly. Electrification is also starting alr via hybrid engines.,btohqsg

Although not the most functionality  many of my friends use AirTags or tiles,btohqsg
Airtags can detect without network for how far,btohqsg
As long as there's an iphone nearby,btohqsg
But 30 feet max from a phone,btohqsg
Just that it allows for more devices to be pinged as it is not apple only,btohqsg
Detect current location but not track history right ?,btohqsg
Airtags taking into consideration most ppl use apple and it can help to pinpoint location as long as other apple devices nearby can ping it,btohqsg
