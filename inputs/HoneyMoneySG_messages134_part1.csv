My statement doesnt have giro stated so will need to pay manually. I thought 10 days will be enough for dbs to register but apparently its not.,btohqsg
I think its a dbs thingie.. other banks or instituition is quite fast,btohqsg
Ya i submit form end of aug and got sms confirmation from HSBC on 20 sec.,btohqsg
Maybe can appeal to dbs and see if you can have a new dp for us,btohqsg
Anyone receive this vouchers from hsbc? I’m not sure how it works,btohqsg
Hahahaha welcome to team failed to register GIRO with DBS because their system is trash.Just check your postal box daily  and pray you receive a letter that tells you that it passed. Or drop HSBC a live chat asking for all the GIRO arrangements you have for your HSBC EGA account.,btohqsg
Not safe. The only safe is if your card statement has the word giro,btohqsg
Can always use that as preemptive check. Every time they will tell me no such GIRO arrangement.,btohqsg
Hi All  for UOB SAVE UP CASH promo 1. can i deposit the funds in batches?2. Then submit the form after i hit MAB $150k?Cos i will only have 150k MAB in the second half of the month,btohqsg
Doesn't matter. Can always register first and wait until have 150k then deposit in.Not sure what you mean by hit MAB $150k in second half of the month lol.,btohqsg
Deposit funds in batches also can?,btohqsg
I mean i will have $150k MAB at the end of the month. Right now idh $150k,btohqsg
Hi  has anyone taken an interest free loan before ? Where is the best deal in SG ?,btohqsg
Tagging on: if participating deposit date is 1-31 Oct  do I need to have 150k in account for earmarking by 31 Oct or 29 Nov?,btohqsg
Yes. If you think that's more interest-efficient lol.,btohqsg
You need it by 31 Oct UNTILend of the specified earmark period.,btohqsg
Just don't be JIT warrior. 31 Oct is PH.,btohqsg

Thanks for that  ive set a reminder to do it in the morning of 30 Oct. Planning to do Ega>One>Ega. Feasible?,btohqsg
Weird that savings/current flagship accounts did not adjust their interest rate lower when fed lower by 0.5. Eg. Scb E saver remains at 3.35.,btohqsg
I’m dumb. I thought “since when Halloween holiday?” Then I realised 😂,btohqsg

Hi all  will like to check if anyone knownwhen using the HSBC EGA debit card to pay via AXS will earn the cashback?,btohqsg
I think it is mentioned in clause 5a in the HSBC everyday+ rewards TnC.,btohqsg
where is the best place to park some cash <50k. i don’t have 2 EGA accounts to switch around and promo rate ended in Sep,btohqsg
hello gurus  quick question — for HSBC EGA  if we GIRO our insurance premiums  are we eligible for the 1% cashback? i saw that using the Debit Card won't get you the 1%. am looking to sign up soon! though i dont have fresh funds of 50k lol. currently on ocbc 360 (salary + save) too (just adding some context). mainly gonna be using it for GIRO paymentsnot sure hows best to minmax things 😂,btohqsg
I was in similar shoes. My ega is only for giro. Don't need to think too much. Just open ega account then set up giro to pay ur insurance. Maybe add giro for income tax too. Then add giro for your credit card(s). 😁,btohqsg
does using card and paying it off straight helps improve credit score compared to just paynow? or doesn't make a big difference 😅,btohqsg
Pay bill right when statement is generated is enough. Your score will slowly go up.True story I have a friend paid his bill before statement is generated. Then last month he had a transaction posted early and wasnt part of the amount he paid. He ended up got a late fee and interest charges. 😅,btohqsg
holding the cash in mari for extra 0.70$ per day 😂,btohqsg
@antonio191203seems that you are the right person to reach out for egaThanks for the advice  i have set my ega for tax and will do for insurance,btohqsg
Hahha im just hsbc ega primary student. There are other experts here esp in getting high interests out of it,btohqsg
Hihi  which credit card to use for paying utilities ?,btohqsg
Good morning everyone! Anybody tried the DBS SAFRA credit card? Can pair with Instarem?,btohqsg
Technically kris+ is considered mobile wallet payment. So Revo doesn’t count am I right?,btohqsg
Only considered mobile wallet for Citi Rewards. Revo can be used on Kris+ and counted as online transaction (provided MCC is correct),btohqsg
Oh so mobile wallet is still considered “online” in a sense?I read the tnc and it says only online + certain contactless..,btohqsg
It is an online transaction for most cards  only Citibank treats it differently,btohqsg
Can I know what the next cashback card taking over Citi Bank reward? (No min spending)? Thank in advance 🙏,btohqsg
Anybody here know if the UOB one debit card $500/month spend is compulsory and what will happen if I don’t do so? I don’t need the extra interest 😅,btohqsg
You will just earn the base interest 0.05%. But do try to hit the $500 if you have substantial amount in the account. If the amount is small  you should consider the smaller digital banks for better interest.,btohqsg
