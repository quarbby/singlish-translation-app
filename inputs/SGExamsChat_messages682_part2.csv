He was asked some relatively tough questions by the students,btohqsg
a level cert empty  only got his name,btohqsg
did u even get a cert üíÄ,btohqsg
"wait how come got ""C"" behind the mathematics?",btohqsg
Maybe Jun wei might know what C stands for,btohqsg
last time is math c and further math iirc,btohqsg
so the c means ntg one lah,btohqsg
Yeah according to some website  but I can‚Äôt find out what C stands for,btohqsg
Like we know what the E and A stands for for o level math  surely the C stands for sth?,btohqsg
Was that back in your day or smth,btohqsg
That was before the switch to the H1/2/3 system,btohqsg
Wouldnt be surprised if it is Dr si yan,btohqsg
Also in the good old days before this Econs used to have mcq,btohqsg
Harlo polis this guy aboosing me,btohqsg
Siyan what is ur experiences with esther chin,btohqsg
thts y there is tatar sauce,btohqsg
i don't  i only buy mcflurry now,btohqsg
i used to hate the tartar sauce,btohqsg
big mac without beef patty  veggies  cheese and ketchup,btohqsg
that's just chicken rice ‰∏çË¶Å chicken,btohqsg
last time before the order booth became a thing  i used to get double cheeseburger and ''swap ketchup with big mac sauce'',btohqsg
ya so i no need pay extra for the extra big mac bun but i get the big mac sauce,btohqsg
only nice thing in macs is the original oreo mcflurry tbh,btohqsg
if only the curly fries were permanent,btohqsg
or just bring ur own oreo,btohqsg
when u order frm the machine js customize it,btohqsg
apparently before this there was this A level A-O thingy,btohqsg
wait i realised why there are only 3 subjects tho,btohqsg
this reminds me of my gp tutor openly telling the class he went to teaching out of no choice,btohqsg
maybe it was just called Math C 'cos it was the 3rd version.https://search.worldcat.org/title/gce-a-level-mathematics-syllabus-c/oclc/42212900,btohqsg
the question: (x-1)2 = [4‚àö(x-4)]2 (the 2 is square)the ans given by the website: Hence  x = 13 and x = 5.i gave 3 ai system a algebra qns these were their answersChat GPT: x=13 x=5Google bard: x=13 x=5Windows co pilot Therefore  the equation ((x-1)^2 = [4\sqrt{x-4}]^2) has no real solutions.,btohqsg
Before the H syllabus  A level students could read just 3 A level subjectsRP of that era was counted using 3 A level subjects (H2 equivalent) + MTL and GP which were at AO level (H1 equivalent)Maximum RP was 7620 + 20 + 20 + 8 + 8Students who read 4 A level subjects would just use their best 3 for computation of RP,btohqsg
rare instances whereby someone uses the word ''read'' in SG xD,btohqsg
last time? All along i thought it is just a westerner thing,btohqsg
Haha actually idk laJust my habit to use read. I cannot speak for others,btohqsg
My seniors did not have to do PW  so imagine for those who took just take 3 A level subjects and did not have to take MTL if they had done HMTL for O level and happy with their HMTL grade which is used for RP computation ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes you can see that guy‚Äôs cert,btohqsg
OA subjects had the same grading system as O levels,btohqsg
Erm  I was the pioneer batch to have done PW ‚Ä¶ But coz I was in the trial batch  my PW did not count to RP hee hee,btohqsg
and i mentioned my pw tutor helped develop the syllabus,btohqsg
If seab decides to set their own local version they might remove it sadly,btohqsg
But we did SAT together with A level,btohqsg
It was a time where we could use SAT to supplement A level results,btohqsg
Being kiasu  we tried to ace both SAT and A level,btohqsg
You also took o level Econs?,btohqsg
about 2000 idr the exact date,btohqsg
im guessing those schs which oni have o level track,btohqsg
Presbyterian High  Westwood Secondary  Temasek Secondary and Tanjong Katong Girls‚Äô,btohqsg
Forgot so had to search online,btohqsg
apprently o's has alot of subjs not offered in neighbourhood schs,btohqsg
