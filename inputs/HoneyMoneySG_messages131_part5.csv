Death of Amaze + UOB forcing me to think out of the box la...,btohqsg
i currently use credit card to pay public transport  is there any benefit to adding the card to simplygo? other than transaction history,btohqsg
As a biggest use factor  UOB Evol can cover overseas purchases at Nuts  Confectionary Shops (MCC 5441) which are almost always NOT included in any White List of the cards I use. It is not dining!,btohqsg
add your card to Heymax... they are running Max Miles promo now.,btohqsg
it's a competitor article so i will not link.. go and google thisheymax miles transport,btohqsg
A bit late for 6mpd but can still use for their normal rate.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  I need some advice.I'm currently using the Citi Rewards card paired with Amaze for miles chasing  along with the UOB One Savings Account and UOB One Credit Card. My spending mostly consists of food and beverage (FnB) and shopping  amounting to about $700 total per month.Iâ€™ve noticed that the OCBC 360 Account offers a higher interest rate compared to the UOB One Savings Account and am considering making the switch. However  I understand that I would need to meet a $500 minimum spend requirement on the OCBC card.Could you advise on which OCBC Credit Card would be suitable for me  given my spending patterns and the need to hit that minimum spend? Or should I just stick with the UOB One Credit Card?,btohqsg
PSA: 2 weeks left to hit $12k minimum spend on Citi Prestige AND book your 2 free limos!! All must be POSTED before 30th September 2024!,btohqsg
Phoned them yesterday  they took 30 mins to book my 2 rides ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg

Hey guys  can shopee platform vouchers such as the $50 less for spending of $750 and more be stacked with vouchers bought fromHeymax.ai? I have read that only one platform voucher can be applied for a purchse,btohqsg
Not sure how they will deduct when my balance is $0,btohqsg
Hey guys  anyone of you here bought device / gadget insurance other than from telco such as M1 FoneCare+ or directly from phone manufacturers such as Samsung Care+ or Apple Care+? I am sourcing around and found only PhoneProtect360 from HL Assurance and My Gadget Insurance from AMEX. I'm looking for some reviews here. Are there any worthy to look at? :),btohqsg
i don't even know WHY they deducted me loh.. but 27 cents i just let it go loh..,btohqsg
I bought applecare+ before and had good experience with them. Personally i am careless with my devices so i treat it as stupid tax ðŸ˜…. Cant comment on 3rd party ones.,btohqsg
I use ocbc rewards for not f&b  grocery with Crmc  food & travel with uob LS,btohqsg
Did you receive sms? I did,btohqsg
Dear valued client  your e$aver bonus interest credited on 31 Aug was inaccurate. An adjustment will be made by 11 Sep. No further action is required from you. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.,btohqsg
Why scb can deducted money from customer without any explanation??,btohqsg
No. That's what I am asking,btohqsg
If scb deducted $1 from 5 mil customer  they are 5 mil richer,btohqsg
they told you adjustment is made due to inaccurate crediting already what,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t buy but somehow even with my screen protector  something must have targeted stress at the front camera/speaker area and cracked the screen below my screen protector. Tried going to outside shops but they said it was too deep they will have to replace screen and LED. So I went to Apple and they replaced my screen for me at a high cost. Lesson learnt. Buy Apple care ðŸ˜… the cost to replace screen was more than the Apple care,btohqsg
Sorry for the late query but why is uob kf gone please? Because it can't be paired with amaze or? Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
Can be paired  but you wont earn KF miles from 1st oct onwards,btohqsg
Oh I just got my kf card to get points for mytrip.combooking. Not sure how big tickets items would be affected. Didn't understand the exclusion very well yet.,btohqsg
hi guruss For HSBC Everyday Global Account.there are 2 interest rate type:Bonus Interest Rate : 3.25%Total interest Rate on Incremental ADB : 3.3%am i right to say  as long as i put money inside is a sure to get 3.25%? <---- not fresh fund.if i deposit 20k inside. i will get 3.3% for this 20k? <---- fresh fund.,btohqsg
You need to understand why the bank uses the term called reference month.,btohqsg
Mean the 10k wonâ€™t get anything?,btohqsg
Burning question.Why bank donâ€™t use $0 leh?Why must $10 000 ah?,btohqsg
Just an update  the CSO called me and couldnâ€™t provide me a valid reason why the bonus UNI$ was not credited also lol. But they will check my transaction and reward me accordingly.,btohqsg
So those with UOB bonus UNI$ not credited  do check your UNI$ statement!,btohqsg
Never explain why bank use $10 000 instead of $0 for less confusion.Weird right. So many people confused.,btohqsg
Read the description of the line items $190 000,btohqsg
only incremental monthly average balance wrt reference month gets the bonus 3.25%,btohqsg
So the 10k is 0.05% or 3.25% ah?,btohqsg
I know.Why donâ€™t use $10 or $100 leh?,btohqsg
depends what is the monthly average balance of the reference monthly10k is just an example in the screenshot,btohqsg
Ya you know what Iâ€™m asking.Why donâ€™t hsbc just use $0.Wonâ€™t that be clearer? ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Can i check now UOB one account nerfed  then what account you guys using?,btohqsg
what is the issue with putting 10k as example? it is to illustrate what is incremental balance,btohqsg
I feel $0 look better.So people wonâ€™t bring that $10 000 into asking what about the $10 000 leh  got interest? ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I guess if you have $0 inside you would likely have to pay the fall below fees,btohqsg
already clearly indicate 10k is balance of reference month mah,btohqsg
"Starting with $0 may confuse people.Becos an example using ""$0 to $100k""  will have1. Incremental = $100k2. Final balance = $100kThen when the bonus calculation use  ""$100k""  people might be unsure is it the incremental or the ADB being used",btohqsg
For my case  is a Samsung S24 Ultra. I can't get Samsung Care+ because I didn't buy from a telco or Samsung shop. So only way to insure myself against unfortunate events is to buy a gadget or device insurance ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Uob kftrip.comnot affected. Its affecting using uob kf for luxury purchases and foreign currency transactions.,btohqsg
Oh yes I mean I didn't look into it yet but I thought kf is good for big tickets items but not too sure about luxury products.,btohqsg
ppl are using amaze to convert offline shopping to be under the online shopping category. Will not be able to do so after Amaze is excluded.,btohqsg
Just sharing for my opinion - Actually to be honest   I've been using DBS Altitude for many years. I don't know if DBS awarded miles to me correctly or not. Eg welcome sign up or for daily use.  I am just not bothered to check statements.In addition  I am planning to sign up for UOB PRVI.  According to tips from members here. I need to purchase tickets from dedicated UOB websites from Agoda or Expedia to enjoy 6 milesThe problem is I cannot select seats using the UOB Expedia travel page. I did a test booking. From Singapore to Tokyo via a transfer at Bangkok with Thai Airways on Expedia UOB. I am not given the option of seats selection.I will just book direct from the Thai airways website. I can choose my seats. I'm not bothered about the 6 miles.,btohqsg
