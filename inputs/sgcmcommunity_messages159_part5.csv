I am using Bridgestone. That one also MIThai,btohqsg
Most importantly is the model of the tyre.Big brands have Eco Summer tire tooExampleBridgestone Ecopia 300Yokohama ES 32NANKANG has UHP tyres.GITI / GT Radial has UHP Tyres.Cannot buy into brand  it may disappoint you when it doesn't perform.,btohqsg
I am running on Bridgestone Ecopia 300 front 175/65/15. I like them. Low noise and brakes dont lock up when wet.,btohqsg
I also using Bridgestone potenza RE-71rs,btohqsg
Hello to car gurus with external tpms sensors  do u remove the sensors before washing cars/tyres? Worry that the pressure spray will damage it,btohqsg
Geez... Guess I'll have to remove the engine before I go do engine bay detailing,btohqsg
Obviously they're made to withstand pressure jets la,btohqsg
"Good for you👍I always avoid  🌧️""C"" tyre.Have wheelspin/skid when moving off at 🚦 and carpark before gantry barrier.My wife gonna scream when it skid/spin on wet road😅Currently using  🌧️""A""no spin",btohqsg
When I buy tyres usually I can see this sticker lei.Is there a website with a compilation of these fuel and wet ratings?,btohqsg
The last front tyre I used is Dunlop SP Sports J5,btohqsg
Google search lo.Or when changing tyre. Try to look for it,btohqsg
i always land in TyreReviews but the reviews are mostly user reviews. 😓,btohqsg
User reviews should be honest and genuine right?,btohqsg
But there is no common standards of testing.,btohqsg
And I wasn't sure if 175/65/15 would perform the same as say 195/60/15 for example.,btohqsg
the thinner the tyre  the lesser grip on the road. the wider the tyres  more grip on the road. but at the expense of fc,btohqsg
So you’re using one too? How do u find its accuracy?,btohqsg
More accurate than built in system that estimate pressure based on rotation speed,btohqsg
Cannot compare via size.Big size doesn't means more grip.For family/personalcar useTreadwear 300-400Traction ATemp A🌧️ A<72DBTaxis useTread wear >400 to 600,btohqsg
The ratings stamped the tyresTraction ATemp A🌧 AThis I feel not accurate sia lolTreadwear yes only to me,btohqsg
Yup. You are rightThink Better to buy tyres under category.Premium Summer tyresPrimacy 4/etc etc.Utral High Performance tyresMichelin ps4/ps4s/ps5Goodyear F1A5/A6At tyre review website.You can select premium Summer tyres.Those brand should be 👍https://www.tyrereviews.com/Tyre-Type/Passenger-Car-Summer-Premium-Touring-Tyres/,btohqsg
I use premium touring instead. 😅But yea  this stays true for me.,btohqsg
When I am going to change my rear tyres  I wish I can do some donut and burn some rubber before changing hahahha,btohqsg

Let me research. Thanks!!(Confession: I buy my tyres in JB...😂),btohqsg
If its cheaper its cheaper 🧐,btohqsg
205/60r15 difficult to find205/65r15 still possible,btohqsg
I would prefer 65. Gives my gear slightly taller ratio lol,btohqsg
JB Hawk has good price for XM2,btohqsg
How ? Rain everything ok ?,btohqsg
I think  considering they’re semi slicks they’re pretty impressive in the rain. Heavy downpour you might feel it slip a bit more  but if you have good control of your car and know how to get it back  it’s not bad.Light rain is fine.,btohqsg
I’m not one to hurl into a corner at 120 on public roads anyways 🤣,btohqsg
So if anyone reads this and is sideways going round a bend at 120 in the rain  that’s on you.,btohqsg
Also  it’s considerably noisier than the PS4S  but not that much more uncomfortable.,btohqsg
Honestly would keep these on if I didn’t have a fresh set of PS4S waiting,btohqsg
My car is rear weight biased.,btohqsg
Ah..Beetle engine is at the rear,btohqsg
modern ones all front engine le  make use of the MQB platform,btohqsg
