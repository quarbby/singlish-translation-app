i once mistook the branded audi car logo (FOUR-interlocking rings emblem) for the olympics logo (FIVE-interlocking rings logo)also the same thing with honda & hyundai.. non-card mistakes i have made would be nike & adidas ( like wtf is wrong with me.. ),btohqsg
i have mistaken all these car brand logos one for the other,btohqsg
like my brain processed but doesn't store that information into memory,btohqsg
Nvm. It’s a Volkswagen Golf I believe.,btohqsg
Found this on a run as well lol,btohqsg
"my father calls me dumb ( or some chinese dialect for idiot ) whenever i tag along while he's working his two deliveryman jobs and encounter some unique license plate number  heavy traffic  vehicle accident and yes  cars that i find unique or cool and ask which car logo does this belong to and he'll give me that look or facial expression on his face which i could define his thoughts as""does ur idiotic self really not know how does a mercedes or toyota look??  like you're sitting on a company toyota lorry""— my dad while he's driving and listening to me yap to myselfmeanwhile also me: i forgot what is this logo.. is this hyundai? hondai? honda?HE WAS SO DONE.",btohqsg
pri sch i was in last time has an olympic looking logo,btohqsg
PLEASE i thought it was just me thinking sg sch logos get so unfunnily laughable sometimes,btohqsg
when the old school emblems look COMPLETELY fine and better than the new ones,btohqsg
but ok.. i get that changes need to be made,btohqsg
Does anyone have the physics paper,btohqsg
Congratulations to everyone for surviving A Level !,btohqsg
some of them probs didn’t survive,btohqsg
I doing the paper slowly haha,btohqsg
i’m like only interested in questions that’s a bit more unique,btohqsg
Only this is a wee bit more unique  but something similar was in overseas paper,btohqsg
only did till Q15 at the moment. Slowly typing out my worked solutions for my students,btohqsg
it's like a series of 12 images on whatsapp. A bit lazy to send to telegram,btohqsg
the context is cool but concept still straightforward,btohqsg
Oh naww dun take to heart. He probably just thinks it’s unnecessary to know itBut if it’s ur interest then ye,btohqsg
Up to Q23  it was pretty standard,btohqsg
OMG I RMB SEEING THIS. But i feel like this is more for uni lmao,btohqsg
no  it's A lvl. I went through with my students earlier  though how many remembered I'm not sure also,btohqsg
Reminds me of quantum finals yesterday,btohqsg
Yea I know  as in the graph itself,btohqsg
Overall quite simple  but I get that quite a few students told me it's tough.I thought only Q23 is tougher,btohqsg
its q a standard a level qn,btohqsg
going to put quick answer here for fun  and letting it get buried in the messages later.ABCBDBCDAAAADCCCDDCBAACBDBADBD8As 7Bs 7Cs 8Ds ==> Quite even,btohqsg
get buried in the messages later?,btohqsg
ya type more stuff so that it goes up up up,btohqsg
So. I had my analytical mechanics final today :D,btohqsg
I swear the final was horrendous,btohqsg
i keep asking people send me but no one has done so,btohqsg
I have never not answered this much qns,btohqsg
did tim liew finally decide he’s done being nice,btohqsg
idk why the formatting in exams now require u to have good understanding or mastery with english,btohqsg
like sometimes the question is meant to be answered very literally but sometimes you gotta figure out what formula  steps to do after being given a bunch of so little info,btohqsg
i mean.. that works as well,btohqsg
i don't research or look into things that don't really concern me or aren't very much to my liking,btohqsg

Yo anyone takes NTU computer engineering?,btohqsg
What’s the curriculum like?I can’t find much info on YouTube :(,btohqsg
One reason why I prefer ce over DSAI or CS is cause I rlly dw touch stats anymore,btohqsg
4 questions and i did not get an answer for all 4,btohqsg
And left 30 marks thereabout blank because i dont even know what to copy in an OPEN BOOK EXAM,btohqsg
I got an answer for Q2 last part tho.,btohqsg
Man was abt to break into tears,btohqsg
It has made me confirm that Exam Hall B is a cursed place,btohqsg
Anal mech is actually so bad,btohqsg
I decided the rest of the day was mental health day,btohqsg
I cant study anymore after being analed in the butt like that,btohqsg
Physics made me realise i can never be a multibillionaire,btohqsg
Meanwhile the china guy beside me was like askinf qns,btohqsg
I was this close to yeeting the coke bottle,btohqsg
The guy beside me went to the toilet 3 times in 2 hours,btohqsg
Also edwin distracted me when the paper started,btohqsg
HOW MANY THINGS IS HE LOSING,btohqsg
We dont talk about him he's a lunatic,btohqsg
Bruh who is taking his stuff i swear,btohqsg
He is just an extremely careless person who doesnt have any regard for his items,btohqsg
I want will figure out where his cheat sheet is,btohqsg
I want to figure out the one day he actually does his own cheatsheet,btohqsg
3 years in and im willing to bet he hasnt done a single cheatsheet himselr,btohqsg
And also he has only submitted one lab report for 2198 currently.,btohqsg
As much as i wanna say there is someone else who is worser,btohqsg
This is not even meeting the basics,btohqsg
People already sent him their reports for him to basically copy already,btohqsg
He just needs to change the values,btohqsg
But apparently its still too hard,btohqsg
The worst I've seen was him asking me for my grp mate phone number for cc5,btohqsg
I think someone told me he confessed his love interest on someone in IG as well,btohqsg
i don’t but i know people who do,btohqsg
so i kinda have an idea,btohqsg
have you tried looking at the mods they take?,btohqsg
In terms of math  i feel:CE<CS<DSAI,btohqsg
Would be doing some modules shared with EEE,btohqsg
The man who is gonna take 6 years in physics at this point,btohqsg
I actually wonder why he wanted to take phy tho...,btohqsg
Meanwhile wyatt and i are one week away from finishing all our core mods phew,btohqsg
I think we lost our sanity at exam hall B,btohqsg
i mean yes but tbh stats is super unavoidable for anything computing related,btohqsg
Even ntu lost and found cannot find,btohqsg
tim liew was out for blood today,btohqsg
I actually was able to do 2 qns from his pyp,btohqsg
I finished the paper in 2 mins,btohqsg
But not for this yr paper lmao,btohqsg
Flip q1  cannot doFlip q2  cannot doFlip q3  oh looks like pyp  but still cannot doFlip q4  i cant even do the first part already and all the subsequent parts relies on part a,btohqsg
Q3 is trick qn cus no fixed pt,btohqsg
I learnt what gu mile told me,btohqsg
i swear all the weird ones come from jc,btohqsg
Because i decided to just copy the pyp wholesale,btohqsg
He told me he poly i swear,btohqsg
Well poly would be a good answer because,btohqsg
He took 3 years for A levels anyway,btohqsg
Might as well tell people poly,btohqsg
I mean i can comprehend from yi or mi,btohqsg
I legit nvr heard of a retainee from tmjc before,btohqsg
chat what’s the most fun h3,btohqsg
(But i nvr took h3 so i wont know),btohqsg
Is it weird that i somehow expected an a level nuclear phy qn lmao,btohqsg
Holy grail don’t have the notes man… tried searching for the codes,btohqsg
YAYY I rlly cannot mathI feel nauseous it’s so monotonous to me SORRY IF I OFFENDED ANYONE… I just can’t concentrate,btohqsg
Do yall have any CE notes I can see,btohqsg
But yea all have math uh,btohqsg
Yeah bad news because all kinds of engineering needs math,btohqsg
I think math is fineBut hardcore like dsai or cs I rlly cannot,btohqsg
Do yall have any lobang or insights?,btohqsg
idk what’s going on but fuck math,btohqsg
I js don’t see myself in it,btohqsg
But if it’s what I gotta do Idm lo,btohqsg
Apparently I see the syllabus it’s so diff from my poly friends,btohqsg
I rlly cannot find content notes to refer from sia :(,btohqsg
Ok but CS and CE ones are diff from DSAI,btohqsg
The cs and ce ones are their own one,btohqsg
Dsai stats is the same as math major stats,btohqsg
Based on the curriculum names I see,btohqsg
Have witnessed the dsai stats one before and...let me tell you the bell curve is .... shit.,btohqsg
But yea  ce deals with like electrical circuits,btohqsg
So i guess if you like hardware stuff  you can join ce,btohqsg
Hell no  that is why i do physics :D,btohqsg
Any websites for me to start learning python?,btohqsg
Well tbh i cant rlly recommend a coding website,btohqsg
But i highly recommend learning python and c++ or R,btohqsg
The problem is idk if ce does c++ or R,btohqsg
Tbh idk what prog languages they do,btohqsg
Youtube has like learning videos about all you need to know about python,btohqsg
i used this website to learn more about css / html but there's python beta offered on freecodecamp nowhttps://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/,btohqsg
it's a self-learning and certification will be issued once you've completed all interactive coding stages,btohqsg
dk if completing thlse free basic freecodecamp scientific commiting language course would consider an actual form of coding certification,btohqsg
just a fun thing to consider or try out,btohqsg
you def need to look into it more bc like,btohqsg
stats in uni are also diff from jc stats,btohqsg
damn a lfa..hope this one dont end up in norway like the white one,btohqsg
Hello! For this one  why don’t want to just say:print (“hello  ???”)print(name),btohqsg
For sep  is it only applicable for 2 variables? What if there are 3?,btohqsg
so if you have some variables - eg print(“x”  “y”  end “ “) then it seperates the variable by whatever is in the end “ “,btohqsg
or it’s a different type of end cause honestly idk 💀,btohqsg
the default ending for print is \n so the two print statements would be on different lines,btohqsg
you could just put it all into one print but it has uses when managing how we want the line to look,btohqsg
sep is really just what goes between the diff elements so it doesn’t matter how many you have,btohqsg
when it comes to python  most questions can be answered by googling the param/function and reading the doc a bit,btohqsg
end is like printing it all on one line right?,btohqsg
yea unless you specify end to be “\n” still,btohqsg
Hi everyone I’m curious to hear from anyone who has gone through the WPLN (Workplace Literacy and Numeracy) assessment. How was your experience? Did you manage to continue your studies after completing the assessment? Diploma? Nitec? What are the possible pathways?I'm wondering what the path forward looks like after taking the test  and whether it helped open up opportunities for further education or career development.PS: im actually a secondary school dropout in my late twenties with only a psle cert and i have been working ever since i dropped out  im now looking for more opportunities!Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!Thanks in advance,btohqsg
While I have the cert  I did not really use it to apply for anything. I am not sure if it does have any use in the workplace.,btohqsg
im thinking if i can use it to further my studies..,btohqsg
u can try and to ask higher educational institutions' customer service or just contact them by email / phone call  to ask about this kind of scenarios  despite being a secondary school dropout with only a psle certification to your name-- you can either let them know this is what you're personally experiencing OR indirectly ask about this hypothetical scenario  what should you do if you're still interested in further studies despite the limitations of how far you can take your studies further,btohqsg
i heard that from my mom who went to take the WPLN at least 2-3 times because she couldn't pass one of the exams  for those with that assessment certification-- you can NORMALLY only apply for short-term ite courses or those technical course  dunno if it's considered under nitec or technical diploma  short term courses offered under various programmes in vocational college (both ite and poly),btohqsg
not too sure on the specifics though,btohqsg
best of luck  and might want to start your journey to further studying sooner than later because usually vocational colleges of higher learning education paths will have a soft cap* for their student intakesoft cap* - refers to how usually they will try to accept those below a certain age but will try to proceed to make a decision after scaling through every profile that would end up being rejected if not appealed for a case-by-case reconsideration allowed those struggling yet really interested students who also happen to be older than the usual ages for poly / ite that aren't opting for nursing  to enrol with special situations or circumstances that they might consider giving you a chance for,btohqsg
I got this for wpln and i think i kinda flunked it  i forgot everyt abt maths lol,btohqsg
Singapore is going through its own version of Japan's Lost Decade. Discuss.,btohqsg
the only nursing course at ite which was at the college east side will definitely have unlimited acceptanceLOL,btohqsg
even though there may be a lot of nursing or healthcare industry related students studying such specialisations or courses  there's still a dire lack of manpower in healthcare because the number of student intake doesn't simply match anywhere close to the number of local healthcare workers..,btohqsg
even a lot of dcotors in polyclinic & hospitals are being recruited from overseas now,btohqsg
But the enrolled nurses basic salary cnt match my salary now.. im at a loss lol,btohqsg
maybe you can approach a HR on how you can workaround this?,btohqsg
just for reference  my dad has a psle cert from the 1970s  he's also a sec sch dropout and did a he works for a WPLN assessment (because he literally couldn't read a lot of those basic to intermediate english vocabulary words or understand grammar + punctuation rules / formatting )  thought he's worked at a logistics company his 2nd older brother introduced him to work together at the same companyit's been nearly 2 decades and only pretty recently (like maybe 2-3 years ago) did he get a position raise and extra salary increase because my second uncle ( dad's 二哥 ) is now considered the Director with no salary  he's just relying on his pension funds and savings 🤦🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
a decade where there is a believe that nothing particularly special happened during the decade so much to the point  it could be forgettable,btohqsg
what makes you say so  tho,btohqsg
The Lost Decade in Japanese history was a period starting in the 1990s and only ending arguably in the 2020s  marked by decline of both the Japanese economy and its standing on the world stage,btohqsg
Singapore standing on world stage is always low . to them  just a small island,btohqsg
Japan's Lost Decade was precipitated by the loss of its position a technological leader in an economy with few other star sectors (anime would only rise much later),btohqsg
i meant why do you reference Japan's Lost Decade to Singapore,btohqsg
Our economy and to a lesser degree what influence we have (we used to be regularly known as the country that punches above our weight) was built upon a world order that prized our ability to act as the ultimate neutral go-between between the East  especially China  and the West. That was our killer app  much like how Japanese technical advancement was theirs. The West has lost faith in that  seeing us as getting too close to China or even no different from China.,btohqsg
i mean to a certain extent.. yea,btohqsg
but definitelynot comparable  nowhere close at allwith other nations  city or countries in general that had decades of lost hisotry,btohqsg
Singapore is not the same ...,btohqsg
Even our politicians have become a bit 怂 in recent years  especially compared with China's more aggressive tone. This was a country that was for a long time famously assertive,btohqsg
don't get me wrong but the peak was during LKY had the reigns,btohqsg
tbf the west loosing faith in us looks like a rouse  considering they still choosing to dock their military ships in singapore ports. while partnering with china in technological fields..We are treading a thin line these last few years,btohqsg
it all fell apart when his kids in the family started having all the weird internal family conflicts,btohqsg
Locations of all the US naval fleet groups as of nov 25,btohqsg
"singapore was always having to thread on thin ice (be careful) with political ties and trying to maintain neutrality or it's ""wait-and-see"" stance before making decisions",btohqsg
no one can change my mind on that,btohqsg
if yall been on cruise ships  you will know this port,btohqsg
because many more countries stirs away from USA?,btohqsg
even MP Gan Siow Huang of PAP who was an ex-bridgadier general in the army  and current Minister of State for Manpower & Education   of Marymount Single-Member Constituency  confirmed this in a Q&A session of a Students Perspective  Dialogue Talk,btohqsg
they have one right in sg,btohqsg
only these few in the whole world?,btohqsg
no if you want the whole world..wait a moment,btohqsg
and want to see army too,btohqsg
"you can't judge political relations or how close political ties are with different nations based on a single idea that ""location of XX companies or army base"" somewhere",btohqsg
these are the only ones in asia,btohqsg
i mean if you are not friendly with a country  you wont plop a naval base there LOL,btohqsg
tbf alot of people think we dont have a US naval base here  alot of people just think they are visiting us,btohqsg
ok i mean to put it out there  this base we have in sg is not a naval base  its a logistic base for the US Navy,btohqsg
"bro  did you forget to consider stuff like land rights authority  the stability of THEIR currency vs OURS ( or basically a currency that can ""sometimes"" go on par almost comparably with those country currencies that have a very high market price )  NATURAL / LOCAL materials +  amenities + resources offered with ease?",btohqsg
a military base isn't some tourist spot for anyone to come and go,btohqsg
idk where you came to the conclusion i thought that,btohqsg
even those logistics services delivering service goods INTO the camps / base  CANNOT drive inside if they don't have a visit pass registered in the system,btohqsg
i mean when i meant visit  its like malaysia's case. where they dock at their commercial port..but there is no actual us navy installation therewhere sg case is significantly different,btohqsg
SG Exams Discord long discussions on wars,btohqsg
not a tom dick harry  just decide to walk into a port,btohqsg
refer to the message i reacted with a 🥴 emoji,btohqsg
broooo  you're using malaysia as a reference,btohqsg
yea because you were thinking i was talking about civillians,btohqsg
i was considering the wider picture  generally speaking,btohqsg
its the latest port they have visited,btohqsg
your point was how sg no longer has any US military bases here,btohqsg
idk what you mean by this but ok,btohqsg
no my point was how people no longer think or never knew sg had a literal US military establishment for the US Navy right here in sg.,btohqsg
"my cross-counter points were these messages1. singapore was always having to thread on thin ice (be careful) with political ties and trying to maintain neutrality or it's ""wait-and-see"" stance before making decisions1a) even MP Gan Siow Huang of PAP who was an ex-bridgadier general in the army  and current Minister of State for Manpower & Education   of Marymount Single-Member Constituency  confirmed this in a Q&A session of a Students Perspective  Dialogue Talk2) you can't judge political relations or how close political ties are with different nations based on a single idea that ""location of XX companies or army base"" somewhere (reply to your comment on how the States don't have any more naval bases or ships docked at SG ports)2a) ryan  this wasYOUR counter replywas from the following before and after messages in between my last few sent messages2b) this was my following responses to disagreeing with your opinionbro  did you forget to consider stuff like land rights authority  the stability of THEIR currency vs OURS ( or basically a currency that can ""sometimes"" go on par almost comparably with those country currencies that have a very high market price )  NATURAL / LOCAL materials +  amenities + resources offered with ease?are u insane ( replying toyour random analogy+further elaboration&random fact about a US ship visiting or docking at  Malaysia port..?3) my response to your random analogy  elaboration and fact check mentioned in point (2a) is that you're jumping way too fast without any further elaboration  clarification or tied to the previous points you've raised until confusion arises between both you and the other party (which is me  this time)i somewhat understand where you're trying to come from  and even say but you're nowhere near on the same page or being able to row in co-ordination and tacit understanding with me LOL",btohqsg
if they wanted to know  they'll (tourists  visitors or those enthusiants / hobbyist ) WILL find ways to outsource or get ahold of any clue to the sort of information / stuff they want to look up on,btohqsg
this applies to both searching on the internet AND personally going down to ask people for more info,btohqsg
don't mind that reply  the unedited message was a message full of typos and written grammatical errorsit was supposed to be something meaning like this:i was  geenrally trying to consider the bigger picture,btohqsg
if anyone's not comfy or this is too political for sgexams  let us know and we'll take it to dms,btohqsg
this is an ordinary debatable discussion ryan and myself hold every few weeks (usually once every month),btohqsg
in hindsight  any country's decision to place a military installation in said country must mean to a certain extent there is comforbility between both nations. (US)any country's decision to also work with and to place a industrial hub in said country must also mean to a certain extend there is comforbility between both countries as well (China)Hence the idea of the Singapore treading a fine line. Yea i know you said you can't judge political relations or ties in details but you dont need to go indepth into relations to realise that both have strong enough ties they are willing to even collaborate on something together is basically my point.If your country has to do business with country B whom has a military prescence from Country C but you and Country C are at odds with each other..its very tough to do business with country BSo even if you say you cant determine  it pretty much shows a certain threshold for the state of politics between both nations.Also Gan said that but SG was also quick to completely ban a indonesian navy ship from ever entering singapore or ever participating with the sg navy in any exercises water all because of the indonesian navy decision for the name of the ship. For reference  this incident would have been like japan not allowing a US ship called USS Hiroshima to enter or help japan.,btohqsg
but yea thats all i have for this discussion,btohqsg
yea they got alot of ships,btohqsg
16 aircraft carriers is crazy  85 submarines is mad,btohqsg
Added data point: Our neighbours are beginning to surpass us in terms of cultural exports,btohqsg
Thai BL dramas  Vietnamese and Filipino pop music  Vietnamese fashion  Indonesian and Filipino video games...,btohqsg
this website is madly inaccurate with counting the list of active equipment a single country has,btohqsg
i mean it shows ships that are not even made yet,btohqsg
USS Enterprise (CVN-80)USS Doris Miller (CVN-81)USS Maine (CVN-82)are scheduled aircraft carrier commissions waiting to get started with the project building OR those models are simply in-completed...so it'll be 10 + 2 = 12 active aircraft carriers,btohqsg
who the fuck needs to know about future stuff and worry about it,btohqsg
i lost my drafted message i wanted to reply to you earlier,btohqsg
And in terms of cuisine? Yeah  it's not even a competition. Our neighbours are lightyears ahead on this front. Even Malaysia is beginning to have some success on this front.Our only bright spots are watch microbrands and some small success in indie games.,btohqsg
we were never once a competition or good reference for such comparisons like; rich historical records  accessible cultural information ( more towards language dialects  customs etc )  navy / ground force / air force presence  imports + exports  cuisines  entertainment circle in terms of acting / music / film / movies / creative arts in general  psychology  socially impactful eventsand finally normalizing being taught from young or in school consistently stage-by-stage that everyone should learn more abouti. financial literacyii.emotional managementbrushing up on productivity (sic.) with better discipline in scheduling timingsiii. self-developmentiv. character growth with maturityv. healthy ways to deal with stress ( unhealthy vs healthy methods of coping mechanisms )vi. further mental health awareness ( in terms trying to reduce stigmatisation where derogatory discrimination and stereotypes happens every single time and in different types of environments )vii. MORAL BELIEFS or a CORE VISIONARY with VALUES to stick with instead of following the god damned majority opinion or going with the flow,btohqsg
Personally I would recommend people do C++ before transition to Python.Because Python would be much easier  after you realized you can include library packages.Then go start go look into Data Analytics.,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/@drlokeDr Loke from NTU  also have a good full recorded lectures on Data Structures and Logarithms,btohqsg
iirc python and computer language c++ seems pretty similar with overlapping functions just that the format is a bit different,btohqsg
data anal seems so oversaturated nowadays,btohqsg
but everywhere I look ppl are asking for data analysts,btohqsg
nothing wrong with C++  but I think C++ builds better fundamentals in programming compared to Python.,btohqsg
it's like how japanese have kanji and koreans have hanja have taken inspiration from chinese's mandarin characters but they are made into different variations,btohqsg
python is more for basic algorithm training or coding language mastery,btohqsg
it's kinda like the normalized trend of collective english version for coding languages ,btohqsg
as long it pays well. and job is easy. lol.,btohqsg
u apply also with data analytical background or qualifications  cannot even guarantee getting employment place,btohqsg
my friend consulted me his company have a test report plotter  dump out variables x  y  z into .csv files.They wanted outsource  the data plotting mechanism into an interactive plot for RM 3k. Just because their test engineers required to compile the results by Excel. But lazy enough to write few lines of code to plot it...💀,btohqsg
"For context:At our height  we produced 3 Mandopop A-listers with majority original discographies within the space of 5 years in an era where one in *20* years was considered goodThere's an old question on 知乎 (China's equivalent to Quora) from around 2012 or so that translates to ""Why are the Singaporeans so good at music?""MediaCorp also used to EXPORT DRAMAS TO CHINA. SUCCESSFULLY.",btohqsg
i told my friend  that plotter I coded before only takes less than 100 lines of code. I wrote it during my Graduate Trainee period over at Intel... within a week💀,btohqsg
does your friend not  complete his own module work / class assignments assignments,btohqsg
or understand what in the world he studies,btohqsg
I asked back him  his company so damn lazy  pretty sure this can be done in ChatGPT nowadays.,btohqsg
Programming/Engineering not his forte. He did Mechanical  I did Electrical & Electronics in the same uni. lol.,btohqsg
we went to the same Introduction to C++ together lol,btohqsg
you know why? it's because singapore is so small with how limited opportunities can get  you can probably only go through IMDA ( Info-comm Media Development Authority ) or MediaCorp channels to be locally famous,btohqsg
doesn't mechanical engineering courses learn a little bit about tech softwares / codes as well,btohqsg
Singapore has lost cause of Thai BL Dramas,btohqsg
idk if what i know of electrical & mechanical engi would be similar to what you study,btohqsg
yeahh  intro to programming is common nowadays.,btohqsg
eventually every uni students doing Engineering:--> C++ / Python  ---> Transition to MATLAB for modelling,btohqsg
plus  even local entertainment media outreach isn't as good as it is  as compared to a few years ago,btohqsg
if he's struggling even with some introductory CODING course module or classes  good job he's fucked,btohqsg
I'm confused as to why we think that SG now is undergoing the lost decade when we are still living in the same decadeYou can just say we lost our competitiveness doesn't mean we are in a lost decade tbf in fact that's like kinda not rly the same thing,btohqsg
welp. Mechanical Engineering kills more brain cells than Electrical/Electronics Engineering.,btohqsg
Knew him since Secondary school  used to be straight A students.Chosen Mech. Engineering wasn't the best choice for him I guess.Electrical/Electronics Engineering in Uni mostly just substitute numbers into equations or programming with logic.,btohqsg
so I believe this is the reason I faired well compared to him lol,btohqsg
also in my university  literally 90% of the EEE students from my batch a first class honours recipients. 😂,btohqsg
"the only Singapore entertainment  I believe last time I remember is some longwindy drama singing ""Wa Meng Ti"" something2.Otherwise is Jack Neo's films.",btohqsg
im also confused with that regards,btohqsg
Honestly  for a supposedly First World country  it really feels 不应该 to be outperformed on cultural exports by almost all of our supposedly poorer neighbours,btohqsg
We are still in the decade,btohqsg
but honestly the conversation these last two hours has been a little confusing because of how many mini subtopics are being dicussed,btohqsg
it's only a matter of perspective..,btohqsg
But not all first world countries are culturally rich as well?If first world countries are taken to be DEVELOPED countries (im guessing this is what u mean and anyways singapore isn't even considered a developed country nor really a first world country by some standards)Most third world countries have far more cultural vibrancy,btohqsg
^ refer back to this reply@gunslinger_nick,btohqsg
and also consider how much support sg citizens and even permanent residents in sg can also claim in subsidies from the gov if they meet the target criteria,btohqsg
I counted 40+ active submarines with live locations still available out of the 85 showed lol,btohqsg
weren't we on discussing on the number of active US aircraft carriers...?,btohqsg
since when are submarines considered aircraft carriers,btohqsg
Idk I just referenced it from the pic of all the shops you replied to  I mean aircraft carriers wise the Us still dominates like mad crazily. China is nowhere close,btohqsg
i never mentioned that the site you referred to for cross-checking isn't totally inaccurate  might have been a little incoherently on my ends as well but you need to double check where you're sourcing information from,btohqsg
But it's the fact less than 10-20 people worldwide know where the submarine attack fleets are at  at any one time if we talking about us naval supremacy,btohqsg
While all the aircraft carrier fleets are tracked  the submarines are not,btohqsg
while  yes i agree US aircraft carriers still dominate the global army ranking in terms of combatants capability but their main force is the destructive aspects...,btohqsg
why the hell do you keep repeating about submarines when it's about aircraft carriers,btohqsg
I mean you also have to see which aircraft carriers tho  not all 12 are good and in working order,btohqsg
that's why i mentioned the word ACTIVE,btohqsg
There are broken active aircraft carriers as well 😔,btohqsg
i never mentioned how capable or function-able it still is as of present day,btohqsg
i really want to ask you to politely kay-why-ass,btohqsg
We're also in an easy win region. We could have easily solidified the lead over our neighbours by doing what China's doing right now and just making MASSIVE investments in media that 讲好（新加坡）故事,btohqsg
A C T I V E  includes those aircraft carriers that have yet to be;i. scrappedii. out-of-service ??? decommissioningiii. yet to be completed or put to serviceiv. conceptual projects on tentative schedule,btohqsg
you're talking about a hypothetical scenario which you know will NEVER exist,btohqsg
because of how mother tongue has faded into almost an all-time low obscurity,btohqsg
likewise with collective language dialects these days,btohqsg
Actually what is the point you getting at ah  I Abit confuse lol,btohqsg
singapore dramas stop after the 1990s,btohqsg
refer to the pie chart graphs i showed you,btohqsg
I can see that but what you trying to tell me?,btohqsg
look at the percentage of destructive destroyers* that how the top 3 global-wide countries (are) known for their navy forces,btohqsg
im sleepy* but my jello is decaying in the air,btohqsg
Ye and what about the percentages?,btohqsg
ya kah? then besides Jack Neo's films I don't think Singapore has much cultural films.,btohqsg
and his films also low budget 😂,btohqsg
Wasn't there like 4 local films that won the acclaimed french Cannes festival,btohqsg
Considered good for SEA  but only because our neighbours are even WORSE at movies than us,btohqsg
compare the percentage of china & russia's destroyers ( china's percentage of destroyers 11.5% + an estimation of  russia's 15% percentage of destroyers  total sum is still a bit behind US' percentage of destroyers at a staggering high of motherfucking 28.8%  bro,btohqsg
Singapore broadcast korean  chinese  hong kong dramas on weekdays. taiwanese and thai dramas on weekends,btohqsg
why tf are you even comparing,btohqsg
do you not realize that our cultural roots and entertainment culture is not even BROAD or very big of a stage for those celebs?,btohqsg
Singapore writers wrote bad plots better to ask AI to write,btohqsg
4/5 local singers that made out of singapore also all going to be age 50 and above,btohqsg
there's like almost zero to none paparazzi's in Singapore as compared to larger countries with much BIGGER entertainment industry circles from music  art  filmography  cinematography  gaming  espots  acting  idols and the most of many more creative arts goes onin places like south korea and china  its a hellhole for these celebs,btohqsg
yeah but i hate that even abysmal hellhole,btohqsg
hollywold always felt so iffy fake to me,btohqsg
as an entertainment circle reference for US,btohqsg
I'm also confused as to why,btohqsg
Singapore lack cultural relevance IN THE PERFORMING ARTS = we are in the lost decade,btohqsg
Well no shit we were never culturally important in the first place lol,btohqsg
U can't be becoming significantly increasingly irrelevant if you were alr irrelevant in the first place,btohqsg
Does that matter tbh? I believe most first world Europe countries artists are the same.,btohqsg
"I'm just trying to understand the line of argument hereClaim: We are in lost decadeReason: Singapore is not culturally superior compared to our neighbour'sCounterreason: that was never singapores strength in the first place ie singapore's relevance never came from our performing arts it was more of just a ""it was there"" kinda thing so using that as a metric is kinda flawed",btohqsg
this term lose decade  as in Singapore is financially/economically stagnant?,btohqsg
"Like this whole discussion is basically just an overdramatic way of saying because singapore is not perfect anymore therefore we are in the stage of ""lost decade/we no longer have a place on earth""",btohqsg
sounds like a General Paper  open topic discussion kind of thing.,btohqsg
"TLDR:Late 90s - early 2000s1) Crimes and Pessimism for the future was rife2) Pockets of social decay started to become prevalent3) Tons of subcultures and trends created felt like it was a  coping mechanism to weather the problems of the decade4) Modern day's japan rates of suicides  extreme political views and trend of single adults are mostfly formed by the teenagers that lived through this ""lost decade""",btohqsg
1) the way people on r/Singapore talk these days...2) Not as pronounced yet3) Unsure about this yet.4) We've hit 2 of these 3. The only one we haven't is the suicide rate.,btohqsg
Our core strengths are also weakening  and with nothing in the pipeline to replace them. Even Japan had ACG to eventually become their new core strength.,btohqsg
except 4) is not referencing teenagers in this decade  but the decades from the 90s to 00s..so If i were to use that rhythm..i could say that our lost decade was also the 90s-00s,btohqsg
feels more like overseas artists come over to singapore to become a singapore citizens or PR (permanent resident)  only because of the strong currency and better international ties with most other nations like where they were born or originated from  as a comparisonthat  ORlocal artists head for overseas opportunities see (Source Link: Jasmine Sokko who was known to be one of the opening acts of Coldplay's 2024 SG Concert )  i got to know her through for her participation in one of a China Music Talent Reality Show called Rave Now ‹ 即刻电音 ›Which was also where famous music artist and record producerAlan Walker( first time seeing his face without a mask since he used to be pretty iconic for being part of the trendy masked artists kind ) where he starred as a guest mentor appearance for the same show and Jasmine Sokko who was the ONLY singaporean contestant who was placed in the FOURTH top ranking placement in this type of variety show competition,btohqsg
problem was Seng Yu Rui commenting about comparisons that Singapore was certainly never strong at,btohqsg
and looking at the multitude of factors  its very more likely we alr had the lost decade  that was the 90s-00s,btohqsg
"prob his ver of ""strong"" is different from us",btohqsg
iirc she hit a europe music tour but not for full blown concerts,btohqsg
I'm curious as to what the 2 if the 3 u are talking abt,btohqsg
And how it is smth that has been happening RECENTLY,btohqsg
the lost is 00s - 10s,btohqsg
but singlehood itself is not a singapore only phenomenon,btohqsg
extremism? our extremist here aint even adults  they are teenagers and if they are..they dont even come from sg,btohqsg
u cant say that singapore is going through a lost decade when ALMOST the ENTIRE WORLD is going through the same problem,btohqsg
middle child as in stuck between the transitional phases of different eras across the decades..millennial > gen z > gen alpha with the extreme of technological advancements,btohqsg
this isn't just a singapore trend,btohqsg
and doesn't add to a lost decade feature,btohqsg
like the credibility of the source a side which isnt reflective of the entire SG populace,btohqsg
classic   would have been better if it was r/SingaporeRaw,btohqsg
the world in general is becoming less or less pessimistic,btohqsg
"""The way people on r/Singapore talk these days""",btohqsg
The core reason Japan had their lost decade was the loss of their core strengths in tech. Our equivalent loss of our core strength is happening right now,btohqsg
how do you know that's from reddit,btohqsg
and what is our core strength,btohqsg
the ui/ux doesn't even look like light mode reddit,btohqsg
theres pessimisim rn based on what he sees on reddit,btohqsg
people forget the lives of others in the decade they never lived,btohqsg
then they make assumptions thinking they lived a better/worst life than the current,btohqsg
retroactively apply standards in different time periods,btohqsg
then say this and that is happening,btohqsg
LOOOL people who live in sg for years ( pr  sg citizens and long term repeat visitors ) don't even know what the components of the national flag representsthe red + white colours respectivelythe moon + 5 star values,btohqsg
middle child is always considered the left-out children,btohqsg
idk i feel like seng keeps throwing the,btohqsg
but he hasnt exactly said what it is yet,btohqsg
u can ask anyone they can tell u a different thing,btohqsg
i don't understand why you keep comparing stuff with japan,btohqsg
are you some loyal japan fan?,btohqsg
The fact that both the West and the East trust us. The West is slowly losing trust in us,btohqsg
i rmb having a convo a while back with someone about saying  the 70s in singapore was such a colorful and interesting decade..i want to experience how it was like living through the 70s.Then my friend gave me a reality check and said  the 1970s singapore was one of the most dangerous decades in sg. gangs and turfs were still being controlled  the authorities were still in its infancy trying to fix up the country..poverty and homelessness was still rife...etc,btohqsg
but this was also never a REAL strength in the first place,btohqsg
in reality this may be be controversial but millenials and gen alpha are useless,btohqsg
the problem is that i remembered he always used to bring up japan as his number 1 country to make comparisons or references...,btohqsg
"then he said   ""do you really want to return to the 1970s now""",btohqsg
why do u think the west is losing trust in singapore,btohqsg
just riding the wave of what has alr been built,btohqsg
it's like most born in the eras of millennials or gen alpha struggle more with the concept of  independence,btohqsg
lol maybe his understanding of the world is largely japan centric,btohqsg
how do you know they trust us in the beginning?,btohqsg
you know its like riding a sampan our forefather built for us  but not mantaining it enough..every decade  five new hole appears but we only get to fix 3 before the next decade comes around...then before you know it..our sampan sinks,btohqsg
ya thats the other confusing part,btohqsg
and if uw to say its a lost DECADE,btohqsg
Because they think we've become weak towards China as compared to the LKY days,btohqsg
trump kim summit was in 2018,btohqsg
he believes japan / eurrope ( because west is only the states apparently) media outlets instead of sourcing various media new reporting publishers LOL,btohqsg
didn't lky get a us bribe..but rejected it,btohqsg
But whats ur evidence that says DEFINITIVELY that the west,btohqsg
i dont think you gonna try to bribe a country's leader you trust,btohqsg
US media has always looked down on LKY despite admitting he's a great political world leader...,btohqsg
like ur ASSUMING that because we are WEAK towards china therefore the west has no trust in us,btohqsg
have you never watched or read his interviews,btohqsg
like has the west taken any action recently,btohqsg
where reporters & journalists interviewing LKY literally try to shut his words back down,btohqsg
now tony blair singing lky's high praises,btohqsg
to do anything that shows that,btohqsg
past 6 years alr got tks,btohqsg
how u gonna form a decade when u - 10 years u alr have a event that involved the WEST coming to Singapore,btohqsg
any idea what makes us weak towards china?,btohqsg
i got so sick of even LKY's family internal conflicts started between his two sons,btohqsg
im trying to just understand what hes even saying in the first place,btohqsg
cause it seems like their just randomly pulling things from different places to fit a narrative,btohqsg
actually what singapore does that makes it weak towards china?,btohqsg
prob its just how sg has better economical viability to other competitors,btohqsg
"this Seng Yu Rui fella is way worse than me trying to explain logic and explanation reasonably sounding to you and some other fellas I always end up getting stumped in trying to simplify stuff BASICALLY and ""SCIENTIFICALLY"" according to society's norms of common sense and literally zero to negative logic which requires people to use their brain cells  to think about the stuff and make links between theKEY POINTSmentioned CAUSE & EFFECTbehind the thought processing  train of thought (m. perspective on how's and why's) andCONCLUSIONbehind the things mentioned so far  sort fk a summary but not really a tldr",btohqsg
"Lianhe Zaobao gets regularly tagged as ""Pro-China"" rather than ""Singapore Government Mouthpiece"" in news discussion. Not without reason  I may add. Lianhe Zaobao literally pulled an article calling on SG to ""never yield to lobbying pressure and keep our conscience when reviewing vaccines"" when talking about Sinovac. Something that follows OUR government's line",btohqsg
This has spread OUTSIDE of Singapore.,btohqsg
also the millenials range is too large there should be something between them and gen z,btohqsg
you do realize those are stereotypes formedbothWITHIN* & OUTSIDE OF SG as well  right?,btohqsg
Not in this case. This particular thing STARTED here and spread overseas.,btohqsg
there are many more news outlet here like today  cna  straits times,btohqsg
ok  then my bad* for the errorSTEREOTYPES<FORMED> BOTHWITHINANDOUTSIDESG  no?,btohqsg
I'm confused abt the vaccine thing,btohqsg
🤔 don't you need something from the triggered from the inside  so that external observers would form stereotypes at the outside...?,btohqsg
Isnt that just saying we should assess everything fairly,btohqsg
this is like saying sg is pro china because of how commonly misunderstood that singapore is a chinese city,btohqsg
how is sg found in china..?,btohqsg
To be fair  Singapore politicians have gaffed by accidentally spreading pro-China narratives unintentionally,btohqsg
you already mentioned the word unintentionally,btohqsg
I think that would be an American thing. With the whole ByteDance/TikTok CEO things vs the White House. lol.,btohqsg
brother  every person has their own preferences and stance that they can take-- even for politicians,btohqsg
Ugh studying for finals is tiringgggg,btohqsg
How do you guys stay up awake while studying,btohqsg
cause with chinese newspaper propaganda manipulation means pro-china stance when it's not  lol,btohqsg
There's a special version FOR China,btohqsg
do you have sources in china?,btohqsg
the vpn is so whack over there,btohqsg
Like genuinely speaking HAHAHAHA cause first time I heard of this also,btohqsg
they say gen y faces theseWorld events: Gen Y has been impacted by world events like the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks  the Dot-com Boom  and the Great Recession of 2008,btohqsg
But true  maybe it's a bit early to call it a Lost Decade.,btohqsg
Give it until the end of this decade to decide  I guess.,btohqsg
maybe a few more decades down the road,btohqsg
"In part of controversial things that stood out in Western media - ""Caning of Michael Fay""?",btohqsg
but only those older ones face this those younger ones still a child,btohqsg
Maybe they just wanna see sg fall,btohqsg
"Singapore is a ""FINE"" city? lol",btohqsg
what the fuck does a tweet from a politician world leader prove,btohqsg
I actually don't even know what this even means,btohqsg
i swear to god  every few eras (about at least one to two decades every now and then) will have a lotta changes,btohqsg
Although on the other hand  we've been tagged as a currency manipulator by the US. That can't be good...,btohqsg
"https://mustsharenews.com/michael-fay-today/""Having gained experience in the F&B industry  Mr Fay was then appointed as the Beverage Supervisor at the JACK Cincinnati  a casino in Ohio.He quickly rose through the ranks and became a Slot Operations Manager. In this role  he oversees 2 000 machines on the casino floor  as well as over 70 employees. These comprise slot attendants  valets  supervisors and assistant managers.""",btohqsg
a production supply line that was confirmed to be a taiwanese company that was barred from allowing a singapore company ( commonly known as ST Engineering  short form STE for Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd ) brought into taiwan during COVID-19,btohqsg
sounds like a Security Operator at a Casino Floor lol,btohqsg
It's been okay so far  but only because even Trump isn't insane enough to go after us yet...,btohqsg
Yes manipulation of exchange rate is a thing,btohqsg
Or are u talking abt smth else,btohqsg
depends on what context?As long the whole Singapore Financial Institution doesn't collapse. It is a good thing for everyone?,btohqsg
"you don't want end up like Japanese ""Banana"" Money lol.",btohqsg
For context: Even China has been removed from the list at times. Singapore has practically never been removed.,btohqsg
which nation doesn't have a single motherfucking issue with how USA's odd love in manipulating global or local news affairs media propaganda and PR strategies of withholding truth  details and facts ( by both the Democrat & Republican parties ) even if it's a close force allying with the US or having some form  of close political ties,btohqsg
the reason why trump seems better is because Joe Biden is still Acting President of America  as he hasn't yet sworn in the White House for his second Presidential Term,btohqsg
He's had 4 years before to do it. He did nothing.,btohqsg
but honestly  it's gonna be interesting to see how Trump will handle most  if not all odds seemingly against him and doing shit however he likes ( when compared with his last Presidential term),btohqsg
^ see my aforementioned reply above,btohqsg
TBF I'm leaning towards Trump never actually going through with it because we might manipulate our currency  but because we don't have much domestic production  we WILL still always import more than we export,btohqsg
Not necessarily to and from the US  but in general.,btohqsg
he treats the president position with the same mindset as how he treats his entire list of business empires he had managed to build in his entrepreneurship days as a businessmna,btohqsg
So the US doesn't actually care about the currency manipulation for it to be a threat because of how little we export to the US.,btohqsg
as mentioned  trump was always known to have a strong tendency of making a lot of rebellious trial-and-error  impulsive  last minute decision-making..,btohqsg
Most of his issue with China is export dumping. Something we just can't do.,btohqsg
in comparison  joe biden seems more like a controlled puppet president,btohqsg
compared with past ex-presidents of america,btohqsg
In 2023  the US imported the following goods from Singapore:Electrical and electronic equipment: $3.24 billionMiscellaneous edible preparations: $3.05 billionMineral fuels  oils  and distillation products: $1.78 billionMiscellaneous chemical products: $668.78 millionLooked it up. Our top export category is only in the single digit billions.,btohqsg
Trump is a well-known Russian puppet.,btohqsg
so can I consider Joe Biden a Israel puppet with that same logic of your so-called XX politician is well-known to side with YY country,btohqsg
okay  im done for the time-being it's personal free time before i head to sleep 💤,btohqsg
can call him a useful idiot toohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot,btohqsg
"""the person thinks they are fighting for a cause without fully comprehending the consequences of their actions  and who does not realize they are being manipulated by the cause's leaders or by other political players.""",btohqsg
also is there a term for someone that has the brains but is not using it correctly?,btohqsg
biden might think he's doing what's best for the USA  even though bibi clearly disrespects himhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/stained-relations-israeli-pm-netanyahu-accused-taking-dirty-laundry-state-trips,btohqsg
i mean he spent his whole adulthood in politics,btohqsg
"he cant comprehend the changing of times and still believes the US is and still is the greatest nation on earth. if you had a hardlook at every major policy he passed or made under his administration..none of it was hard hitting  all of it was along the lines of ""do something to show people we are not doing nothing""",btohqsg
"i doubt anyone was ever familiar with the name ""Joe Biden"" before he sat for his elected term as one of the USA Presidents",btohqsg
biden is very well known in politics  he did alot as a politician..wherever he was posted to,btohqsg
some people are citing reasons for his old age & ailing health for the drastic negative change in the way he handled politics,btohqsg
thats why under obama  he was awarded the presidential medal of freedom,btohqsg
i mean if you consider him as an individual alone,btohqsg
like no one really knew who Biden was or what specifications was he heavily involved as a politician,btohqsg
in the US Sphere he is quite known  outside of the us. he is not until his obama tenure,btohqsg
"sort of ""you heard of something / someone  but it doesn't quite ring a bell yet and can't place a finger on where you heard that""(with whatever your memory stores)",btohqsg
biden was the youngest US senator ever appointed becoming one at 29,btohqsg
ill tell you who wont ring a bell  kofi annan,btohqsg
okay  but aside from all the weird world achievement records of being youngest + oldest  fucked-up / sane persona people in the places where heavyBUSINESS ENTREPRENEURSHIPorGLOBAL / NATIONAL POLITICALis involved,btohqsg
what else do you recall biden for,btohqsg
isn't he that newly elected PM in the UK or is it under the British government,btohqsg
nope former secretary general of the united nations,btohqsg
isn't he already 6 feet under,btohqsg
if you want to use deceased politicians for comparison references  there's a lot more...,btohqsg
i mean this guy whole life was political..theres nothing else that people could have known more about him which was not political,btohqsg
iirc biden was never credited solely for the work he did,btohqsg
he was at most just praised for how well he handles things in the political world,btohqsg
before he was president and the recent election,btohqsg
i mean his achievements changed america quite frankly,btohqsg
i meant  is biden the main creditor for any major or notable political work he did?,btohqsg
that many people would probably know of?,btohqsg
the first amendment?? is fucking useless by the way,btohqsg
He was the person that started the conversation about violence on women and wanting to create a law that better protected women. This law would later be known as the widely acclaimed violence against women act that was passed into law in 1994.Notably  it changed the complexion  understanding and outlook of laws which surronded the safety of women throughout america,btohqsg
Then another notable law which was passed because he started a conversation on it was the federal assault weapons ban. it was removed  but he has always advocated for it to reinstated. the act basically banned multiple variants of assault weapons from being in possesion of civillians,btohqsg
so yea there is those..but thats it  as far as i know. His time in politicis was just too long and too much for his own good,btohqsg
people who live too long in politics lose their true selves and almost impossibly cannot pick up their bits of their original personality of before entering politics,btohqsg
those were the good early (political) days of biden's,btohqsg
no idea  no further comment on that,btohqsg
@IcedMilo@pen_guiniithis guy has been repeatedly getting past the auto filtering for the past 2-3 hours,btohqsg

algorithm & ai is still ultimately made by the human hands + brains  soo,btohqsg
technology still can't replace traditional humans,btohqsg
i hope no more jobs get replaced on grounds that ai will help better assist already existing job positions like data entry clerks,btohqsg
that's just wishful thinking from me but pls 🤞,btohqsg
but it's humans' job to adapt to it and learn other skills,btohqsg
no more in a shorter run,btohqsg
but at least give more time for people to adapt to the use of ai skills being applied in work and literally daily life,btohqsg
people still struggle with emails and basic software tools at work,btohqsg
like those older generations aged people working,btohqsg
they can learn  yes but if they struggle then how,btohqsg
and taught by kids / younger generation people they know,btohqsg

then end up struggling without asking for help  delaying the start of lessons time especially when they arrived late  or end up asking someone in class or call IT dept for staff support🤦🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
result in class dismissal being later,btohqsg
i mean i more so was speaking from uni perspective which is like,btohqsg
they have to end on time or ppl will just leave anyway,btohqsg
Mood when the projector cant even be seen irl or in recording,btohqsg
but i heard it depends on how the prof prefers to work with lectures / labs in general,btohqsg
lessons in labs work more straightforward because you can only go at a certain time where the class booked a time slot for lessons i thinklessons at lecture halls or smth are more lax compared to class labs,btohqsg
at least the general situation would be as such,btohqsg
more so depends on the major,btohqsg
and also the location of where they can get lessons booked st,btohqsg

can someone give a razor simplified explanation on reddit comment karma,btohqsg
i came back after a few days of being inactive and saw my comment karma jumping to 103 from 20-30~ last i checked???,btohqsg
i still don't understand the reddit guides  like i can read novellas but not this...,btohqsg
maybe you got downvoted to oblivion,btohqsg
likely because a bunch of people found whatever you commented relatable  useful  or entertaining,btohqsg
or it’s the reddit hivemind doing its thing,btohqsg
idk eh cause my top few most downvoted comments were somehow mainly from r/sgexams 😓,btohqsg
probably this because i don't understand how reddit post + comment karma algorithm changes every now and then,btohqsg
don’t have to worry much about it tbh  karma’s all just imaginary internet points,btohqsg
on the topic of reddit  is it just me or does r/singaporeraw seem super negative most of the time,btohqsg
i prefer to cultivate and accumulate real karma for my personal karmic life debts,btohqsg
lol i don't consider myself too personally religious,btohqsg
i like the concept of karmic debts  samsara ( cycle of reincarnations ) etc and a lot of more sanskrit / buddhism / taoism concepts i got to know in my fictional novel reading journey,btohqsg

I think u need to draw out the sin curve to visualize,btohqsg

if you draw out the triangle  sin(30 degrees) = 1/2,btohqsg
then you look at the sin curve  if sin(30 degrees) = 1/2  then sin(-30 degrees) = -1/2,btohqsg
a lot of principal value questions can be solved by remembering SOHCAHTOA and then drawing out what that triangle would look like,btohqsg

martial law probably affects those who have the capability or skill set of fighting  i think...personally haven't gotten to read any articles on this yet but their SK* laws are getting more ridiculous because why are they coming up with newer laws as compared to making further adjustments / reforms to their Employment Laws ( Particularly those in the Entertainment Circle & Healthcare Industry ) or those general protection guideline section for the Public Servants / Workers IN South Korea??? like bruh( * SK = South Korea  cause no one knows wtf is going on in North Korea unless Kim Jung Un wants to disclose such relevant information ),btohqsg

Guys i want to die so bad,btohqsg
My boyfriend just broke up with me a few days ago,btohqsg
Sibei dont leh i know this sounds like 0 EQ but after you die the people in charge of ur funeral vv traumatised,btohqsg
So after you die ah if u found(depends on how long let's just say within 8 hours. If more then your body deteriorate. Past 3 days in sg weather mostly got the botfly larvae coming out. V fat one smells like egg turn bad ×3 . Got more but i skip the details ah)So assuming 8 hours  they move you to funeral refrigerator. This one around 15 degrees. Depends on funeral ground though. But anyways you won't be in a casket for this. You would go in as-is. Already q traumatizing for the people. If police investigation going on you traumatise the policemen also. Cuz sometimes they do take you out the fridge to inspect body for possible external injuries that may indicate malicious actor  cause of death investigation. They cry you know. Then after that they will be calling your family to put you inside the casket. Depends on religion to religion but if your family choose to cremate  your family members and the funeral precedence people will put you in the wood casket with flowers  etc and paper sheet inside  that's the final time your family get to look at you. Body quite heavy btw. Then your family members  typically 6 male family members  if less then cremation people will help carry you to the cremation grounds where your body burn. Or they use cart sometimes if got. I got some friends in funeral proceedings service. They find it hard if they have to do funeral/ cremation for young suicide or old people dying without care  forgotten by family ah. Also if you go funeral for young people  you know it man like legit cannot say a thing one. Especially if die in a way cannot preserve body like in accidents. So don't die pzpz.,btohqsg
Idk if u are Chinese but there is this thing I heard ah. There is a word for a wife that lost her husband called寡妇There is a word for man who lost their wife called 鳏夫. There is a word for child that lost his/her parent called孤儿. But there isn't a word for a parent that lost their child because no word enough to contain the sorrow ( or things maybe too many child deaths in the past so not worth ),btohqsg
damn late night things be like,btohqsg
avoid getting hacked next time or sending messages in public gcs like this next time  ripKevin,btohqsg
Eh Hello this is O Level chat,btohqsg
i envy neighborhood schools that offer computer-related electives for any streams in general  aside from Normal Technical subjects that are mostly a mix of N(T) compulsory & elective subjects like  computer applications ( CPA ) & engineering specific electives like this one called Mobile Robotics which I took in sec sch  which from the name you would think involves a lot of hybrid use of engineering & internet technology components because of the subject name... lol,btohqsg
"some dude whose account had gotten hacked after falling prey to those phishing scam messages usually sent early in the morning / late odd hours at nighthis last words were literally ""sorry""  in this chat here  before he lost any access controls over the user account that was once his own ggs( aka the kevin account i tagged earlier on  before he got banned i think )",btohqsg
oh did not see his last words,btohqsg
his messages got deleted by the time i tapped the sgexams tele chat notification  earlier on.as in before the hacker took primary control of the account  kept spamming 2-3 more times to battle the filtering system set up with u/ProtectronBot & u/daysandbox_bot's auto-moderation system and finally resulted in a ban hammer issued by an actual human admin i think,btohqsg
Is it  from what I can see from the history  Kevin wasn't an existing member,btohqsg
ehh then idk how ppl even sent messages in public group chats on tele  without joining anymore lol,btohqsg
cause history + tele auto-mod logs  are also a bit wonky when referring to them as well,btohqsg
keivn's + similar phishing scam messages that can get an individual's account hacked.. all theirRECENTLYsent messages  prior to being banned & reported by people once found and discovered to be breaking chat rules,btohqsg
As in he was one of those bots that joined  posted that message  then left,btohqsg
Afaik he wasn't an existing member that got hacked,btohqsg
eh  my badit's just a few possibilities that i listed from,btohqsg
i thought he was a sgexams tele chat member because i used to see a bunch of him chatting before ( but probably just my memory is failing me )same for some other bot accounts that keep joining to send that same advertisement messages  pretty much every other day around 1AM to 4AM,btohqsg
Hmm now that you mention it I did rmb Kevin before,btohqsg
But idt it's him because when I banned him  I had the option to delete all messages from him  and I only deleted that spam message,btohqsg
ohhhhh  yeah. probably two diff accounts,btohqsg
if it's actually the same person  managing an account that has a bot programming algorithm to send those spam messages every now and then while re-joining & leaving a group.. ggs,btohqsg
for some reason the mods awake at 1am 💀💀,btohqsg

🥴 something bad happens at NTU Tanjong Hall Of Residence,btohqsg
does anyone know more info about the victim generally speaking?,btohqsg
every time foul play is ruled out in more recent cases of individuals found dead somewhere in a residential area.. feels like a possible investigation case that will be most often left unsolved with how SPF (Singapore Police Forces) lack evidence,btohqsg
is this some fking competition to see if the telegram or discord has the more unhinged crazy,btohqsg
I just worked in a crematorium before.,btohqsg
this one got copypasta potential eh,btohqsg
i like to think straits times has officially became stomp 2.0,btohqsg
instead of stomp being straits time 2.0,btohqsg
jesus the amount of speculation articles that has infiltrated straits times instead of being a stomp article,btohqsg
maybe maybe they meant a different kind of haircut yk,btohqsg
im more curious as to why reporters are going undercover to patronize MORE THAN ONE OR TWO sussy establishments when they're already aware of such pre-knowledge information before heading down to checkfor these shady geylang establishments  they probably already existed as far as many years back in the past  even though authorities have already tried numerous times in attempts to crack down on such businesses that involve a lot of illegal prostitution / sex workers & prohibited drugs,btohqsg
they just learn how to stay more low-key over time,btohqsg
