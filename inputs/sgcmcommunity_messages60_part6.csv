Newbie question here  does worn rear absorber produce squeaky sound while driving slow when someone sits at the rear passenger seats? Kept having the squeaky sound on my rear left when driving slow but when driving fast on expressway no sound.,btohqsg

the solution unique to your  problem is  to drive faster,btohqsg
