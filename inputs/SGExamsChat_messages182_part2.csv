YA the kinematic is so tedious,btohqsg
i lost sm marks : )),btohqsg
Now time to study other subjects,btohqsg
do halfway the ans v weird...im like doubting myself,btohqsg
My teacher say compound interest for dat qn accepted,btohqsg
just curious but can moderation make the grade boundary lower than the standard ?? like is that possible,btohqsg
how do u explain for the m question,btohqsg
which one is case by case,btohqsg
parallel to the mod will give u only 1 pt,btohqsg
and if its greater than that it will still only touch 1 pt nia,btohqsg
then another case is it touched only min pt / just not even touching it at all,btohqsg
Ooo question 1.. this topic will be out of syllabus next year onwards,btohqsg
i guess this amath ppr is the toughest just to pave the way for the new syllabus lmfao,btohqsg
Why every year syllabus learn lesser and lesser,btohqsg
Yeah sum and product of roots,btohqsg
Plain geometry is the distinction filter subject,btohqsg
Since paper 1 dh  paper 2 marks is reduced rit?,btohqsg
Anyway even if you forget the formula you can just keep multiplying 1.07 in your calculator. So the original value times 1.07=Ans  then ansx1.07 and so on,btohqsg
Cant say for sure but i think there’s a very good chance at least 5 marks removed,btohqsg
Yeah.. y-intercept of y = mx -2 is -2.. draw a line from y = 2 to the vertex... that’s the minimum gradient which is 4/7,btohqsg
The line shifts with increasing gradient from 4/7 to 2 where it is parallel to the graph of y = |7-2x|,btohqsg
I thought part 2 is find gradient,btohqsg
I get positive graident i think,btohqsg
Negative 1 divided by your positive gradient,btohqsg
lost like 10 marks due to careless af mistakes,btohqsg
I lost the marks to alpha beta n compound interest,btohqsg
the fkn motorcyclist took away my marks,btohqsg
he drove away with my marks i guess,btohqsg
I hope the motorcyclist runs over smth,btohqsg
run over alr cannot get back the 6m also,btohqsg
The question need reject angle  if never reject 2 of them,btohqsg
huh? Thrs only 2 ans tho,btohqsg
Ya i know i found 4 wtf,btohqsg
not no mark prolly. -1 oni,btohqsg
i wrote -1 < sin A < 1,btohqsg
I arrowed to 2 n reject,btohqsg
Huh I only got 2 answers 199.5 and 340.5,btohqsg
just one mark bro don’t fret,btohqsg
Max only Minus one so u can still get ur other marks,btohqsg
i rlly hope for that 70/80,btohqsg
alot of good people are taking amath,btohqsg
so ur basically competing with the strong as fuk students out there,btohqsg
i heard 75/80 thrn a1  true or nah,btohqsg
Centre at (-2 3)  so radius from centre to (1 7) has positive gradient. The tangent at (1 7) has negative gradient then,btohqsg
a should be 75-80 and above,btohqsg
80-90% for a1 depending on how everyone did,btohqsg
Tbh don’t stress about dat bro,btohqsg
but given the difficulty it shldnt be above 80,btohqsg
Ffs i damn scared abt the curve,btohqsg
its the toughest i’ve ever seen,btohqsg
