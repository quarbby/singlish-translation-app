Hi  If I just signed up for (new) UOB one account this month.Sign up for the UOB Big savings promo for this month  do I deposit the amount in today or end of the month?,btohqsg
Do you intend to get 4% p.a. interest for May?,btohqsg
anytime so long you have earmark amount+Mar MAB by 31 May 10.30pm,btohqsg
Yes  intend to earn 4% int.Apologies. Edited to add in more details.,btohqsg
To ride on when will the amount be earmarked ? Iâ€™m doing the April month .,btohqsg
Today put in the posted date should be tomorrow right since its public holiday..,btohqsg
Is there like a formula to calculate cashback. Cause I rmb Chris mentioned it once in his video,btohqsg
I just top up 50k also...,btohqsg
May i understand why several of u mentioned 155k instead of 150k ah?,btohqsg
I only top up to 150k...,btohqsg
Card gives 3% cashback = transaction amount Ã— 3%Card gives 5% cashback = transaction amount Ã— 5%Card gives 8% cashback = transaction amount Ã— 8%Not sure what you're asking for  but this is the math,btohqsg
To maintain MAB at 150k. Transactions today do not count. You have to keep it at 155k unless you already have 150k on 30 Apr.Or if he not interested to get the full 4% p.a.  then he can just ignore.,btohqsg
MAB in march is 100k so now make it 150k,btohqsg
I see. Because of the public holiday so today bank in will be counted as tomorrow,btohqsg
Pls correct my maths if i am wrong.1st May 100k2nd May till 31st May 151666.67Then MAB for May is 150k,btohqsg
Isnt cashback just eligible spent amount  multiplying cashback %? Or do you mean miles vs cashback equivalent calc?,btohqsg
For those with 100k already on 30 Apr then sure. But OP is new account.,btohqsg
U r right. I was counting how much i need to top up. Cash is tight balance three 100k accounts,btohqsg
There's a lot new account openings even though nerf. Because people start to realise it's easier and higher overall interest with fresh fund of 150k.,btohqsg
Didnt treasure the last one year,btohqsg
"Search ""UOB amaze"". Unless it's not a UOB card then maybe new but also similar issue.",btohqsg
I found the answer. Thank you! Apparently ongoing issue between amaze and UOB,btohqsg
Better double check the actual MAB for Mar in the app. It's pretty impossible to be 100000 on the dot.,btohqsg
If can't find then wait for physical card ba,btohqsg
Thank you. I did. Its 100000.01,btohqsg
I did my maths for the previous month in Feb to hit nicely for March.,btohqsg
That 1 cent steps between whether you get earmarked or not.,btohqsg
Yea so instead of 151666.66 i make it 151666.67 to make up for it,btohqsg
If u value 1 mile as 1.5 cents  4 mpd is equals to 6% cashback. If can get higher than 6%  then use cashback card.,btohqsg
Samsung online store  which card to use? HSBC revo or citi-rewards with amaze?,btohqsg
Not sure about Samsung storeBut I use shopback to earn myself 2 percent cashback,btohqsg
Ooo... I was chatting with Samsung chat earlier  was told using the Samsung store app  first time got 10% off.  Comparing the cost via the app and online  there a good 80$ different..,btohqsg
So just thinking with card now is better to earn the miles...,btohqsg
Hello Gurus may I ask on UOB'sã€€Big Savings Promotionï¼ŸIf march month average of my UOB one account was was 50K and currently as of May 1 I have 100K in the UOB One account. By placing incremental 100K the total will be 200K.Since I apply to have only 100K as incremental  to maintain max 150K WHEN CAN I WITHDRAW THE 50K?,btohqsg
If March MAB is 50k and Apr EMB is 100k  then make sure it's 152k tomorrow (top-up 52k) to earmark 100k fresh funds and maintain 150k MAB for 4% p.a. interest. How did you get 200k?,btohqsg
Is there any miles card to use for town council payment,btohqsg
"Have you searched ""town council card"" or ""town council miles""?",btohqsg
Considering campaign return I thought maybe more efficient to put in incremental 100K. Since only 100K will get earmarked (so current 100K + incremental 100K = 200K)  I assumed I can at some point take out 50K since in March I only had 50K in my account,btohqsg
you need to topup $50k to get $150k ($100k earmark amount+Mar MAB of $50k),btohqsg
Still don't get why 100k + 100k... Your Mar MAB is 50k  your registered fresh funds is 100k.. 50k + 100k = 150k..,btohqsg
So the 50K I currently already have in is counted towards my 100K!!,btohqsg
understood now!! thank you so much@MelvynEzi@Trazora! You guys saved me from putting random excess cash. Much apprecaited!,btohqsg
