They will send it to ur house in 2024 Jan,btohqsg
Nope they will put it all tgt,btohqsg
So I got to JC in 2024?,btohqsg
Then the one year will be preparing for the private candidate,btohqsg
U did not take A math?,btohqsg
Why would u wan do private tho,btohqsg
I thot amaths not necessary for jc?,btohqsg
Just a math and physics for private,btohqsg
I think  she wan go Sci stream,btohqsg
Emath can take h2 math aslo,btohqsg
I think u can just take a diagnostic test in some jcs,btohqsg
Idt u can take phy tho,btohqsg
Which jc can take h2 math with e math,btohqsg
then jpjc also can I think,btohqsg
NY dont give shit abt ur subjects imo,btohqsg
H2 math without A math will be even harder,btohqsg
Can try to ask yr school to let u take phy and A math,btohqsg
But u got 3 months to prepare so shd be fine,btohqsg
Granted u cant slack off during the hols haha,btohqsg
Tbh this is very advisable nut,btohqsg
I thot if u do diagnostic test u can,btohqsg
Idk I thot that was for everything,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234imo if u wan u shud consider mi,btohqsg
Cuz mi no nid amath for H2 math,btohqsg
Just check with your school principal to allow you to take A math.,btohqsg
I take A math at sec 4.,btohqsg
I checked with my form teacher,btohqsg
I not qualified for h2 math,btohqsg
U nid to have taken phy b4 before u can take phy,btohqsg
It's fine haha i think alot of people will drop come j2,btohqsg
For me i am a NT student,btohqsg
Then i do NA math at sec 3.,btohqsg
Geog   lit in el   translation   and bio,btohqsg
Before taking offically given A math at sec 4  i need to sit for a test.,btohqsg
Doesnt this fill up the 4 subject slots already?,btohqsg
Jc math is not compulsory for art stream i think,btohqsg
I'd imagine ur timetable to be utterly bad haha,btohqsg
but yea if only ny takes me if not,btohqsg
But math is very useful in terms of everyday usage of math. Imo,btohqsg
What are the job prospects for physics,btohqsg
Other than law psychology and business,btohqsg
ive not used sin cos tan ever since sec sch,btohqsg
Dude  how do people live life without the knowledge of solving  at the very minimum  a 2nd order non homogenous ODE. Yesterday when I tried to cross the road  I had to solve one already.,btohqsg
honestly whatever u do in JC/poly doesnt affect much,btohqsg
This one best. Need to teach propaganda,btohqsg
unless  u going into specialised fields such as engineering or what not,btohqsg
What u study doesnt equals to what u work next time tbh,btohqsg
I did hospitality in ITE  business in Poly and communications in Uni. Im working in hr,btohqsg
U dont need skills future anymore,btohqsg
Yeah u dun use sin cos tan ever since sec sch.,btohqsg
My point here is math is every where.Investment  probability for gambling,btohqsg
but am I going to know how to prove that 2 graphs are isomorphic in my career,btohqsg
You‚Äôll never be successful if you can‚Äôt even prove that quintic equations don‚Äôt have a general formula,btohqsg
sadge... i guess i'm gonna resign myself to mediocrity NOW,btohqsg
Hi everyone! I am part of a youth-led mental health project called Cloud 9 and we recently made a chatbot connecting youths to help-seeking resources@stubbythe_botIt's something small  but we hope it can at least be useful to some of you.

We're very open to new ideas! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Edit: included ig link :),btohqsg

@sactiiii&@raznflameDid you listen to the new Weeknd single?,btohqsg

Kanye dropped donda but onda is pronounced as eez nuts in yo mouth,btohqsg

Uncle think Lorine Smith is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Yo fellas   me @cauchycriterionand@fez_tivalare working on an open source chemistry project where given an input chemical  the program can tell you if a certain type of reaction is possible and what the result of such a reaction would be.Its coded in python. Im wondering if anyone wants to join us? Eventually it will be released for people to use in sgexams so in a sense its our way to giving back to the sgexams community!https://github.com/neilscallywag/reaction_pathway,btohqsg
Not yet but I heard it's quite good,btohqsg
The new look  he's matured now.,btohqsg
seems cool eh  would you guys be interested to possibly integrate this into the sgexams website in the future?,btohqsg
I dont mind but its python based,btohqsg
Anyone interested can just contact me,btohqsg
I also need people to help me w some things HAHAH,btohqsg
yea should be fine  do y'all have like a github repo or smth?,btohqsg
maybe can add me in? haha then in the future we can see how we can put this on the website for more ppl to use,btohqsg
Its open to all regardless if u have coding knowledge or not,btohqsg
Does anyone know if NJC sends out rejection letters after interview ?,btohqsg
why bring up the antivaxxers out of nowherealso thats one of the saddest tele groups i have ever seen,btohqsg
Just let the blood spill. Cant get covid if ur dead,btohqsg
aiya don't dwell on them la,btohqsg
let them think what they want to think,btohqsg
Ah yes the ancient way of treating illnesses,btohqsg
Nice  I want to troll also,btohqsg
All Hell breaks loose in that group,btohqsg
by trolling them we are just giving antivaxxers more reason to think we are the ones at wrong,btohqsg
attack for what? what's the point seriously?,btohqsg
Imagine if we bring up geographical contentions in that group,btohqsg
Just let natural selection do its thing,btohqsg
they alr feel like they have the world against them  u want to go in and troll them even more  they'll feel even more strongly about what they feel,btohqsg
let's try to add value to society and the people around us ya?,btohqsg
Hahaha  they don't even know/understand the reference,btohqsg
we want to support one another here  not try to bring people down,btohqsg
if you want to participate in such behaviour you can find some other group,btohqsg
Wow  I made a point about Google's negligence with data and they actually blocked me.,btohqsg
its literally a far right echo chamber dont expect too much,btohqsg
"They were like ""install Google Translate"" and I  acting like one of them  said that I'm an Apple User and Google tracks all of us.",btohqsg
tbh the far left also influence some singaporeans but yea ...,btohqsg
Well  in life  it's about being on the middle straight path.,btohqsg
Anyways  that aside  do we get a national Public Holiday on the 22nd for the Parade?,btohqsg
Oh my  that's not what I mean.,btohqsg
i thought they already confirmed theres not gonna be one more,btohqsg
Oh  it's a Sunday  no wonder.,btohqsg
Can I say that I actually liked the NDP 2009 & 2018 songs,btohqsg
Apparently  they're considered the worst or at least not popular.,btohqsg
2018 is the remake of Count on Me,btohqsg
I just liked the R&B-Pop vibe of it,btohqsg
Back in the early 2000s it would have worked,btohqsg
Early 2000s was practically sensual R&B,btohqsg
Back during those days radios played R&B and hip hop,btohqsg
Not exactly R&B pop but close enough,btohqsg
Just because a subgenre shares the name of the main genre  it does not necessarily mean they sound the same,btohqsg
It's close enough + R&B doesn't sell in 2018 anymore,btohqsg
Yo  the NDP 2018 songs sound nothing like the R&B or early 2000s,btohqsg
I'll say they're closer to mid 2000s,btohqsg
Early 2000s were sensual and sexual in nature - Usher & Aaliyah are prime examples to mind,btohqsg
I would strongly disagree that they sound the same  one is a subgenre of the other. Yet  even then  I would argue that the NDP 2018 song is more Pop-inspired.,btohqsg
Well  let's be honest  any main genre in isolation was beginning to not sell well by the late 2010s,btohqsg
The pop style it was going for wasn't the pop style that was popular in 2018,btohqsg
The R&B sound was also not the primary R&B sound of 2018  so what exactly is it?,btohqsg
idk if its appropriate to turn here for advice but how do i convince my strict slightly anti-christian parents to allow me to attend church camp,btohqsg
i'm not exactly part of the church btw  but i attend their services,btohqsg
Wait  so you're Christian but your parents are not?,btohqsg
new believer is a more accurate term,btohqsg
i still have a lot to learn abt christianity tbh,btohqsg
other than that yes ur right,btohqsg
I see  ah  okay. Did you talk to your parents before converting?,btohqsg
Nicea Creed of 381 AD would be the best place to go,btohqsg
Oh my  that sets the beginning of the hurdle,btohqsg
Is the camp online or in person?,btohqsg
Our latest series from the FBM team is a three part article series on internships!

to be fair i didnt really convert ah like i dont spend a lot of time on church stuff to say the least,btohqsg
Oh  right  COVID restrictions are getting lifted  how could I forget?,btohqsg
not very becoming which is why i cant call myself a christian,btohqsg
Ok  personally  I would say to inform your parents that it's for experience but I'm not experienced in this feel.,btohqsg
but some part of me feels that i need a more strong convincing reason that theyll actly find logical,btohqsg
also please dont ask why my phone is at 1% HAHA,btohqsg
prob people wont notice but u said that hmm,btohqsg
i have been shadowbanned by singapore's concerned parents üò≠,btohqsg
when does the results for chinese come out for mid year takers?,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt like your music taste.,btohqsg
no one listens to mainstream pop/r&b/rap in singapore anymore üòî many ppl migrated to kpop,btohqsg
pls ping me if anyone knows ty,btohqsg
why got ads when u use yt premium kek,btohqsg
People want to stand out so they'll actively search out alternative music until the alt genre becomes the new mainstream,btohqsg
ariana grande  taylor swift  olivia rodrigo  dua lipa  doja cat  justin bieber  the weeknd  nicki minaj  cardi b  drake  lil wayne  travis scott are considered mainstream internationally  but maybe not in sg hehehe,btohqsg
cuz I told my sis was like jul kke,btohqsg
cuz during my time it was l8 jul,btohqsg
ndp songs topping spotify playlists these past few days LMAOOO,btohqsg
he recently only made a song,btohqsg
There ‚Äòs a scene of him acting like one..,btohqsg
liking to listen to anime opening / game songs / ads songs,btohqsg
English is like all abt luv,btohqsg
how long i didn't listen to tat alr lol,btohqsg
"its called ""stay""  with The Kid LAROI",btohqsg
id do the same that i tell you i never would,btohqsg
why are there so many ppl in grps of,btohqsg
I think their taste is the Gold 90.5FM and Class 95 kind of playlist.,btohqsg
Guys how to stop smell of cig from neighbour,btohqsg
Chinese paper got distinctive smell cuz I live near a temple,btohqsg
I think my parents talk to them befote but like they still do it,btohqsg
my throat feels so dry from all the smoke,btohqsg
Been living with this shit for years,btohqsg
unless it's sore throat from covid,btohqsg
My neighbour ‚Äòs dog bark 3 times a day or more without fail..,btohqsg
Well. I tried to. But sometimes it barks at 11pm+,btohqsg
Wrong small dog = easier to take care of,btohqsg
Except that my definition of take care of is most likely different from what you're thinking,btohqsg
where to buy  how to install,btohqsg
I put like at my window,btohqsg
Cannot uh.. The whole house can hear the bark so not just one room.,btohqsg
I dw expose where I stay,btohqsg
I know there ‚Äòs two dogs that barks very loudly. One on level 1 and the other on the second floor.,btohqsg
Then they tell me is another estate..,btohqsg
I got asked the dog on level 2 to shut up before..,btohqsg
I shouted at the dog from level 1,btohqsg
Well  most people here are only on Pop & K-pop so yeah.,btohqsg
That's a good question since After Hours is labeled as Alternative R&B but it was considerably the most popular R&B album of 2020,btohqsg
That's the norm after all. Sometimes it is quite detrimental  Chance The Rapper.,btohqsg
Bille did make a big impact here,btohqsg
Can I say that I actually like Changes now?,btohqsg
I play old racing games so we we're all weird in our ways,btohqsg
Well  not true really  The Weeknd used to be about mindless groupie sex while living a hedonistic drug-filled lifestyle,btohqsg
I was thinking more along the lines of kanye's graduation  considered alternative hip hop  beating 50 cent's curtis  a gangsta rap album  considered one of the most popular hip hop genres at the time,btohqsg
His older songs sound like high on drugs..,btohqsg
To be fair people's tastes change over time,btohqsg
I didn't like Taylor until Folklore & Evermore,btohqsg
They forgot that today is the 8th  maybe,btohqsg
Well  that's back on '07 & Hip-Hop was starting to move away from bling-era then.,btohqsg
Yes  I used to listen to Maroon V back then and whatever is popping on the radio but now I'm considered (in my surroundings) the odd one out since I listen to the Weeknd Silk Sonic & Tyler  The Creator (obviously there is more but I'm just stating artists that have dropped new materials this year),btohqsg
@sactiiii&@raznflame  The Weeknd is really taking my breath away.,btohqsg
The maturity of him not wanting to the drug lifestyle anymore (reflected in the lyrics) and the continuation of the sounds from After Hours is really something,btohqsg
I feel like we might be getting an album of him being the anti-thesis of House of Balloons,btohqsg

Hey i went from neyo to breaking benjamin somehow,btohqsg
i started liking taylor from 1989,btohqsg
Yeah  I only liked Fearless (Taylor's Version) as Taylor sounded more mature. Yet  I am not crazy over it since it's Fearless still.,btohqsg
I oni like taylor fearless to 1989,btohqsg
Oop  I ain't a fan of Pop after all.,btohqsg
tv is better than the originals,btohqsg
U should listen  quite a vibe,btohqsg

It's still the same 80s synthpop like the bulk of After Hours - except it's more Disco now.,btohqsg
I can ask you to listen to songs from the mixtapes  they sound really high.,btohqsg
There ‚Äòs ad for this service too,btohqsg

yeah im super sure nazi germany is in the o lvl history syllabus  i took elective history last yearfinding my old notes is probably gonna be really troublesome though,btohqsg
There will be two different certificates:(,btohqsg
With two different certificates can I still apply to jc with both certificates,btohqsg
So when choosing the subject in jc,btohqsg
hi there! yes you can sign up again :) it‚Äôs to update whether any additional help is required and also whether you are interested in joining a study group,btohqsg
Just let uk smth ah@jacquelyn1234if u wan dsa,btohqsg
U can only can DSA when ur in sch ah,btohqsg
I‚Äôm only private candidate for a math,btohqsg
But u sure u wanna self study a math by your self?,btohqsg
For me is not really easy tho,btohqsg
Maybe I can hire tutor after o levels,btohqsg
YesIt's not easyI was a private candidate for Math beforeIt's quite struggling,btohqsg
Can I know how much did you get so I know what to expect,btohqsg
You must have tuition and a lot of discipline.,btohqsg
How many chapters are there in a math,btohqsg
You will learn Sec 3-4 A Maths in one year,btohqsg
The syllabus have been scaled down,btohqsg
@its_shxnbut why did you become a private candidate,btohqsg
So new syllabus is easier to learn now?,btohqsg
if u saw the sample paper,btohqsg
Cos I wanna know if it‚Äôs worth it,btohqsg
But they cut down of some chapter.,btohqsg
u wan to know mine or neh,btohqsg
I hope y'all don't laughüòÖWhen I was a school candidate  I got C5 for MathWhen I was a private candidate  I got C6 for MathI did not go for any tuition because I wanted to save money (although I did not work before  but I understand that money is not easy to earn  so I didn't want to spend money on tuition)That time the only way was to ask my secondary school teacher for helpThe weakest topics that I faced were properties of circle and 3D trigonometry,btohqsg
There still some student struggle with A math,btohqsg
If you don't mind telling me  pleaseüòÖ,btohqsg
I'l pm mine cuz mine q long winded,btohqsg
But idk if it‚Äôs really worth it to waste 1 bfore going to year to be a private candidate,btohqsg
Like I‚Äôm quite scared of the different certificates,btohqsg
But 1 year is quite rush unless you can take it.,btohqsg
Then I will start studying next year in o levels,btohqsg
Well i completed the entire NA syllabus in a uear.,btohqsg
cuz alot only take private if they want a btr score and just for a sub,btohqsg
I really start focusing for A math after Sec 3 EOY.,btohqsg
And my test is all on Sec 3 A math syllabus,btohqsg
I‚Äôm really scared on the different certificate,btohqsg
if u wan to take amath I suggest studying this year alr,btohqsg
ur new sch wont know that ur a private,btohqsg
2 years is safer than just 1.,btohqsg
But the most important is do they know I‚Äôm took a math cos h2 math needs a math,btohqsg
That time I take.. I regret cramming the whole thing in 1 year.,btohqsg
Yes. I even signed for a class,btohqsg
And my test is on end dec.,btohqsg
So i was given like 3 months to complete all the Sec 3 syllabus,btohqsg
why would u want to take it when u can go some sch for bridging math for h2,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm not sure which schools,btohqsg
I told u some but sedly u said no,btohqsg
YepNot really true2016 NA and O level Mathematics was the first batch of new syllabus (I mean to me when I was in sec 4)It was very hard for many of us during my time because of real-life applicationI'm not really sure about your syllabus (whoever is taking Mathematics now)  but I think would be also harder as well.If you find your syllabus is easier  it is either that you're super smart at Mathematics or because of cutting down number of chaptersOkay done,btohqsg
these are the schools btw:YIJC(B3 and btr )  ASRJC(emath must be A2  n btr )  JPJC (must talk to  the sch principal )and TMJC(u nid get A1) MI(c5 and btr),btohqsg
those updated as per my batch ah,btohqsg
@chemcerur sch the h2 same  condition anot,btohqsg
Ik asrjc n jp no diff,btohqsg
H2 math have also cut down the topic for 9758,btohqsg
And they have introduced real life applications.,btohqsg
hi guys isit allowed to send my lazada link here‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
They are training you to be a independent thinker.,btohqsg
anybody wna help a G out pm?,btohqsg
But I heard from them can,btohqsg
I heard from sajc.confessions in ig,btohqsg
They got bridging module.and this person say got take bringing module,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs a sch confession page,btohqsg
And taking A math doesn't really help you in h2 math. Yes you apply your A math stuff in h2 math. Like product rule quoient rule. But to do very well for h2 math. Is not about practising anymore.,btohqsg
still the Provence isnt thr \,btohqsg
Is h2 maths important? Like is not having h2 physics enough,btohqsg
This iis how i feel tbh,btohqsg
throwback to crying over struggling to do 2 math questions,btohqsg
Yea I wld rather drop physics,btohqsg
throwback to completing 3 math questions in 1 day,btohqsg
But I feel they overlap alot in the courses,btohqsg
I must be damn shit then haha,btohqsg
i still rmb a few days before h2 maths As last year,btohqsg
i was struggling to do the simplest of questions,btohqsg
What make h2 math difficult is the application question,btohqsg
that was exactly where i got stuck at,btohqsg
But stats help to pull up marks a lot,btohqsg
In general I see graphs I pain,btohqsg
Given u dont screw up any parts,btohqsg
Reading this makes me question why I went jc again,btohqsg
I feel like u gonna tell me it gets worse,btohqsg
Yea hope so since I no need take h1mt anymore haha,btohqsg
my teacher once told me i was gonna fail GP As,btohqsg
U dont need good english to do well in gp...well to a certsinextent,btohqsg
I will definitely fail my GP,btohqsg
I think that's same for all years in sg education system,btohqsg
O level english oso no need good english,btohqsg
No leh  last time gp no need compre only do essay. Now with compre  u die die need english more,btohqsg
YeahAlthough both papers 1 and 2 are 35% each (I'm not sure if this percentage is still applied for current syllabus)  I think compre is more important than essayI also hate compre  but yeah  it's like that :(,btohqsg
My oni issue for compre is SAQ & summary  since theyre kinda focusing more on language  kinda like olvl english,btohqsg
I think AQ is useful in bringing up skills relevant to 'GP'  but i think theres more ways to do so as well in compre,btohqsg
And to add onEven if you think English is not important  better work hard for English  otherwise you will be suffering when you're in poly or uni,btohqsg
Is it cuz of the report writing / presentation etc?,btohqsg
Oh yah.. Presentation   you need to speak clearly,btohqsg
And there are many courses required students to take Communication module  which involves English Language. If you're weak in English  you will be suffering with this module very badly,btohqsg
If your English is not so good   can use Grammarly to improve,btohqsg
Yep canHowever  if you have to take exam for your Communication module  cannot use grammarly at all  so try to understand the grammar that suggested by the Grammarly  and try not to rely too much when you're taking this module(I mean if you rely too much on Grammarly  you might be suffering on exam because you might get a sudden feeling on how to survive without Grammarly in exam and feel very stress about it),btohqsg
And sometimes you have to write a formal email to your lecturer for the important stuff,btohqsg
Ah. That too.. need to learn the formal format.,btohqsg
I only used it at the start. Thereafter I stopped.,btohqsg
Sorry to bother you all  may I check with you all on how to getv1=1.25m/s & v2=6.25m/s if not sure nvm thank you all for your time and kind attention! :),btohqsg
I see  thanks for the time and guidance! :),btohqsg
