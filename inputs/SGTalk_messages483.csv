The men all evil too! Not only woman ü§£,btohqsg
What sleeping pill are you currently one?,btohqsg
Zopiclone. My mom has some extra so I've been using them periodically. Ran out of it le.,btohqsg
This one can report? The ingredient literally says sugar in English  and glucose fructose in chinese  but the importer dare to label the thing A grade. Not just this bottle  but all the bottle label this.,btohqsg
I drank 2 bottles Nia. Damn happy when I drank it.,btohqsg
Then realise no wonder I so happy,btohqsg
No wonder high in sugar rush,btohqsg
What food to recommend at suntec? Not too exp de.. probably less than $30per pax,btohqsg
Zopiclone only for short term use.You have depression?,btohqsg
No  from mama shop below my house,btohqsg
his mom's zopiclone bro. not his,btohqsg
Probably have depression  but I never go diagnose it. I scared cannot apply certain jobs after diagnosis,btohqsg
Oh. I thought it's he and his mum take the same pill,btohqsg

Go polyclinic if have depression.Their med n counsellor gd,btohqsg
Bro. Brain is just like any other organs. It can get sick and can recover.,btohqsg
There is no reason to reject your job application if you have made full recovery,btohqsg
No need to declare have depression bah when apply job,btohqsg
Cuz I consider sign on SPF or ICA mah  then those job require you to declare one. I NS SPF  so I roughly know the process abit.,btohqsg
If you mental health history  then high chance will reject cuz unfit to bear arms.,btohqsg
Even more important to get your body and mind in the right place to ensure personal and public safety.,btohqsg
Ever thot of go exercise to tired urself out? Can slp better?,btohqsg
Got exercise de. Cycling lor. Which is keeping my mood in check also.,btohqsg
@SongAzureBecause the alternative medication I was going to suggest for insomnia might worsen depression.,btohqsg
Ah I see. Then I better go get it checked. Medication conflict later hahahaha,btohqsg
Even i taking gaba.. wkends i dont take,btohqsg
Wah abit late reading this  but I think should be ok. I take every 2-3days @ 1/2 -1/3 pill each time.,btohqsg
For your insomnia  just try cetirizine.Most importantly  have a good sleep hygiene for long term solution.,btohqsg
I think ask him see doctor better,btohqsg
Wah  I think this one good. I have allergies also. Kill 2 birds with one stone,btohqsg
What is gd for us  may not be gd for everyone,btohqsg
Maybe your allergies keeping you awake. See a doc to properly diagnose the cause of insomnia.,btohqsg

Yes too much proteins will cause kidney stones,btohqsg
I try my best to tar 4l water a day,btohqsg
that is the best supplement !,btohqsg
4l for me just right la,btohqsg
It's not expensive to be healthy. Supplements are non essential to healthy living if you are eating right and have a healthy lifestyle.@iugoddessis the best example. He is not on supplement and he is looking like Mr Universe.,btohqsg
she eat also dun tell you üôà,btohqsg
No la where got mr universe,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt forget our water is also processed,btohqsg
Supplements was designed for imbalance diet and people with digestion and absorption issues such as elderly and IBS.,btohqsg
we all here elderly Liao üò¢,btohqsg
Haha... Just sad to see capitalism and marketing perverse the original intentions of supplements.,btohqsg
but ok la I also only take if bobian,btohqsg
I am lazy to argue. Lol,btohqsg
Like i seldom eat orange and vit c stuffs so i will take vit c tablet,btohqsg
Then I have trouble eating a lot so protein and mass gainer,btohqsg
I want bigger meat meat so I take CREATINE,btohqsg
How many oranges u can eat in a day? Sugar lvl will shoot up,btohqsg
Oh no. Please don't argue. It's ok if you like your supplements and they are making you feel great.I am merely stating the original intentions of supplements.,btohqsg
I am taking it for the purest intention,btohqsg
I taking the recogen.. gd for joints,btohqsg
I probably need take something too XD,btohqsg
Need to take the type 2 then is gd i think,btohqsg
Getting too used to sore and pain in gym Liao lol,btohqsg

I go as high as I can until I slowly cannot go as high then drop,btohqsg
But I trying out new one I use weights then I jump and hold there as long as I can then slowly come down and repeat,btohqsg
I think those lat pull down and such will help build strength do pull up also,btohqsg
pull up is my weak point I struggling also üò¢,btohqsg
Recently i do assisted pull up and lat putdown,btohqsg
Oh. Do you mean you are doing negative pull up?,btohqsg
Yeah me too. Used to be able to do 10+ (NS version) But I stop working out for 1 year due to stuff. Now I can only do 8-10 normal pull up.Will take a long while to go back to 10+.,btohqsg
Last time i do 10+ pull ups too,btohqsg
Over the years become 0 fighter,btohqsg
My friend can do 20 to 30+. I don't even know how,btohqsg
Smaller size and light weight can do a lot,btohqsg
I wonder can buy supplements on amazon cheaper or not,btohqsg
Does your generation NS still need pull up? I think they cut it out of ippt some time back.,btohqsg
With a bit of training can pass easily,btohqsg
Ya lor. Kns. But it's to your benefit still,btohqsg
I never had to take ippt after i ord,btohqsg
I legit got very bad injury from ns,btohqsg
Good thing is no need ippt. Bad thing is no free money,btohqsg
I stopped exercising cos of this,btohqsg
The doc recommended me to stop exercising,btohqsg
Then better go easy on those heavy lifting and squats,btohqsg
But i dun feel any pain on my back,btohqsg
Just 2 years to look like that? You actually has good genes,btohqsg

Cos i dun eat a lot one,btohqsg
Used to be a big eater but i cut down a lot,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I started gym lol,btohqsg
Nowadays rice i also dun eat finish,btohqsg
Is just that now my upper body is satisfactory,btohqsg
So now i focus more on cardio all that,btohqsg
Wa still got this so good,btohqsg
Got the machine at my gym,btohqsg
Every month i take the reading,btohqsg

ok la best gauge is mirror !,btohqsg
I only happy with my arms,btohqsg
I long time never do leg press,btohqsg
every leg day I cry mother cry father rolling on the floor suffering,btohqsg
After losing weight then i do back my leg press all that,btohqsg
I now more of skinny fat,btohqsg
The plate dropped on my toe that time,btohqsg
all these machines are good for progress tracking only.your body composition done with bioelectrical impedance is easily affected by daily routines like amount of water you drink,btohqsg
Best is dun eat or drink anything before u take,btohqsg
Ya but iherb must hit $60,btohqsg
Even Dexa and MRI has their issues ,btohqsg
U got use shopback? Think 1 to 2 days back got massive cashback,btohqsg
I did some gym back in 2022. I fractured a rib unknowingly while benching.during routine screening  saw a 1cm shadow in my lung. i thought GG liao.did a MRI  heng it was fractured rib. The whole health scare cost me about 1k,btohqsg
birthday month. dont like this. üòî,btohqsg
no la. business owner. unemployed myself when i want. employ again when i want again,btohqsg
ya. this year fractured the same rib again during a bicycle accident. so pause everything for 3 months to let it heal.,btohqsg
haiya. birthday month also wanna grill me,btohqsg
Is there anything u can do to prevent fracture?,btohqsg
go gai gai now. after nov / dec hell restart,btohqsg
Arbo? U want to fracture where else?,btohqsg
So shiok. Still can gai gai,btohqsg
healed fractures are never back to 100% original state. Best idea is not fracture it in the first place.otherwise strengthen the muscle around the bone is a good idea to prevent future injury.,btohqsg
recovered a month or 2 already. initially  even breathing will feel painful,btohqsg
Ya i understand that. Becoz of my kneecaps hurt and i know my legs are not strong  that why i did alot of leg strengthening. Esp muscles around my kneecaps. Sometimes it will have inflammation  it hurts to walk. That why now i am careful.,btohqsg
Now so hot to even walk out. Thought walking out to my doc‚Ä¶guess i wait for a while more,btohqsg
For knee  think dont do too much climb stairs? Wear n tear easily..My knee need to do keyhole surgery maybe next year..Provided my dvt have recover..,btohqsg
Climb stairs is ok but going down is killer,btohqsg

Scare to go so long de leave,btohqsg
I feel u  like my shoulders recently then recovered but not fully,btohqsg

I also dun regret started working out,btohqsg
At least won‚Äôt feel so lethargic,btohqsg
Some days i dragged myself to workout but after that i am so glad i did,btohqsg
