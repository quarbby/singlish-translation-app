Yes but u need to calculate urself,btohqsg
like ppl do better for h2 sci?,btohqsg
No i meant ppl tend to do better in their h2s relative to h1s,btohqsg
and h1 lesson time lesser also,btohqsg
yeah but im sadly still in 90rp system,btohqsg
maybe that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt see it as important,btohqsg
I prefer none of the system,btohqsg
I want 3H2 and 1H1 and GP lol  then pw pass/fail,btohqsg
Or even better  make gp pass fail,btohqsg
even better  make all subjects pass/fail,btohqsg
Help‚Ä¶how does that work‚Ä¶everyone will just hv passes,btohqsg
then everyone will have equal chances of getting what they want,btohqsg
this year there was this MI senior who has straight Us,btohqsg
Should‚Äôve gone poly from the start,btohqsg
This one rlly no joke one,btohqsg
someone making a fool of you,btohqsg
But I thought if the subject fail it won‚Äôt be shown on the result slip,btohqsg
So can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs S or U,btohqsg
so he got the unofficial results slip instead,btohqsg
bro he stayed for 5 years i think,btohqsg
wait do I know the guy,btohqsg
ik someone who repeated a year in MI,btohqsg
Ik someone who spent 4 years in ej,btohqsg
And I thought 3 years in ite was bad,btohqsg
Well  it is still pretty bad but...,btohqsg
3 years in ite is normal,btohqsg
It's literally 3 yr hnitec+poly = 6years,btohqsg
ya youre allowed to retain once per level,btohqsg
but some have to do 7,btohqsg
But I thought nitec can go poly if gpa high enuf,btohqsg
So ej also allows one to retain once per level? Or is it that person retain once then come back ej retake,btohqsg
but not twice for the same level,btohqsg
Thst ej recommended him to not take the paper,btohqsg
Wow at least they allowed him to retain once per level,btohqsg
Tgt with students who just skip a levels,btohqsg
‚Äúnah you‚Äôre gonna get cooked just retain‚Äù,btohqsg
I think in Acjc cannot retain twice for J1,btohqsg
Only way of getting 4 years is to retake as J3 after retaining onceNvm after thinking about it I realised it‚Äôs basically retaining once per level,btohqsg
at least for you is shorter,btohqsg
still shorter than going ite then poly,btohqsg
lol I‚Äôm christian but idk why people are like that,btohqsg
it's a pretty stupid method of evangelism,btohqsg
doesn't work in singapore at all,btohqsg
keep telling that to people in my church and outside but they don't seem to be interested in listening üòê,btohqsg
There is result slip and cert  I think everything will still be on result slip  just no cert,btohqsg
I hate both extreme christians and extreme atheists,btohqsg
and extreme of any religion tbh,btohqsg
Today is an extremely unproductive day for me  I just can‚Äôt process anything,btohqsg
as long as they don‚Äôt tell me everything science related is bc of god,btohqsg
do wtv the fuck you want,btohqsg
