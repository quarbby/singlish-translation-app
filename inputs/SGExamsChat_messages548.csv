Hii  just needed advice. I‚Äôm a j1 student currently. I‚Äôm failing chemistry and I‚Äôm not quite sure why. I‚Äôm doing well for my other subjects. For Mid years  I managed to get A for everything but U for chem. So I know I need to spend more time on chemistry but I‚Äôm not sure how. I failed because of my answering techniques and not my content. Are there any tips y‚Äôall have on how I can master the answering techniques in chemistry??,btohqsg
if you're failing based on answering techniques and not content then i suggest you can pick up like your school's exam answer sheets and compare it to your own answers you wrote during the exam and figure out what's the disparity.,btohqsg
That and also like Kuro said  spam consult to ask about how to succinctly answer questions better from your chem teacher,btohqsg
get ready for a 'HOLY SHIT WTF' suicide story on mothership,btohqsg
in all honesty and very frankly  if you get a U  I believe that it has something to do with your content too. Because even if you anyhow write write something just to smoke and fill in the blank  it should be D to S and also those recall kind of questions in MCQ/P1,btohqsg
Okay thank you to those that helped!!,btohqsg
Oi guys  I want to know the transition of chemistry from o level pure Chem to h2 chem,btohqsg
üíÄ ok honestly it is manageable. It‚Äôs kinda fun but like you really have to pay attention.,btohqsg
Um well‚Ä¶ If u have the interest for it I‚Äôm sure ull grasp it easily,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have any interest in it  but chemistry is one of the easiest subject for me.,btohqsg
So I had a thought of taking chemistry in jc,btohqsg
How about u do some research like during ur free time on the topics tested,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong w asking,btohqsg
It‚Äôs always good to start early and plan ahead,btohqsg
Do you want to be the next yishun innova 90 rp legend,btohqsg
Just 70 -80 would be okay for me,btohqsg
Not gonna try hard and burn out,btohqsg
Then why worry so much abt a levels,btohqsg
Not likebyoure aiming for med or law,btohqsg
Where can we can an intro to h2 chem,btohqsg
That's like one of my classmates,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt the h2 chem syallubus has some o level stuff and concepts but just in greater detail?,btohqsg
We must support those of lower ses!!!,btohqsg
Even if my o level mess up something prob just 12,btohqsg
Shld I give up my goal for nyjc and go eunoia or smt,btohqsg

And last 2 years in debate I went to a shit ton of competitions,btohqsg
But mainly non cca bc it's now lame ass public speaking,btohqsg
Serious Face  everyone like annoyed lmao even mp,btohqsg
