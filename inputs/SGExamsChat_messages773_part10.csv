Japanese air craft carriers in ww2 are the epitome of desperation,btohqsg

They were so desperate they took river boats and installed larged metal plates on the roofs of them to become aircraft carriers.When planes left  they were never expected to return,btohqsg

i mean the average missle is 100kilotons of explosive yield giving about less than 0.50 miles of fireball damage..tbh so maybe it not as bad..if its struck in other countries.But if it was singapore half of the country will be affected,btohqsg
