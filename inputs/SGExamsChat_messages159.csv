as long as u dont fuck up,btohqsg
getting banned left right centre for no reason smh my head,btohqsg
Hi guys  erm I’m not sure if it’s a stupid qn or not ah... if I just chose to practice my TYS only for English  will I be able to get at least B3? Cuz i don’t think there’s much time to practice other schs alrd...,btohqsg
ez game pushes up ur language skills as an entirety,btohqsg
i forgot editing was a thing lmao,btohqsg
editing irc takes 3 mins to complete,btohqsg
one day u can finish one whole book de,btohqsg
then u go into exams like a piece of cake,btohqsg
i don't even rmb ever finishing a book of editing,btohqsg
this is why u came to mi,btohqsg
hey eng was my best subject ok,btohqsg
i heard examiners in o level when marking english mark super leniently and very generous?,btohqsg
like can easily get 30/40 for essay,btohqsg
we will never know the marks,btohqsg
to my defence  you probably studied more for it,btohqsg
is it after a word that is plural the next word cannot be plural too?,btohqsg
if I studied properly I wouldn't have went to MI ;),btohqsg
but u did so nice to meet u,btohqsg
honestly for editing I just go for what makes the most sense,btohqsg
can u remove milo off ur name,btohqsg
No use thinking about rules and shit,btohqsg
sacrificing the time i can use to study history for u bro be honoured,btohqsg
Cause there are so many exceptions to rules in english,btohqsg
No use thinking about SGexams rules as well,btohqsg
wow i'm worth more than your study time for history??,btohqsg
anyone here usually failed math but o level passed?,btohqsg
idk how i got b3 for science,btohqsg
i gave up on both exams,btohqsg
same i failed my lc smh,btohqsg
see how bad my eng is smh,btohqsg
Ya possible. Just make sure your language accuracy is there  and content relevant  will do,btohqsg
note that when u integrate f’(x) into f(x) c is integrated to form cx and a new arbitrary constant shld also be added,btohqsg
When you got c right c is constant mah,btohqsg
You integrate again you get cx and another constant,btohqsg
Integrate that you will get the something x and plus 'c' which becomes d,btohqsg
hi just wna ask for elective history is it ok to just memorise content based on the syllabus,btohqsg
ik yall will say just be safe and study all but im rly q pressed for time LOL,btohqsg
Anyone here taking NA A maths tmr?,btohqsg
Left one week to o level,btohqsg
Should i just memorise the format and stuff,btohqsg
Like legit no time alr lmao,btohqsg
^ is it even playable lmao,btohqsg
Paper 1. Letter  Report format etc.,btohqsg
(don't be like me English E8  last resort ITE),btohqsg
huh? how english E8. isn't english impossible to fail as oral can pull you up too?,btohqsg
oral easy get distinction if i felt i said well?,btohqsg
Paper 1 probably. I'm more surprised that I didn't get f9 lolll,btohqsg
“if i felt i said well”,btohqsg
u wont be getting a distinction with that,btohqsg
ok so within this week i should spam editing  read the model answers for paper 1 email and just memorise some good vocab along with format for email?,btohqsg
is this enough for a b3 or should i do more,btohqsg
What's your average grade for English?,btohqsg
average grade from young till now would be a b4,btohqsg
thanks sm  have a nice day,btohqsg
Never in my life english i see get 70mark before one,btohqsg
SameThe only time I got see 70% and above is spelling test😂,btohqsg
but o level possible to get 65>?,btohqsg
But i flunked my oral lmfao,btohqsg
if u rlly no choice u choose either cold war / sec 3 work,btohqsg
must study the source based case studies topic tho,btohqsg
its ok u can do ittt,btohqsg
Isit true if do e math tys finish,btohqsg
Depends on how well u do the tys,btohqsg
Like tys i completed at least 3-4,btohqsg
Other school paper at least 5,btohqsg
shld be fine alrdy cos the quantity doesnt determine anything its just whether u understand what the qn is asking for🙃,btohqsg
Bell curve doesnt exist  only moderation,btohqsg
Anybody here know how to study for combined history,btohqsg
Bellcurve has a fixed percentage of each grade then will adjust the grade boundaries according to this. Moderation will just adjust the grade boundary to whatever they like it to be,btohqsg
Hi may I ask is it$348 + $50,btohqsg
Can someone ans my qns :’),btohqsg
its 348 minus 50 divide by 2 plus 50,btohqsg
no pm someone else I q busy now HAHA,btohqsg
wait for someone to help u here,btohqsg
idk how to explain in pri sch terms,btohqsg
If I give someone x dollars  the difference between our money changes by 2x dollars,btohqsg
if kelly gives 348+50 which is 398 sandy will have 398+50 more than kelly,btohqsg
U have been a great help,btohqsg
if u stfu i will give u 398,btohqsg
so its 1 unit plus 1 unit plus 50 = 398,btohqsg
try to give arnd 3 details then u explain the details,btohqsg
how it develops into end of ww2 for eg,btohqsg
e.g. like for end of ww2 in japan if u talk abt,btohqsg
u can give example of the battle of the coral sea   the aerial bombing of major cities & the,btohqsg
fact that the pearl harbour attack did not completely destroy us naval,btohqsg
then u explain  why does this allow US to win against the war  and result in jap’s defeat in ww2,btohqsg
Where did u get this information,btohqsg
Hey does anyone have emath 2020 papers ? Looking for some to give my younger brother for his time practice 🙂 because he has finished the holy grail2017-2019papers for emath already,btohqsg
which is basically a more chim way of saying bell curve,btohqsg
Huh? No what. Bell curve benefits and disadvantages people differently by forcing a distribution. Moderation benefits or hurts all equally.,btohqsg
Nah  not bad. Appreciate that you can see it now haha,btohqsg
usually moderation is too allow those borderline fail to pass and also prevent too many people from getting a1,btohqsg
so like 45% for e math can pass already,btohqsg
if there are 1000+ A1s 1000+ people will get into btr schs,btohqsg
every sch is a good sch🤡,btohqsg
then the other not as good schs uh,btohqsg
like the ones that are of higher standards HAHA,btohqsg
Not really all school is a good school,btohqsg
Like one of the school got serious cases of bullying,btohqsg
And then the teachers never do anything,btohqsg
thats what moe is trying to tell everyone,btohqsg
i still got a B3 so i wont complain but,btohqsg
if your stupid moderation is your best friend  if your super smart moderation is your enemy,btohqsg
i forgot thr were ppl who didnt suck at chinese,btohqsg
dont tell me u got B3 too,btohqsg
i feel bad enough abt it,btohqsg
actl idc tho bcs im not using for r5,btohqsg
im using as my r5 subject but i wna go poly so doesnt rlly matter,btohqsg
but u still decided to retake?,btohqsg
all subjs are fun except eng🥰,btohqsg
i wldnt mind if eng just disappears forever🥰,btohqsg
omg yes im still panicking thinking abt my future if i failed eng.,btohqsg
u wna go poly too right?,btohqsg
Nah I'm N level but I learnt alot of the o level geog stuff,btohqsg
Just not food resources cause I was lazy,btohqsg
yall learn plate tech if im not wrong,btohqsg
but ik they learn plate tech,btohqsg
they had an essay qn on plate tech,btohqsg
"""does volcanoes only form at diverging plates"" or smth idk",btohqsg
i think nlevel geog elect is just plate tech gateway 1 and 2,btohqsg
and wc thr was stuff on kyoto,btohqsg
i think so  but no food,btohqsg
case studies that come after gateway 3,btohqsg
Yeah we do it's just most of the people don't rmb and doesn't come out,btohqsg
I don't even think they asked for pyroclastic flow and lahars,btohqsg
But all have a general sense in saving the earth's climate,btohqsg
why is human geog even a thing  things inside are like common sense,btohqsg
just revise physical geog and at bare minimum you'll get a b4,btohqsg
I still got E8 for combined humans,btohqsg
i just hope they don't set questions like bearings,btohqsg
havent seen it since lower sec,btohqsg
i hated it so much its so useless,btohqsg
food egs still must memo haha,btohqsg
now that they removed the content heavy part,btohqsg
green revolution   green like the emoji 🤢,btohqsg
i never memorised examples but still pass la but 5,btohqsg
huh rly i rely on my examples to get full mark,btohqsg
tbh i only memo examples lol,btohqsg
i nvr got higher than 6 in my life,btohqsg
even practices whr i copy notes,btohqsg
tbh thr is a standard way to get full for essay,btohqsg
It's pretty easy if you list down examples  have an opinion and give 3 points,btohqsg
i think its ur weighing thats off then,btohqsg
I mean N level max is 6,btohqsg
Idk how much o level is though,btohqsg
i cant even read his name,btohqsg
If Im not wrong it should be elaboration of your points,btohqsg
lol my teacher once took off one mark from my essay bcs i never write the currency name,btohqsg
Tip for geo don’t bother memorising essays,btohqsg
I think only one example is from the textbook  wtf.,btohqsg
Cause there’s over 80+ essays that can be tested,btohqsg
For N levels they were asking abt mountains and I thought abt block mountains but I didn't know they were referring to all types of mountains so I didn't write that,btohqsg
Actually no I retract my statement I can't read it without getting a headache,btohqsg
i cant read a single word  i think i have dyslexia 😭,btohqsg
It’s okay at least they got a lot coreectttt,btohqsg
The real question is how did the marker mark it?,btohqsg
honestly his teacher marked really leniently,btohqsg
Why not get tested then? You might be able to get extra time and all that.,btohqsg
Nah I can't read it too,btohqsg
I only could read the bottom part,btohqsg
sorry what did you say  i can't read,btohqsg
a handwriting class might be more useful for@chemcer,btohqsg
What a great way to pick someone up lol,btohqsg
Okok back to exam stuff haha,btohqsg
When is o level written anyways,btohqsg
Next mon is emath paper 1,btohqsg
or js chop off the hands,btohqsg
is that your dinner for today,btohqsg
Ah so you guys start when we end alright,btohqsg
u guys aove when k die die,btohqsg
how well would you like it,btohqsg
anyone here giving up their other subjects to focus on those subjects u using in elr2b2 instead?,btohqsg
i gave up on my subjects,btohqsg
I gave up o levels back in my day,btohqsg
but on a more serious note  it's a last resort option,btohqsg
im giving up on combined (bio/chem) unless i can be convinced i can get a c6 within 2 week,btohqsg
I got a D7 for chinese,btohqsg
so like yknow  I didn't really bother with that much,btohqsg
scored decent points for my L1R5 in the end,btohqsg
I'd recommend studying less  but not giving up on it totally,btohqsg
focus on the easier topics that can get u marks,btohqsg
Still better than most of my ldq. :(,btohqsg
Best 3 subjs can choose right,btohqsg
why tis yupi bears packet talking to me,btohqsg
But you gotta choose whether group 1 or group 2 if you are applying for pfp,btohqsg
tbh i heard pfp isnt offered across every course right,btohqsg
chinese take alr so i only hv 5 subjs to bother abt,btohqsg
the last subj is a backup,btohqsg
I don't get how people even do Chinese lol,btohqsg
what course r u aiming to go into?,btohqsg
Tbh i see it as a lack of practice in the language,btohqsg
Have been failing for 8 years,btohqsg
Just wondering what’s y’alls l1r5 score,btohqsg
And also how comfortable we’re with english,btohqsg
My parents speak but I reply in english,btohqsg
Ive noticed it in my lil cousin,btohqsg
back when 9 meant anderson jc,btohqsg
how do ppl l1r5 single digit,btohqsg
its the first time i got a score less than 20,btohqsg
They redo tys more than 3 times,btohqsg
but i want l1r4 single digit,btohqsg
find one person to study with,btohqsg
Idk don’t ask me a lot of ppl in my class score 5,btohqsg
im not even done with tys,btohqsg
That's what I see for pure science students,btohqsg
If only I had a subject to replace Chinese. :(,btohqsg
But tbh i regret not studying la,btohqsg
having one person to study with really helped me,btohqsg
in JC I didn't have a stable study partner,btohqsg
And tys for most subjects we finish 2 months ago,btohqsg
I cant even l1r4 single digit,btohqsg
I have been planning to go sec 5,btohqsg
The course i want is like 11 cutoff,btohqsg
Got my dsa offer yet they forced me to retake. :/,btohqsg
In fact I may even go poly 😂,btohqsg
Go to sec 5  it's actually the best year.,btohqsg
But in all honesty i found a course i like with cutoff 26 so im not that screwed,btohqsg
I heard its a big jump frm sec 4..?,btohqsg
I have been doing your o levels tys,btohqsg
Most people N levels are over,btohqsg
Doing my first question of first chem paper rn,btohqsg
Just that the people taking coursework is their exam this week,btohqsg
Honestly quite cancerous doing coursework for one more year,btohqsg
EAE choice; marine engineeringended up studying business,btohqsg
Yeah  sec 5 is honestly the best decision made.,btohqsg
I mean there are honestly alot of different opinions,btohqsg
hard to know what u wanna do in sec sch,btohqsg
but then again ur future career is not that dependent on ur qualifications,btohqsg
Didn't you take o levels alr,btohqsg
Wtf since u live near me send the braincells over pls 🤩🤩🤩,btohqsg
I started spamming tys when I was in 3na,btohqsg
Why is everyone in this area so smart then theres me,btohqsg
banking and finance  looking into compliance ops,btohqsg
She nvr said when mAh so I just plot myself in,btohqsg
So 6 months of no social life led that 6 points,btohqsg
cuz ppl are only willing to share success,btohqsg
uwu I almost failed o levels,btohqsg
Im the only one who shares my failures,btohqsg
I guess it's still worth it,btohqsg
I scored A1 for every subject except Chinese  didn't sacrifice much of my social life.,btohqsg
How much was your N level results,btohqsg
Mine was 8 for emb3 then l1r5 6 HAHAH,btohqsg
No need to sacrifice something important to you for good grades.,btohqsg
But can i ask a qn,btohqsg
If only I gotten 5 I could have gone to bms,btohqsg
Why do yall find it funny that you cant speak your own mother tongue?,btohqsg
As long as you can manage your time  you don't need worry about sacrificing your social life.,btohqsg
Yea but I no social life back then,btohqsg
What happens if you want to take JC but you only have 5 subjects and take clb?,btohqsg
cos not everyone is good at it my dude,btohqsg
hi guys i hope i do ok for h2 chem  im getting promos results tmr,btohqsg
It brings shame According to my parents,btohqsg
Alternatively  drop out and sign as a private candidate.,btohqsg
You won't be able to go jc ..,btohqsg
Like they say shit like your a chinese,btohqsg
Ye my parents say those who are Chinese and can't speak Chinese brings shame,btohqsg
And you can't even speak chinese,btohqsg
i mean post sec anywhere got stress la lol,btohqsg
Even malay ppl can speak better or some shit,btohqsg
It is what it is  you drop out from secondary school and register as a private candidate.,btohqsg
tbh I wish yall happy memories,btohqsg
That's if you want to go to jc.,btohqsg
Wait till u go uni chem,btohqsg
yay yall are so nice haha,btohqsg
regardless of the results u get,btohqsg
the attitude u have at work,btohqsg
I mean  personally i speak mandarin at home l,btohqsg
is what determines ur career prospects,btohqsg
I've never seen a private candidate who has done better than they have for their school's exams,btohqsg
its the hardest h2 subject lol,btohqsg
My parents find clips on Facebook of foreigners speaking Chinese and comparing them to me,btohqsg
a degree or diploma is just a starting point,btohqsg
just to get to the door,btohqsg
Chemistry will be hard in jc though,btohqsg
i thgt this was econs at first glance,btohqsg
Have u tried to pick up mandarin tho,btohqsg
It's like trying to say you are a English blood person who doesn't know how to speak  English,btohqsg
h2 math and h2 bio easier,btohqsg
Nah is the easiest for me  hardest shld be h1 gp,btohqsg
Cause I never learn organic chem,btohqsg
jc was probs the most fulfilling time I can remember,btohqsg
I assume you don’t take FMaths,btohqsg
Well its easy so im enjoying,btohqsg
Nah not really they just happen to get the clips really often,btohqsg
Bell curve in uni not fun HAHA,btohqsg
Unless every1 doesnt do well for exams,btohqsg
30/80 for an A grade for a mod,btohqsg
The Vietnam scholars in my class are very smart though,btohqsg
and serve to remind u of a time when u could in a way  do the impossible,btohqsg
if u remember the hours and dedication u put into ur craft in that period,btohqsg
honestly im considering taking h3 bio,btohqsg
it's something to be v proud of,btohqsg
But a lot of ppl die-ded,btohqsg
i feel its more of passion than anything else  i personally enjoy bi,btohqsg
How do you enjoy bio without enjoying chemistry,btohqsg
Yes bio has a bit of chem,btohqsg
My fren took some life sci modTheres pka pkb knowledge,btohqsg
I just said I hated physics,btohqsg
When in poly or JC  bio has a lot of chemistry😏,btohqsg
and never wanted to touch engineering,btohqsg
Nvr expect the uno reverse card to play on me in uni,btohqsg
Final stage of studying life:Meets physics,btohqsg
Ppl who say is easier than jc are closet muggers,btohqsg
But it also depends on the cohort performance,btohqsg
But the score range between the top 15% of the cohort and the next 85% is very bigEg. Ppl who scored 30/80 gettin A  but ppl who scored 55/80 also ended up with an A too.,btohqsg
Any one can explain simple cell of electrolysis chapter? Thanks.,btohqsg
2 electrodes made from different metals in solutions containing the respective metal cations  and wires from electrodes with voltmeter in between,btohqsg
More reactive metal electrode oxidises and hence is the anode. The other is the cathode. Electrons flow from anode to cathode. Voltmeter registers a reading.,btohqsg
I dont understand why hydrogen ions accept electrons to form hydrogen,btohqsg
I thought copper is less reactive than hydrogen,btohqsg
Copper won’t oxidise because zinc  being more reactive than copper  oxidises instead,btohqsg
Hence copper electrode is the cathode,btohqsg
Metals can’t be reduced. So copper remains intact,btohqsg
U might wanna look at the d orbital,btohqsg
Hmm I don’t think this is A levels,btohqsg
This one just swallow it for now. I ask my teacher the same qn when I was sec 3,btohqsg
One person msg can't get thru,btohqsg
There’s no copper ions in the electrolyte,btohqsg
It's actually magical cos it can be used as a noun  a verb  a pronoun  an adjective ...,btohqsg
H is negative in this case,btohqsg
? I said metals can’t be reduced,btohqsg
H is negative if it’s metal hydride,btohqsg
They should ask the teacher can hydrogen be both cation and anion,btohqsg
Just look at relative ease of discharge table,btohqsg
And ask yourself what ions are present at the electrodes,btohqsg
And look at whether it's electrolytic cell or...,btohqsg
In the example you stated  hydrogen ions and zinc ions are present at the cathode  hydrogen ions will be reduced since on the relative ease of discharge series H+ is lower than Zn2+  so H+ is preferentially reduced.,btohqsg
As simple as that  no need to complicate things further.,btohqsg
So if you were confused by 2 ppl above  hopefully this sums it up succintly,btohqsg
I figured there were misconceptions so hence i explained,btohqsg
I saw 'metals can't be reduced' i got triggered alr,btohqsg
Enjoy ur studies before u go out and work ur lungs out,btohqsg
But considerin u are quite smart,btohqsg
I wish I m in hawaii,btohqsg
U will be the bell curve wrecker,btohqsg
So i can see why u made that comment,btohqsg
Okay you tell me how metals are reduced to anions :),btohqsg
Thanks. I understand now. Can you give any more example of this for more clear understanding.,btohqsg
U nvr know  it may be possible :)Source: Uni,btohqsg
I think pure chem textbook quite good alr,btohqsg
When u throw the metal into the sun,btohqsg
It gets reduced so fast it vaporized,btohqsg
But yes metals cant be reduced.. under normal conditions,btohqsg
I thought it just vaporise haha,btohqsg
Reduction from the hydrogen in sun issit,btohqsg
Actually  what is the core of the sun made of ah,btohqsg
This remind me of that time I laugh until I drew my sister out of the window,btohqsg
Yup. Nuclear fusion stops at iron,btohqsg
Why won't the iron vaporise ah,btohqsg
Hydrogen to helium all the way till iron,btohqsg
