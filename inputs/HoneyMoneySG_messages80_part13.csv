Third one is spend S$1 n get 23mpd? Are you giving up this promo? üòÆ,btohqsg
what do you mean spend S$1 and get 23mpd? ü§î the third criteria is S$1000 in foreign currency qualifying spend which I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt hit,btohqsg
Mean you spend S$1000 in fx currency  n get 23 000 miles.Perhaps book next year oversea holiday in advance? Or buy handphone in JB?,btohqsg
Ahhh ok got it! Yeap will definitely try to clock this $1000 foreign currency spend ü§£ but in case I don‚Äôt  I‚Äôll still receive the first two tranches right?,btohqsg
What are the new account promos you all are eyeing? Need to 'shift money' next month as my HSBC EGA bonus interest promotion period will be up end of Dec,btohqsg

Any advice on how to redeem Cashback on Citi Cash Back ? Can't find the option on the app,btohqsg
Dear all experts  does anyone ever top up EZ-Link master card before? Which cc is useful to top up? I am thinking of cimb or hsbc (although I seldom use this card)My main spending are UOB One Account,btohqsg
Which cc to get for retiree with no fee charge,btohqsg
Ezlink considered at Wallet top up and excluded.,btohqsg
I see.. wow. Seems many cc also excluded this kind of top up,btohqsg
Unless you're topping up concession cards for senior or child  there is absolutely no benefit in topping up ezlink.,btohqsg
Money top up to EZ-Link master card wallet cannot be used on AXS and SAM. Better think twice before topping up it. Only for shopping n spending.,btohqsg
Hi  any money changer recommendations for SGD to YEN? I want to hold cash so not looking for digital wallet . Thx üôè,btohqsg
How much are you looking to change?,btohqsg
Hi good day guru. I have tried to search and only saying HSBC account with giro to get 1%,btohqsg
Some cards under maybank  they recently nerfed the cashback one so less attractive,btohqsg
May I know for the HSBC IRAS giro form postage free . I don‚Äôt have to put any stamp just drop in at the pos box am I right ?,btohqsg
Lol.. if you are using the iras master form is there any pre postage,btohqsg
If yes u don‚Äôt have to pay. If no  there goes your answer .,btohqsg

Hey y'all  heading to Japan to get some big ticket items. Need some tips - is it better to convert sgd to yen and store in currency wallet  or pay via instarem + citirewards? Let's say the purchase is 3k+.Thanks!,btohqsg
Thanks for advice. I will stop chasing them. Believe there will be another fintech coming soon and have a better service than ichange. Lets wait.,btohqsg
i have maxed out evol  ocbc. what other cc good to use for spending?,btohqsg
Yes  except normal exclusions like insurance  utilities  education etc,btohqsg
Does 10X citi rewards card paired with amaze work for online attraction purchases? (Gardens by the bays ticket),btohqsg
I get this from the dbs live fresh. Why is favepay and shopeepay considered as  excluded transaction ?,btohqsg
DBS excluded Fave long time ago,btohqsg
Oh  and shopee too? Then very hard to meet the online spending to clock for dbs live fresh,btohqsg
Not Shopee. It says top-up Shopeepay is excluded. You can buy things from Shopee and pay with your DBS Live Fresh.,btohqsg
OK. So just have to remember fave is excluded from dbs live fresh. So weird  is counted for evol but not for dbs live fresh,btohqsg
Different cards la  same like amaze excluded for wmmc but not crmc.* they are not charity organisations after all,btohqsg
if the mcc fits your lady's solitaire cat you can consider pairing that with amaze for 6mpd,btohqsg
Ah i have to change categories  but yea gr8 idea. So it's generally more efficient to earn points via CC + Amaze than changing and paying with wallet cash yea?,btohqsg
well efficiency would be subjective and based on your value of a mile - since transacting via amaze+cc is essentially buying miles (cheaply)personally if I can get 4-6 mpd via amaze  I'll pick it over youtrip/revolut/cash,btohqsg
ah true  yea i thought it would be more worth it too compared to cash  but was afraid the charges might make it moot. gotta check on the limit for citi rewards to see what's it. But thanks!,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been holding the Trust credit card since the application is the easiest and Fairprice groceries are my main spend.UOB EVOL is next option if you can make 3 monthly minimum online or mobile payment to avoid the annual fee.,btohqsg
Uob evol need any min amt spend to avoid the annual fee? What if not met...how much is the anuual fee? TKs..,btohqsg
You need the minimum $600 spend to get cashback and perks but you just need to incur 3 monthly spending to get auto-waiver for annual fee.,btohqsg
"Hi everyone  may I ask if funds transferred from OA to SA will be considered ""reserved""? likewise will the interest earned from the SA account in general be considered ""reserved"" and unable to use for SA shielding  because I understand that RSTU to SA is reserved and cant be use for shielding and hence would like to avoid that. Thanks!",btohqsg
1) OA to SA funds not considered reserved.2) Int from RSTU of funds to SA is also part of reserved.You can check in the web portal when u login. There is a hyperlinlk for reserved funds under the 3 acc summary,btohqsg
hmm is it this page because not sure why mine doesnt show :(,btohqsg
If my citi rewards + Amaze hit 1k spending overseas liao  should I swap to Youtrip?,btohqsg
yes if $1k is in statement month,btohqsg
"Click on the ""i"" above special account",btohqsg
see whether your nxt statement cycle will  be in your remaining trip,btohqsg
Say my statement comes on 14 DecSo the 1k limit is from 14 Dec to 13 Jan isit?,btohqsg
Yup. Got promotion: grocery spend $30 get $5 cashback,btohqsg
