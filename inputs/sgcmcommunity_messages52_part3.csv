I got see double decker bus doing 20 point turn near SMU today,btohqsg
Meant to turn right after the Lazada office  bus driver wnet straight onto fort canning road instead,btohqsg
His underwear must be very wet üòÖShag,btohqsg
Will try to find a video of it if I can,btohqsg
Are we allowed to post sgrv videos here?,btohqsg
https://fb.watch/et2604oZ8p/Wanted to get an opinion on this. Everyone seems divided on how roundabouts work.,btohqsg
So ignore the rules or teachings on 3 lane roundabouts  just focus on 2 lane rounadbouts.Can you exit from the inner lane or not?,btohqsg
Yes i've seen this and other infographics on facebook,btohqsg
if B is allowed to exit 12 o'clock  what if there is Car C  entering the roundabout from 9 o'clock and exiting 3 o'clock?,btohqsg
HAHA this is a very good question,btohqsg
u know how this can be solved,btohqsg
if everybody that wanted to turn signalled...,btohqsg
and checking blindspot when in sit B,btohqsg
Electric cars make up 9% of new cars sold in first half of yearhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/electric-cars-make-up-9-of-new-cars-sold-in-first-half-of-year,btohqsg
keep to lane A only if you are turninf in the next exit,btohqsg
According to the picture  A takes outside lane and is allowed take 2nd exit.So Car C is also allowed to enter and take the outside lane from 9 o'clock end exit 3 o'clock (2nd exit),btohqsg
Actually roundabouts are safer than controlled junction cos they forces drivers to slow down...but from experience I see not many drivers know how to maneuver in a roundabout...heck I even see some speeding in it *facepalm*,btohqsg
Even if signal  there is still accidents happening. If everyone exits from the outside lane then the chances are much lower,btohqsg
A pity that even Newton circus roundabout turned into controlled junction,btohqsg
Have to apply the basics lane switching...and also patience and give way to these motorists..but I guess in SG it's hard,btohqsg
Both in the wrong according to me,btohqsg
Just rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise,btohqsg
Singapore drivers  when see someone signals  it means the driver need to speed up before the car that signals cut into his lane,btohqsg
But yeah white more so than the taxi,btohqsg
Mr Road hogger! I went and looked at the Tesla model Y today,btohqsg
So u decided to buy model y and tesla share,btohqsg
Ok so in the video the white lexus is Car A  by law or by FTT  he supposed to exit by the 2nd exit.In this scenario  the taxi can argue that they both entered from same entrance so the lexus must exit and therefore he can exit from inner laneBy my question is not about who is wrong. My question is why can you exit from inner lane?,btohqsg
The taxi should've switched lane early and exit but lol I see this is how most drivers do,btohqsg
How come u think no good ?,btohqsg
I still prefer to get a GLB35 or xc60 for that price,btohqsg
YES THIS! why people dont follow this?? No second guessing  no confusion  no accidents.,btohqsg
But the quality has definitely improved with the model Y with regards to panel gaps,btohqsg
They just exit from inner lane and horn the leftie if the latter tries to stay in the round instead of exiting,btohqsg
singapore driving sch cant even teach properly honestly,btohqsg
A roundabout will always be faster than a traffic light,btohqsg
Interior still has some ways to go  still can press panels and hear rattles and cracking like those Mercedes c class panels,btohqsg
That's why roundabouts are supposed to be safer than controlled junction,btohqsg
Oh ok   ice car don‚Äôt left long liao,btohqsg
Keep seeing the comments  go back to driving school  do u even know the rules blah blah blah.These people are either not drivers or are sitting ducks  waiting for accidents to happen,btohqsg
The school follows the law. The law might not be the most efficient,btohqsg
real world situation drive at 40kmh one mehüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Newton circus in the past always jam cos difficult to enter due to many vehicles doesn't slow down in the roundabout  doesn't give way  and some not confident to enter the roundabout,btohqsg
I applaud your effort to try to explain it and more.So B can exit 12 o'clock from inner lane. And C can exit 3 o'clock from outer lane.Then if bang  who's fault?,btohqsg
Got a simulation app or website in SG context to check the share of fault but forgot what it is,btohqsg
Then they shouldn't throw the law or rules up there if they knew anything about good driving,btohqsg
u talking abt the fb comments ah,btohqsg
most of them all eat shit nth btr to do oneüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
