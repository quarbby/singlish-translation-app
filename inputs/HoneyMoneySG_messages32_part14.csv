Hi! Anyone using both cashback and miles credit cards at same time? If yes  which ones would you recommend? I have a citibank cashback credit card (mainly for food/groceries) and would like to get a miles cc for all the other expanses. Thanks!,btohqsg
Get a Citi Rewards card and pair with Amaze,btohqsg
Now have to check whether your type of transactions have fee or not 🌚,btohqsg
Tonight I will talk about the new instarem fees,btohqsg
but feel like no point to use it for sgd transaction already  still have to risk to kena 2% fee,btohqsg
So which is better? Amex highflyer or UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
Any tips for ocbc cards application? They reject without considering despite being their customer for 13 years and crediting salary. I'm applying for basic card like ocbc 365,btohqsg
not really  the fees still dont impact the main use case for people using it in SGD.It oly meant to convert offline to online for CRMC.no one will use amaze to topup e-wallet,btohqsg
i think people need to understand why people using amaze locally  it mainly use for CRMC trick.Go oversea still can use but you also wont be topping up any e-wallet.,btohqsg
Can get free cash advance by topping up grabpay and withdrawing,btohqsg
mostly to close this loophole. if people are abusing it.,btohqsg
what is the CRMC stands for? but i think it is quite rare to find a company to charge you additional fee on doing certain categories of transaction. they usually just remove the cashback or rewards only,btohqsg
Citi reward mastercard  they already dont reward anything in the first place but let A A mention it meant to close loophole for cash advance as amaze wallet deposit into Grab Walelt can be withdraw to bank account,btohqsg
yea  i believe is to close the loophole. hopefully it doesnt extend to more type of transation,btohqsg
people are mainly using it for thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GOO9ngIm84,btohqsg
as CRMC + amaze make it a general card,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer easier to useAmex highflyer if you already own a biz sure can combined with grab card to use,btohqsg
So the HSBC revolution should be a better choice,btohqsg
Wise debit card does this as well,btohqsg
OCBC 4.18% p.a. for Premier  4.08% for normalIf you have >$350K for placement can sign up for Premier referral here:OCBC Premier/Private Bankinghttps://hmsg.link/ocbcbank,btohqsg
Good day  May I know I have CIMB account already but never apply CIMB credit card  can I use this promotion code to apply CIMB CC?,btohqsg
Any good fixed deposit or similar schemes going on right now?,btohqsg
Seems like rhb  cimb the rates have been nerfed,btohqsg
And the highest is ocbc 4.08,btohqsg
whichever that is giving a 4% right now is considered really good.,btohqsg
anyone get positive return using endowus for investment so far？,btohqsg
Can you earn cashback from topping up ur grab pay with AmexTCB and then paynow the grabpay balance to ur bank account?,btohqsg
No. Credit card topups are non transferrable balance in Grab,btohqsg
Oh ic thank u  for clarifying,btohqsg
Anyone has any smart way to earn from shopee top up?,btohqsg
Their credit cards has a 2% surcharge,btohqsg
actually that means we shouldnt top up TnG using amaze..should use youtrip to top up then?,btohqsg
Ocbc titanium give 10x when buying Shopback vouchers?,btohqsg
TnG is a MYR wallet  not SGD,btohqsg
hmm but anyway no reward for topping up  if spread is better for youtrip then i guess should use youtrip,btohqsg
After viewing this video can’t help but to worry the days of master cards using amaze as proxy is nearing an end.,btohqsg
mcc varies. but doubt will be under the whitelist for 10x points,btohqsg

May I know if singaporean can apply for a Malaysian credit or debit card in Malaysia?,btohqsg
think you beat temasik already lol,btohqsg
Can we link OCBC titanium with amaze to earn the 4mpd? Just curious why CRMC and DBS Women’s world card is often highlighted and not this titanium card?,btohqsg
I am researching which card to use to buy a MacBook Pro …. CRMC and revolution 10x point is only up to the first 1k while women’s world card is up to the first 2k  in a month. Titanium is up to $12k per year. If I am not wrong  all of 3 cards rewards compute to 4 mpd. Any experts here can comment if my analysis is correct?,btohqsg
ocbc titanium only give 4mpd for some specific MCCs,btohqsg
