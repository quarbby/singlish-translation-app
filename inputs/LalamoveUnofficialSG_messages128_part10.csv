You refer to car or van?,btohqsg
For van $900-$1000 depend how you work,btohqsg
Anyone do lala using tribecar before? Can cover rent and earn ?,btohqsg
I have tried before. Depends on how long you rent the car. If a few hours only can be quite challenging. I think because considering that I never try stacking of jobs as im still quite new to LLM.Also need to consider the car that you rent. If the car use fuel like water then GG bro.,btohqsg

"I always ask them sign off and write ""no dmg"" below signature",btohqsg
PartTime or what. Just take Photos Of All Angles when Reach DropOff. Before Collection Check also. Kena Ztall no give me the Slip which they Always Attach to the Plastic. Customer say special Request and Stall say got and got receipt Attached. Lucky I take photos then CS say stall fault. If not sure Blame Driver for Fault,btohqsg
Haha been with LLM since September 2017. All their pattern i see already.,btohqsg
Theyâ€™re basically one sided. They all are. When it comes to customer vs driver  the delivery personnel is looked as the suspect to begin with. Gotten very used to this antics. So anything deemed fragile and expensive  always take additional pictures for your own records.,btohqsg
