Btw fr respect to those ppl that have 0 space at home at doing well in poly,btohqsg
yea  btw have you seen TIB 1234 H at depot?,btohqsg
my friend in tm doing bio medical   he said  he has so little space in his house. when his room door closes  it barely scrapes pass his chair he does work on,btohqsg
shared room wiht his siblings  apparently a 3 room apt,btohqsg
nope he does it on a chair or floor,btohqsg
Can leave it there overnight or need keep,btohqsg
Like everytime need use must take out bag then done need put back in,btohqsg
dk  but does not sound conducive at all,btohqsg
oh yea  must take out then keep again,btohqsg
Yeah then not good unless he can leave laptop and do that all day without anyone complaining,btohqsg
Fr need figure out how tf they get sht done,btohqsg
im tryna get sht together but no motivation,btohqsg
If i had a gf or some sht rn  i wouldn't even be at home bruh,btohqsg
the way he described  sounds like it look like this,btohqsg
I got a friend in biomed in tm right now  I can ask him,btohqsg
Wah u going for eae ah?,btohqsg
gais  i have one qn: how much does a poly course affect ur chances at a uni major (disregarding GPA),btohqsg
Dont come here unless you have willpower to study and get what you want,btohqsg
(MI alumni that did not have the willpower),btohqsg
I alr feel the urge to start clubbing and to waste my life away,btohqsg
The only club you should be going,btohqsg
Is go home and study club,btohqsg
I went from one shithole to another,btohqsg
I wouldnt call my experience in MI that horrible but ok yeah maybe sometimes it felt like a shit hole,btohqsg
Im only half a year in and i alr feel some of the teachers arent even qualified to teach us,btohqsg
And the students there oh my 天,btohqsg
Oh students are hit or miss,btohqsg
I think most of the qualified teachers left MI as soon as i graduated lmao,btohqsg
Theres only one sane person in my class,btohqsg
Assuming it fails under the relevant diploma list and the same co-curricular positions and activities with the same awards fuck all.,btohqsg
Also I am 1000% percent sure TP has no Biomedical Science.,btohqsg
I am flattered at your reciprocity,btohqsg
Some degree like med need specific diplomas but if the degree uw in uni doesnt need any specific diploma then i think ur GPA is king followed by the porfolio and ur interview performance,btohqsg
Insn't this biomed or is this new,btohqsg
It literally says Biotechnology right there,btohqsg
That friend I have is in biomedical engineering,btohqsg
Which is different that's in the engineering cluster and doesn't fall under a relevant diploma for admission into local med.,btohqsg
I got friends in both biotech and biomed  idk which one she wants. I'll just ask both lol,btohqsg
Biotechnology is a different thing all tgt and has even lower admission rates to local med.,btohqsg
Oh anyhow just ask and see what they respond,btohqsg
If not I can ask jc friends also,btohqsg
See what they have to say,btohqsg
That falls under the Alevels syllabus which is also again a totally different thing.,btohqsg
Did u managed to obtain your LEAPS 2.0 records?,btohqsg
i emailed my school no reply,btohqsg
Head down to your school directly. If it's within 6 months it's likely your record is sitting on a file or table somewhere.,btohqsg
idts eh it’s been a few yrs 💀,btohqsg
Kinda important for EAE ngl. Did u remember what points u got? Was it -1 or -2,btohqsg
it’s reflected on the o lvl cert right,btohqsg
No... but it should be reflected on the JAE form.,btohqsg
I thought I kenna deja Vu cause I saw this like last week lol,btohqsg
My dad always tell me my news are always delayed🤣,btohqsg
But it just appeared on my ig feed,btohqsg
No wonder cause if you are consuming news on IG reels  that why it's delayed lolz,btohqsg
My mum actually told me of the idea of maybe wearing a helmet to the plane but i still feel it kinda is a bit extra + i will wear my seatbelt anyways unless i use the toilet,btohqsg
I think cap does nth lol,btohqsg
How can a cap shield u when u are thrown to the ceiling,btohqsg
But nothing will protect you from spinal injuries  majority of the ppl injured on that flight experience spinal injuries,btohqsg
At least it does.not cut your head,btohqsg
Yea but i guess it protects fr head injuries (some ppl thrown up and hit the cabin overhead compartment),btohqsg
Yea i do coz im lazy to go to the news outlet app / website,btohqsg
I also lazy to go there's most of my news is from yt lol,btohqsg

I was like why suddenly so hot,btohqsg
Then I realised he just tilt the fan in his direction,btohqsg

Can you go out and suffer under the hot sun for at least 15 mins before eating?,btohqsg
I stand under the hot sun just now,btohqsg
Expanding in scale but not in manpower,btohqsg

Lazada sells the plane for $80,btohqsg
That's quite cheap for an entire plane,btohqsg
Does it come with on board WiFi?,btohqsg
It's a boeing there's no difference,btohqsg
$80 cant even buy a car,btohqsg
Im tempted to buy sq merchandise,btohqsg
But lazada only has the shirt and the plane,btohqsg
So a car is more expensive than a plane these days,btohqsg
like that everyone can buy private jets,btohqsg
Wdym being funny I want my plane for 80 bucks,btohqsg
I would buy if i m working,btohqsg
Why buy the figurine when u can buy the plane for 80 bucks?,btohqsg
But my mum will think im crazy,btohqsg
y r ppl so excited when i enter chat,btohqsg
No i say the $80 is the figurine,btohqsg
Does it come with the plane as well?,btohqsg
Bro got that cute gif again,btohqsg
does it come with 2 towers,btohqsg
Why not it would be a great deal By one figurine get 1 plane,btohqsg
wait till it hits 9 nov,btohqsg

Free NUS Pharmacy Graduate with every purchasewhile stocks last,btohqsg
Found this on the internet  looks nice ngl,btohqsg
I m tempted to get it,btohqsg
But I rather get something like this ngl for the price,btohqsg
Why didn't u just buy that in-flight?,btohqsg
How do u buy a human,btohqsg

Oh i didnt know they hv merchandise in their in-flight  shop,btohqsg
I tot it is always luxuries,btohqsg
Actually i dun think my mum will allow me to buy💀,btohqsg
More than booking a flight just to buy it,btohqsg
?? Who's there to stop you?,btohqsg
So more ex than the flight ticket?,btohqsg
No. Just buy it off the website in retrospect,btohqsg
I mean if you are talking about sq to kl then maybe more ex then plane ticket tbf,btohqsg
Is it cheaper if got ticket?,btohqsg
It's cheaper when bought on flight,btohqsg
So i guess need wait till year end,btohqsg
Coz im not travelling till then lol,btohqsg
U will remember to do so in 1 year meh?,btohqsg
Year end is in few months,btohqsg
Idk if i shld get the plushy or figurine,btohqsg
But i think plushy will be cheaper,btohqsg
The price on Kris Shop reflects the magnitude of the price difference,btohqsg
Wait i cant find the plushy on kris shop,btohqsg
Means it's not a currently stocked item in flight,btohqsg
But im searching kris shop for non travellers tho,btohqsg
Also kris shop is not just in flight lmao,btohqsg
As long as you have a ticket u can collect it with that as duty free,btohqsg
Not a physical store but u can order it online with your ticket and collect for pickup on the day of your flight.,btohqsg
See you can buy humans SIA stewardess for 300 bucks,btohqsg
Limited time offer if u buy the SIA stewardess for 300 bucks u get Ganyu for free,btohqsg

Wdym not a physical store than how to collect,btohqsg

See once u work then you become part of SIA property then we can purchase u,btohqsg

Whoops can't help you in that one,btohqsg
Same last time i flown SQ was 2022,btohqsg
I mean there are pharma companies in Japan but they usually want to hire someone with experience rather than fresh grads,btohqsg
Mine was back in 2019 lmao,btohqsg
Plus I will generally discourage females to work in Japan because the pay is low,btohqsg
I think to some extent Japanese companies in SG,btohqsg
Im looking beyond pharma also  yes pharma companies hv v little openings  maybe coz it is not big,btohqsg
It is reflected in the salry,btohqsg
As well as in terms of promotions,btohqsg
I mean not that as a foreigner you will be promoted to like manager or what,btohqsg
"🌶Too hot to handle?Denmark has recalled Samyang noodles for being too spicy  citing concerns with capsaicin levels and potential ""acute poisoning"".https://cna.asia/3RnnpfgDo you find Samyang noodles too spicy?",btohqsg
No Aespa is the only spicy one,btohqsg
But I feel that there are a lot of like business cultures in a Japanese companies,btohqsg
That is very hard for the foreigners to even understand,btohqsg
I didn't even bother checking mine since my sch lost records,btohqsg
Plus the way promotion happens are different in these two cultures,btohqsg
I was here but just inactive for a pretty long period of time,btohqsg
The guys face is on the mf wall,btohqsg
Someone here also want do the same,btohqsg
but for a totally different reason,btohqsg
Can buy or cannot buy chicken rice?,btohqsg
Dam pein trying to get my fren to grp study,btohqsg
Study alone tend to be more productive for me,btohqsg
Study w friends once in a while is noice,btohqsg
Depends on your studying style and group of friends,btohqsg
If all u gonna do is talk when yall meet that is not the group of friends u do for a study group,btohqsg
cuz I am a certified yapper LMAO,btohqsg
Tiem to admit myself to imh,btohqsg
Btw dont entertain that girl too much the one that want go poly then go med sch,btohqsg
U need a friend that tells u to diam and do your work if u wanna do a sucessful study grp,btohqsg
Doesn't have to be and it's better if they subtly do that,btohqsg
I mean my JC close friends,btohqsg
I don't even entertain u that much,btohqsg
Mugger can still be the talkative type what as long as they switch during study time can liao,btohqsg
Afterwards like dinner or smth talk all u want,btohqsg
I need to force myself to switch by using ypt lol,btohqsg
I 100% cannot be in a study group,btohqsg
U bring me in at a price I tell u to diam,btohqsg
My gpa now cannot even buy ban mian...,btohqsg
Almost anyone trying can get a waffle gpa,btohqsg
Eh i find it harder to concentrate on my own,btohqsg
Can also go off track in a grp,btohqsg
Bruh if you get 1.2 you wouldnt be in ntu anymore,btohqsg
doing work myself is for other people’s sake,btohqsg
i have like 3 hardworking friends,btohqsg
But to pull yourself from 1.2 to 2.0,btohqsg
It's pretty important to find yourself like a uni group of people that you trust to do projects with too.Like the most successful people in school are the ones that go hackathons  case comps with each other  so it's not just about studying. If you are with those people  you will also get motivated in a sorta group-think to be the best.Thats how you get dem 6-8k fresh grad salary tho they do it because they also like it  not just for the money.But yeah having a group of friends that are genuinely passionate  not just hardworking is the key,btohqsg
And i think ys also mention japanese companies the jap culture is there also in foreign countries,btohqsg
That time I intern at japanese company we couldn't whatsapp japanese colleague we needed to email vv sian esp hq,btohqsg
Cb the paint smell strong sia,btohqsg
I mean by right should be like that,btohqsg
Bro its gg cause most of my friends  in sch take h2 phy so its difficult to find ppl to go bio comp with,btohqsg
Nah some other mnc in oil space,btohqsg
Strangely i do get hr whatsapp-ing me for interviews,btohqsg
Yeah only HR and your Direct Supervisor has your WhatsApp,btohqsg

The first one was p good,btohqsg
Why everyone be crying a lot during the how to make millions movie,btohqsg
My friend feels its overrated ah,btohqsg
Can someone ask me about enzymes,btohqsg
Enzymes are biological catalysts that lower the activation energy of a reaction  allowing a more efficient pathway for the reaction to take place. The formation of an enzyme-substrate complex lowers the activation energy. There are 4 ways in which an enzyme-substrate complex lowers activation energy:proximity effect  strain effect  orientation effect and microenvironment effect.There are 2 models of enzymatic action  the lock and key hypothesis and the induced fit hypothesis.,btohqsg
Suggest how does the yellow line come about on the graph? 😄,btohqsg
Ye saw alot on my insta,btohqsg
Been abit of a dry spell?,btohqsg
i feel like its unlikely to be pH,btohqsg
The yellow line reaches the same Vmax as the noncompetitive inhibitor.. could it be lower enzyme concentration ? idk 😭😭,btohqsg
It is something that you never learn before.Green =Competitive inhibitorBlue =Noncompetitive inhibitorYellow = Uncompetitive inhibitor.This kind of inhibitor is quite rare. They have both reduced Kmax and Vmax. How they work is that they only bind after ESC is formed  preventing the release of products.,btohqsg
TM goofy ahh everything including GP on first week of t3,btohqsg
