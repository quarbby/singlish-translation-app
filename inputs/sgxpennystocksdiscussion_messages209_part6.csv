Ooo.. this news i din see it üòÇ,btohqsg
Something to ponder:Here‚Äôs some info from the UK government website:1. The vaccine is not safe for pregnant women or women planning on becoming pregnant within a few months of taking the vaccine2) The vaccine is not safe for those that are immuno suppressed3) No testing has been done to determine any long-term side effects4) No testing has been done to determine side effects if taken with long term medications5) It is unknown if the vaccine will cause infertility6) Taking the vaccine will not stop you spreading the virus but will only reduce your symptoms (for years the doctors told us to rest  take paracetamol and drink plenty of fluids to achieve the same result)7) You can't breastfeed if you have had the vaccine8)The vaccine has not been tested on children and may not be suitable for young persons under the age of 169) The vaccine is only 95% effective....meaning 5% of people that had the vaccine still had severe covid19 symptoms....the demograph and outcome of those 5% of people are being withheld...10) Average age of death of persons in UK over past 10 years - 81years old....Average age of death of persons dying with/from Covid19 in 2020 - 82 years old11) If the mortality rate of 0.3% is unacceptable for covid19 virus....why is 5% now an acceptable rate for vaccine failure?12) If the vaccine is safe....why do the government and manufacturers accept no responsibility for death or injury resulting from the vaccine?now before you say this cant be true all this is on gov website herehttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR2L52Cv7dyCPr9ZNAxw3aH933qaWXBW9Sc0_BGsU7w5TxOqQER0owFxbkI,btohqsg
