Need ÊûóÂ¶àÂ¶à and her ÂêåÂ≠¶‰ª¨ here,btohqsg
because since beginning their prices are already very close  use % gain and they still follow. You still notice at some point of time the gains are different but will quickly go back.,btohqsg
Dreamzu see for MT. only after 19/8 den start to differ abit. and recent few days drop back waiting for SG to catch up (in terms of % gain),btohqsg
market sentiment is horrible for MT  and telegram/SJ talking ourselves down,btohqsg
I think sometimes we underestimate the influence chat in telegram/sj has,btohqsg
Actually not sure why sentiment is bad. A bit uncalled for. Let the results speak for itself in due time. Holding strong,btohqsg
if we believe retailers are outflowing MT  no real surprise when everything is 'end of the medical bull run' and 'its dead until november',btohqsg
holding strong too  but it's perpetuated imo,btohqsg
It's a matter of what price BBs want to maintain MT at,btohqsg
Profit guidance should be preparing now  be patient,btohqsg
It got to pause at some place and wait for next catalyst,btohqsg
Our retailers not strong enough to keep it at 150-160...,btohqsg

Let hopes ..We get some reply soon,btohqsg
