reminds me of my mummy back home sir. growing up I lie on her lap and watch tv while she dig my ear,btohqsg
Aww... Most of us did that when we were kids,btohqsg
Car not necessary in sg la,btohqsg
our mrt system is actually very good,btohqsg
But this  you sure it's drool Mark?,btohqsg
The parking   road tax n insurance,btohqsg
at least... I think so.....? 😅,btohqsg
I don't mind the parking and insurance actually. Road tax just doesn't make sense for me. Coe is to control no of car  tax is to?,btohqsg
after work at end of day I take the train home to joo koon there. very fast.,btohqsg
Cat a and b for small and big cars,btohqsg
Road tax also different for diff cap engines. Small cars usage lesser?,btohqsg
I'm sure there is a proper explanation  just that I can't personally justify it,btohqsg
might be more coz usually they are bread and butter cars?,btohqsg
would it be better if and once they move to satellite based road tax system so people actually pay for what they use?,btohqsg
But road tax is cheaper for smaller cap engines if you refer them to bread and butter cars,btohqsg
do you feel that is a fair system (not that you and I can change anything)?,btohqsg
And more tax for coe cars. Do old cars go on road more?,btohqsg
I say  scrap road tax 😂😂😂,btohqsg
apparently they pollute and break down more?,btohqsg
someone wants us to sell and buy newer cars,btohqsg
along the way  can scrap COE and ERP too pls?,btohqsg
One at a time pls 😂,btohqsg
It's just multiple ways to get money,btohqsg
Coe so that you can own a car,btohqsg
Road tax so that you can go on the road,btohqsg
Insurance so that you pay road tax,btohqsg
then maybe one day I can own a VolVo like kors kors such as Mr Xun here@Jingxunn,btohqsg
after reading all this chats  I am convinced Volvo and Mazda are best cars,btohqsg
I'm quite sure you have a very nice car,btohqsg
like Mr X say  volvo for life,btohqsg
S90 b5 is kinda downgrade from previous t6 and T8 tho,btohqsg
wait.. you even know what engine designation is on the S90?,btohqsg
are you also a VOlvo expert sir like Mr Xun?,btohqsg
I have a good friend called sgcm,btohqsg
give me money last month in a giveaway,btohqsg
hmm it is to a certain extent,btohqsg
He only tempted me to spend money,btohqsg
S90 no T8 if im not wrong,btohqsg
I havent seen b6 yet. Or I'm outdated,btohqsg
its the same  just diff engine,btohqsg
Saw a Malaysian S90 t8 in sg the other day,btohqsg
if u not gg to msia and tiong myvis  B/T5 would be enough,btohqsg
cos im prettt sure dont have sg S90 T8,btohqsg
If money is no problem  wad car to buy to show off?,btohqsg
I am very used to this... sometimes I have female customers who tempt me to spend money but i really just don't have money.  So problem solved!,btohqsg
Sorry to break it to you,btohqsg
I really have no answer to this one sir. I prefer to keep cash to show off how much cash I have... like buy most expensive car in Singapore is just showing off how much money I am burning off every year... like not very clever leh.. end up showing off but backfire massively in my dark face,btohqsg
can I just buy a Vios. Show off how clever I am at saving money one,btohqsg
smart ones buy multiple properties . not multiple cars,btohqsg
I agree Mr Anwo  some people buy Rolls Royce phantom viii to show off  then their chauffeur kena stuck in small lane. Got no parking,btohqsg
Buy 3 boxer to rotate in between ws,btohqsg
How to show off like that when you get late for your dinner reservation with the people you are showing off too,btohqsg
Buy GCB if money no object  live comfortably,btohqsg
erm... usually restaurants also up in buildings one.. unless my rolls royce can go up,btohqsg
Drive vios to be low key outside,btohqsg
Later need to go pick-up everyone or drop them off so that they can see the car,btohqsg
sorry what did you say?? cant hear you clearly sir...,btohqsg
Otherwise cannot show off if you meet them at some place where they cannot see the car,btohqsg
Unless you sit roadside and eat,btohqsg
Then they say  why you drive big car yet make us sit roadside,btohqsg
Can buy Mazda 6@Cxspeed  then use i-stop and drive efficiently and grow a tree on your screen,btohqsg
Heard that people very environment friendly these days,btohqsg
i love the mazda gears... i-stop. i-drive. reach destination already..,btohqsg
Very important to reverse park Mr Anwo,btohqsg
oh no ... sgprotectiveparking pls don't come flame me,btohqsg
Next time I teach you to i-reverse and i-park ok,btohqsg
If you can reverse rickshaw  can reverse anything,btohqsg
i got license drive truck.. also know how to reverse  and parallel park container truck with trailer behind too,btohqsg
If based purely on aesthetics  would you buy a car for its exterior or interior,btohqsg
I want to give passengers surprise,btohqsg
I want to look back at the car and see something like this,btohqsg
Then you can zhng your own interior,btohqsg
Also anyone got lobang to buy suede,btohqsg
I want exterior to look like broken trash car,btohqsg
Interior must be futuristic n highest tech,btohqsg
Not that easy to get an OEM look on the interior usually,btohqsg
Need a lot of money but can be done tastefully,btohqsg
Is this true abt this Lexus model?,btohqsg
We have spotlight and mr diy,btohqsg
Later end up looking inconsistent like this,btohqsg
Although now there's a few brands with better aftermarket light strips that are more consistent,btohqsg
This car look more cheap after zhng,btohqsg
The gear change. The sound the high revv. Exquisite,btohqsg
Ferrari gets them right  even after adding turbos and decreasing sound after the new emissions rules,btohqsg
Their cars are really great in terms of drama and sound,btohqsg
Just buy a million defi gauge 🥰,btohqsg
electric car is fast. really really fast,btohqsg
Agreed because this particular one is engineered to be as light as possible with instant torque and a lot of downforce from the fan at the back,btohqsg
And it has lesser battery cells than any consumer electric car or consumer performance car,btohqsg
holds the record for pikes peak,btohqsg
it is designed for goodwood. so made to last just that as light as possible and very short wheelbase,btohqsg
had this been a long wheelbase  i dont think it can be this fast,btohqsg
sort of like battery powered radio controlled car,btohqsg
Rear wheel drive as well  to make sure it doesn't suffer from understeer common with AWD cars,btohqsg
Where got Fast ? Model 3 bhp is 320 but 0-100kph acceleration only 6.1s. Even stock coe bmw 335 with lower bhp can accelerate faster,btohqsg
Ev is instant torque u should try to drive 1,btohqsg
I have sir. I think I still prefer drive and feel of many cars here in this forum for now. I can see the benefits of EV taxis though after being in quite a number in Seoul this month. Quiet and practical as a people mover.,btohqsg
got instant torque lah but honestly I am still old school in driving technique - gentle acceleration from stop... otherwise I think I will be up for more frequent tyre changes 🥴🥴,btohqsg
instant torque give u gentle and smooth accelration,btohqsg
smooth and no noisy engine looking for power,btohqsg
in that case  ICE also have lah.. press accelerator instantly have torque too.  🤣,btohqsg
ice is just so slow no offence haha,btohqsg
I felt quite 'disconnected' driving a rental EV tbh for a week and maybe it is just a matter of getting used to ba.  in place of engine note which I actually do enjoy  one gets a kind of whistling.,btohqsg
most of the car is not engine note,btohqsg
most of them are engine no power  screaming for power,btohqsg
I realise am quite chin chai when it comes to speed lah.. just chill driving mostly,btohqsg
it not about speed  just that ice pick up is just so noisy  and not smooth,btohqsg
lack of power  noisy  and not smooth,btohqsg
i can see the draw of EV taxis but then again  the downtime for them just to charge makes them not a work horse also,btohqsg
i ask some driver  they prefer ev  as the 50 minute charging time  they can eat  and rest,btohqsg
which is everywhere. at the moment  one pays for the '$70' somewhere else upfront and annually already le. besides  nowadays also need to pay for charging.,btohqsg
maybe when EV costs and taxes comes down  the economics attraction may be greater,btohqsg
i just sharing some thoughts of byd driver only,btohqsg
I do love the Korean EVs,btohqsg

PPF whole car ah sir? but but... after 1-2 years in our climate  the glue turns .. yellow leh.. then how?,btohqsg
this. you're a smart man. it is a losing fight.. imagine the visuals.,btohqsg
Find a good film lo.Anyway even if sell. The new driver won't know there PPF unless he's a car enthusiasts 😅,btohqsg
😭😭😭 you can never win an argument with aunties,btohqsg
Even worse if they bring their whole crew 🤣,btohqsg
you should have tried. they might compensate you seeing handsome dude,btohqsg
PPF vs ceramic coating  which one is more feasible?>,btohqsg
polestar 5 max they bring in srsm for 350k,btohqsg
who wanna pay 10k road tax,btohqsg
This auntie like ah ma. They Don't eat fresh meat 😂My face also black.unless  I can pull off a white flesh meat  accent 🤣,btohqsg
later so handsome they offer to pay in kind how. jitao run.,btohqsg
PPF obviously better protection but ppf have lousy ones. PPF tend to yellow too after exposure to elements. Both need maintenance as ceramic coating also need to reapply. PPF tend to darken if not reduce the colour gloss on the paint same with cheap ceramic coating.,btohqsg
hmm  like easier to maintain for simple washing and etc.. like alot worries on ppf of the glue..,btohqsg
If you drive in tuas or any industrial area wear rocks are plentiful  get PPF,btohqsg
I'm had Graphene Coating. My take was I was the car look shinny.For deep scratch  I will just go Ong Kian Seng there touch up 50-80 dollars / per spot.PPF $2000+. If new car. I will put.,btohqsg
Both need to wash haha  but ceramic coating is cheaper to maintain ah.Obviously u sacrifice the solid layer of protection lor,btohqsg
Im very an@l about my paint and all but im not willing to spend my money on a ppf thats is gonna yellow in 2yrs so i just ceramic coat and reapply when it wears out lor (usually 9-12months),btohqsg
That the CON. During removal  can peel off the original paint.You know painting whole car also around $2000PPF$ 2 000I seen new  Lamborghini put PPF. Because their new paint cost.more than 2000 I believe,btohqsg
Ppf is like wrapping but in a clear coat..,btohqsg
Compare the cost of new paint versus PPF lo,btohqsg
vs ceramic more like chemical barrier,btohqsg
if she shows you her beautiful daughter you will say otherwise!,btohqsg
Yes I know.1)The disadvantages of PPF is the film can peel off your original paint. Repainting whole car around the same price of PPF.2)The film can turn yellow3) remove PPF can leave slots of glue stains.,btohqsg
No la. I married already. Give my birth date? After life can look for my soul😂 pre -arrangedNext life la. 😂,btohqsg
downtime for installation is about same as a full car paint job too..,btohqsg

I think it’s for females. No macho at all. Pink interior. 😂,btohqsg

If you missed your payment  wait for them to send you the second letter or keep checking the system. Be prepared to pay more than the original fine.,btohqsg
Porsche 718 n 911 also girl’s car,btohqsg
LTA or TP next you will receive court date,btohqsg

"anyway i love driving ""girl"" cars",btohqsg
Cayman is true mid engine rwd,btohqsg
More than 50% chance of seeing a female in a 911 no joke,btohqsg
A woman can drive a male car. But a man must never drive a pusssy car boxster beetle,btohqsg
The shape n size la. Designed for small humans,btohqsg
Either a jcw or a gp3,btohqsg

It’s Low. It’s wide. How is it sissy ah,btohqsg
Because it's not meant to be of that class?,btohqsg
It's a rear engined 2+2 in most cases,btohqsg
Like that 1.6l and below all girls’ cars liao,btohqsg
The design is pu55y compared to Ferrari n Lambo,btohqsg
Positioned as a sports car unless you consider a gt3rs or a turbo S,btohqsg
If anything  I sometimes feel those car are trying too hard. It’s always.. roar roar.. look at me look at me!,btohqsg
And the turbo s as well is positioned at the Gran tourer end of the supercar spectrum,btohqsg
Later go carpark kenna aunty scratch,btohqsg
Nah… don’t need cars to do anything for me or improve my masculinity,btohqsg
People like Mr Pete come and say oh boring  walk away,btohqsg
