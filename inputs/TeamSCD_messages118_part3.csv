I had a 4 point bar installed previously  after 2 weeks I took out,btohqsg
i need stronger absorber. now full load the rear looks v nice lol,btohqsg
Fit short wheel base easier to cross,btohqsg
The landmark hotel/mall whatever  at the bugis one also,btohqsg
the landmark hotel one also looks innocent. until you try to exit lol,btohqsg
Bugis junction one ok lah  just avoid the middle road entrance/exit,btohqsg
Yeah bugis avoid the hotel side,btohqsg
ðŸŒš but i not those petrol run guys. haha going in for TD tomorrow,btohqsg
New to coilovers  didnt know. When i went there  looks fine. Until kena,btohqsg
Petrol runs ok la  they won't go in this timing,btohqsg
For me Fullerton hotel also must avoid,btohqsg
One Fullerton exit still ok  but Fullerton side cannot,btohqsg
Normally when my partner says wanna go xxx place  i will secretly look up the place. See if anybody says anything about that CP anot. lol,btohqsg
If got people complain  then i will see google map see the entrance hump how high. If it looks GG type  i will normally park else where lol,btohqsg
Sls I think I can clear,btohqsg
Then u will also have those applied Tuesday leave,btohqsg
But then again  now that im on coilovers. When i sit my friend's car or take grab  really feels weird.,btohqsg
2 days leave for a 5 day weekend in genting or wherever,btohqsg
I want holiday also cannot... Got rehearsals and stuff,btohqsg
Now i take normal car during turn i feel like the car gonna overturn,btohqsg
Wa but ur car donâ€™t look that low,btohqsg
Lucky you. Now i parallel park outside,btohqsg
Problem is the wheels far apart  so the center kena,btohqsg
There was once  i took a grab back. Vezel. Woah,btohqsg
i feel like im on clouds,btohqsg
i cannot even feel the road,btohqsg
Especially after the cte exit the one turning sharp right,btohqsg
They approach the hump fast your heartbeat accelerate,btohqsg
Time to save up for air sus,btohqsg
The big long humps all very safe,btohqsg
Then sometimes if drive short cut through private estate. Also scary,btohqsg
But stripes on the road pain,btohqsg
The humps not high kind but just have to go slower,btohqsg
then behind you see a car creep up tail gate you,btohqsg
The wdl ave 1 to woodgrove looks safe but is damn sharp actually,btohqsg
Especially the JB one going to woodlands,btohqsg
Most annoying is the plastic ones inside some condo so sharp,btohqsg
Im ok with sharp. Not high can liao,btohqsg
Malls CP also quite scary actually. Those spiral CP down. You cant see the hump,btohqsg
Been thinking if I want to soften my coilovers,btohqsg
Sharp feels very jerky cos my coils q hard,btohqsg
But the most ultimate ccb humps are those at the top or bottom of slopes,btohqsg
Ya lol bottom of slope one hump your front lip die alr,btohqsg
