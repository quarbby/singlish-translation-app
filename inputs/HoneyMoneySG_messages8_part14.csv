Can share about the withdraw back to bank?,btohqsg
In your grab app click Finance tab at the bottom  click transfer and choose your paynow account if you have that set up.,btohqsg
Last time i did a longer method to prevent looking sus. Which is to transfer money from grab to revolut  then transfer back to back. I have revolut card because I also using CDC card  last time they were saying if using grab to top up CDC got fee  So i got revolut card just for that. But now we can use grab to top up CDC  donno what to do with revolut,btohqsg
Probably just to earn the 20% public transport capped at 10% every month? And use it together with Youtrip when going overseas.,btohqsg
Now still got 20% cashback for public transport ?,btohqsg
I see I think it ok for me I use amex this year then the next year UOB for tax,btohqsg
Yes  but now they changed the T&C  need to top up $300 via bank transfer orcard?,btohqsg
correct me if im wrong but im pretty sure you cant withdraw funds from grab that are topped up with credit cards. Only debit card/funds funded from bank can be withdrawn,btohqsg
if a person is not NTB but donâ€™t have SCB Credit card in the past 2 years  still can get $300?,btohqsg
Yes  a new to bank means you dont hold or cancel any SC card within 12 months,btohqsg

Hello. What card do yâ€™all use for transactions that are excluded for hsbc revolution? And also after you max the $1 000 cap.,btohqsg
What the best method to redeem the ns55? Can use to top up grab?,btohqsg
One of my friend tried grab  cannot. I would like to guess use something like Youtrip or Jipay where the app will generate a QR code with the value $100 and save it in your photo galley. Then open the lifeSG app and scan that same QR code,btohqsg
So the best method for ns55 is topup jipay?,btohqsg
I guess so. I transfer back to grab liao,btohqsg
Ok. I guess it is best. Can use ns55 to topup jipay. Then use jipay paynow back to own bank account. This way is best. Written here so others can see on how to redeem easier.,btohqsg
Managed to transfer to Jipay. But keep clicking upload Qr code  the picture doesnâ€™t load in ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Do i have to wait until the card arrives before it can be used to pay?,btohqsg
I'm sort of a fresh grad starting on my first full-time job. I'm 2 months in. I stumbled onto Honey Money's HDB 2 room flat video and from there found out so many personal finance videos! They are so useful. :) I just want to say thank you!,btohqsg
Which one is better? Citi premiermiles card or HSBC revolution? Need help pls,btohqsg
You can thank me by smashing the LIKE button for the YouTube algorithm,btohqsg

Is applying for credit card instant approve? Cause the deadline for the fast gift redemption is today. If I apply now will i still be eligible?,btohqsg
possible but don't count on that,btohqsg
So I should just wait for another promo?,btohqsg
Hello! I too have HSBC revolution  I also started using DBS Woman World Master Card and Citibank Rewards card for any online purchase. Citibank can also be used for offline shopping,btohqsg
Oh nice! I thought itâ€™s only for online purchases for Citibank rewards?,btohqsg
hi anyone tried cardup/ipaymy on OCBC 365? is it 0.3%? why would people do it for 0.3%...,btohqsg
This is my little notes  u can check out their t&c  I saw Chris's video mentioning certain merchants are accepted offline too ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜€ the numbers are not in sequence use,btohqsg
I just signed up for Citi cash bank card,btohqsg
Anybody here using DBS vantage? How's the review,btohqsg
Ok thanks!! Oh is itðŸ˜… I need to go rewatch again hahaha,btohqsg
Hi  would you be able to use the above cards for electronics? Maybe say apple store or Harvey Norman etc?,btohqsg
Is there any promo for uob absolute now?,btohqsg
Are you sure that is possible?,btohqsg
UOB absolute is always like that because itâ€™s AMEX. They mention in their website can use to top up wallet. And there no exclusion in the T&C,btohqsg
I think there's a spend $3000 to get 5%.,btohqsg
No sign up bonus. Only UOB own 5% for first $3000.,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think any credit card allow you to withdraw cash and count it as eligible spending. I strongly encourage you to watch honey money or other YouTubers about credit card first.,btohqsg
Is anyone experiencing the same? I can't use ezlink to link with amaze to purchase anything. But with citi rewards card I'm able to pay via amaze.,btohqsg
Many have same problem. Nothing you can do. Change to youtrip or revolut,btohqsg
Common issue when u use Amaze with EzLink.. encountered tons of times until tulan..,btohqsg
Did you get your refund back from ezlink?,btohqsg
Erm not really sure on apple store or Harvey Norman..  I guess it depends on the merchant code as well haha.. their .. I will try to use woman's world for online purchases  and citibank rewards for offline shopping / online shopping / transportation / online food delivery first. Anything out of these categories  I use hsbc revolution for contactless payment.. trying to adapt this new strategy as I lately found out Chris's video on maximising miles using these cards ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
