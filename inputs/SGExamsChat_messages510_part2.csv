The logic is to eliminate every thing that repeats twiceMay 15 16 and 19 eliminateAugust 14  15 and 17 eliminatejuly 14 and June 17 eliminate.Now you are left with June 18 and July 1618 appears once16 twice but May has already been eliminatedFor July  14 already eliminated therefore ans is 16,btohqsg
Im just gymmin to escape the grind,btohqsg
if eliminate everything that repeats twice   then July 16 should be gone wad,btohqsg
if you follow the steps to the end,btohqsg
why can't be June 18 or may 19,btohqsg
Cant be may because 3 values and 2 people will leave 1 value being unaccounted for,btohqsg

"What bernard said cuts down the possible dates to only the month with 2 values- In his thinking  he only has June and JulyAlbert-Month and Bernard-DateAlbert thought process- (""Unlikely bernard will know the month"")Bernard-(""At first i had thought of it as June but Now i think its July)Albert-(July? you say  ok i know the date)Scenario 1: If albert thought the number was 1414 only appears once so when cheryl said the month  he should have known the date before bernard confirms it.Scenario 2:if albert thought the number was 1616 appears twice hence he would be skeptical and needed to wait for confirmation from Bernard.Scenario 2 is what the conversation is about",btohqsg

bro u remember him more than me,btohqsg
actually ah  why only month with 2 values. 3 also can no?,btohqsg
wah sitting down at computer so shag,btohqsg
if it was May or August..Albert wont know even after bernard say he knows because they have 3 values,btohqsg
but at the end albert knows,btohqsg
so it can only be through elimination of two values..that he comes down to a single value,btohqsg
In the scenario...elimination with 3 values is impossible,btohqsg
