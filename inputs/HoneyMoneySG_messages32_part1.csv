Anyone crack the math for which telco plans is best for buying a iPhone 14. Is it better to buy phone + circle life?,btohqsg
Seems like SIMBA is very cheap but I've never used it so I don't know how good it is,btohqsg
New Webull deals coming. Even better,btohqsg
For webull  I just deposited sgd300 and immediately put in one buy order for nikko am Shenton short term bond fund of $100. Even though the transaction will only be settled t+2  I should be able to spin the wheel for aapl?As long as all these done by 3.59pm today?The etf and options I settle when USA market open tonight.,btohqsg
Anyone tried digiportfolio yet? aka DBS robo investors,btohqsg
Reception quite spotty. But anything is better than m1 I feel,btohqsg
After 4pm  my spin wheel for Apple shares is missing. Would I still get chance to spin after my mutual fund purchase is settled?,btohqsg

Starhub sim only plan + easygo plan to divide the phone price into 12 installments,btohqsg
Yes  promo depends on when you deposit fundsDeposit before 4pm today = old offerDeposit after 4pm today = new offer,btohqsg
I completed the deposit. But not sure if I manage to get the subscribe mutual fund and get Apple share one. Cause the spin wheel now not in my app.,btohqsg
check with customer service to confirm,btohqsg
Hahaha recently is lag abit but at least... cheap and also   faced worse with other pricier telcos so..,btohqsg
Depends on your area. My area it's really fine.,btohqsg
Not sure how to feel about the new rewards,btohqsg
Shaggy didnt get to redeem the prev ones!,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also an affiliate. Just cannot post here because Chris is also affiliate.,btohqsg
This promo like a lot easier to hit/achieve than the prev one but of course I'm sure the lucky spin would be limited,btohqsg
can someone let me know if  I can do GIRO via my HSBC EGA ac for personal income tax monthly deductions?,btohqsg
Why it takes up to 3 days to pay hsbc revo statement via hsbc ega? üòÇ,btohqsg
HSBC received my rev CC applcation on 3 Feb... still nothing from them. Is it I have to start EGA first or something? Dun wan liao la,btohqsg
great  I should fill up a form fm iras website? I seemed to only find for dbs  ocbc  uob,btohqsg
You'll have to physically fill the form and post your application. Can't be done online,btohqsg
k  thanks for sharing .. I look for it,btohqsg
Why it so hard to get maybank cc? üòÖAlso any particular cc that gives rebates for telco bills? Maybank fnf has that category,btohqsg
can easily set giro instalment payment for income tax on iras website,btohqsg
Haha. I badly want Maybank fnf cc  as I can easily maximize cashback and it suits my spending. I read in hwz that opening account and putting $10k improves ur chances  but I don't want to open 1 more account üòÇ,btohqsg
I think that only supports the big 3 local banks.,btohqsg
no ah  I used boc. think can use hsbc also,btohqsg
New grab challenge hard too hit liao,btohqsg
I doubt anyone will bother with Grab hahaha,btohqsg
"Hi sifus! I spent $500 on my UOB credit card in Jan  but was recorded as having spent less than $500 for the purposes of my UOB one account.I called up UOB and was told that an online transaction I made to Awfully Chocolate  with description ""Paypal *Awfullychoc"" is an excluded transaction.Does that mean ALL paypal transactions (even when I am paying a business) is excluded?",btohqsg
Pay 25x grabpay wallet in past I would pay $1 for my starhub bill x25 times. But now you also need to spend $2100 (can scan my company qr?)Anyway  I won't order 12 grabfood or grabmart üòÇ,btohqsg
All PayPal transactions are excluded on UOB One,btohqsg
I think most PAYPAL are not included  you can see the PDF.,btohqsg
What is Paypal *Plus500  Paypal *Plus500.cometc though,btohqsg
I had assumed from this article that paypal transactions to businesses earn cashback/miles:https://milelion.com/2020/02/29/do-paypal-transactions-earn-miles/,btohqsg
2.2k? They dreaming. After I missed out on their previous challenge by 50cts I give up already. Because the stupid transitlink charged so late,btohqsg
Topping up of trading accounts on Plus500 via PayPal.,btohqsg
Quite normal for banks to exclude topping up of any trading accounts,btohqsg
Yes so the bank specifically blacklisted PayPal transactions to Plus500,btohqsg
But my paypal transaction was to Awfully Chocolate. It shouldnt be an excluded transaction from the tnc,btohqsg
should not be excluded unless the mcc is,btohqsg
Now thinking ocbc 365 as an alternative to maybank fnf. Anyone recommend? Thinking to hit $800 in telco  utilities  and food,btohqsg
Hi i am currently booking for a japan trip and i realised that the credit card im using  citibank rewards card  has a oversea currency exchange fee  if someone could double check that. So i would like to find a way to pay for my hotels without the fee and still get the points for my credit card. But i learnt that youtrip topup would not get any points. are there any other method?,btohqsg
Amaze plus any Mastercard cmrc combo?,btohqsg
Hi  what are some recommended cards for big purchases? For both cashback and miles. Thanksüôèüèª,btohqsg
