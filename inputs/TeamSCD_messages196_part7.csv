I use 0w20. I follow manual book,btohqsg
Depend on engine temps. In the end the quality and what temp it can take without degrading is more important,btohqsg
yesterday my friend showed me why we use thicker oil in our old car using the curry from the prata shop,btohqsg
its because when the oil is too thin  it creates gaps,btohqsg
then engines that rebuild before  or had bearings changed  the gaps are bigger and not as precise as a stock engine,btohqsg
so the thicker oil fills these gaps,btohqsg
or at least thats what i understood from the explanation,btohqsg
Yeah honda fit manual oso said 0W20 but I seen the price is more expensive than 5W30,btohqsg
If u need such viscosity it is wise to either change often or use a synthetic that doesnt degrade easily,btohqsg
Im guessing fit engine runs hot? 110 oil temps normal?,btohqsg
Not sure myself as I'm collecting my newly bought car tml,btohqsg
That's why wana get some idea which viscosity to use. Since the fit is more than 5 years  not sure should I use thicker oil like 5W30,btohqsg
for a moment i was thinking how come Master Leong was asking these,btohqsg
then now i realize its a different feller,btohqsg
Idk if u can understand Chinese,btohqsg
should have taken video when my friend use curry to explain lol,btohqsg
he take and spread it on the table  and we could see the oil split,btohqsg
Idk. How it work. But I just follow manual book haha,btohqsg
I suppose it could apply to u also just need to paste a miata,btohqsg
Wow  where to get it! Me want,btohqsg
If there is one with hashira or just shinobu  confirm buy,btohqsg
print sticker then stick on any bottle of oil,btohqsg
I tot is u correcting marc,btohqsg
Miata drivers are like that. They are toxic internally toward diff gen miata,btohqsg
NA: sure u can wink but slow AFNB: other than the turbo one  TRASHNC: BEST MIAT EVERND: lol no glove box please die,btohqsg
If need pick one..I pick please die😂😂😂,btohqsg
No use for a glove box 😂,btohqsg
My glove box a lot of stuff tho,btohqsg
Or maybe its the “if there is space it will be used” syndrome,btohqsg
If there is a pocket  its meant to be stuffed there,btohqsg
at one point i did think about having one,btohqsg
yes indeed..fun and nice to drive,btohqsg
Dun open the top at industrial areas ya😂😂😂,btohqsg

roadtax and insurance enough to kill me,btohqsg
Mine also reliable hehe haha hoho,btohqsg
Ur chassis shared with rx8 so i will agree,btohqsg
Ya i see u roadtrip to thailand HAHA,btohqsg
The NC Miata was developed when Ford owned Mazda; to trim costs  Ford dictated that the car share a platform with Mazda's larger RX-8. The NC was thus noticeably bulkier than any previous Miata  and it's now widely viewed as a departure from form.,btohqsg
NC is the biggest and widest cos of RX8,btohqsg
Which is why people hated it,btohqsg
Maybe they subscribe to Josephine’s “small space can be happy” theory,btohqsg
i do like the latest mx5,btohqsg
Roi will say u like dildo is it,btohqsg
(Yes thats what miata owners are like),btohqsg
better then a rx8 wanabe lol,btohqsg
