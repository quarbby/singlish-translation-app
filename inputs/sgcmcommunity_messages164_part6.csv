Can change car  but definitely not because of the bs the sales person tried to sell you ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
yup  cos market not good have to sell the car bought at very expensive price. then selling in bad times cannot cover back the loan.,btohqsg
Common during the 10 years loan. 0 d/p. Buy high  sell low,btohqsg

F1a6 many say very good like track tyre with good grip n quiet but wear rate nt as good as ps5 which is noisier,btohqsg
Wear rate means wear n tear faster issit,btohqsg

Gov need more to store in their 'reserves',btohqsg
Like that they better faster launch their distance erp,btohqsg
I think that 1 even worst,btohqsg
They can't launch the GPS tracking cos when underground and in high rise building area  it's not accurate. Infrastructure to track is  complex. That's why they haven't announce anything yet.,btohqsg
Just launch and correct the error through mistake,btohqsg
I wonder if they want to absorb 8% gst into it as well,btohqsg
With the way SG'ians complain...I doubt they'll do that. lol,btohqsg
8% gst also people complain   the folk also accept it   9% soon . People complain.,btohqsg
I think car model they spec the stock size. If you changed your sizing  check the size directly!,btohqsg
