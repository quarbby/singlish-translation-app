looking at SCB Journey Card  doesn't seem to have excluded hospitals?,btohqsg
Inflation now most $600 min spent card upped to $800 . Maybe the $800 spent will upped to $1000,btohqsg
Does it mean we cannot use Diners card to pay for hawker food anymore?,btohqsg
If they have nets machine can still use nets ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
Unfortunately  we are taking one step backward to use cash again. It was mentioned that Xnap feedback that they are working to relaunch the app. Hope this is true,btohqsg
You mean use the Diners card physically to tap on the net machine?,btohqsg
Yes  with effect from 1st July,btohqsg
What will be the next alternative after 1st July?,btohqsg
No  slot into the nets machine and type your bank pin ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Probably Amex pay is the only alternative after xnap and diners pay,btohqsg
Amex pay LoR Orr use kopitiam app,btohqsg
Yes  I been using xnap to help meet the UOB One 500 spending requirement ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Your Amex pay means the direct American Express company? Not those UOB Amex or DBS Amex?,btohqsg
Hawker centres dont have kopitiam app.,btohqsg
Haha I don't even think have nets. ðŸ¤ª Just use cash,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/202520Amex true cashback $150 offer  Extended till 30 Jun,btohqsg
Some places have PayLah/PayNow also not bad already. Personally I avoid cash only vendors.,btohqsg
I havent carried a single cent on me for past one year,btohqsg
Haha.. most hawkers and coffee shop is west side. They say paynow or cash,btohqsg
But comparing China cities with Singapore  their cities are really into cashless trend. Only use their apps wechat pay & alipay for all the daily needs.,btohqsg
Amex direct not those under uob,btohqsg
Yup. WeChat is literally their life app.,btohqsg
Ya no benefits using pay now haha unless just mean for cashless,btohqsg
We were close to this situation but iirc Singapore reject the idea,btohqsg
You know why.. because most hawkers don't want to pay charges to banks. So they want to cut cost,btohqsg
All want a piece of pie LoR defragmentation of cashless mode,btohqsg
Bro  the wechat and ali pay can go directly into their wallet  nothing to pay the bank,btohqsg
Too troublesome to log into Internet banking to pay for paynow. If paynow. I prefer pay cash .. .Pave wave/amexscan  shopback  ntuc apps can't be use . I pay cash .,btohqsg
Banks charge 0% for SGQR transactions.,btohqsg
More troublesome to carry a wallet,btohqsg
Provided the hawkers have these link lÃ ... they still prefer you paynow or cash...,btohqsg
Oh I didnâ€™t know China have paynow,btohqsg
Hard for spore to follow china,btohqsg
We comparing China and Singapore on why they use wechat pay instead of cash  and you say coz they dowan to get charged by banks. How is this any relation to Singapore?,btohqsg
Bank charges 0% on SGQR transactions  you said they charge (???). And SGQR can support PayNow  Alipay  etc.,btohqsg
What I mean is spore hawkers and coffee shops sellers.. they doesn't want to pay charges to banks,btohqsg
I think more to do with income tax issue rather then bank charge since it is promotional 0 percent now,btohqsg
They want to earn all profit,btohqsg
Half the time he answer 1+1 with A,btohqsg
can use Ez-link mastercard scan to pay,btohqsg
Now harbour front got road show on scb card.. I just walk past,btohqsg
Thanks for your update. Any special offer at harbourfront?,btohqsg
@voidhighlordI don't think I have to explain to you twice,btohqsg
Any other benefits that I canâ€™t get when applying online?,btohqsg
Nothing new bro... I feel they need to work a lot harder to make their cards more attractive again,btohqsg
Noted. I thought got something special that's why you share,btohqsg
It's a live location update. So you can maybe meet Terry IRL and see what he's like ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Can you explain why scb need to work harder? How is it not attractive?,btohqsg
Redemption rate to miles is poor .And also not relatively strong in their miles card.,btohqsg
He can help you plan out your cards to future proof it coz according to him  he knows which cards is going to get nerf,btohqsg
