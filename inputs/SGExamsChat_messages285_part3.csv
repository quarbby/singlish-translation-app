I believe there are some websites that are available providing some information about this. Can try to Google search for it,btohqsg
But the info thus far is only for application this year. So if you are looking to apply for next year  have to wait closer to the next year or at the beginning of next year.,btohqsg
requirment should be relatively the same as the year before's requirements. so u can follow that version in the meantime.,btohqsg
anyone here knows programming  can explain to me (a total beginner) how C++ syntax works pls,btohqsg
I just want some eli5 what is include iostream and int main,btohqsg
Are you familiar with programming at all,btohqsg
no I said I'm a total beginner,btohqsg
need to learn cpp next sem in poly  might as well start 1 month in advance while I'm free,btohqsg
Might as well enroll in cs50 which will teach you C,btohqsg
You can apply the same syntax to C++,btohqsg
But to answer your questions:#includeallows you to specify a library which contains functions/classes that you can use.int main() is the entry point  when you run the program that is the code that is executed first,btohqsg
thanks for the link imma save that,btohqsg
So u can't declare like in python,btohqsg

The game stops spawning fuel after you crossed the next level mark,btohqsg
So your max score will always be limited by your level rather than your upgrades,btohqsg
But your level itself is proportional to score,btohqsg
So the time it takes to reach a given level is proportional to (level)¬≤,btohqsg
anyone here went to swab recently can ik hw long it usually takes to get ur results now,btohqsg
Self test swab or the PCR swab,btohqsg
resources are available all year round  thats just if you wanna submit assignments and stuff,btohqsg
honestly right the cert doesn't do much,btohqsg
its cool to have but its not gonna straight away land u in nus cs or something,btohqsg
u can just complete the course and go on learn more complicated programming and do your own projects (or whatever  i gave up on cs50 cos dumb me can't understand),btohqsg
and those projects and stuff can go into a programming portfolio that u can show for uni apps,btohqsg
Aight then time to grind during ns pepega,btohqsg
then u can wait until the 2022 cs50x is released,btohqsg
