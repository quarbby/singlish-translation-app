However  if you are into collecting grab points via the grab challenges  only top up via bank will count. I know it‚Äôs not a lot now. But I‚Äôve accumulated quite a significant amount of grab points to exchange something. Quite a waste to give up now. Once I‚Äôve exhausted the points then will whack the $30k top up using Amex,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure many members here are already at the limit since it‚Äôs toward the end of the year. Saw some public consultation paper to increase the e-wallet limit from $30k to $100k. Hope it gets approved.,btohqsg
Would be interesting to see how many had NOT reached the limit. Perhaps admin can do a vote count here üòÉ,btohqsg
If you use CRMC + Amaze overseas (food  retail etc) do you get 4mpd?,btohqsg
yes so long mcc not excluded. 4mpd capped for $1k spend per statement month,btohqsg

For those who used up $30K  what did you spend on?,btohqsg
After the nerf grab pay   next year many might not hit the 30k right. This year can still say some ppl use 1 card strategy.,btohqsg
Now already mucho lessee on grab more on direct Cc payment,btohqsg
Just got my AMEX TCB. I was planning to spend the 5k on GPMC to pay taxes. But now that the GPMC topup has been nerfed from sign up promo  Any suggestions on how to spend the first 5k? I don‚Äôt have any such major expenses that I wanna use the TCB for‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Consider having expenses prepaid upfront. Like getting grocery vouchers  ask your telco or subscriptions if you can pay upfront,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestions  but I think I would rather spend those on another card such as Live Fresh or EVOL which would give me much more cashback üòÖI guess I will let the additional $75 (1.5% of $5000) pass. üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyone can share on the strategy for LiquidPay? Looking for an alternative after the Grab and Nestia nerfs. Thanks.,btohqsg

Anyone here knows if it is a good idea to share credit card within the family? Eg UOB ONE has a high cash back for taking public transport (10%)   but min spending of $500. Can I setup this as virtual credit to my both parents phone (using Google and Apple pay)   and so they will be able to use my credit card to take public transport simultaneously and charge it to my card in the end?,btohqsg
Senior rates are cheaper than cashback?,btohqsg

The Asus deal in the Grab flash deals seems to be a typo? 4000 grab rewards points for $100 off coupon üòÆ,btohqsg
will KrisFlyer miles be more worthwhile or these types of pointsback flash deals? Pls and tq üôè,btohqsg
If I am pending overseas and have already mac out the 1k limit for Amaze + Citi Rewards  it is more worth to use 1.7% cashback to topup Grab then to Revoult/Youtrip right,btohqsg
Can use UOB KF and OCBC TR with Amaze for MCC specific uses,btohqsg
I am planning amaze + Ocbc TR for my japan trip.Fingers crossed,btohqsg
maybe can use a locked dbs card to test for mcc (check via ibanking chatbot) if unsure if mcc is under the whitelist of mcc eligible for 10x points,btohqsg
assuming 1.7% cashback is better than 1miles per dollar right,btohqsg
I think still got to factor in the fx spread  I think there might still be some spread?,btohqsg
hi  for revolut‚Äôs currency conversion fees during forex market/non-market hours  does it also apply in real time for ATM cash withdrawals (before conversion)? Means I need to also withdraw at specific timings to minimise the fees?,btohqsg
