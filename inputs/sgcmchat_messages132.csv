The maintenance was Ike 2k ish,btohqsg
Don't worry many companies now say ATF is forever.. No need change XD,btohqsg
2k you tell me oil change only i go beat the workshop for you lmfao,btohqsg
"do they slap on a ""maintenance in 5000km"" sticker and call it a day",btohqsg
They say they put special oil,btohqsg
ok that one cannot beat need to bomb,btohqsg
7500 cuz I'm using Greddy oil,btohqsg
it was done before we bought the E,btohqsg
i think i maintain once every other month or once a month sia,btohqsg
the mechanic maybe lube it up for you alr,btohqsg
In terms of running and power wise,btohqsg
waiting for the day you full send it over a kerb,btohqsg
waiting for stage 20 nano ionization,btohqsg
My dad knows his stuff so all good,btohqsg
he nearly fully sent it over a bump,btohqsg
Sounds like service plan to me,btohqsg
He jus brought it to c&c,btohqsg
just buy your own jack and do everything yourself,btohqsg
but eh  at least your car isn't leased from c&c haha...,btohqsg
it won't work but at least you can put in your insta#mechanic,btohqsg
My condo drain is my oil pan,btohqsg
just dump the oil in the PCN canal,btohqsg
throw the car batteries in the ocean also,btohqsg
when the EVs hit 10 years old,btohqsg
im genuinely curious as to how manufacturers will replace the batteries,btohqsg
They don't.. They only make more waste.,btohqsg
more waste + coal operated power plants,btohqsg
idk bro you tell me if EVs genuinely save the environment,btohqsg
AT LeAsT iT is nOt POLLUTInG ThE aIR,btohqsg
need to drive one for more than 100 000km then you offset the production pollution,btohqsg
all the EV thirsty people legitimately low IQ,btohqsg
Even if all cars go EV.. It is not even gonna make a dent to air pollution.,btohqsg
not when the big manufacturing companies still exist lol,btohqsg
"they should crack down on the big polluters  not ""just"" cars",btohqsg
you see shenzhen all the manufacturing companies the amount of shit they spew into the air,btohqsg
yes cars are a problem but fucking look at those huge ass plants in china,btohqsg
i still think the funniest part of sg is they're more than happy to promote motorsports when it makes them a fat stack of cash,btohqsg
thats a fuck ton of carbon emissions,btohqsg
meanwhile the car enthusiasts like us are subject to constant bullying,btohqsg
the raffles marina thing also LTA waiting outside,btohqsg
exactly. they support certain people when they go overseas and rep sg. but when they do ass they close both eyes,btohqsg
whoever ordered that needs to be shot,btohqsg
there's absolutely nothing fucking wrong with having a car enthusiast scene in singapore,btohqsg
honestly speaking i dislike where our culture is headed. at least the main pricks.,btohqsg
absolutely nothing wrong with new aftermarket exhausts that still comply with emission regulations,btohqsg
too many people are into pops and bangs  absolute nuisances,btohqsg
idk why pop and bang tunes are that popular,btohqsg
i mean on one hand yes your 4 banger now makes some noise,btohqsg
on the other hand who cares,btohqsg
i genuinely have zero clue why they think it sounds good,btohqsg
cars are not about your brand new spanking pop and bang tune,btohqsg
it will sound good without annoying everyone and getting the police to come chase you,btohqsg
as a VTEC enthusiast i am shooting myself in the foot  but holy fuck your pops and bangs sound like hot fucking garbage and it hurts the ears,btohqsg
i suppose maybe the pops and bangs attract kids so that it can fuel the owners ego.,btohqsg
the cars that deserve to be looked at and admired are the ones that are well done up,btohqsg
not the ones that make the most noise,btohqsg
indeed. that's why i started that ig page,btohqsg
all the pages nowadays just shows supercars and shit,btohqsg
let your car draw attention witout making noise,btohqsg
i'd rather put the limelight on neat builds and understated stuff than OMG WIDEBODY SUPERKAR ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø,btohqsg
that being said if i can get my hands on a cherry qq,btohqsg
I'll make that thing pop and bang because that would genuinely be fucking hilarious,btohqsg
honestly  i respect alot of owner that bring their seemingly normal cars to c&k,btohqsg
like the MPS6  and the Manufaktur specced E63S estate a year back.,btohqsg
imagine this thing popping and banging it's fucking hilarious,btohqsg
if you do it i will salute you,btohqsg
i don't get the hype around the hypercars,btohqsg
they're like 20 mil and whatnot,btohqsg
but to me it's hypercar lor  insanely crafted and stuff but i can't appreciate them as much as a 40+ year old survivor,btohqsg
i think hypercars are genuinely some of the coolest things right now,btohqsg
the amount of engineering work that goes into crafting one is amazing,btohqsg
they are amazing dont get me wrong. the technology and r&d is wild,btohqsg
and tbh they're beautiful pieces of art,btohqsg
i nut to molded carbon sry,btohqsg
yet i feel that i'm more drawn to a black plate 30+ year old car that's in great condition,btohqsg
and they sound really nice and make ridiculous power,btohqsg
hypercars are peak engineering  old cars are peak stupid,btohqsg
i'd nut over a Zonda and stuff,btohqsg
but probably not as much for a Senna etc,btohqsg
i suppose the local culture has changed for the worse,btohqsg
i wouldn't call the change worse la tbf,btohqsg
people will tsk you if you accidentally block their shot at c&k  some would push and run to catch up with a super/hypercar that would park up,btohqsg
plus people will always have their own taste,btohqsg
oh lmfao which reminds me my friend told me someone asked him to move his DC5R so they could take a pic of an AE86,btohqsg
i keep laughign cuz he's so tilted over it,btohqsg
i find quite a fair share of the community doesn't really respect owners of cars they don't deem to be ig worthy etc,btohqsg
i've overheard certain kids shit on other owners for parking next to the car they want to shoot and ruining the shot lol,btohqsg
gotta remember they're still young so don't be too quick to begrudge them on stuff like this,btohqsg
that being said if someone asks me to move my car i will just walk away kek,btohqsg
we're already repressed and depressed enough  making the car community a better space is what we need now,btohqsg
unless that someone is parking attendant then I will move,btohqsg
Wanted to sell Child Porn to me Bruh wtf,btohqsg
this the only cp i have,btohqsg

Dm me n offer to sell me child porn for $400,btohqsg
