Need to start only fans account,btohqsg
Last year 72% dividend ???? Huh ??,btohqsg
And last year price only half of this year,btohqsg
Anyway they are mostly an oil related tanker company,btohqsg
And this year net debt close to zero I think?,btohqsg
They have been actively reducing debt,btohqsg
2021 should be a better year for them given oil is healthier,btohqsg
But then again their assets are depreciating (tankers),btohqsg
So my only worry is if the management can continue new growth,btohqsg
Singapore don't like solid company one,btohqsg
They like company with boardroom battles,btohqsg
Take one day at a time. Meanwhile enjoy the fruits ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Don't know whether will have fruits or not,btohqsg
Just camp for next dividend liao,btohqsg
That's the only fruit I know will have,btohqsg
Depreciate assets means more profit for same sales right?,btohqsg
Means return over time will reduce,btohqsg
One year two year is safe,btohqsg
That one depend on management to do new growth,btohqsg
Buy new tanker/ get more business/ sign more contracts,btohqsg
As long as oil price up I think ok lah,btohqsg
If not I just wait for dividend also can,btohqsg
