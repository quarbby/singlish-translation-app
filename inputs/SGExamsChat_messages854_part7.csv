some physics profs do research in physics education,btohqsg
I cant even access the fyp project list anyways,btohqsg
So i wont know if he wld change it or not,btohqsg
Oh then in this case it's just a bog standard FYP,btohqsg
I dont even know what the profs projects are,btohqsg
you can still email to show interest like you know you don't have to do smth on the list right,btohqsg
but maybe wait till recess week ba,btohqsg
This is why u do URECA too also tbh,btohqsg
i mean that's what i did,btohqsg
tim liew didn't have anything on the list back then but i just emailed him and he gave me 3 ideas,btohqsg
I didnt even know that was possible,btohqsg
yea but like my prof for e.g. has collabs with nie so he could do like some interdisciplinary one based on that,btohqsg
But yea. I alr ended up working with nie during summer holidays,btohqsg
Thing is in this case it's would be registered as a normal FYP,btohqsg
FYP URECA got their own funding,btohqsg
The point is to do an fyp that is also educational but like not under ureca,btohqsg
Can apply for more marni compared to just normal FYP,btohqsg
we kinda alr moved on from the ureca thing lol,btohqsg
I mean also for conference too la,btohqsg
FYP works very differently across faculties,btohqsg
What if i want to work on a phy project,btohqsg
you need an spms prof as a main supervisor,btohqsg
You need a physics faculty as your main supervisor,btohqsg
But i need to get a spms faculty member as my supervisor,btohqsg
fyp is more flexible than you think,btohqsg
Idk the rules ah for spms but for soh is u need your faculty to sign off,btohqsg
Should be physics not spms i tot?,btohqsg
you could even do fyp with external organisations that way,btohqsg
Physics can go for CERN's? if you're rich enough .https://careers.cern/summer,btohqsg
Actually what's the limitations for FYP ah isit physics limited or spms limited,btohqsg
"the unofficial stance on what projects are allowed is ""must involve physics in some way""",btohqsg
But the admin sign-off required a spms or physics prof?,btohqsg
And eventually charmed his way into a job there,btohqsg
ask if he knows a phd student from bangladesh there,btohqsg
Either ways is forced 1 year rite?,btohqsg
The next time i talk to him,btohqsg
think so but man it's been too long,btohqsg
I need to start changing bedsheets,btohqsg
I mean my understanding is based on my faculties rule,btohqsg
Damn is that a business plan,btohqsg
I knew i shouldntve washed my bedsheets once a week,btohqsg
There is always demand and supply,btohqsg
I just need to find it,btohqsg
they'd pay me to stop you from selling it,btohqsg
U wash them once a week?,btohqsg
There's always a market one lah,btohqsg
How do you have the energy to do that,btohqsg
The sheets itself have some value,btohqsg
as long the job is high paying lol.,btohqsg
or just to some weird weirdo on carousell lol,btohqsg
