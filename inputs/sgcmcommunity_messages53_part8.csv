Gotcha! Removed him from the group already-R,btohqsg
This seems very good üëçüèª I just saw the video review from CarBuyer as well,btohqsg
Actually the line is blurred from manufacturers also. Merc cla is considered coupe  then bmw gran coupes also considered coupes.I think sports car is up to too much interpretation. it should just be removed entirely.Hot hatches can be in hatchbacks categorySuper saloons can be in sedan categoryConvertibles have their own categoryMaybe there can be a coupe category for a start,btohqsg
üëèüëè bravo. This is the definition of listening to the people  no matter how small the voices or the changes are,btohqsg
While we are at it. Can there be a spell check or words suggestions in the search bar? I have fat fingers and always having typos,btohqsg
Are the categories chosen by the dealers or assigned by sgcm?Sometimes when i see the used car listing  the category does not match  i wonder if it was the second hand dealer or sgcm misassigned when it was new.,btohqsg
..and VW beetle is considered a sedan.,btohqsg
I have a legit qns. I have a 3 years old Audi A3 1.0A. Bought it a year back when COE was low.With the current cost of living   I‚Äôm wondering if it makes sense to down grade the car to a Yaris cross hybrid.Drove before JDM and conti. So I don‚Äôt mind driving back to JDM.Wondering if it makes sense to get a brand new Yaris cross hybrid.,btohqsg
yeah if it saves you lots of money,btohqsg
it is just a tool. car,btohqsg
No worries. I‚Äôm not ashamed to down grade. Is reality of life. And is an Audi A3 not A8. Haha.Just wondering if it makes sense to get a brand new hybrid or just suck it up and continue driving the car.,btohqsg
Just compare the total spending on the car per month‚Ä¶. Depreciation  patrol  road tax  maintenance etc,btohqsg
okay dont talk about face la,btohqsg
got alot of things to consider,btohqsg
A3 resale now vs next timeYaris u buying new? need to include coe premium nowYaris second hand valuerunning costetc etc,btohqsg
ya mann  thumbs up to sgcm ü´∂ü´∂,btohqsg
I will think both.E.g. listing an auto car as manual transmission.The is 99% car dealer/seller fault,btohqsg
You‚Äôre a confused person. If you want to save money why get a new car?,btohqsg
Get a good used car. A Japanese or Korean that is reliable to save you money.,btohqsg
if want to save money sell car and take public transport,btohqsg
Wouldn't consider it sucking it up with the a3 because u bought it way lower than the current market.Even if u make money from the sale  make sure it covers the extra difference for the yaris cross due to coe hike. And there's no way of telling if you can sell the yaris cross with no loss in future if coe is low when u are trying to sell the car.,btohqsg
Never encountered something that drastic before but i guess it could happen if dealers pick off the video,btohqsg
I agree that the lines are blurred  hence the proposal for performance oriented cars,btohqsg
And cars with sporty body types to be separated,btohqsg
U mean like specific performance versions of bread and butter cars like the gti  the i30N  focus st  jcw?These seperated with sporty looking cars like the veloster  koup  rcz etc etc?,btohqsg
Ya the classic m  s/rs  amg,btohqsg
Anything that is focussed on providing better performance driving basically,btohqsg
It could be a tough one but its worth a try. Kinda feel like we doing a cool wall like on top gear.,btohqsg
After that im sure there are some models that falls into the cracks but thats a given with what manufacturers do these days,btohqsg
Is the giulia/stelvio super considered sporty? Or has to be veloce hahahaha,btohqsg
Infinity q50 2.0  jag 2.0 sedans... Those get pretty blur,btohqsg
These days a lot of cars do multiple things,btohqsg
But the category should be based on what it is positioned more towards with a well defined classification,btohqsg
Because currently the sports car category is cluttered with all sorts of things,btohqsg
For most of us  much easier to figure out what we want as we can just look for the exact model or use multiple variables to filter,btohqsg
But there's enough people out there who could use the classification to better understand the cars they're looking at and figure out what they want to buy easily,btohqsg
Ya actually this will be more for the masses,btohqsg
There isnt a unified definition of a sports car hence the confusion and mix up,btohqsg
Yeah and it'll also help classify stuff better for the Karen's and Aaron's so that they don't go around calling everything a sports car,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminmaybe can consider hiring me and@arnavgulianias part timers? We'll do a proper clean up of the database,btohqsg
Sit there and sort all the models on sale,btohqsg
I wonder what they think of a tesla model Y dual motor,btohqsg
Or worst  a ford mach e,btohqsg
Because it is a regular SUV looking car,btohqsg
They aren't aversed to them somehow,btohqsg
Anyone went down to the meet?,btohqsg
Even though many EV drivers tend to be the worst on the roads,btohqsg
With their launches  lack of signal usage and aggressive driving,btohqsg
Already very good. From 50 mil to now 150 mil,btohqsg
