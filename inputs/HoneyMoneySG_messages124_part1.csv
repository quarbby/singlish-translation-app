Any benefit of UoB KF if fly with SQ?,btohqsg
Fast track to KES 😅It may be branded as KF but all it benefits is on scoot,btohqsg
Even at 200k balance  your bonus interest  for growth will still be based on 100k.,btohqsg
walao pay annual fee for T1? This card so many people abuse  surely nobody should be paying AF 😅,btohqsg
Oh have different with use other card such as uob LS for reaching KES?,btohqsg
Nope  Only for first year when you get the card you get fast track which the requirement is lower mainly based on ticket purchase rather then actual flying 🤔,btohqsg
But still my go to card for booking SQ and scoot due to that im using the basic ladies which is capped at $1k and booking SQ surely most of the will overshot when booking together with partner 😅 so the uncapped SIA spending is good for that ~,btohqsg
Other benefits would be the uncapped 3mpd on krispay merchant is a good use case itself especially big purchase like at Harvey Norman not missing out since those give 1 extra mile + 3mpd on following month 🤔,btohqsg

Dear  I'm trying to use Maybank Platinum Visa pay my income tax payment through Cardup  1st time. However  it will only charge my card on Aug. 2nd. Is there any method I can pay my tax within July to meet minimum spend requirements for Maybank Platinum Visa? Thanks.,btohqsg
Wouldn't the GIRO deduction take place already by now? For Jul.And 2 Aug may not be in time for Aug tax payment also.,btohqsg
Other than CardUp  what is the other platform name?,btohqsg
Thanks  my main point is to spend the money to meet min spend requirements on CC. no matter it will be in on time for Aug tax or not.,btohqsg
You might want to spend elsewhere already. In especially merchants that are able to do same-day/one day posting.,btohqsg
I didn't aware that CardUp only charge my card so late. Thought the payment will be charged in July. Haiz,btohqsg
Can I use Ipaymy for income tax?,btohqsg
Arent u set the date for payment on the app?,btohqsg
Yeah  the earlist for my card to be charged is on Aug. 2nd.,btohqsg
Because he's trying to be JIT warrior. CardUp only allows setting up in the middle of the month.,btohqsg
U can set it to be earlier isnt it,btohqsg
that is the earliest date available. the earliest for IRAS to receive the payment is Aug. 7th...,btohqsg
this is my 1st time make payment on Cardup and didn't aware such policy,btohqsg
U can pay earlier by setting it in jul  look like u have not follow what other are discussing about tex payment on cardup. So next time do more research,btohqsg
You can try. Not sure if they block out the first week like CardUp or not  but the fees are a lot higher.,btohqsg
CardUp won't let you send on last week or first week of the month for tax payments.,btohqsg
Yeah  learned lesson 1st time and will do it mid of each month.,btohqsg

"⚠️Trying to apply HSBC TravelOne cc for iPad 10th gen reward. Does this mean have to spend 1k in 2 months?""Apply for the HSBC TravelOne Credit Card  provide your marketing consent to HSBC  pay the annual fee (S$196.20 incl. GST) and make a min. spend of S$1 000 by the end of the following month from card approval date to be eligible for reward""",btohqsg
Just wanted to see if anyone else kena fraudulent transactions recently with cards linked/used with ipaymy,btohqsg
Yes. Within 2 months must spend $1k (excluding annual fee and it's GST)  pay annual fee and provide marketing consent.,btohqsg
Then it has nothing to do with ipaymy. It's just a common issue with Citibank cards due to bin dumping. Just report fraudulent transaction  get new card  move on.,btohqsg
