Management fees of 0.65% would never make sense when one could get paid 2.18~2.5% by DBS/POSB to invest (would be even higher after factoring in the sign-up cashback).It might even make sense to double your current Invest-Saver despite maxing out the cashback cap of $30 every month.,btohqsg
Not much choices for invest saver though. My nikko sti is over 1 year. Not sure which to switch over to next,btohqsg
Can switch to Singlife. Oct will be 1.5%,btohqsg
