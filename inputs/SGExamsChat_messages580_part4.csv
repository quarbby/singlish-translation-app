if it was me last yr at this stage i needed to sit through 2 mcqs and 2 geog papers :/,btohqsg
Maybe cuz all the harder subjects are gone,btohqsg
i had to listen to the current geog cher rant to me abt ej geog students,btohqsg
all the HELM kids finished As already,btohqsg
he bought me coffee just so we can talk abt why this yr j2 geog students not gonna do well,btohqsg
ur so close with our chers,btohqsg
uhh I think he just say alot of them are shaky,btohqsg
its cuz i taught ur batch,btohqsg
and alot of the gp chers from ur batch were from my batch,btohqsg
anyways he was just saying like this yr j2 geog students 0% distinction rate for prelims,btohqsg
then got alot of people like also not rly studying or motivated,btohqsg
but imo this is just smth I noticed abt ur whole batch in general,btohqsg
i had one of my students give up on studying in March and sat down to talk to me during consult about how he shud drop out of ej and start working cuz he doesnt feel like studying anymore,btohqsg
shock is usually for 'non rhythmic pusle' like ventricular fibrillation,btohqsg
where the heart is beating but not regularly,btohqsg
for the patient that i got he was under PEA  or pulseless electrical activity,btohqsg
where on the ecg machine it shows a pulse but when checking for pulse manually there isn't any,btohqsg
but normally if u donâ€™t have machine and u feel manually u wonâ€™t feel a pulse though,btohqsg
i did a mr case with vf and shock prompted by AED but initially couldnâ€™t feel a pulse during my ABCs,btohqsg
Donâ€™t mind me asking Qualifications required?,btohqsg
Yeah  6 hours a day and already made a 100,btohqsg
prolly not lol she just completed her o levels,btohqsg
he couldnt have been too upset tho  ej got 100% A/B for pw my batch,btohqsg
so he got either A or B,btohqsg
hey yall does anyone know what is next after a levels? do i apply an internship in the courses im interested in taking in uni or will just normal admin assistant jobs be good enough?,btohqsg
its very hard to get C or D,btohqsg
i only know one student who got D and thats cuz she fainted halfway through her OP and the sch considered it as not finishing her OP :/,btohqsg
my moms like pressuring me to do sth alr,btohqsg
I would recommend if u have money to go solo travelling,btohqsg
ðŸ˜­ idk how to apply admin jobs  iâ€™ve been working fnb my whole life bruh,btohqsg
Wait donâ€™t admin jobs pay like $10 an hour or smth? Like the date entry ones,btohqsg
do u know where to find internships? like is there like a fastjobs app for internships or sth,btohqsg
idk how do data entry even â€¦,btohqsg
Donâ€™t bother man  Low pay only if itâ€™s internship,btohqsg
i want to do aerospace engineering,btohqsg
anyways if u rly rly want it for the practicality try and make it relevant to ur uni degree,btohqsg
wtf type of internship do i even take ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
my friend got into aerospace engineering with 70RP,btohqsg
apparantly he worked in an engineering firm somewhr,btohqsg
i can ask him what he did,btohqsg
I thought u were talking about some IT degree,btohqsg
