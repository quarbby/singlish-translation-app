0.006 will mostly probably hold as current support.Neo garden boss did married deal $0.008. And is now SSH.No players or retailers interest on asiatic at the moment.Have to wait til some volume come in then this counter can try.,btohqsg

Hahha but So far Neo have not sold since he bought $0.008. He is SSH now. If sell  will need announcement.I have watched the PA too. Just resting now. No real sellers alreadyThis Asiatic can wait til got volume come and micros segment in play.$0.007 safe  $0.006 no sellers.This one if spike easily $0.009 clear,btohqsg
I think caution ⛔️. Good to stay light wint lesser counters first. In case market turn can run fast.My focus is to reduce existing.The good once I reckon- Chasen 71/72 (but if 70 breaks and don’t recover   gotta run)- Moya (72 test crucial today to see whether got play or not)MicrosFor collection (safe price- must be able to hold)- Asian micro $0.008 only- China Env res $0.013 onlyWhen spike  easily 1-3 bids win type.,btohqsg
