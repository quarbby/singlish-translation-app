My old sec sch force one.. if IT and Science  Sports club dun want take in  kena pushed to UG. At least 1 of the options for CCA selection has to be UG,btohqsg
But for me at the time worth it  mine prioritise attendance rather than focused on performance,btohqsg
So every npcc activity I go  I participate  I get free points,btohqsg

Helped to drop my L1R2B2 from 15 to 13 üòÅ,btohqsg

Can't afford no shitbox in sg üòî,btohqsg
word on the street that there will be people coming in a certain type of vehicle without any driving license. pls don‚Äôt be dumb and do this  especially going to places with a lot of people and a lot of cars parked. it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.,btohqsg
and pls don‚Äôt jeapordize the car community if you get caught at the carmeet by tp/lta,btohqsg
singaporeans in general are very stupid,btohqsg
you tell them not to  all the more it spurs them on.,btohqsg
Smone gna crash n smthing gna explode,btohqsg
might as well let me drive with my eu license while they're at it,btohqsg
Yep. The ones so called Red Flag drivers.,btohqsg
Cus I feel the front grille and roof seems a littleoff.,btohqsg
I'd love to see some dumbasses going to jail,btohqsg
ik alot of them no license oso,btohqsg
idw later i see crash sia,btohqsg
How long you been in Singapore?,btohqsg
Or are you not a foreigner? I.e. pr/citizen alr,btohqsg
alot of ppl going for this?,btohqsg
no opps man ahahha just tryna look out for each other bro this thing if really happen especially during car meets will look really bad to the community if you get what i mean,btohqsg
4 months + foreigner yeah  pass holder,btohqsg
Just convert your eu license then,btohqsg
About 100 bucks for the btt course and test at CDC,btohqsg
Then you can't drive on the eu license,btohqsg
Until then you can use the eu license to drive too,btohqsg
Good to know but not really worth it la bc I leave sg in 2 months,btohqsg
Can drive without conversion for 1 year then haha,btohqsg
Should definitely be cheaper than actually renting a car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs point A to A Tho,btohqsg
I think bluesg a bit better,btohqsg
ü•∂ He said this is NOT a parking spot ‚ö†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Bluesg won't allow his license my guy,btohqsg
Well it really depends how long you use it cause you gotta drop it off where you pick it up,btohqsg
So if you're out for a while and the car's just parked,btohqsg
You've gotta pay for the car hourly anyway,btohqsg
So at times daily rental is cheaper,btohqsg
