VP is a good trading counter though haha,btohqsg
After all my VP postSomeone Pm ask if I‚Äôm their supporter he can feel my passion for the companyRender me speechless,btohqsg
Take note I said trading and not hold long term ah.Dont later twist my words,btohqsg
Over 4K members here in this group. I‚Äôm a newbie as well  joined less than 2 weeks ago. Might be useful to see the age demographic of this group (curious to know  maybe can poll?)Have a good weekend everyone üôÇ,btohqsg
To be fair I think everyone was hyped about mr Heng visiting VP la.Stamp of approval from him.Price doubled in 2 days.Can I say I didn't believe in the hype?No because I did fomo and joined in at the highs as well and earn a bitBut when price went down one should be rational.Is the hype for real or just a smokescreen?Dyodd!,btohqsg
I suspect I may be in the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù generation here ü§™,btohqsg
TG is probably the best ‚Äúgamble‚Äù at the moment regardless the BBs planning to do whatever they wan. If they make the price drop to a value which the company itself finds its a good price  there‚Äôs a high possibility they will buy back the shares.Some +ve to back TG 1) Next year report should be as good as the recent report2) They r looking to expand their products to even more countries.3) Upon clearance of the labor issue in the short period.I‚Äôm a TG investor though but no biased view. üôÇ,btohqsg
Anyway I don't want to appear to like hindsight talk because really no right no wrong to believe in the hype.If you do still believe it just hold loh.Market is irrational at times,btohqsg
Anyway not only VP got sold down la MT as well.So VP is not getting targeted solely,btohqsg
Maybe Medtecs current price ( already priced in Vaccine ‚Äú out ‚Äú ) ....then vaccine out - price boom back due to result of FA..ü§ì,btohqsg
Gurus  can help advice on the new plan of Alpha Energy,btohqsg
Consolidation and issue new share options at 84%  discount,btohqsg
Nothing to advise. Do 40:1 conso also not much left,btohqsg
How you had such feelings that VP will rebound to 70cts?Thanks,btohqsg
alpha come back? i thought die hard le,btohqsg
No wonder MT price lao sai,btohqsg
Alpha just annouce new consolidation plan,btohqsg
maybe too few go to baibai le. angry.,btohqsg
Yes what he say is correctHi bro Alan will VP price go up,btohqsg
if BB stuck at 50 60. the price will go up again.,btohqsg
I have no idea. maybe someone can calculate it.,btohqsg
I quite agree with Furion 07.,btohqsg
Maybe some bounce then follow big down.,btohqsg
Anybody in Medtecs or Vicplas group chat can add me in. Thxs,btohqsg
After pandimic  who will wear mask?,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt wear .. Sg very hot le,btohqsg
heart speaking  wearing mask outside is good for healthy when big wind.,btohqsg
I will still wear hope govt enforce this. I dont want be gineui pig for the vaccine,btohqsg
Maybe govt will enforce you for vaccine  not wearing mask.,btohqsg
vaccine probably only will enforce for travellers/healthcare workers,btohqsg
No vaccine no work (no school),btohqsg
they will be the first batch people.,btohqsg
unless our country suddenly got another outbreak  why will they want everyone to take a vaccine,btohqsg
Me. I look better with mask on,btohqsg
Baby need quite a few vaccine.,btohqsg
Our vaccines will be bought from China,btohqsg
this one must wait a few years  for full health study to ensure no side effect,btohqsg
baby's vaccine also has fever sympton. very low possibility will server response.,btohqsg
parents will still worry. No way anyone will put them through that willingly.,btohqsg
paiseh i not trying to refute your every point just voicing my thoughts,btohqsg
i just my thoughts  not right at all maybe,btohqsg
this disease easy to be healed. so govr not take it seriously.,btohqsg
China holding military exercise near Taiwan...soon on high alert...affect Medtecs sentiment,btohqsg
these two month  quite ofter exercise.,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople!Weekend Reflection Quote  :‚ÄúYou must be shapeless  formless  like water. When you pour water in a cup  it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle  it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot  it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.‚ÄùBruce LeeHave a blessed weekend.Enjoy üëç,btohqsg
A good analogy by the legendary Bruce Lee that we use to reflect on perhaps what went wrong or perhaps right this 2-3 weeks.It has been a tough trading period I have to say for most of us.Sometimes  good to pause and evaluate what went wrong and what could have been done better etc.This way  we can adapt better to future similar circumstances.Cheers all.,btohqsg
U are very right. Let‚Äôs base on fact.Share price up  typically scripts will be lesser held by BB.Share price down with volume also means.... Scripts are being collected by the BB. Not possible to distribute shares when price is moving downwards as nobody dare to buy.If the above make sense.Now the question is  why the BB want to collect the scripts?Yes  one reason is to reflect the actual price of the share based on the ‚Äòexpected‚Äô results. BB might know  a phone call to the company should be able to know how the share price should react.Another reason  I can think of when the time arises again  they will play up the shares because they have it.3rd reason  why is there a rush to push down the price within this month? Why so hurry to do so?Only a hindsight answer will be able to answer this question. üòÇ,btohqsg
"VP is one of the makers of covid test kits developed by NUS. 40 millions were ordered from 4 local companies. Forefront is one of them. If they are given 10 million to make that should contribute big to their profits. They also recruited 80 new staff. I think that is the trigger. Let us see. I am waiting to see the results.""¬†protection for healthcare workers.Prof Boey and his team are now working with four¬†companies  TNC Optics & Technologies Pte Ltd  Meiban Group Pte  Inzign Pte Ltd and Forefront Medical Pte Ltd  to mass manufacture and sterilise the injection moulded swabs.About 40 million pieces of the IM2 and IM3 swabs are expected to be produced over the next few months  and these locally-produced swabs will be priced lower than the current commercially available imported swabs.""https://www.biospectrumasia.com/news/54/16287/singapore-develops-novel-covid-19-swabs-to-address-global-and-local-shortage.html",btohqsg
Nope. Need plenty of hopeBlind faithImaginationHallucinationDreamMedicine (wrong ones)Irrationality,btohqsg
Haha. All of the above and broke.,btohqsg
well done and kudo to Singapore development team and manufacturing companies like Forefront medical... sales will be good to local and oversea markets... will roar to success...üëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
They also make / sell ventilator components. Half year end Jan 2020 medical revenues almost doubled to 30 million from 17 million same period last year. This should show substantial growth for second half as well due to swabs and respirator /? Ventilator components.,btohqsg
I have no doubt it is going to boost Vicplas resultsOut of the 4  meiban used to be listed and much bigger. No idea on the other 2 but I do sense forefront should be one of the smallest.So let‚Äôs assume they get 10And assume the completion is by july 31st.Which is unlikely. It will flow into 2 different financial year most likely.So based on their 1H results medical segment did 29m revenue and around 10% gross profit marginGP of 2.9mNote these nasal swabs are ‚ÄòNational service‚Äô. Reasons for heng visit?1.  Trying to boost confidence in local sme because that‚Äôs the key theme of the budgets. Job retention  innovation etc usual big words2.  Show how ready the country is in the fight against COVID3. Get associated with seemingly successful and innovative local companies as examples to showcase how policies are in right direction (chan visited AEM).Back to forefront  it‚Äôs a National service and has indicated it will be sold cheap. Expect a fat margin paid for by government?NopeI have heard of mask factory setup in sg by private entities all fully sold to the gov on literal cost plus basis. National service...However let‚Äôs assume the best and at 10m units (doubt they get so much)All completed in last half (unlikely too)Margins remain the same (unlikely too)Assume $10 each  that‚Äôs a 100m revenue. At 10% GP they make $10m gross. Your extra staffing etc cost? To churn such quantity it‚Äôs a 24/7 job  shift work won‚Äôt social distancing etc. 80 new staff adding OT etc. one year salary 30k (hack the cpf contribution for easy calculation) already underestimatedLooking at 2.4m staff cost. Count half year since previous 1H have no ah heng effectIt‚Äôs 1.2m additional staff cost.So looking at 8.8m profit  another bold assumption piping business self-sustain at breakeven (clearly it‚Äôs a hole but isn‚Äôt this an optimistic exercise)Less income tax17%7.3m nett profit for 2HAdd on to 1H 2.2mTotal 9.5m net profitAdded plenty of optimism and hope alreadyAt last done 34 cent with 507m issued the market cap is 172.6mNet profit of 9.5m translate to PE18Expensive? Prob not.Cheap? Definitely notReduce some optimism here and there and easily full year PE of more than 20Awaits a correction isn‚Äôt it?The hype of the 10m swabs sent share price up multifolds even after the correctionWhat are the chances of a supernormal result to send it flying?Not impossible but the market is a game of probabilityI don‚Äôt like my odds. The rest might favor yoursNot inducement to buy/sell,btohqsg
Maybe should assume another 2.2m assuming 1H medical segment business contributes,btohqsg
Repeatedly. Ah no mood to do. Can play with figures ownself for sensitivity analysis and see how much it deviates from the result next week,btohqsg
My agaration just for referenceSee if they cAn supernormal perform more than 9.5mThen maybe I chase opening the next day. Cheers,btohqsg
Yes hope they managed some exports on swabs and realize good profits.,btohqsg
All swabs are for local use. Well who knowsAs I saidThey are manufacturer do not own IPIf they do for others and learnt and make themselves and export overseasWhat diff are they from china typical manufacturers,btohqsg
Then ah heng just visited a crook house. That would be funny,btohqsg
They will enjoy a fraction of higher asp and not fully for the same reasonJust wait for results see how far I am. I‚Äôm bad at guessing hence never tio 4D,btohqsg
Meanwhile investors or stuckist can expect a turbulent rideMay be sweetMay be catastrophic,btohqsg
their nasopharyngeal swabs and other product can break the dominance of the US/Europecompanies  which are selling at very high prices... it can expect more orders coming in from the regions and oversea... üëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg

Mr heng advertise for forefront medical,btohqsg
If still in the black for UG & MT  isit a good idea to cash out now?,btohqsg
no matter how good the profit all these company is making  the singapore market is in a very depress state theres no more stimulus from the government given to retail investor to inject back to the stock market.,btohqsg
Got Make money is always good,btohqsg
you wont see all those crazy gains like the past 3 mths anymore,btohqsg
and everybody is back to work and theres alot of debt that need to be repaid.,btohqsg
Hard to maybe after earning announcement or maybe another global.wave,btohqsg
Citing that the news on overseas still covid case surging,btohqsg
its not gambe its cash flow. who goes in early and out at the penthouse wins,btohqsg
if our government did another circuit breaker and more stimulus on the way then maybe,btohqsg
Ya in a way if u enter earlier perhaps on June period,btohqsg
We won't know and hard to.predict as wealso.openborder,btohqsg
But if we don't open sg will hit even more harder,btohqsg
thats up to mr heng to say now,btohqsg
Ya already open up green lane,btohqsg
i guess this indicates theres not much money injected in singapore stock market.,btohqsg
Like what u see medtec stock in.tawian,btohqsg
Taiwan dun even have any circuit breaker till now,btohqsg
Taiwan numba 2. China numba 1,btohqsg
All these are public info for months. No doubt the bottomline has been boostedKey is how muchMarket cap is 3X since thenProfit needs to be 3X to maintain PE as of then. Factor in some future expectations. As king profits taper down the commanded PE as wellDepicted in all COVID playsBiolidics high 88 cent they own the IP and selling test kits. In the end didn‚Äôt sell in US but bottomline has been boosted from sales in phil and Indon  assisted by ClearBridge. Nonetheless no more 88 cent glory days because of sheer number of stuckist at the high  a natural selling force by stuckist who wants to breakeven  lose less or make abit.,btohqsg
Market reacts to the unknown not public info. Retails bank on public info and extrapolate it to the unknown  giving a false sense of security they do know the future. When it doesn‚Äôt pan out (especially share price movement) all get bewildered and ask fellow stuckist what to doBoth at different ends of quicksand all sinking together. Hold hands will feel more secure,btohqsg
Is there a medtec group? Can someone add me in?,btohqsg
can someone add me too to MT group,btohqsg
How much we will know on the earning result next week,btohqsg
Ya I guess so there some info probably kept in dark  for public,btohqsg
Like the recent Parliament debate why suddenly pm Lee talk about SG must be ready for diseases x related to covid 19,btohqsg
Who will?If subscribe to conspiracy insider theory then can take hints from market. Even so will have people believe flushing to collect cheap for good resultsOr bb run road,btohqsg
Too far fetched to fathomLike how well prepared we are since sarsThe rest is clear to see,btohqsg
Haha big fish eat small fish,btohqsg
Making money is a skillLosing money is an art,btohqsg
Ya we will know next week when result made know to us,btohqsg
Ya either pm Lee think too far or there is some info kept public in dark,btohqsg
End of the day if u are in any counter... Make ur own judgment and not to rely too much on outside voice.. Every one have their own agenda. Of cos there are some shifu who really help like furion,btohqsg
VP not only doing test kit for medical segment right? It also says for global supply,btohqsg
Any one know about the evoluation of  virus? will be lighter or serioius?,btohqsg
Is there a MT group? Pls add me,btohqsg
Ya vp forefront medical not only do test kit and arrow medical now supply ppe in uk,btohqsg
U may go to their website to see,btohqsg
üëçüèª this is where the majority get blinded by ‚Äòcovid related business‚Äô you went so deep in i feel my previous statement was peanuts üòÇ,btohqsg
Cost of swab test charge by Gov.,btohqsg
U all keep forgetting one thing  all these announcement is late Jun  july or even august news. Do u think it has impact on the quarter ended 31/7!,btohqsg
ya all this info provided was before Mr heng advertise for them on late June and July where believe result made known before they managed to secure 5 to 7 contract for covid related medical stuff,btohqsg
We will see on the coming weeks probably it will get beneficial on q3 and may more on q4,btohqsg
This probably not only supply to local govt but to other country as well,btohqsg
Maybe for test kit but not other as they provide other stuff related covid 19,btohqsg
As past month due to global supply shortage of material of test kits so forefront medical by using 3D-printing and a manufacturing process known as injection moulding.This has given Singapore the capability and know-how to produce its own swabs.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt what ah heng has visited and said all under medical segment?,btohqsg
oh... vicplas also produced many other medical supplies like tube  rubber seals etc  which are in huge demand too by hosiptals/pharmaceutical factories etc.. as matter of facts  lesser competitors in this field  as these products required to be manufactured in the very high standards of ISO and GMP certified plants...  this is indeed required a very specialised knowledge ...üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
Just share info what has made known to public,btohqsg
This estimated 9.5m includes other medical devices like ppe?,btohqsg
I think they have kept them under very profile... may be bound by the agreement signed with customers   as they are ODM/OEM manufacturer...,btohqsg
I think is time to change to another topic   too much on this company... is a weekend... let's chill out...bro...,btohqsg
I‚Äôm no enemy of Vicplas. Somehow I feel there are a lot of info trying to prove a point im too bearish on their performanceI would be most glad to see some forecast or analysis on their coming results to have a fruitful discussion. Most glad to be wrong when provenMarket is and cannot be an egoistic ground because I care for profits more than ego and being right. Don‚Äôt know where I can encash ‚Äòbragging right‚ÄôWith respect to Vicplas medical segment seriously i have no idea exactly what they are producing  how much  to whom and where  projected growth  how much premium to command in times like this  their bargaining power  demand forecast etcIn an ideal world all info are available but then there won‚Äôt be extraordinary profits to be made when everything is knownEfficient market hypothesis?Your guess is as good as mine. Mine may be imperfect I will do a forecast and guesstimate. I got a number and when results is out  I will dissect it and see where I gone wrong and if very grossly wrong on the upside  it shows credibility of the company and underestimates by me and the marketThe differential in views is what makes the alpha / the extra pain where gone wrong.,btohqsg
bro  wow... u really can type such a long message within a few seconds...,btohqsg
How much PPE are they selling?How much did they pay for arrow medical?Existing owners have to writeoff debt to let Vicplas take overSelling ppe in times like this they have to writeoff to sellThey dumb or something?It may become a gem after restructuring and turnaround. For now it surely does notHear ppe all hyped up already.See UK hyped up once more.Definitely won‚Äôt appear in coming results. Already stated does not have any effect in the acquisition notice.,btohqsg
Bro just share info that not trying to prove a point or etc as there are too many news that perhaps may miss out or this also go to other counter as well. You are right on the report stated just that other information come late before the result made known,btohqsg
Errr not sureThey look dime a dozen generic products readily available in China and suchMaybe made in Singapore commands a premium. No idea,btohqsg
that is correct .. made in singapore is indeed a premium brand product with good quality and should command a premium price   esp in medical field  brand and quality are essential... thats how to differentiate the products/service from other countries...üòÑüëèüëè,btohqsg
Wow first time see so many ppl comment on VP... HAHAHA..,btohqsg
"""Test Kit Manufacturing:Forefront‚Äôs investment in cleanroom capacity and its manufacturing automation and qualitymanagement competencies made it a logical choice for commercialization of a test kit developed by acompany in Singapore. Automated equipment mixes and fills reagents in one clean room  while aseparate room is used to fill the positive controls in a biohazard safety cabinet. The reagents are thenpackaged into test kits and shipped.While the speed requirements of this project meant that Forefront Medical built its manufacturingsolution around specifications developed entirely by its customer  its regulatory team did support aconcurrent validation  registration and regulatory process""From their case study report",btohqsg
VP got growth. Next week see result.Got value.,btohqsg
Now market don't know see what...Good result also sell down,btohqsg
Tell me which stock can buy,btohqsg
It might be overvalue and that's y market sell down,btohqsg
Under value buy. Over value sell.,btohqsg
VP alot of people trapped high,btohqsg
I think from fy2018 till now will be more relevant for medical segment especially this yr 100% acquired arrow medical and produce new medical related stuff for covid 19 and with contracts secured,btohqsg
Now 0.34 almost 50% wipe off...Really no mercy,btohqsg
in vest based the fact not hope.,btohqsg
Note this have not add arrow medical into,btohqsg
Actually I see here ppl know how to count the EPsCount backwardU can assume VP can earn 30millions.30/500Slap a 12x pe is 70c.Can they earn 30millions?Then 74c can buy anot?,btohqsg
So isn't it over value sell and under value buy?,btohqsg
Closing of VP ..Also sell down..Next week maybe can see 2 series..,btohqsg
Vicplas results I think will not be spectacular due to drag from piping business. But with the new contracts and projects for medical devices  and the reopening of the construction sector  ya 2021 will be much better.,btohqsg
Will have a technical rebound. Now quite near to bottom,btohqsg
Notice a very heavy volume at closing matching for many counters  some up some dn. AEM eat up 2 to 3 pips  and SM throw dn with big volume. So VP not alone.,btohqsg
Nobody wants to hold over the weekend,btohqsg
Ya that why we see strong buy on Monday,btohqsg
Mondy  if MT down  VP down. if up    then all up.,btohqsg
If u think the growth rate is justifiable,btohqsg
MT  now only 4 pe  people don't dare to buy. VP how much?,btohqsg
Lol I need to see result ist. Whhaa,btohqsg
Actually is the theme play.Some yrs ago. Water stock in sgx trade at 25-30xpe.Now is merely 4x.So the glove counter. It's theme play. Ppl value it very high.Moving forward it will normalise.Part and parcel of business cycle.  That's all.,btohqsg
At least Mt has justifiable 100x yoy gain,btohqsg
Let alone say that‚Äôs only 1H result,btohqsg
Bro just check how come this not using 5 yrs chart as compared with vp,btohqsg
which water stock for water? maybe buy some for another play.,btohqsg
Becos MT has yoy result to compare,btohqsg
Yup that‚Äôs true.Don‚Äôt look at price.Try to understand the valuation of the business.,btohqsg
Good reminder that nothing goes on forever.,btohqsg
use minite fighure. don't show like this.,btohqsg
Look about same as vp that extracted base on 5 yrs. That y curious why vp use 5 yrs and medtec use last yr till todate,btohqsg
MT has generally average revenue/profit for past 4 years around the same. Only this 1H shoot up 100x,btohqsg
Alright where they started earlier than vp that started only on June onwards base on contract secured,btohqsg
Looking at VP net profit2016 - 5.382017 - 3.21 (-40% yoy)2018 - 3.62 (+11% yoy)2019 - 4.24 (+17% yoy)2020 - unknown,btohqsg
What your EP in VP if you don‚Äôt mind sharing ?,btohqsg
Yes correctAlot trapped in high and some even over 0.73,btohqsg
Next week result out probably we will have better view,btohqsg
VP boosted by heng...bb know..And he plays it,btohqsg
This year need +700%  can justify?,btohqsg
Waiting to enter. Have been watching for past 3 weeks. Waiting for the descending triangle to hit the bottom. Just did yesterday i think.,btohqsg
176m market capAt 34 centDo 8m. More than 20+ PEAwait another selldown?,btohqsg
What price would you enter ?,btohqsg
We will.know next week when result out also past result doesn't really benefit from medical segment,btohqsg
Forward earnings will be much better.,btohqsg
I am tracked in AspenAny advise for Aspen?,btohqsg
Also is a witching day.. So alot of counter affected.. U see sembmarine u know,btohqsg
All ppe and gloves forward all betterIf market caresSo next qn will be how much forward is factored into current price,btohqsg
U will ask why 0.44 no enter. Reason being the MACD has no sign of u turn (same case for MT). Yesterday hit low 345  almost touch ma50 342  maybe good to enter now.,btohqsg
Aspen still no substance.... Only a piece of land waiting to build a glove factory.Malaysia property don't look for booming any time soon.,btohqsg
Maybe I am wrong. But if hype on vicplus  then it is hyper hype on Aspen before the plunge,btohqsg
Vicplas is a good investment (at right price of course) as their core businesses are quite inversely correlated in times like this. Cyclical and non-cyclical. Sort of smoothen out earnings over time but low risk = low reward.So it could actually stay stagnant for many years to come. A few spikes and continue to hibernateLike progen style,btohqsg
Anyone vested in Asianhealth and IPS securex,btohqsg
I admit I tio stuck asianhealth. Heehee,btohqsg
I vested for their 2hospitals in Vietnam. Growth.,btohqsg
Asian healthcare no volume for.past week in stock resulting downtrend,btohqsg
How much is your EPCut lost now will lost quite a bit,btohqsg
U mean for asian or ips secure?,btohqsg
Vicplus is making profit every year  though not spectacular. There will be re rating due to the good growth of medical division. So the based price should be mid 20s to low 30s (near to current price). Just FA side.,btohqsg
Same as meI still hold on itWhat price you sell off for Asian healthcare,btohqsg
I though Temasek is inside Asianhealth and though Temasek will push the price upwards,btohqsg
The worst myth of the market,btohqsg
I cHow many shares you had for Asianhealth,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt push sembmar they push these crap,btohqsg
Probably I share again in business perspective.Venture after record break yr it retrace and normalise.Yearly they still rake in decent profit and gave out dividend.Similarly after medtec record yr it will retrace and normalise.Hope it helps,btohqsg
Medtecs dropped brought most other medical related stocks down including AHC.If can hold  over time should not be a problem,btohqsg
Ya if to keep probably may benefit as I also didn't vest alot,btohqsg
Yeah SMM share price drop and lower than the right issue of 20centsMake no sense,btohqsg
If don‚Äôt make sense why u don‚Äôt buy till sense prevails,btohqsg
I seeYou sell off at what price?My ep for ips is 108Any hope for ips to go upward to 105,btohqsg
So dun worry Mt investor.Medtec will still be around. 100mio net profit can let them substain for many years to come. ‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
Being around doesn‚Äôt feel very consoling haha,btohqsg
Now SMM is 0.16No sure this price can buy or not  ?,btohqsg
Today bro furion very active sia,btohqsg
Then the lost is not too much,btohqsg
Will MT price go up 1.80,btohqsg
Not just in piping perhaps u should go find out more on vp fore front medical and arrow medical,btohqsg
To see so many fellow retailers currently stucked at high of any medical / glove counters is quite saddening. You have to spot early at initial stage of the move. If miss  not necessary to force chase. Chasing mentality very risky. Should always wait for a better time to enter after retrace or when it‚Äôs trading at an ‚Äòarea of value‚ÄôJust sharing an example of@rczsjjsearly research on Vicplas ($0.13x) to look for potential counter at early stage by spotting activity . Instead of trying to defend your vested stocks or talking it up (which is pointless as retailers can really only move a stock price by tiny bit) . If it moves  it moves.Being stucked is unnecessary too if you guys practice proper SL. Honestly  all this can be avoided. If you think trading is to make easy money or get rich quick  I believe this will only get you in more money problems.,btohqsg
anyone here vested into VICPLAS (569) ?,btohqsg
got any insight? just found that they do medical supplies and maybe might be relevant with the covid19 play after the vaccine is out.,btohqsg
Close to the 5 year high. Very Low liquidity though. Fundamentals quite okay.,btohqsg
thanks! need to do more homework,btohqsg
Not vested yet. Just doing some homework over weekends   but seems like a buy for me. Their next financial report is in Sept. so i think got time to go in.,btohqsg
Nice do share with us your research bro üëç,btohqsg
Hey bro  any research you did for Vicplas ?,btohqsg
Vicplas is the main company. they have this 100% owned subsidiary called Forefront Medical. Apparently  given this covid19 situation  they are dealing with Diagnostic devices. This forefront medical is one of 4 companies under the sg government to mass produce those test kits/swab.,btohqsg
Thanks man. For Vicplas  News was out 13th July  price was about $0.113 then. Now moved to about $0.138. If retrace  I might consider joining in. Any further news is catalyst for move.HeySoon Guan (SG Yuan - Elliot Wave) Share Junctioncan share your chart for  Vicplas ? Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg

Show of faith by tang tang to bePutting in millions of her own $ to buy from open market.When Uncle Sam buying at 20 cent region she pays almost 40% higherA prime takeover candidate but surely no deal in near future or she will be accused of insider trading as she is ED and husband is chairman.,btohqsg
Is there any stipulated time frame that insiders cannot buy if they have knowledge of a possible offer coming ?,btohqsg
Hmm  good to know bro.Always had that thought that it had this possibility when bought it earlier on  along with it being quite undervalued and CB groceries demand,btohqsg
Can any kind soul add me to MT grpüôè thanks alot,btohqsg
If they make offer  what price u reckon they might make ? Uncle Sam likely form part of that consortium to take it private too I reckon.,btohqsg
If sam not part of consortium he won‚Äôt let go cheap,btohqsg
He always got special liking for food counters,btohqsg
Another candidate will be jb food,btohqsg
$0.49 quite steep. They surly wanna buy cheap though,btohqsg
Yea man  was he part of the team who took Super coffee private ?,btohqsg
May seem high but absolute amount needed to buy those outside their handsProbably the cash within is sufficient already,btohqsg
No he was part of those who sold out,btohqsg
Sam don‚Äôt privatise companies. He hold till get taken out,btohqsg
There is a MT group char ?,btohqsg
150mil cash approx in Hanwell balance sheet,btohqsg

345 is key chart support. Holds anotNo idea. I sucks at chartResults play only insider know.Maybe a bounce will be in place for Vicplas since medtecs also likely to have an oversold bounce. Which are both tradeable,btohqsg

Takeover cannot only based on NAV  earning potential more important.Anyway  to me a company NAV is no use unless the bulk is in cash n liquid assets. U can have big NAV  but if your cash flow is bad  the company can also goes under. Also  if business bad as O&G  u see all have big NAV few years bad  only to write down to 0 or negative.,btohqsg

looks like got fair bit of VP supporters out there,btohqsg
vicplas been discussed back on 5 and 11 Aug... it started out low volume and nobody dare to buy at 20cents... volume came in after it hits 30cents... i would say for people who are not vested in vicplas and looking to buy it... wait for results to be out,btohqsg
Like that need create many support groupsMSGTSGSSGRSG,btohqsg
Ya wait for results as information on forefront medical secure project   also mass produced 40million test kit  arrow medical secure provide ppe to Birmingham look like vp will likely gain earning from there n likely to bb,btohqsg
for the price now... they need to have increase in earnings 250% to maintain the same PE ratio pre-covid,btohqsg
their ppe i saround 45million to pvc pipe of 35million... so it's been discussed that this 35million is as good as half gone due to construction halt,btohqsg
Not sian meh every stock must have an auntie agony cornerWhen Chiong all shout here scared nobody knowWhen toh all hide in a group to cry and whine together,btohqsg
so unless the 45million medical has margin like maybe 20% and above... unlikely to see improvement on earnings... share price was at 14cents before the run up... u decide what's your EP,btohqsg
What is auntie agony corner mean?,btohqsg
My view is Can't base on past earnings as made know they into covid related medical on June 20,btohqsg
it was before that... i think back in april people mentioned about forefront medical on sharejunction alr,btohqsg
So base on past earning on pipe would be wrong info,btohqsg
But nevertheless somehow affected on pipeline business,btohqsg
yeap... so it's been discussed back in Aug... that the 45million medical device revenue will increase... but the 35million pvc pipe revenue will drop,btohqsg
Ya and forefront medical have a lot more to offer not just test kit   nasel swab n ppe,btohqsg
i was discussing with you... you still ask me call the boss,btohqsg
Please add me to MT group..üôèüôè,btohqsg
i think@acac86mentioned that you're from construction line... you should have a rough idea of how bad vicplas pvc pipe biz gonna get affected,btohqsg
Can someone add me into the MT group Pls!,btohqsg
Bro u no save my contact ah? Wah bad leh u.,btohqsg

I think med stocks under alot of pressure from vaccine news,btohqsg

I know. Last yr we had cny dinner at ritz calton ü§£,btohqsg
any comments on this asian healthcare?i saw that it had some healthcare acquisition collaboration with temaseknow the price drop close to the previous support of 18cents alr... profitable company that's at lelong price now... any comments?,btohqsg
not bad not bad... i not familiar with the vicplas people... i think contractors will be more familiar with them ba,btohqsg
Hence my optimistic bold assumptionPiping business breakevenAlso cant derive supernormal profits for the company,btohqsg
if they dont have the pvc pipe biz... current price still feel justifiable... but i think their pvc pipe will pull them down for this FY,btohqsg
Never thought to have any stop loss when you places this trade bro?Really important in trading to set stops.We were rally for a possible breakout when price at the $0.24/$0.245 level if the $0.235 can hold. But unfortunately it broke and cut most $0.22 .Still keep 50 lots for long term holdings.Long term should be okay IMO.Believe the players still in and medical / Gloves and there should some more upcoming play.When that happens  This will bring up the sentiments for other medical counters like this one,btohqsg
i guess it's time to buy the dip then,btohqsg
Anyone please advise if got Medtecs chat group? Pl add me thanks,btohqsg
U are right on the loss of the pipeline business so far we only know VP cut down production and mins labour so the net operating cost will be lower compared to past . Maybe is breakeven from their medical segment or maybe higher not sure perhaps coming week result will have better view,btohqsg
As at now we only know secure 7 project,btohqsg
Its not just about less profit. U need to check their nominal operating expenses. Even cut by half  that is a loss or cost to the company with only est 20-30% of the revenue. Only the coming QR can tell as todate there is nothing to be reference with.,btohqsg
I seeing at the net profit is only,btohqsg
Hi  please add me to Medtecs chat group too.,btohqsg
It may mins of 20% to 30% upcoming qr we all have better view,btohqsg
Of the operating cost for pipeline,btohqsg
so results expected to be so so only,btohqsg
U mean breakeven on pipingYa I assumed so. Which is very much unlikely.Factor in gov funding perhaps. Only proves how big a hole that‚Äôs coming soon,btohqsg
Yes CoZ they are not end sellers. Market price surge benefit them indirectly,btohqsg
breakdown for vicplas is given on page 111 for FY2019,btohqsg
Many ppls were stucked with Medtecs & Vicplas. I'll share my view on these then. Vicplas basically follow Medtecs as you can see from the similar pattern. Everyone knows that Medtecs is on the downtrend. But down until when & where? Let me tell you!!!.........I also don't know!... Lol. My guess is this. Medtecs has started to form a Falling Wedge pattern. This is a good pattern. As the two lines get closer to each other(or near apex)  then the chance of reversal will be on the way. I think the candles body got to close the gap. There's buying zone around 94.5-100. So probably price may drift there. High is 198. So if drop 50% will be around 99. Therefore I think when price come to around 99  there should be many buyers. My English no good so hopefully you all understand. To conclude  I believe a reversal or a good rebound will come after it hit around 99. MACD histogram currently show no positive sign. Just watch out for a positive histogram. MACD Histogram start to turn up means coming liao. Dyodd hah.,btohqsg
Piping $17 329k vs Med $29 836K.Net profit margin is around 7.7% (no insight as VP do not have detailed breakdown per segment).Operating expense also no insight. Let use same % as revenue: $7 350k = pipe $2 720k vs med $4 630k.Operating loss cannot be removed  even cut manpower assume 50% operating cost still = -$1 360k.With only 30% of revenue and 50% opex  u need to cover that cost from the covid business profit. Only then  it will be MORE profitable than last quarter result.,btohqsg
assumption is that medical device revenue increase 50%... margin increased 10% due to covid increased demand,btohqsg
piping assume no loss no gain... remove from equation,btohqsg
Tot someone mention add 80 headcount to medical just nowClearly I didn‚Äôt read ah heng posts on Vicplas,btohqsg
profits wont double... by right share price wont double,btohqsg
Yes. More headcount boost revenue. But whether profitable is another question.,btohqsg
There is no track record to compare.,btohqsg
Also  their FR don‚Äôt break down different sector‚Äôs expenses. So its too speculative.,btohqsg
I thought Medtec went this way üò¢,btohqsg
Thanks for the charts and great explanation üëç,btohqsg
Let our brain rest. Result out next week. Who correct who wrong doesn‚Äôt matter. Winning the trade is the key.,btohqsg
so vp falling wedge till roughly wat px ?,btohqsg
Ya as we here to share informationüòÅ,btohqsg
wait until they ÂºÄÁâå lo... for now we are all speculating,btohqsg
wud be interesting to see how both vp and mt perform on mon,btohqsg
On MT - can we deduce that based on the charts given  $1 is the major support and hence  major reversal for MT?,btohqsg
break up or down important cross road,btohqsg
Too much fear being spread around in sj are telegram groups,btohqsg
Ppl probably be fomo near $2,btohqsg
MT replied not aware of any reason for price movement in SGX query....at least will calm some nerves as no negative surprises,btohqsg
Exact same qn and reply on 13 july,btohqsg
Mt dun even bother to draft a better reply lol,btohqsg
hope MT rebound. though i don‚Äôt have Vicplas.....it will improve general sentiment for all medical stocks,btohqsg
they bochup cos tw mit they steady,btohqsg
Yes..My nagging feeling.....since all these Telegram chat groups were set up  it's even easier to swing sentiments and trap retailers....I wonder at times if these groups do more harm than benefits,btohqsg
I think bb aren't so free to do this....probably just shortist retailers,btohqsg
Same same .. for sharejunction. DYODD,btohqsg
u think tw px drop much ?,btohqsg
Dun need to refer to tw chart...their market isn't as fluid as sgx,btohqsg
Only small amt of mt shares are available in tw,btohqsg
Lack of liquidity causes big upswing and downswing in tw,btohqsg
was there any query by Taiwan stock exchange for price movement in Taiwan? it has been going limit up for a number of days,btohqsg
No need to do themselves..just sent a few runners into chats can achieve the same....of coz this is just my guess.. I'm not a BB nor am I an experience retailer trader....I'm just thinking how easy it is to plan messages or spread rumours nowadays,btohqsg
not sure if they are so ‚Äòon‚Äô as ours,btohqsg
Ppl who entered high...on tenterhooks now....most easily influenced,btohqsg
tw side dun seem to have that fear factor,btohqsg
maybe cos they know the co very well‚Äî-home ground,btohqsg
Read mt response on price difference,btohqsg
It is not as liquid as bursa or other exchanges....dun compare tg bursa and sgx movement,btohqsg
guys what‚Äôs the dividend distribution date for mt,btohqsg

Maybe their retiree favourite investment? Lol,btohqsg
pay on or around 25 Sep,btohqsg
0.01166 wow too late buy 1166 today haha,btohqsg
It's sad...but many retailers dun do sufficient research and not much conviction to hold....easily swayed by telegrams and sj,btohqsg
yes sad but this is the reality of life.,btohqsg
what would be an appropriate price to load Vicplas? support at 0.34? sorry i lame at charts,btohqsg
Ya lo.. If buy vp.. Have to dyodd,btohqsg
support both med and vp can? huat to both,btohqsg
procurri  aem they collected more than  30%; ISDN ran too fast. Their 30% target not there yet..and they most probably have a budget for ISDN collection... so this selling is a good method to depress for further collection..just 2 cts.,btohqsg
agree .....as there was no negative surprise news announcement after query,btohqsg
MT x VP % gain comparison  1 year.,btohqsg
VP better have at least 400% yoy results..,btohqsg
See MT chart got some support only many machiam confidence comes back & want to buy already. There are so many counters in SGX. Why die die must MT & VP?. SGX only got 2 listed companies?. I saw someone said got MT Telegram group some more. When stocks market become a fan club?. üôà,btohqsg
They not buying in open market.No idea what‚Äôs their next move.CK also not willing to cede much control over.,btohqsg
Reposted your charts many thank meI direct the thx back to u lol,btohqsg
They closed at 130pm so monday see if the selling here affects there,btohqsg
they can use a proxy to buy and then do a married deal just like the 10m share they bought at between 23-24cts. So lets see over the coming months.,btohqsg
Similar case in raffles edu most likely,btohqsg
if taiwan side thinks we are irrational selling  they won‚Äôt follow. anyway they only have fewer TDRs in greater demand there,btohqsg
yup life is abt making choices...if we do this  if we do that....lol,btohqsg
A lot are addicted . Including me.,btohqsg

By Tng Kim Bock on 19/9/20*_‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny how humans can wrap their minds around things and fit them into their version of reality._‚Äù*The ST carried a near full page report on 19/9/20 titled ‚Äú_SGX seeks to build multi-asset trading platform on Asian growth._‚Äù It prompted me to share the following thoughts.1.  _There is nothing new under the sun_. Ecclesiates 1:9It‚Äôs the same thing over and over again ‚Äì multi asset  derivatives  Reits.  IPOs have dried up  companies are delisting when they can and volumes remain thin  yet Loh Boon Chye (LBC) said in the article that ‚Äú_having the highest number of IPOs is not the only guage of success_.‚Äù*What then is a drought of IPO a guage of?*LBC also said that ‚Äú_Liquidity begets liquidity_‚Äù and ‚Äú_the derivatives market and reits sector are creating the depth needed to boost overall trading activity._‚ÄùSomehow this depth and boost is not obvious to many of us and try as we may  we just dun see the liquidity that was supposed to be begotten.Let‚Äôs look at some past headlines in the BT that speak for themselves since LBC became SGX CEO in July 2015.‚Äú_SGX new boss sets his sights on bringing in big IPOs_‚Äù BT 30/7/15‚Äú_New SGX CEO targets digital  consumer IPOs: boosting liquidity also a major focus_‚Äù BT 5/11/15‚Äú_SGX  Third500 to build emerging-growth pre-IPO  IPO market._‚Äù BT 28/2/18‚Äú_SGX eyes global partnerships  growth beyond IPOs_‚Äù BT 12/3/18‚Äú_SGX says IPOs picking up‚Ä¶_‚Äù BT 23/4/18.‚Äú_SG‚Äôs shelved IPOs pile up as Summit  Qualitas struggle_‚Äù Bloomberg 24/4/18.Whatever happened to LBC‚Äôs plans?  Oh yes  a ‚Äúmulti-asset trading platform!2.    Minimum Trading Price of $0.20 (MTP) rule.SGX introduced the MTP rule in Feb 2015 prior to LBC coming into office.  Compliance was mandated by 1/3/16 later extended.  June Sim  Head Listing Compliance said then that the rationale was ‚Äú_to nudge companies trading below that price level ($0.20) to improve their business fundamentals._‚Äù (BT 7/5/15).Throughout 2015 and early 2016  many spoke up and wrote to the press about the irrationality of the idea.Yet on 20/11/15  June Sim said in a letter to the BT that ‚Äú_MTP was introduced to improve the quality of the stock market and reduce the risk of excessive speculation.  Share consolidation is one way for companies to comply with the requirement._‚ÄùIn a pontification and what seem liked reading out from a textbook  she went on to say ‚Äú_The fundamentals of a company are not impacted by share consolidation._‚Äù Was she confused?  Did she forget what she said on 7/5/15?What she failed to understand was that we are talking about a market  not theory  and after share consolidation  there was now more ‚Äòmeat‚Äô for market to go short on a stock decimating shareholders wealth further and for some eventually wiping them out.Many small investors and moms and pops saw their wealth simply disappear.  Markets can be reflexive by nature and the more the shares are shorted  the more the fundamentals of the company are adversely affected. Contrary to what June Sim believed  business fundamentals for those companies never improved.When LBC came into office in July 2015  did he understand these things and if he did  did he not see it fit and have the courage of leadership to stop the madness?After a few extensions for compliance with the MTP  SGX finally announced the ditching of MTP in 2019.  On 29/11/19  not 1 but 2 articles were written by 2 different journalists in the BT.‚Äú_Ditching MTP rule is about listening to the market_‚Äù BT 29/11/19‚Äú_In nod to market  SGX seeks to scrap minimum trading price rule. A public consultation will be held  and a decision will come in the first half of 2020; market watchers welcome SGX‚Äôs willingness to change course._‚Äù BT 29/11/19.Those 2 articles couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth and they hurt.Throughout 2015 and early 2016  many pleaded but SGX didn‚Äôt listen.,btohqsg
To say that SGX was ‚Äú_listening to the market_‚Äù does not help in accountability and lessen the pain after much shareholders‚Äô wealth had been wiped off ‚Äì for many  their hard earned savings.3.   The madness continuedOn 17/12/15  June Sim stated in a letter to the BT that ‚Äú_SGX has introduced a number of initiatives to help investors  including retail investors.  These include the 100 share board lots  lower clearing fees and dynamic circuit breakers.  The MTP requirement too is aimed at helping investors by reducing excessive speculation.  All these help improve the SG stock market in the long run._‚ÄùIn her concluding statement in that letter  she said ‚Äò‚Äô_we look forward to working together towards a more dynamic and robust SG stock market._‚ÄùYou be the judge whether she achieved her objective?In justifying the reduction of board lot size  SGX said ‚Äú_Blue chip equities are now affordable with reduction in lot size from 1000 to 100 shares._‚ÄùIn reality  the 100 shares board lot serves only to make it cheaper for people behind algorithms to test market.  And from time immemorial  blue chips in board lots of 1000 have always been affordable to small investors in SG.4.   Minority ReportTan Boon Gin (TBG)  Chief Regulatory Officer  in an interview published in 29/2/16  stated that ‚Äú_SGX as the frontline regulator is perfectly placed to be a disruptor._‚ÄùThe BT summarised the many words he used into a report headlined ‚Äú_SGX‚Äôs approach aims to stop crimes early_.‚Äù TBG believes in preventing misconduct before it gets to the enforcement stage.  If TBG was a fan of the movie Minority Report  he either didn‚Äôt see it to the end or didn‚Äôt understand it.Why would anyone want to list a business that he painstakingly build up only to be delivered a message that he would be watched for potential misdemeanours?5.   TieringOn 17/7/18  BT reported ‚Äú_SGX takes carrot and stick approach to set good corporate behaviour._‚Äù TBG had introduced the ‚Äútiering‚Äù approach at a seminar on 16/7/18.  _Tier 1 companies are the law abiding or rule compliant companies._TBG said ‚Äú_The challenge here is how to motivate them to do even better.  This requires a different kind of investigation and accountability._‚Äù‚Äú_Tier 3  the bottom tier are likely the most notorious‚Ä¶.where some form of fraud and other criminal behaviour has taken place  *or is taking place_* (Minority Report again?).‚ÄùIf you are getting the feeling that listcos and their stakeholders are being treated like kids who have to be taught to behave  I don‚Äôt blame you.  How on earth anyone can surmise that this will make SG equities market attractive is befuddling to put it mildly.  Why would any entrepreneur  by listing in SG  allow himself to be treated this way?*In attempting to kill the weeds  could it be that the entire wheat field was killed?*6.   Don‚Äôt worry  as LKY said ‚Äúwe punch above our weight‚Äù.On 17/8/18  Chew Sutat  Head of Equities and Fixed Income said: ‚Äò‚Äô_SGX is unlike HKEx  which has China as its huge hinterland; SGX in fact punches above its weight._‚ÄùAnother headline also quoted him ‚Äú_SGX eyes billion-dollar Reits  consumer  tech  healthcare IPOs in coming months._‚ÄùThat was 2018  where are we today?  In trying to punch above our weight  did we punch ourselves?*‚Äú_More people would learn from their mistakes if they weren‚Äôt so busy denying them._‚Äù*,btohqsg
Can call and ask him for the result next Friday ? ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Is there a medtecs grp chat ? Can someone add me ? Thank u :) I am a longist,btohqsg
Taiwan said MT financial results out in  23 Oct 20,btohqsg
Hi is there one ? Can add me,btohqsg
ÊûóÂ¶àÂ¶à also base on our email reply from email receive from management,btohqsg
I already told them is profit guidance or results forecast,btohqsg
But no matter what  got announcements better than nothing,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing....good article üëç SGX is the worst performing market in this region. Top mgmt dont know how to run a bourse for the benefit of investors - low PEs  low liquidity....That is why a slew of companies privatised like OSIM  Breadtalk - the value of their companies are not reflected in their share prices.,btohqsg
MT in 1H forecasted a stronger 2HSo 3Q if don‚Äôt forecast into 2021 then also don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs there to update,btohqsg
They give some indication of 2021 orderbooks also 50/50,btohqsg
Just my personal thinking  SGX looks bad now I think also because US side keep go up. Seems that a lot of people goes to US side. If US side cool down  I would think fund start to flow back. Just my 2 cents worth.,btohqsg
Is worrying to see usa.. market n economy are disconnected.. if correction come it will be a painful fall,btohqsg
Their earning power has no question. No need to disputeSame as VP also. No need recycle all the straits times articles or arrow medical acquisition or ah heng visits etc.Except for self consoling there‚Äôs not much usage tooThe key is when the demand and hence supernormal profits will taper downAnd what to do after that?In their lifetime they have never made so much money in such a short time. In fact medtecs in 2 years probably made more than since incorporation till now. Or maybe 1 year alone.Reference to Cimb ug report  the analyst forecast 2 years profit surge and derive a 15X PE based on the climax earning year fy21 to derive a target priceThen just keep shifting 2021 profit figure to go for higher and higher target priceDon‚Äôt know which valuation book teach one. I find it shallow at best and or irresponsible at worst.If want do a proper valuation model  forecast to tapering profitability then do a perpetual discounted model back to present etc. good or bad is beside the point.Don‚Äôt do a forecast for next 2 years and that‚Äôs it. Akin to plucking numbers from airBack to medtecs. Why did I refer to ug? Because similarly gloves and ppe plays will eventually encounter tapering profits down  like it or not. The stories about vaccine will not reach whole world so fast  hygiene expectations higher blah blahNothing wrong with that. I still see that as self consoling. Profits taper down need not be pre-covid era but much lower than these 1-2 years is tapering downWhich justify a revaluation downwards. Like it or notThey key for these companies is how they handle their supernormal profits because the party will end  what‚Äôs after that?1. Expand operations worldwide and enhance their existing business  capacity  product range  quality etc. risky as the capacity is maxed at peak periods. Any expansion may result in prolong slack and idle downtime.2.  Return bumper dividends back to shareholders. I feel this will be the ideal way to manage the extra cashflow above operational needs3.  Diversification. Made money then some genius will approach them with ideas on how to spend their new found cash. Acquire some crappy companies or assets that are not complementary to existing business. May also call it diworsification. Probably the worst idea of all 3. Diversification cost is much cheap on individual level  than corporate.,btohqsg
US share PE is very high. But again  most company list there is global company. Even those big China MMC is there. But again  PE can be so high till few K  For some company.,btohqsg
YeahMe also had such thinkingBut cut now is going lost alotHeart pain,btohqsg
Those PE few K one I really don‚Äôt know how those company going to earn back,btohqsg
I think u got a lot of self reflection to do.I see u asking advice on a chain of stuckist counters. When happen too many times I think you are the issue not the counters,btohqsg
Yes broSorry about this but me no sure what to doLost really feel no goodMaybe you did not lost so you won't understand,btohqsg
Â§±Ë¥•ÊòØÊàêÂäü‰πãÊØçÔºålose is the mother of success.,btohqsg
Pls la I have lost multifold of what u have. Don‚Äôt come complain sob stories u hear mine u will be very glad u are in current position,btohqsg
younger support older  the later comer support the earlier comer in market   that''s healthy.,btohqsg
The point is money is lostHow to lose itLearn from it or repeat itIs own choice,btohqsg
I noticed the same too...U probably have to think why u bought these shares in the first place.... did u do the research before buying or just follow forum chat groups to buy thinking to make quick buck.... if so then it's just gambling... should stop this first,btohqsg
Those who came into market instantly made a lot and think is easyIs just waiting to be slaughtered for the ignorance and complacency,btohqsg
Most fall out. Some survive some licking wound some lurk around some learn and come back from it,btohqsg
No right or wrong. Some just aren‚Äôt suited to play the mental game in market.,btohqsg
Must learn to cut lost. I have lost $10k this month . If I never cut lost on MT and riverstone . I would have lose about 40k in total . Even sta I also cut loss at $1.50 series and lost about $4k.,btohqsg
But if u find yourself blaming whole world but ownselfU prob should just leave,btohqsg
if one lose from young to old in market  that can tell not suited. maybe one time gain back all lose.,btohqsg
Then do your own research about the stocks first to determine your own target price.. see if u wana hold or cut loss...What's important is u don't simply go around asking what's others target price... everyone has different positions that they buy into n different holding power,btohqsg
Nothing to sorry to me. U never lose my money. Is your own or maybe family or even kids education funds or what.Be sorry to themAfter the sorry  decide what‚Äôs next? Cut and get out of marketOr stay and become a better man in market?Own choice have to live with it,btohqsg
Only MT can ... the best performing stock I have seen... buy at lowest and sell at highest . $3000 investment return $198000,btohqsg
Not me. I wish is me . Haha,btohqsg
I think he meant option 3 is good too.,btohqsg
i small buy at 8C  unload all the way and only 3.5K to get the peak.,btohqsg
Ok your freedom of speech. Won‚Äôt reply u further.,btohqsg
Ok thanks for your advise.Will take note,btohqsg
Hi BroI did not do any research when buy them  I just follow forum chat to buyThis is my mistake now I realiseThank for your advise,btohqsg
Then just hold on...Last week mkt sentiment is so bad - not worth to cut now. CB price dropped slightly in tandem with overall medical counter.Sell when the sentiment is better and you can get a better price.Dont think it will get lower than what it is right now.,btohqsg
Me same same. I also learn from mistake .,btohqsg
I haven't learn to cut loss very strictly so far. also failed to get the profit quite well.,btohqsg
Groups have plenty of info going around. Some are facts some are views.Views will easily be biased. Someone vested will surely cheer for own stock regardless of movement. Nobody will curse own stock unless stop loss already.So a painful lesson but gonna learn from it. Price tag is slapped by market,btohqsg
"can you understand""Êó†ÊãõËÉúÊúâÊãõ‚ÄúÔºü maybe oneday you will have own stratigies for earn money.",btohqsg
Hi sisWow big profitCongratulationsYou really smartHappy for you.But MT now drop so much,btohqsg
Everyone here risking hard earned money. Nobody had it easy just got say or not.U aren‚Äôt the first nor the last and probably first time getting such shock so asking for help is natural. However no matter what help  no matter how bullish people are on your holdingsWhen they drop u are the one facing the losses not them,btohqsg
Humans are driven by greed...yours truly here included. Made a few rounds from CB...then decided to trade in one more time....of course  now stuck....,btohqsg
Every one here know lose is more people  earn is less people. has the preparations.,btohqsg
The prob is all think they are the minority,btohqsg
Of couse la  i also want to be the minortiy. otherwise  no play here le,btohqsg
Many peoples were laughing to the bank when a 20 cents share got fried to almost $2.00 by operators....,btohqsg
Thanks bro for your adviseWhat you say is correct,btohqsg
Ya surely. But easier get humbled by market then realise not so special afterall,btohqsg
I quote example ... not me la. Lol.,btohqsg
dn't play too big  play in the lose range can afford.,btohqsg
No worries . I also wish I have this foresight and luck. Lol.,btohqsg
Now the situation is  MT  VP  gloves  all want speculate once more to have a big bite. everybody know finally the price will go north.,btohqsg
Ok  sis you willYour time will come,btohqsg
Bro have you cut your aspen? Or you still holding?,btohqsg
Thanks for taking time to pen this well-thought and analytical post.üëç,btohqsg
I still holding my aspen as I hope it can go up abit before cut,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.üëçGood food for thought,btohqsg
A friend of my who is old time trader  he went in MT at 10 cents. He went out at 30 cents. He did not expect this counter to goreng so high. He said this counter start out as goreng only. Just that the earning really shoot off the roof  this goreng lasted so long. Still it went from few cents to current price is super impressive. But he never touch this counter Liow as he also don‚Äôt know when the goreng will end. His view is this still a few cents counter before Covid. I went in play at $1.60  he tell me to FIFO. Once the BB decide to draw out  the price may free fall. He told to remember to put stop lost if I play any penny. No one knows when BB draw out.,btohqsg
I play a bit only at 1.6,btohqsg
After hearing his warning I dare no play.,btohqsg
what are you thinking when you buy at 1.6?,btohqsg
That time MT is still good,btohqsg
I see from 1.5 keep moving up.,btohqsg
during the first rising. not the draw back. good timing.,btohqsg
after you sold  it can up to 1.9  how do you feel?,btohqsg
Until all thinking to sell at $2!,btohqsg
I still look at this share. Until 1.98 flush down,btohqsg
I still remember $2 sell wall is huge,btohqsg
yes  i also thing can touch 2.,btohqsg
Once touch $1.98 retraced so fast  I quickly sold at 1.92! Hehe,btohqsg
i thought will tract bakc to about 1.88  then go out to 2,btohqsg
I using tiger  cannot put stop lost on SGX. So I also scare. I newbie  and some player. I just trying to learn from everyone. So my talk with my friend scare me. So I decide not to take risk.,btohqsg
Is good u overtake ur greed,btohqsg
I still stuck with share like SIA which I went in $4+ but never cut lost. So I scare. Also after my friend tell MT used to worth less then 10 cents. He say when he in at 10 cent  price is up already. 30 cent he run Liow. If keep till now(at that time 1.8) can change sport car Liow.,btohqsg
Just sharing view no offend to anyone.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt be surprise many still earn big $ here,btohqsg
52 weeks Low about $0.03 I think,btohqsg
The boss of MT confirm  I think MT before Covid is like 5 cents. Even now it worth 20X,btohqsg
I check Liao before covid is $0.027... been quite flat for past 5 years,btohqsg
But he never buy either .,btohqsg
But his ‚ÄúË∫´ÂÆ∂‚Äù now different Liow.,btohqsg
Just thinking  his company profit up so much  how much dividend will he give to shareholder.,btohqsg
MT is one of my freezer. 5.5 cent buy then 2-3 years later  2.c,btohqsg
You keep till now? Then ‚ÄùÁ±≥Ê°∂‚Äù Liow.,btohqsg
Depends on how much he hold la,btohqsg
Very insightful detailed views and pointersüëç Thanks bro,btohqsg
If holding 1k/million lot then hoseh,btohqsg
20c should be SARS period right,btohqsg
penny stock. seldom though go up 20C,btohqsg
only ISDN  go from about 20C to 1$. in a month,btohqsg
Ya  is because of virus then become windfall for them,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know. I think if you hold 1M share cost at 3 cent. 30 cent also you run Liow. That is like 200k+ profit. I don‚Äôt think you are still so cool to stay till $2.,btohqsg
Unless you are the BB who is doing the goreng.,btohqsg
yeah  run vey early. now only 3.5K share left to see the door.,btohqsg
I bought 0.11x  see go up to 0.15 I run oledi,btohqsg
That‚Äôs my 1st bought for MT,btohqsg
penny  normally  go in quick and out quick if earn money.,btohqsg
if lose  will cut some then keep some.,btohqsg
He got about 20% shares. He shld give handsome dividend,btohqsg
0.11 hold till 1.92 confirm is BB.,btohqsg

As Long as money in pocket can Liao,btohqsg
The mistake we sometimes make is always want to sell highest,btohqsg

Imagine those who see their profits from MT vaporise,btohqsg
