Hello  does anyone know why does Singapore have no Supra mk4? I did some research and did find some supras that existed back in the early 2000s but now it just seems to have disappeared. Would really like to know what happened to them,btohqsg
i think most of them got scraped,btohqsg
theres 1 in a workshop i saw before,btohqsg
but iam not sure where that is,btohqsg
I saw there was a post on tiktok i think  there was a heavily modded supra at sentosa cove  the carpark there,btohqsg
there used to be like 4-5 otr,btohqsg
this should be the last one,btohqsg
we had a few on the roads in early 2000s  but the last one got totaled and now we have ~10 mk4s but none are registered,btohqsg
they can technically still be driven on the roads with a test or trade plate,btohqsg
bt im nt sure about that ah,btohqsg
Lemme try to find it sir,btohqsg
Eh pai seh  it was a youtube link,btohqsg
