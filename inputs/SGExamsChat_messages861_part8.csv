Taking o level once in school only. If you can't pass. Cannot retain. You have to go and retake on your own,btohqsg
school gives you more guidance but the exam is the same,btohqsg
for private  you get assigned an exam center that's a sec school near your home,btohqsg

Lol so I decided to stop at Poly atm,btohqsg
Think you can work few yrs to decide what you want first or what course you interested,btohqsg
But don't take too long..because after that you might have more commitments..and you might not continue,btohqsg
Which also means by right you can earn..eg 1 yr you by right you can 40k.. but cause you can't make up your mind..your lose 40k++,btohqsg

Because you have too many commitments..,btohqsg
