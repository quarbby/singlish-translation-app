Yes or you topup in cash lo,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt matter what deposit im referring to. Any payment you make  can tell them how you want to split.,btohqsg
So only after HDB drains out the CPF  will the balance amount be given as loan?,btohqsg
Decision between the partnersAnyway  there was a person in this group who shared about his situation but subsequently deleted his postGist - he is SC  partner is notHe received grant but partner did notSo  both of them were supposed to pay 50/50 for the BTOHis partner paid the deposit through her CPF and he paid his share using both grant and less than 10k cash,btohqsg
Up to you and your partner on how to finance the flat... Drain CPF  keep 20k in OA  loan or cash etcIf you are concerned about you paying little for the BTO  you should be discussing about that with your partner,btohqsg
Sorry to ask.If our loan is high enough  will HDB still make it a point to drain out our CPF OA?,btohqsg
You can choose to keepminimum20k in your OAAlso  whether or not your loan is high enough  you should also consider if you can pay back the loanEsp if you guys plan to renovate  have kids or maybe other plans like one quits job and both live on a single income  start a business etc... All these are $$$,btohqsg
I mean  getting a house is supposed to be a happy thingWouldn't want to fight with partner due to money for the house next time... That is why have to carefully think through,btohqsg
Erm  i thought is minimum ü§î,btohqsg
I primarily see 20k as the recommended amount  ha ha,btohqsg
Like  keep in OA to service the loan  in case loss of income / CPF contribution stuff like that,btohqsg
Oh... If like that  sounds like can be minimum or maximum too?,btohqsg
A friend also said 20k is maximum but didn't quite understand his explanation... üòÇü´¢,btohqsg
Regardless of loan quantum  hdb will drain cpf oa first before disbursing loan. You can only choose to keep max 20k,btohqsg
Ah thank you! This is clearer to me now,btohqsg
I see. This is clear now. Thank you!,btohqsg
OA can be wiped out? i thought have to retain 20k either way?,btohqsg
oh so can put OA to zero la. the 20% downpayment can use cpf? usually the downpayment is made upon appointment in aug 24 (june 24 bto)? so the wiping out of OA is done upon key collection after 5 yrs when the project TOP right? asking about timelines becasue i use cpf oa buy tbill so working out timelines and funds,btohqsg
First appointment option fee cashSecond appointment down payment CPF (will know the % on first appointment) with the use of gains if availableKey collection ( wiping CPF before HDB loan),btohqsg
Downpayment  stamp duty  conveyance etc - can use CPFFirst appointment - pay option fee in cashSecond appointment - typically 6 - 9 months later  sign lease  pay depositIf eligible for EHG  it will be credited before your second appointment date,btohqsg
ah ok. thanks thanks! will create a gantt chart so i dont forget. so for now can reinvest the returned tbill funds in cpfia (bought end of the month 6mths ago so if dont reinvest now will lose 2mths. haha),btohqsg
FYI for Jun BTO  you will only receive ballot results by Aug.Ballot results differs from flat selection.For Dec 2023 launch  selection started from late Mar 2024For Feb 2024  only Tanjong Tree(Hougang) started selection on 25 Jun (other projects no movement yet),btohqsg
For flat selection  can monitor from SM's unofficial tracker too...https://t.me/btoapptdates,btohqsg
I wonder how the queue number allocated? Though some % goes to 1st timer  2nd timer etc  will hdb actually let 1st timer (starting queue no. 1.....last number) to select their units first  then start 2nd timer (with queue no.1) etc?,btohqsg
Or concurrently: means tgere are different sets of queue numbers.when 1st timer (1st in the queue) & 2nd timer (1st in the queue)  otger categories (1st in the queue) to choose the unit?,btohqsg
There's only 1 set of queue number,btohqsg
How about MCPS   ethnic quota etc ?,btohqsg
all same set of queue no.,btohqsg
ethnic quota is alr factored in when they release queue no.,btohqsg
Hi  if during key collection appointment  we need to pay a big lump sum of cash of more than $100k  what are the payment methods available? By Nets  credit card or cheque?,btohqsg
If remember correctly HDB only accepted Nets and cash cheque order,btohqsg
Cashier's orderNETS  may have to check if any limits imposed,btohqsg
Is this what u are looking for?,btohqsg
Example bro.. rough schedule and estimated figures,btohqsg
@thumper9223and@nylecojnatsome musings about ethnic quota from SM,btohqsg

Omg thanks@purrevilfor replying! I can't wait for key collection! üòç,btohqsg
Ya!! Super excited! Usually key collection is how long after this roadshow?,btohqsg
"No problem! Congrats!!!Not sure how long after the roadshow that you will get news of key collection but  yeah  HDB organizes them for BTOs which will be handed over to the new owners ""soon""Anyway  let me try ask another group if they have info on how ""soon"" üòÖüòÖ",btohqsg
Maybe i should volunteer with HDB for these roadshows...Free foodüòÇüòÇü§≠ü´¢,btohqsg
A member from another group shared that her estate roadshow was end April  key collection started end May and will complete end AugustI didn't ask her which or how big her estate is thoughVaguely remember some people getting virtual tour of the BTO apartment before key collection tooBut don't know if they are generic ones or specific to their unit numberMaybe can also look up defect checkers  other than sourcing for reno,btohqsg
This sounded promising!! Hav been waiting since 2018.. I wish it can b v soon cos I m tired of sending my kid to hongwen everyday hahahaah,btohqsg
Hi  idk if this is relevant to this group. Was hoping someone can tell me if i do not want to put in any cash monthly for loan repayments  do I put the same number for both Monthly Income and Monthly Financial Commitments columns? Thanks alot!,btohqsg
