I think is fair la  you buy at lower price compared to other brand  when sell also lower than other brand,btohqsg
nowadays demand for skoda increasing cuz of the competitive price compared to other continent brands,btohqsg
Yeah this is definitely fine  just that worst case if dealer throw u paper value when want to tradein and change car.. thats the one that will kill 😂,btohqsg
Somemore coe go up so much if buy 2nd hand skoda or peugot now with low paper value  next time want sell or tradein sure die haha,btohqsg
"For resale usually the expected value is ""current coe value + Parf value"". Anything else is a plus.",btohqsg
Yeah if this is the case then not so bad hahha,btohqsg
When i bought my cit 1.5yrs ago. The avg dep is abt 12-13k. Peu is abt 13-14k. Sienta was then abt 13k and freed 14k,btohqsg
Currently cit is abt 15.5-16.5 avg (petrol variant) and peu is abt 16.5-17.5. Petrol sienta and carens are now only 14k avg,btohqsg
Dealer now quite keen to take in coz of the high takeup rate. Avg 1 cit sold every 3 days. Petrol variant sold even faster,btohqsg
Wa 1 cit every 3 days is quite impressive haha,btohqsg
Mazda 5 sold 60 in 90 days and bmw 216 sold 82 in 90 days. Avg 1 daily,btohqsg
Ok la not bad already. Until now some old bird still think can only buy toyota or honda. If go luxury only go for bmw and merc,btohqsg
Shouldn't Cheong in the first place when it's amber. Supposed to slow down,btohqsg
Actually all supposed to slow to stop,btohqsg
Not sure about specific models but at least last 2 yrs cit petrol cars brand new sold avg 2k/yr  mazda petrol cars about avg 33k/yr. Based on this figures.. cit 1 every 3 days in resale mkt is about 6% resold a year whereas mazda  60 every 90 days represents 0.7% resold a year.. so yeah pretty liquid resale market for cit imo haha,btohqsg

Expert here. May I ask which type is quiet n durable for suv car ?? Thank you very much,btohqsg
Think not moving and dealers cutting losses?,btohqsg
Then again need to see consignment to nonconsignment % to determine also,btohqsg
Probably people expecting to drop next bidding,btohqsg
Prob listed too long. Value depreciate w time. The COE n PARF decaying as time goes by,btohqsg
It will come to a time where they will export out,btohqsg
Dont think they will keep e car for too long also,btohqsg
Yah but if owner wanna sell no one wanna buy also a sign,btohqsg
Some cars i see list damn long alr,btohqsg
Cos owners usually set unrealistic pricing ma,btohqsg
Even agent sell used car also cheaper thn consignment.,btohqsg
Rare cars consignment can uds. Those common cars also on consignment at high prices..who will buy sia. Plus mileage going up everyday,btohqsg
Use this for grab will kena cursed bo?,btohqsg

Hi fellas nice to be here.,btohqsg
Do you think Merc C180K or CGI COE car worth buying?,btohqsg
COE car got more risk of breakdown and then u need to pay to repair,btohqsg
I rented one from shariot before,btohqsg
where swift sport manual 🤤 🤤,btohqsg
But those with attractive Depre usually require buyer with higher down payment. Buying 3 year old car have better depre than 7 year old car.The problem is that 3 year old car Downpayment is much higher than 7 year old car,btohqsg
but i think after a year leg tired liao,btohqsg
A to b car how to corner 😂,btohqsg
Think I saw Julian in Msia jn,btohqsg
