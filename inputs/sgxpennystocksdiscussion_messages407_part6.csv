Mental prep worst case scenario lol,btohqsg

Over committing n risking in these troubled times is frightening. Maybe many are ignorant of what is happening around the world,btohqsg
Actually future housing will get cheaper due to 3D printing,btohqsg
Now alr most BTO are prefab right?,btohqsg
I think SG mindset is property price will never collapse.......,btohqsg
But honestly... I truly believe shipping containers as housing to be a good idea lol,btohqsg
But for my gen and those younger than me  if lucky  can inherit an HDB w >60 years on lease,btohqsg
They over rely on Govt to support prices from collapse. If not for Govt hdb scheme private sector prices would not be cushioned indirectly,btohqsg
But by the time inherit  how many per cent can inherit an HDB >60years. Maybe those recent BTOs only lor,btohqsg
Once all the old HDB in TPY  Queenstown return to govt  housing there sure damn ex,btohqsg
Who can afford to live there any more... Might as well all flip to condo...,btohqsg
Future housing may be cheaper w 3d printing,btohqsg
But land cost is added to BTO,btohqsg
How to be cheaper overall? I not sure...,btohqsg
Cities around the world are like that leh even in much bigger countries,btohqsg
Effect of 3d printing will be felt in us housing market bah,btohqsg

Actually my idea is to decentralise SG. Don't everything conc in CBD. Having Jurong East as 2nd CBD is good start. Punggol digital hub also,btohqsg
Buyers want cheaper  sellers want to sell higher prices. Who to please? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But unfortunately Sinkie mentality v hard to change. All will laugh at PG for ulu  human air filter etc etc,btohqsg
All want live near CBD only,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t this what Govt has been doing for years? End up property prices gap amongst constituencies not as big as before,btohqsg
What to do... All prestige issue,btohqsg
Burn those boomer who buy property,btohqsg
But gulf in property prices still way too large in my opinion,btohqsg
Burn those who spend beyond means,btohqsg
No Lah. With time this prejudice will be gone. I hv witnessed this.,btohqsg
And it's just Sinkies idiosyncratic preferences,btohqsg
"Feel like going dbs bank ask ""eh do yall provide credit default swaps ornot""",btohqsg
I can get landed property in Tokyo for 200k sgd,btohqsg
Japan is a bit special cos their building code keep updating,btohqsg
So although the land is valuable  the structure is not,btohqsg
Singapore so small very soon no more outskirts,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ may be that also no more,btohqsg
