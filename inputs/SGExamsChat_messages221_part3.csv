in my sch comp engineering is in eee sch,btohqsg
2. Is networking n security under soc and if yes what course is it under.,btohqsg
umm itâ€™s entirely up to the mod coordinator decision,btohqsg
3. Is there anyone in soc that u know is under CSF ?,btohqsg
i picked the right book then,btohqsg
it was such an extensive history of jerusalem omg i gave it a glance and goodness me,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m buying two books from Samin Nosrat   Salt fat acid heat and Harold Mcgee   On food and cooking,btohqsg
Maybe try to do some research?,btohqsg
Or go to skillshare or masterclass?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what I  also did when I donâ€™t know which cooking book is for me to improve on my technique and to study more about food science .,btohqsg
for nus  CS2105 for intro to networks  CS2107 intro to security  CS3235 computer security  CS5321 network security,btohqsg
But is there a specific course?,btohqsg
it's really not much different from doing a cs major and having security as your focus area,btohqsg
Cuz I'm trying to find out the difference btwn computer engineering and info systems for like mod,btohqsg
info systems is more biz oriented,btohqsg
ceg will cover more circuits  more low level stuff etc,btohqsg
at least in nus  it's half ee  half cs,btohqsg
more like 10% ee  90% cs but more low level focus,btohqsg
It's very flexible tho  you wanna do more ee stuff as electives you also can i think?,btohqsg
wait lemme shitpost on discord a bit more,btohqsg
uh computer engineering mainly deal with a mix of the software and hardware,btohqsg
if you're undecided between the two you can go comp eng and slowly figure it out,btohqsg
then it depends on what specialisation you're going into,btohqsg
i did computer eng before i switched to mechatronics,btohqsg
But I'm really like both tho,btohqsg
yeah if you lkke both you can still do comp eng,btohqsg
But I'm like into hardware for security,btohqsg
like you touch on stuff like fpga for hardware and data struxt for software,btohqsg
i am not too sure about security tbh,btohqsg
no physics but you need electric,btohqsg
it's basically h2 physics on electricity but a bit higher level,btohqsg
logic gate design  boolean logic etc,btohqsg
need to know calculus  matrices  fourier transform  etc,btohqsg
But what are the other subjects?,btohqsg
it's fine until you take it ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
like you don't take a subject specifically lol you take modules which tackles specific topics,btohqsg
Is it harder than further math/ h3 math?,btohqsg
oh you mean from a level to enter comp eng?,btohqsg
i didn't have fm but i assume it'll be a tad harder since h3 is basically just taking a module,btohqsg
any subjects combinations are fine as long as you hit the grades requirement from the sci side afail,btohqsg
because you'll be learning from things from groundup,btohqsg
so while taking h2 computing isn't a must it does help,btohqsg
"yeah uni they sometimes ""assume"" you have no prior knowledge",btohqsg
and will crash course the living shit out of you,btohqsg
like the whole h2 syllabus in a week or two,btohqsg
well not the entirety of the h2 syllabus,btohqsg
Ppl said HL math in IB= h3 math+ H2 further math,btohqsg
just some of the topics required of that mkdule,btohqsg
It's like abt the same as uni,btohqsg
but yeah even if you go in comp eng without any prior knowledge you'll probably still do fine if you put in the effort,btohqsg
