https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/products/everyday-global/tnc-ega-bonus-interest-promotion.pdfHEY IT IS OUT!2.65% bonus rate + 0.05% + 1% incremental,btohqsg
Dropped 0.1% compared for all tiers except Premier Elite 0.02%,btohqsg
Seems like got typo? Only accounts opened before 1 Jan eligible. Worse than Jan's promo where new accounts not eligible.,btohqsg

Hi. So the reference mth Is Jan 2025.So if Jan we have 10 kFeb is 100kMar is 100k.Both mth Feb and Mar will have 90K incremental and entitled to the bonus Interest?,btohqsg
Feb 3.7% p.a.  Mar 2.7% p.a.  Apr 0.05% p.a.This includes 1% bonus interest from Everyday+ Rewards.,btohqsg
If they already registered in Dec  they cannot register in Jan and can only register in Feb.,btohqsg
the TNCs recently very very confusing to be honest,btohqsg
They adding a lot of stupid clauses,btohqsg
1. registered when cannot qualify when2. single single/joint3. reference months4. qualifying monthsvery dangerous to advise people since the tnc may not be consistent across months,btohqsg
Because you don't have incremental funds in Mar  as stated in your original message.,btohqsg
But if never register in Dec either. Then register today is better right?  I just smsed today,btohqsg
Cos I thought both Feb and Mar balances with be referenced back to Jan. So if it is not.  Then just keep for 1 mth Feb. to get 3.7 %,btohqsg

Not everyone able to spend solely on card ma. Especially hawker meal doesn't accept card,btohqsg
