Yes both will get bonus pts,btohqsg
Only worthwhile cards to consider is BOC family and Maybank Visa Platinum.,btohqsg
only 1x point since it is not under one of the fashion mcc for 10x points  use Amaze+citi rewards (via applepay) instead to get 10x points for online transactions (amaze converts to online),btohqsg
Hi would like to enquire for uob one acc to earn the interest  after trf salary to acc  how long does it take before i can use the money i trf provided i already hit the uob amt i wanted.,btohqsg
I’m not too sure about Frank as it has a bonus component to the cash back. Evol excludes CardUp if I didn’t recall wrongly.I studied both of them when I selected and I dropped the slightly iffy ones.DBS Vantage can also select cash back mode and with EGA  break even on promo code but it’s so minimal compared to the miles.,btohqsg
BOC  Frank and Evol also has a much smaller quantum. More hoops to jump through 😑Those were my primary considerations when I went for the process.,btohqsg
if i already got a debit iuob card and i apply for uob stash will they auto link mine existing card to the uob stash or i can remove the linkage?,btohqsg
"HOME175 can only be applied with Vantage Card? I tried just now but Cardup stated ""Sorry  you are not eligible to redeem this offer""",btohqsg
This offer was sent to me via email. Sorry if it’s not a common promo code 😑It states that it should work with all Visa cards.,btohqsg

Try their recurring code for 1.85%Or if you’re new  the one from Chris (HONEYMONEY) gives $30 off fees,btohqsg
Anyone tried? Kris + to pay Harvey using UOB signature. Is this online or contactless. As UOB signature requirement is contaless = apple pay  tab….,btohqsg
dbs vantage/uob linked to cardup  hence i asked if there is any cashback,btohqsg
Thanks in advance 👍🏻 thanks again,btohqsg
online  no 4mpd for uob visa signature,btohqsg

Hi  if my lifestyle spending is such that I can clock $800 through UOB Evol card and having the UOB One Account for the savings wise  is it still worth having UOB evol card with the UOB one Account?With the changed criteria  the maximum I can get is even $30 or slightly more as I don't have much overseas transactions day to day.Should I change UOB One account to another savings account? But I do feel UOB One still easy to qualify for the interest rate. Compares to SCB Bonus saver where have to fullfil criterias such as bill paymentsShould I change my UOB Evol to another credit card? I am confused by the change of the terms and conditions to UOB Evol Card😔,btohqsg
yes. your husband is main account holder?,btohqsg
still ok lor 30/800=3.75%. Consider uob one card if u transact at merchants that give bonus cashback e.g. mcdonald  grab  shopee  dairy farm group  sp services,btohqsg
yes  he is. speaking of main acct holder  when i asked the CSO to confirm who the main acct holder is (this is after account is opened for few days)  he said there's no such thing  both names are same 'level'. 🤷‍♀️ but we did tell the bank to put my husband as primary holder when we opened the account.,btohqsg

Hi  i am interested to earn miles. Im going to have a big ticket spending on hai tien lo (restaurant) at pan pac. I know they accept kris+ payment for 3mpd  anybody can advise if i shd use which credit card to earn the best miles reward. Thanks!,btohqsg
How much is your estimated spend?,btohqsg
How big ur bill is gonna be? A few k then UOB KF. Less than 2k then UOB lady sol dining + travel,btohqsg
Might be worthwhile calling Hai Tien Lo and ask them whether they allow u to split Kris+ payments,btohqsg
got the $18 cash coupon. Thanks,btohqsg
Not really. U get some ezlink points but the redemptions are not useful.But time and again Ezlink provides promotions so just keep a lookout.,btohqsg
Meaning if I do fast transfer from EGA to pay bills I get the 1% cash back? That will explain some of my $0.60 cash back 😂😂,btohqsg
That's not what I meant. You need to read again.,btohqsg
If can make a few paymentsUOB lady solitaire 2kDBS woman 1.5kUOB ppv 1.1kCrmc + amaze 1kUOB KF the rest,btohqsg
If can’t split  your best bet is UOBKF for 3mpd assuming u can fulfill the criteria for UOBKF,btohqsg
What criteria? 😅 Kris+ is direct 3mpd plus the mile from Kris+ (another 3mpd I think),btohqsg
Thanks guys. Grateful for the advice,btohqsg
Fair point  my brain went thinking about Amaze UOBKF 🤣,btohqsg
Can this apply to car deposit?,btohqsg
