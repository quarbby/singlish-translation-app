5k can. Do whole day non stop dun care location. But deduct petrol maintenance dunno left how much,btohqsg
Take note the charge for car and courier is different as well,btohqsg
Don't have so many jobs to win bid each day😂,btohqsg
Last time don't need stack advance jobs to earn 200 on wkend. On the day itself do the immediate jobs have good prices n will surge n +$. Last time don't have soo many sudden influx of part time drivers and have more jobs,btohqsg
Now toooo many part time wkend drivers n little jobs. All jobs b4 chance of any surge or + are taken at a low price,btohqsg
Thats y its no longer a good choice to do llm,btohqsg
Good luck with your future endeavours with LLM. You picked a bad timing to join.,btohqsg
Nowdays when I open app to see sometimes,btohqsg
Jobs to or from mbs price so low still have pple take,btohqsg
I wonder how these drivers do it,btohqsg
Mbs cp expensive. And then if the main cp is full  they close the cp and they open the convention hall for u to park. But that 1 no grace period at all. N its $23 flat fee. Minus the cp earn wat,btohqsg
Some pple say can park outdoor cp. But that 1 also have queue. Then if raining  it's a long walk😂,btohqsg
Its the same for all the town/cbd jobs. Last time price high can tahan cp. Now price low taken  how to make 5k/mth after minus operating costs. Park illegal kena summon worse😂,btohqsg
Do non town jobs  longer distance jobs  mileage fee kena cut so much 🤷‍♂😂,btohqsg
Do llm similar to become low wage workers lor,btohqsg
Earn more coz 100% profit coz no rental + keep fit,btohqsg
During covid  demand very high. Prices very high. Is buffet spread for us. That time many pple don't join llm  maybe scared. Then now after covid demand drop till cui. Then more pple join. 🤷‍♂😂,btohqsg
Then cos demand drop  llm lower their price to retain customer n biz. Then price low old drivers start to no do  the jobs hang there. So the best solution for llm? Do hard and aggressive marketing for recruitment. More drivers  new drivers  see price still higher than grab etc. Then do,btohqsg
But  correct me if I'm wrong  the other food delivery platforms price per job low but their incentives high. U get reward for hard work.,btohqsg
N they don't need to bid for jobs  the platform throw to them. Llm still need bid n bor bao get the job,btohqsg
Even festive seasons which used to be fierce like lion/tiger  now also cui liao. Last Yr Xmas llm like kitten  not even a cat😂,btohqsg
Cheapo. Prefer van but choose mpv!!!,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I would like to know if MPV or Van would be better for lalamove full time? What vehicles are good and practical? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Depends on what you want to ferryVan lorry of course more charges cause heavier load,btohqsg
If you want to rent a vanI have one available,btohqsg
Llm ft how feed family? Need multi,btohqsg
Yes   llm ft van max net profit 3.5k. u need deduct your expenses. The fares are low and jobs limited. Part time a few platform better,btohqsg
Okay bro thanks man  needed to hear that. 🙏,btohqsg
Looking for drivers to set up for eventsRequirements: to have their own mode of transport  car/van etc.Only sat and sun job,btohqsg
Before u rent   find out more alternatives  of cos llm is good for picking up and drop off on the way while having another platform job 😁😁. Van job within 2hrs   mpv 1.5hrs car job 1hr.,btohqsg
Yes  don't be misled by all their advertisements n marketing. If I'm not wrong  van jobs prices have dropped drastically. Quantity also drop.,btohqsg
Doing ft can. U have to be prepared don't earn much. If u have family commitments think u have to consider properly,btohqsg
Dropped from 37$ to $26 while all other expenses increase . A diff of 35-40%,btohqsg
No wonder I hear now vans also sometimes bid for car jobs,btohqsg
There was some competition between GGV and llm. That's how llm got more van drivers to paste their stickers 😂😂,btohqsg
Mpv was not present in the past. Mpv eventually meant for customers to abuse van drivers haha,btohqsg
All newbies being conned by all the ads😂🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Eg those need vehicles to carry 2boxes of 40kg in total used to call for van job. Now they use mpv or even car,btohqsg
They r being spoilt cos massive influx of newbies who will take anytg  bor bian,btohqsg
Van is better for parcels . Load all space and go send,btohqsg
Some are fake drivers   paid by MOM . Purpose to slash market. Benefit companies on expense of drivers,btohqsg
The whole thing going on now is the society getting seriously poor.,btohqsg
So word of advice to any newcomers thinkg of llm as ft  think again😂,btohqsg
The old saying the rich get richer is sadly true,btohqsg
Llm cannot FT . Can die one,btohqsg
Can do again if lockdown occurs again only,btohqsg
Possible that time during lockdown only😂😂,btohqsg
Govt no more money pay for ppl and companies for another lockdown,btohqsg
One more lockdown the world economy gameover,btohqsg
Y is there such a general misconception that gov no money,btohqsg
