Honestly 2.5% isn't very attractive. If I have that much money anyway I'll put in SIF  not Trust. I just put minimal money in Trust when I travel for ATM withdrawal.,btohqsg
"""Citi Rewards Card  remember to avoid *in-app mobile wallet payments*  because you won’t earn any bonus.""1. Can I clarify what is considered an in-app mobile wallet payment?2.

When you open an app  about to pay  then there's google pay/apple pay option  and then you pay using that without leaving the app... That's in-app mobile wallet payment,btohqsg

Hi  for the UOB One account interest  i did the salary transfer (reflected in interest tracker) & $500 credit card spend (posted on 27 July) but seems like the credit card spend did not reflect at all in the interest tracker at all. I did a $500 top up to my grabpay account. Can anyone advise?,btohqsg
Topping up grabpay is probably is in the excluded transactions,btohqsg
ok thanks  i checked their T&C din mentioned though  but will try to clock the $500 spend the traditional way  ty,btohqsg
Or else u can check with UOB live chat what is the MCC for topping up grabpay then will be clearer,btohqsg
their chat very slow  & their hotline worst,btohqsg
If I linked citi rewards with AMAZE.Then link AMAZE with shopback.When make payment  I use shopback.Will I get 4MPD? ☺️,btohqsg

How is the 30-Day Period counted?The first  day of your 30-day period begins  on the same day when you make your deposit of a minimum of S$1 000 or more during the period from 1 Aug to 31 Aug 2023. Please ensure that you have opted into SMART Park (Excess Funds Management Facility) for your trading account before you make your first  deposit for this promotion.To opt in  please log in towww.poems.com.sg> Acct Mgmt > Online Forms > Excess Funds Authorization.,btohqsg
yes  just deposit and it will auto-subscribe,btohqsg
"the ""M"" in the trade account is known as cash management right?",btohqsg
must this be enabled too or?,btohqsg
Then  I guess the best card would be UOB One card for SP bill payment which I don't own anymore.,btohqsg
Excess fund authorization is good enough. Mine is enabled for multi currency aswell,btohqsg
Oh sorry circled wrong line. Should be just need Excess Fund Authorization,btohqsg
Is yours showing Yes? Mines still showing No today,btohqsg
I'm curious what does the gmd and the m at the back means?,btohqsg

hi friends  do yall know if uob has digital cards that I can use before receiving the physical card? HAHA,btohqsg
Hi for this UOB National Savings promo  it seems like a 4 mths Fixed Deposit of approx 2.9% interest. Am I understanding it wrongly?,btohqsg
The poems deposit  do I have to do anything to go back to original state after 30 days? Or just leave it at smart park?,btohqsg
is this the right place for the smart park or am i missing something?,btohqsg
Seem like Airpod is the least amount 🤔🤔,btohqsg
From reading T&C  indeed it's basically like a 4 months FD (cash credit depends on how much you earmarked). However  according to this chat message:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/115771seems like you are also earning the UOB One up to 5% Interest (assuming you are using UOB One Savings account). So the Cash Credit + 5% interest is very good rate.,btohqsg
hi all  am trying to open a TD ameritrade/TOSaccount but am stuck at the SGX e-learning cert part. anyone knows where i can obtain it??? tyvm!,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I have $10 000 with me and I am not sure what can I do with it. Any recommendations?,btohqsg
Yes  while not explicitly mentioned  it seems like as if the amount that I earmarked in my UOB One account can also be earning the UOB One bonus interest concurrently with the UOB National Savings promo!,btohqsg
