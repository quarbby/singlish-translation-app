Even on pretext on kind sharing,btohqsg
Wah market price $0.08  offer price $0.14,btohqsg
Cement company. Will indirectly impact ICG price too tmr,btohqsg
Maybe tmr really no need yum gong liao,btohqsg
Really don't know that this company listed in SGX until this takeover announcement,btohqsg
But I really don't know a takeover of a smallish local concrete or cement company will affect the SP of a big east Asia cement company.,btohqsg
Maybe the BB try to stir interest.,btohqsg
If icg ever run tmr  it will be the profit guidance that trigger it.. Won't be this concrete news,btohqsg
What's the fair value for international cement?,btohqsg
I got no idea.. Some say growth stock.. Some say way overvalued with high pe ratio at current price,btohqsg
I am on the growth story side since I am a existing holder,btohqsg
read read and think think ba Â§ßÂÆ∂,btohqsg
BRIEF BACKGROUNDInternational Cement Group (ICG) was previously known as Compact Metal. It was until Mr. Ma Zhaoyang who joined and started reorganisation efforts that resulted in a new business direction to develop cement and building materials in Central Asia. This is then how ICG is known to have two business arms today ‚Äì cement in Central Asia and aluminium in Singapore accounting for 90% and 10% of the overall revenue respectively.DEMAND OF CEMENT CONTINUES TO BE HIGHPresently  the Central Asia  together with the rest of the world  have started their vaccinations on its citizens in an attempt to start the recovery of respective economies as soon as possible in a safest possible manner. Some people have then asked me  ‚Äúwhat is it that I see in ICG that makes me want to promote them so much?‚Äù The answer lies in the operating theatre of its cement production lines.Today  the lands and infrastructures within Central Asia are considered backwards and therefore suggests the room for further developments. This thus makes cement as one of the natural key building materials that Central Asia cannot do without. However  there is more than what meets the eyes on the demand for cement ‚Äì the China‚Äôs Belt-and-Road (BRI) Initiative is precisely what drives the higher demand for cement because this US$4 ‚Äì 8 trillion foreign and economic infrastructure development strategy has plans to connect China to Central Asia  the Middle East  Russia  and Europe via the Silk Road Economic Belt. In addition to this  there have also been proper legislations set up to curb cement production in China so one can certainly expect a higher demand of cement from Central Asian cement suppliers in the foreseeable future.RECOVERY OF ALUMINIUM BUSINESSWhile the aluminium business arm has taken a slow recovery but it‚Äôs a gradual one  given that it depends very much on the recovery of the construction market and land space in Singapore. As of 30 June 2020  ICG has secured a three-year delivery order of S$17.4 million to be from 2020 to 2022.SHAREHOLDING & SHARES ANALYSISAs of 21 February 2021  after the restructuring of VGVL on 18 Feb 2021  Mr Ma Zhaoyang holds 25.59%  Mr Zhang Zeng Tao holds 54.93%  and other substantial shareholders hold around a total of 16.23% of the total 5 734 732 849 shares. This leaves us with 185 966 797 shares in the public float today.It seems that down the road the directors can certainly explore to raise funds by increasing the number of shares to assist in expansion strength and joint ventures to further leverage on the ever-growing demand of cement ensued by potential developments in Central Asia and China‚Äôs BRI.FINAL COMMENTSThe current market valuation of ICG is only 390m (share price of $0.068) right now. Net profit margin is 21.6%. I believe there should be a proper market revaluation of the company after the release of FY2020 results and the recovery of economies and oil prices all round the world as 2021 proceeds on.,btohqsg
That's y I yum gong liao,btohqsg
Thks.. Hope concrete news help abit,btohqsg

Ya.. But the cash offer is for the concrete company.. Doubt icg will have impact on it..,btohqsg
Ya I also think no effect on ICG,btohqsg
Saw some one share on fb,btohqsg
Both circled ‚≠ïÔ∏è which coincidentally happened to be the highest % price target increase I do have them.- Oxley- IX Biopharma,btohqsg
Had 500 lots Oxley bought $0.240 on last Monday but sold 350 lots $0.235 and bought back 150 lots $0.235 when the buyers came in.Didn‚Äôt expect the closing $0.24 actually. That‚Äôs why maybe this week might have chance. Needs a trigger. BBs might work. The Oxley chart set up is poised for a big run actually in my opinion. But when is the question,btohqsg
Which one would be stronger  oxley or ix bio .. in your opinions?,btohqsg
Oxley   1 - steep drop and downtrend   2- consolidation and price stabling upwards  slow and steady  building momentum and power 3 - breakout of channel due to Fundamentals (good financial results). The recent PA   TA  FA all leads to a higher upside further break out % probability I reckon. With the patient consolidation (10 months) in the channel  BBs should have accumulated a lot and the ball is in their court now. Analysts also give high target üéØ for this one. Now  I think just wait and see. Last Friday closed well. Closed to the main resistance. If they test again soon  I believe it should be the one ‚òùÔ∏è,btohqsg
Oxley - Watch next week. Today T+4 over. Price held and closed really well after quick covering of gap. They wanted to flush those buyers who went in Monday on their strong results. MACD turning up. Good candle today. Should get interesting üßê great set up for a big break out üôèüèª,btohqsg
Overall looks really good for Oxley,btohqsg
IX they also consolidated a lot. I watched for some time already. Waiting for the right time to jeep.Last Friday when they stacked up. And cleared 260  I thought maybe this time can break out  so as they were clearing 265  joined in. But they blocked 265.Now I think depends on Medtecs   if results superb  they run big  this one should be pulled along. They won‚Äôt block it if Medtecs run big I reckon,btohqsg
huat ah both on my list,btohqsg
can cover up for my yoma,btohqsg
there's a telegram/channel by a phllips agent,btohqsg
his name Terry  he run TT channel and consolidate all these,btohqsg
oxley float too heavy.. explosive movement will go to IX,btohqsg
This Yoma I have too. In 2 minds.Anyways sorry for the boot.Still have Yoma ?,btohqsg
Long term I really think no problem.They will find compromise and sort it out. Problem now is uncertainty.That‚Äôs the issue.There‚Äôs strong auto buyers last Friday $0.185.See how Also  maybe might cut first . Use the funds for those in play to minimise opp costs,btohqsg
Yoma one of my favourite counters man. Yoma in Myanmar üí™üèº can become the CDL & Far East combined of Singapore .,btohqsg
Ayala is the equivalent in Philippines. What‚Äôs their stake % and price ?,btohqsg
Holding both oxley and ix bio  but cut ix bio few weeks back. Will load again ix bio. Added yoma also. All 3 Huat Huat!,btohqsg
yes  0.185  really strong on friday,btohqsg
i like the price action on friday look like stabalized and bottomed out,btohqsg
yesss   they have quite a monopoly in  Myammaar   looking forward to their long term,btohqsg
Eaton Vance cut down position    Aberdeen increase at cheap price,btohqsg
Yea and they went in high price yea,btohqsg
Ix vs Ox??? Straightforward answer.. Sarpork Ix,btohqsg
at 0.45 haha.... their 2019 price,btohqsg
Hehe that is the main factor but..Ix current price 25.5cents TP 44.5cents(74%upside potential)Ox current price 24 cents TP37cents(54% upside potential)So still need to explain? Hehe,btohqsg
But FA okay anot ? Never really study much . See recent PA and TA okay. Need better medical sentiments then I think bingo bingo,btohqsg
FA still very red... haha got improvement over previous year .. but still in the red,btohqsg
Haven add any.. Need to plan correctly which one run first,btohqsg
Ayala knows the potential and connections of Yoma.Potential of Yoma to become the biggest conglomerate in Myanmar is there .,btohqsg
relative to other pharma companies .. which mostly are in the red too.. loll. IX bio is relatively undervalued,btohqsg
industry average PE 40x .. they targetting 12x pe,btohqsg
