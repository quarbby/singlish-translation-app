Could be just carbon buildup also,btohqsg

Tape dropping out. STA Sin Ming quote me $7++ to replace IU unit. Buy new 3M heavy duty tape prolly more ex. Will u all change IU unit?,btohqsg
Are you refering to the IU cover? The IU unit itself is alot more expensive. 😅,btohqsg
I've replaced mine once before and the flap cover always breaks. I just tap it up and remove the cover to access the card.,btohqsg
tape also more expensive... but multiple use i guess,btohqsg
I'm tempted to just super glue the flap shut  then remove the whole cover when needed. lol,btohqsg
