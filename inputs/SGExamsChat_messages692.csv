I mean fr pw my cher actually encourages use of ai,btohqsg
We jst need to cite it,btohqsg
Like u can ask what is d/dx x^2,btohqsg
They will give u the ans,btohqsg
But if u too complex den they will brain fart,btohqsg
last year when I was using it for math qns it was q inaccurate,btohqsg
but maybe given sufficient context it will b better,btohqsg
idk i give the qns quite easy oso chatgpt dk how to do,btohqsg
How complex is ur complex tho,btohqsg
Im jst saying in general since its ai,btohqsg
Coz idk la mine at least there is some examples to follow,btohqsg
Den at least u know what is expected,btohqsg
Den i use chatgpt to double check,btohqsg
Like ai they can give u like ans from prompts because there is like records/info of it online alr,btohqsg
But they will go extra step one  abit annoying,btohqsg
Or they learn from other users with similar prompts,btohqsg
Just dont use it to copy write thesis can le i guess,btohqsg
I think if u rly want to use ai then jst use photo math 💀,btohqsg

instead of demonising all use of slang,btohqsg
but then it's also important to write in a clear and concise manner,btohqsg

And any swearing is pretty effectively filtered oyt,btohqsg
This is just my opinion so don't flame meIf you're texting your friends in private then no one really cares but then if you're writing a reddit post for people to comment on then it will be a bit difficult to read if it's all abbrevations and emojis,btohqsg

Coz u need to put in at least some effort (and the min is alr insane) to even pass the exam,btohqsg
it's more of what expectations you have vs how you handle the workload,btohqsg
that's why it's how you handle with respect to whatever expectations you have,btohqsg
Correspondingly  the net aggregate cut-off for admission to polytechnic in the first year will be adjusted from 26 points to 22 points. For nursing courses  the net aggregate cut-off for admission will be adjusted from 28 points to 24 points.                       Changes to Institute of Technical Education (ITE) pathwayITE is transitioning all its Nitec courses to the enhanced three-year curricular structure leading directly to a Higher Nitec certification. ITE will continue to monitor the outcomes of this implementation  and is on track to complete the transition by Academic Year 2026.Starting from the Academic Year 2028  the admission requirements for direct entry into Year 2 for all Higher Nitec courses will be set at G2. This means that students taking a combination of G3 and G2 subjects can apply for direct entry into Year 2 of Higher Nitec  as long as their gross ELMAB3 aggregate score is 19 points or better.,btohqsg

then must do challenges from H&F to get,btohqsg
my day has been instantly ruined,btohqsg
also apparently mr sin lives around my area,btohqsg
At least the what western store still ard rite,btohqsg
if sizzler shuts down the school will mourn,btohqsg
oh yeah now with the new SEC how do they calculate grades,btohqsg
or still the same as before,btohqsg
means majority of rp students in IT engineering and nursing courses kena kicked out,btohqsg
hmm i see it as g3 express grading g2 na grading  g1 nt grading,btohqsg
so if u take 6G3 subjects and 1 G2 subject,btohqsg
wait how do they grade NA again,btohqsg
im guessing how they grade current sbb subjects,btohqsg
why the fuck did they have to rename this,btohqsg
if the shit is still the same,btohqsg
also what is the g supposed to stand for,btohqsg
the new exam replacing o's and n's,btohqsg
been in the top tier and used to it,btohqsg
3 new contenders:4. any given palestine supporter5. futureofryan6. telehitch foursome,btohqsg
futureofryan is the underdog here with only a 7% equity,btohqsg
isnt f9 technically fail? 5 is still considered a pass in a na rite?,btohqsg
and the palestine supporter self immolates  hes out!!!,btohqsg
ok left 1  3  5  6,btohqsg
idk but for nt if u get U grade for ur na subj is automatically a U in nt,btohqsg
So the grading system is further optimized,btohqsg
grades 1-5 for na will minus 1 for conversion. e.g. 5-1 is 4 which equals to grade c,btohqsg
U shouldn't have a grade bah,btohqsg
smtg like tht. cant rly rmbr,btohqsg
My mum imposed this rule that the guy need to be caring to my autistic bro,btohqsg
And actually my mum antisocial and dun hv friends  i also dunno the type of person she would be ok with lmao,btohqsg
Is 2 nameless cat or josh,btohqsg
I still don’t know a lot of discord stuff,btohqsg
Actually i dun understand what does that even mean,btohqsg
So weird sia the new system,btohqsg
My NS life too boring so I came here to hear more drama and gossip lol,btohqsg
Then how to get 22 points even??,btohqsg
That’s like converting o levels to n levels right,btohqsg
im from clementi camp with gpa of 5 (gay people association),btohqsg
So G1 to G2 grades basically,btohqsg
B3 and A1 gives me the same thing,btohqsg
Who will study hard to get an A sia,btohqsg
but decrease min points for highes5 score,btohqsg
Can u go jc with that shit g2 scoring tho,btohqsg
I tot jc need minimum idk how many g3,btohqsg
But I think it’s like for G2 stream students taking G1 subjects under sbb,btohqsg
Wait G3 is express or is it G1,btohqsg
G1 is NT  G2 is NA,btohqsg
Wait sry then I mean G2 taking G3 under sbb,btohqsg
Then since G3 is harder that’s why the conversion is like that,btohqsg
I thought even right now it’s sth similar,btohqsg
My sis is in the sbb pilot school,btohqsg
A1 to B3 in o levels is like 1 point for n levels,btohqsg
The mix is so not it  like she told me her class got weird people and blah blah,btohqsg
They want to mix them but it is not practical lmao,btohqsg
It will just be 1 class but they still dun interact,btohqsg
rn is A-D dk if it will change,btohqsg
why is this so confusing omt,btohqsg
Ohya broski how bad is inequality as a GP topic,btohqsg
Would U recco doing an inequality qn,btohqsg
I would write it because my competition consists of1. Emotional SJWs who believe that only minorities get discriminated2. People who only know what is happening in Singapore and USA,btohqsg
U cant really ask me like topic which one i would do cuz i legit can do any topic for gp,btohqsg
i go by how easy the qn is,btohqsg
I mean like for avg student,btohqsg
i mean inequality qns as long as u,btohqsg
Ah ok so mapping G3 to G2 for posting group 2 students  it’s basically n level student taking o level subjects under sbb,btohqsg
I mean its not about being balanced,btohqsg
and not writing like a 3 year old child at a playground,btohqsg
Oh so don't just cry abt minority issues,btohqsg
dont treat the essay as a way for you to be angsty,btohqsg
Honestly I don’t get what’s the point of removing the current system  beyond students from different streams being in the same form class,btohqsg
Also I’m guessing schs with only regular express or IP won’t see any change,btohqsg
oh but is this only for poly,btohqsg
But I don’t get why is there the one G2,btohqsg
how they convert H2 to H1,btohqsg
So JC is still L1R5 system isit,btohqsg
Idk got diff or not sia,btohqsg
so rn is either poly intake will go up or ite intake will go up. cuz of the lowering of the net points,btohqsg
the back of ur result slip is what?,btohqsg
fail is U what not E,btohqsg
It says A to D pass what,btohqsg
unless this is for the new exam,btohqsg
Maybe it’s different for n level,btohqsg
A level grading system no changes announced yet except for pw,btohqsg
Yeah but the grades themselves no change,btohqsg
Even w/o the stream  it is already happening in some schools lol,btohqsg
And the H1 is only counted if it improved the rp,btohqsg
I thought for sbb the form class is still grouped by students form the same stream,btohqsg
My sis sch has all 3 streams in one class,btohqsg
Oh idk then. My sch was like that  only subject class the NA ppl taking sbb come over,btohqsg
That’s weird. Maybe diff sch moe direct them to try different approaches,btohqsg
But then like if you said the students from different streams don’t talk with each other  no point,btohqsg
this batch sec 1 is the only full SBB batch rn,btohqsg
beforehand they were testing it with different schs,btohqsg
https://www.haisingcatholic.moe.edu.sg/hsc-community/students/full-subject-based-banding/permalink/i pulled this out frm my sec sch website. but is for subjs offered. i cnnt find anyt on grading,btohqsg
this reminds me of my friend who got 8 for L1R5 but went RP and got a 1.9 GPA,btohqsg
tbf he said he just didnt wanna study,btohqsg
Is that guy still in discord? I still rmbr him answering questions in the O or A chat last time,btohqsg
I mean I didn’t join sge discord so no clue,btohqsg
Thought I saw him before in the regular study chats,btohqsg
I only could do that from start J2 when i realised that examples is q easy to gets one,btohqsg
Is it the only poly that offers that course,btohqsg
Even for those ppl who do well for Os and want to go poly idk why they’d go to RP for science related courses,btohqsg
Maybe stuff like hospitality I think only rp offers for certain courses,btohqsg
I wonder if he still intends to come back on april fools lol,btohqsg
I assuming he said it on discord,btohqsg
Yall should start preparing to “welcome” him,btohqsg
SP diploma is the most recognised,btohqsg
Even Cambridge recognises it while they don’t accept 3H2 without H3 students,btohqsg
i wadio frm that system go change,btohqsg
Tbh i also dk how to explain well,btohqsg
"okay according to google""ennui • \ahn-WEE\ • noun. : a feeling of weariness and dissatisfaction : boredom. Examples: In reaction to the ennui that he was feeling after working for twelve years in an unchallenging position  Darrell began to look for a new career.""",btohqsg

Not when it's hard like a rock,btohqsg
Depends on what kinda egg yolk too,btohqsg
What else can u use hard ass egg yolk for sia,btohqsg
frm google.Ways to Use Leftover Hard Boiled Egg YolksCrumble/smash and mix with hummus  mashed avocado/guacamole  ranch or bbq sauce and add to sandwiches  quesadillas  grilled cheese etc. Grate them over a salad like you would a block of cheese. What is this? Add one or two to cookie dough to make it more tender.,btohqsg
Because of the sauce it would soften up,btohqsg
Damn I bake and I didn't know egg yolks can be added to cookie dough,btohqsg
dont need  search up flourless recipe,btohqsg
Oh flour is for making donut,btohqsg
I meannn I wouldn't go overboiling the eggs till it's that hard,btohqsg
I fked up my donuts when I tot rice flour can act as a subst for all purpose flour,btohqsg
