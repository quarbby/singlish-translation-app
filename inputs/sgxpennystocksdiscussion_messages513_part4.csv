No one is willing to risk now because no clear direction at the moment.,btohqsg
The market has too liquidity still. In this market this year and last year at least. So if history is to believe  then we hope tonight Dow Jones will crash big time  so that it forms 3 red candles. STI Market will then have a high chance to recover to recover tomorrow and Monday together with USA futures turning green tomorrow. There are still bargain hunters and support now waiting to buy below. The theme for august  the curse of the hungry ghost month  is to buy when market down a lot. And not to chase any rally (or bounce up).,btohqsg
Pick cautiously...maybe can get kopi set  2 eggs 2 breads and 1 drink.....,btohqsg
If itâ€™s for any year before 2020  I dare not say because liquidity not there.,btohqsg

Settlement of trades executed on SGX securities market takes place on the second market day after the trade date (ie T+2). When a seller does not have sufficient shares in the account for settlement by the start of the final settlement run at 1:30pm on T+2  CDP will conduct buy-in on that afternoon*. Securities bought in successfully will be used to fulfill the seller's delivery obligation on the next business day.The buy-in session will commence from 4pm to 5pm on T+2. If buy-in is not successful by the end of T+2  buy-in will continue from 4pm to 5pm on T+3.The starting buy-in price for any security is 2 minimum bids above either the previous dayâ€™s closing price or any of the transacted or bid prices in one hour preceding commencement of the buy-in  whichever is higher. The buy-in bid prices will increase by 2 minimum bids from time to time throughout the day until the securities are bought in by CDP.,btohqsg
