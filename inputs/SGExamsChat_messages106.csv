Surprised smu law grads get paid higher than nus wonder how they even do it,btohqsg
Stats is a way to lie with numbers,btohqsg
I am 100% proficient in english,btohqsg
The ones who earn peanuts wont reportThe ones who earn a lot will prob declare their earningsAnd thats how stats misleads ppl,btohqsg
Probably because of what they choose to do  and the environment they are in is able to promote the desired outcome,btohqsg
Hahahaa sometimes! Are you from Cambridge,btohqsg
I guess cos smu focus is corporate law,btohqsg
You would not ask this if you didn’t already know the answer,btohqsg
Consider a sample x_1  ... x_n  members of some space X.............,btohqsg
Even more fun than stats is rankings,btohqsg
Choose job based on ranking. Choose school based on ranking. Choose book based on ranking. Choose show based on ranking,btohqsg
Wait what IDE do ppl even use nowadays for JS,btohqsg
Does that mean this year uni survey salaries is the lowest in history,btohqsg
If you do so the competitive ones would just choose where to go depending on the rotation,btohqsg
Top decile only 1 person can go this school,btohqsg
Maybe they'll just try to do transfers within the year,btohqsg
Then all teachers flock to bishan,btohqsg
Not if those earning less than prev yr stats dont report,btohqsg
Whatever la my point is there ma,btohqsg
Haha all teachers wish they can do that  but no,btohqsg
Teachers are segregated into 4 zones in sg based on where they stay,btohqsg
If bishan out of the zone where u stay in  then almost impossible to go there,btohqsg
Imagine the teacher stay at sentosa bungalow@Jaycubed_t,btohqsg
Thats in the South  not too bad tbh,btohqsg
o o 20+M is not too bad to you!?,btohqsg
20m I might as well just rent my whole life,btohqsg
@yukemingrent out no need work lol,btohqsg
I didnt mean it that way,btohqsg
What if someday rent can't cover mortgage,btohqsg
In monetary terms obv outstanding liao,btohqsg
I didn't know you the GCB trader,btohqsg
Imagine you rich enough that you paid fully already,btohqsg
Invest in stock market can earn how much sio,btohqsg
20mm at 8 pct is 1.6 mm,btohqsg
Rent can get 1.6mm a year meh,btohqsg
How do you ensure you sure win in the stock market lol,btohqsg
Last time avg yield over 10 year period is 8pct,btohqsg
If gdp grows then stock market confirm grow over longer time horizon ma,btohqsg
The covid case grow  the stock market also rise last time,btohqsg
Ppl losing job but indices grow,btohqsg
Regarding the point on money. If we take a step back and look at the macro environment in terms of total utility (as opposed to individual happiness and volunteer folly(u gain happiness when u volunteer but apparently violate comparative advantage)  and distributive justice  u inevitably realize that to make any real impact (knowledge  wisdom  spirituality are useless if you don't use them to create a greater good and essentially spirals down to self indulgence)  you need capital.Apart from the bigger picture. We go micro a little bit and we realize we didn't really have to worry that much about money precisely cos we leech off our parents  who provided for us for a pretty significant amount of time. Go earn your own money first before talking about the higher ideals. Highly unlikely that the woes of our parents wouldn't be the exact same woes we face  and if they struggle hard  there is little reason to believe that we won't struggle at least to a similar level. Wealth gaps take generations to narrow and it is highly likely we will end up in the same or slightly higher decile than our parents. Do first  talk later. And if u are very fortunately the very rich and have little care for earning money  ur search for ideals without making an impact  is just what it is  self indulgence.There's this video from this growth equity investor talking about capital and changing the world. Very coarse and blunt  but insightful all the same  illustrating my first point,btohqsg
Commodity investing is better termed as speculation,btohqsg
hi is there anyone from vet tech in tp that could give me some advice for eae? cld u pls pm me thx ◡̈,btohqsg
Ik someone who went to vet course in TP im assuming vet tech is different ?,btohqsg
Ah what do u want to ask i can forward the query,btohqsg
Altho i can tell u the person after finishing her diploma is no longer interested in the field because the requirements and effort is not worth the pay,btohqsg
Its a general statement not a full blown discussion.,btohqsg
I would be the first one to lose interest if it were to devolve into that,btohqsg
Way too much negativity bad for health la,btohqsg
Prefer to follow my passion. Nothing beats sitting down and reading a good textbook,btohqsg
Tryna understand the nature and beauty  of this universe,btohqsg
This person has not read the statistical mechanics book,btohqsg
Is this where fractals come in?,btohqsg
The very reason we are here to observe the universe is that the universe wants to kill itself and we are a byproduct of that.,btohqsg
Hmm vet  I think that's probably not saturated but you start your own practice to earn money ah?,btohqsg
The moment u start worrying about money ur gonna fuck up. Scarcity mindset. Ur chasing the chicken and not getting the chicken to lay eggs😌 ok la enough said. Think positive guys  u can do it 🙌,btohqsg
U have become what u hate,btohqsg
Sadly the only way to not worry about money is either aid or having money in the first place,btohqsg
Talk about scarcity and Matthew effect but using it as a tool for condescension,btohqsg
Eh not a long exposition just a quick mention,btohqsg
Why you guys so scared of salary talk lol,btohqsg
It's not about salary it's about money and capital,btohqsg
And more vaguely how to deploy them in useful ways,btohqsg
Don't be blinded by money. I lost my parents to money.,btohqsg
The Matthew effect does not trap you if you want to be socially mobile. My parents came from very humble backgrounds and then start to be so focused on money,btohqsg
Oh btw  if you happen to look at the works of the latest econs Nobel laureate  you will notice that even the richest of the rich  when put in shit conditions  have no resources nor time to overcome the scarcity. Matthew effect isn't that easily overcome by a simple (don't have a scarcity based mindset),btohqsg
Many people including relatives and scholarship providers I know have worked their way up slowly... you need patience and not keep whining,btohqsg
Telling people not to be blinded by money is as effective as telling NRA to stop using guns,btohqsg
U gave me one example and expect to overcome the global problem,btohqsg
I left hwz cause it was full of trash talk about how poor ppl are and all the whining. Guys look at the bright side. We can do it!,btohqsg
We talk about population stats here  not individual victories,btohqsg
Bright side doesn't do shit for alot of ppl,btohqsg
It's like telling the depressed there's nothing to be depressed abt,btohqsg
Many of my relatives have ended up cushy jobs. Just work hard and be fiery with passion. That's the best advice I can give...,btohqsg
Prediction: you will leave here very soon.,btohqsg
Or telling the autistic kid to speak up,btohqsg
Sigh.  Nothing u can do to help learned helplessness,btohqsg
U haven't been pushed into the deep end of the pool,btohqsg
I expected more from a cambridge dude 😞,btohqsg
ΔS (Universe) = ΔS(System) + S (Surroundings)you probably seen the kym threads too,btohqsg
Lol Cambridge isn't a magical wand.,btohqsg
Ah girl sorry hor me from a shit bg and ended up where I am precisely because I am Galactically lucky and pure effort,btohqsg
None of the elite universities are a magical wand,btohqsg
To put things into perspective getting into oxbridge medicine needs you to have 3.9/4.0 GPA,btohqsg
Being privileged doesn't mean I don't acknowledge the effect of luck,btohqsg
And Oxbridge medicine too  isn't worth very much,btohqsg
I don't really think u understand what's needed for Oxbridge,btohqsg
Most competitive uni and most competitive course xd xd,btohqsg
just do your work. Do not be silent. Learn how to communicate and convince people and say your truth. I believe you can do well in life.,btohqsg
Whether or not I do well has nothing to do ur belief,btohqsg
I don't think you are in a place to give me advise honestly,btohqsg
That said  I know people from finance  law and medicine who are doing very well  in my extended family...  the numbers are just numbers.  They represent the mean or the average. Are you average???,btohqsg
I need to break into Administrative Service/s,btohqsg
I'm confused about where this Convo is leading,btohqsg
My dream since young was to help the population of Singapore by entering the elite Administrative Service to bring coordination within the government. Oh and/s,btohqsg
The convo is leading to the fact of social mobility which our government firmly believes is a political and societal truth.,btohqsg
You will be counselled to leave CEP too Low for your age sadlyfe,btohqsg
U obviously haven't read Ong Ye Kung speech,btohqsg
From 2 room hdb to landed.  Bs???,btohqsg
Maybe last time property prices cheaper,btohqsg
Is it worth it to lose your soul to earn a few million dollars???,btohqsg
But true hor  at my age Admin Service is Asst. Director or ++.  selfd0xing my age liao,btohqsg
Once again. We are talking about population stats  not personal victories,btohqsg
Administrative Service is all about judging now get lost so we can get fresh blood to replace you!!!,btohqsg
Lol have you ever tried asking this question with honest resposnes,btohqsg
Wah admin service confirm get special salary scale sia,btohqsg
No that's called 'Leadership renewal' hahahhaha,btohqsg
Honestly I don't think she knows what she's talking about,btohqsg
I suggest u go work and leave ur parents for a while to really look at the world,btohqsg
Salary scale and Admin Serv is independent IIRC,btohqsg
No need to be condescending. I know people in the legal service  and medical profession and doing very well and they came from humble backgrounds. My family friend Prem Raj as well used to stay in HDB and is a Public Prosecutor.,btohqsg
Obvious you haven't read enough about the Matthew effect nor know how population stats work,btohqsg
Does social mobility mean HDB can join AGC? Is that what it means?,btohqsg
I can give a ton of examples of ppl having succeeded from humble background,btohqsg
But for each example I give,btohqsg
If you choose to be blinded you will be blinded. Self fulfilling prophecies. Go see the graduate employment survey and open your eyes. Take care,btohqsg
There will be 100 more who failed,btohqsg
Gonna study now. It's gonna be a long way to be a doc. Bye.,btohqsg
What in the world is this suppose to indicate,btohqsg
Man  you think the world is a place where we can all win (so long we work hard),btohqsg
No it doesn't work that way,btohqsg
Good luck  when you take your oath  consider coming back here to share what you have learnt/done,btohqsg
I legit doubt ur morals as a doc,btohqsg
But ok what do I know,btohqsg
There's a place for everyone and everyone is serving others at a different level. Who cares if you are a doc? Your pay is from people who are sick or the hospital board of directors. These people contribute to the society in their own ways as well and without whom you are nothing. If you think a doc makes huge contribution think again. The very reason you are there at all is that the financiers have put in tons of money into research and have given hospitals and healthcare facilities for u to work in. These financiers are responsible to their equity holders  who  btw  are common people like you and me  making this cycle complete. I have no idea what you are trying to express sia,btohqsg
This is the first time I've heard ppl saying Matthew effect is pure bs and a wholely fake problem caused by an intentional choice,btohqsg
today only got 1 community case,btohqsg
hopefully the total numbers go down,btohqsg
And wow they say I'm toxic and the rest of u just enabled me,btohqsg
Thanks for enabling me lol guys,btohqsg
Talk about distributive justice and capital is toxic. I'll keep that in mind,btohqsg
Anybody here currently studying in SMU law?,btohqsg
Lmfao about money and employment again,btohqsg
Time to not answer chem ques for a while,btohqsg
My chem is deteriorated until -15%,btohqsg
1 pct everyday is what kind of disgusting growth,btohqsg
Is to show the power of improving urself,btohqsg
Time to change my life motto,btohqsg
My life motto clearly outdated alr,btohqsg
Hmm. Pretty sure doing a master's in 5 years doesn't improve myself by 77 mm times,btohqsg
Are you on a quest to send one article every morning?,btohqsg
lmao guys is it normal to be annoyed at people who have nothing to talk about other than their love and sex iife,btohqsg
like u no personality outside of shagging is it,btohqsg
i know this person for dunno how long  9/10 of the convo they start is about their bf their fwb their sex life,btohqsg
somemore this person v unattractive physically,btohqsg
idk why no one calls her out,btohqsg
There's one thing you can always say,btohqsg
How to stop grandpa telling me to study for 7.5 years? And I do study ALOT,btohqsg
he was a teacher 👨‍🏫 and now he became grandpa teacher 👨‍🏫,btohqsg
You jealous of the sexual experience ah,btohqsg
I have a questionHow to stop grandpa telling me to study for 7.5 years? And I do study ALOThe was a teacher 👨‍🏫 and now he became grandpa teacher 👨‍🏫,btohqsg
Children can’t change the minds of their elders,btohqsg
Just don’t take what they say to heart,btohqsg
I came to Canada to live with grandparents in grade 5,btohqsg
I get he telling me to study then because I was young and to new/old world and I didn’t know much of English well back then,btohqsg
But now I’m grade 11 and I am very good at English then him. And I am grade 11,btohqsg
What if your grandparents and parents suddenly turn young again,btohqsg
But i think its about the plasma infusion,btohqsg
90% chance its on plasma infusion,btohqsg
I think I saw soemthing about NAD+ haha,btohqsg
Neil  u signed up for the testing trials right,btohqsg
Theh say they gonna trial on human I think,btohqsg
I not looking forward to extend life,btohqsg
I thought its to look younger,btohqsg
It has been around since like 2010s hahah,btohqsg
😱 Someone has allegedly been hiding these containers in trees at Hougang Ave 7  causing mosquitos to breed.➡️https://bit.ly/2ZThV29,btohqsg
Wah i cant imagine living outside sengkang,btohqsg
Which retard put it there sia,btohqsg
In b4 the government planted these containers to decrease the population,btohqsg
I was suppose to take exam now but the issac card account locked haha,btohqsg
But u have to come back right,btohqsg
It’s counted as COU ah lol,btohqsg
I hope I dun need to come back since they doing the clearance for posting out,btohqsg
Coz they say non-COU telecommute lik,btohqsg
So I would assume that we just stay at home until we graduate lol,btohqsg
Or u report to work next Monday,btohqsg
@yukemingyesterday you shared those China channel YouTube got commentary video sia,btohqsg
It would be a real achievement if I can know enough mandarin to understand the speaker in real time,btohqsg
I also got watch English vids but not so informative,btohqsg
U can go watch the vid about capital as instrument of change,btohqsg
I'm sending an email to air force,btohqsg
Are you under the impression that I work in the Air Force?,btohqsg
Explain why I’m still going to work then,btohqsg
I ask AETI to fail u,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionthe thing is we have nothing to do,btohqsg
We are graduating 10th June so,btohqsg
Anyone got try fiverr services before ?,btohqsg
haha pls getting laid isnt hard?,btohqsg
its just disgusting to keep broadcasting degeneracy,btohqsg
also when someone has nothing to talk about than their gross hookups,btohqsg
its sad  not sth to be jealous abt,btohqsg
i agree with this russian guy for once,btohqsg
How come i see playdoh here but riviera on desktop,btohqsg
Same reason why you see quizarium buttons I suppose,btohqsg
Fk it imma go back to practising,btohqsg
Oh yes please ban me again,btohqsg
I’m not helping you guys write any more guides,btohqsg
I’ve been doing it for so Long and then you guys ban me?,btohqsg
so idk where you were banned,btohqsg
Gonna unsubscribes and I hope you guys die,btohqsg
if you're gonna continue this behaviour here without further explanation then you're out of here too,btohqsg
they tried but with limited success,btohqsg
even if they can do it on mices  its prob way more complicated on humans,btohqsg
so we will have a perpetual rodent infestation. Cos they just wun die,btohqsg
They make them look and feel young tho,btohqsg
Looks young  feels young  must be young,btohqsg
Yea for now  but imagine they succeed and the rats escape,btohqsg
But why would humans wana be immortal anw,btohqsg
There is this scifi show called in time,btohqsg
Everyone can possibly be immortal by moderating ur gene expression and then we can basically tag ur wealth to ur lifespan,btohqsg
Of u are poor u will run out of time and die,btohqsg
Isnt that just wads happening now either way?,btohqsg
hmm is this about malthusian trap?,btohqsg
I think they are trying to classify aging as a disease,btohqsg
Live so long just to generate more waste and more problems,btohqsg
What I am thinking is what if your parents and grands parents look young again,btohqsg
the only reason we seek meaning is cos we die,btohqsg
What if there is nothing after death,btohqsg
Children don’t know that they will die,btohqsg
Imagine immortality is there  then resource constraints will be much worse,btohqsg
Burdened with the reality of death,btohqsg
What if you become a cyborg in the future,btohqsg
Or enable immortality but sterilise everyone,btohqsg
the religious live life as they do cos they belive their actions here have long term consequence,btohqsg
Imagine suddenly got world ending event then how,btohqsg
the non religious live their life as they do because yolo  theres nothing after death,btohqsg
If aliens show up  does that undermine religion,btohqsg
speculate or stroke our psyche all we want and give reasons to die  we all die nonetheless,btohqsg
There are no mention of aliens in some religious texts  I believe,btohqsg
Hence why some religious people don’t believe in cells,btohqsg
no fun mingling with the same 7 billion over and over again,btohqsg
imagine a world whereby donald trump can become president over and over,btohqsg
I am not too clear about the religion part,btohqsg
erm theres a psychological need to nurture your young,btohqsg
You are now banned from r/childfree,btohqsg
i want to stay child free,btohqsg
Anyways I am glad that I just finished all my homework lol,btohqsg
yea man but technology has a way to extend that limit,btohqsg
eh flu just killed how many people,btohqsg
yea many cults have the belief that God comes in the form of aliens,btohqsg
and u can mass suicide so ur spirit can ascend to the spaceships,btohqsg
In very unrelated news  anyone want to drink some kool aid,btohqsg
any one to intro nice english drams to watch?,btohqsg
there was a cult that held a party and let thousands of ppl drink kool aid.... it was drugged and all died,btohqsg
erm trying to catch up with westworld  the americans now,btohqsg
the cult was in the us in 1960s i believe,btohqsg
done with that  let's just say that its a retirement plan for chemists to diy in the states,btohqsg
although the rad now is to do it in asia,btohqsg
thailand is hot for making syns for party highs,btohqsg
but almost all netflix ones i have watched,btohqsg
there are geographical restrictions in asia,btohqsg
So no need to come anymore haha,btohqsg

So that means my team all pass the exam lmao,btohqsg
hi everyone!just putting out a call again to help us out with our survey (https://go.exams.sg/census2020) ! thank you c:,btohqsg
hi how to resolve sql error,btohqsg
like when I try to upload something to the uni matriculation portal it says sql error,btohqsg
does it give more information on the sql error?,btohqsg
double check what you submitted whether it fits the specifications,btohqsg
if not means their backend fked up alr,btohqsg
because it’s hard or easy ?,btohqsg
And there’s hardly any maths in it which is quite a large part of physics,btohqsg
Hardest math you use in jc physics is like cosine rule,btohqsg
The hardest calculus is pretty much counting squares under the graph,btohqsg
I don't see much high math in JC/High school physics,btohqsg
Even for undergrad  most things are magick-handwave to become linear,btohqsg
Not saying that quadratics would be easy though,btohqsg
By this I mean globally btw,btohqsg
I dont think high school physics need use calculus,btohqsg
Yeah I not much sure any other thing  but possibly got  but if you know any of those you are into the deep end already,btohqsg
Got use linear algebra and multivar de uni physics,btohqsg
Fluid dynamics use multivar. Vibration use linear al,btohqsg
Solving for forces in structure also use linear algebra,btohqsg
ya laplace but not all that hard,btohqsg
Wow wow wow you took functional analysis alr?,btohqsg
All of these come under 'special functions ' since they are just diff eqns/diff eqn solns,btohqsg
Functional analysis is level 4k mod,btohqsg
Does it really matter what level it is,btohqsg
Under prof Gan Wee Teck it was Super hard apparently,btohqsg
A year ago it was by denny leung,btohqsg
I lucky sia I almost wanted to take LOl in the end I just took Topo,btohqsg
TBH till today I have no fking clue what is a Topological Insulator,btohqsg
There was one lesson he tried to prove Ascoli Theorem and everyone didn’t understand it and gave up lmao,btohqsg
At least he got no accent,btohqsg
Are you like year 1 NUS,btohqsg
is ascoli's theorem arzela-ascoli or smth different,btohqsg
i'll wait until i take topo before i scare myself further,btohqsg
Suddenly a lot of maths majors here,btohqsg
Math is too hard to understand,btohqsg
No need all the esoteric topics,btohqsg
Just probability is enough to kill,btohqsg
Probability comes from an esoteric topic also,btohqsg
Its the job of mathematicians to make the simple things complicated,btohqsg
anything that can be abstracted  can and must be abstracted :'),btohqsg
I heard Euler's equation prompted string theory,btohqsg
Any1 here has RI's 2019 H2 Chem Prelim paper? If have pm me thanks!,btohqsg
At least got some practical use,btohqsg
Hi  I am going to be a Physics major soon lol,btohqsg
That I dunno  but I know non Euclidean geometry went from no apparent use to theory of relativity,btohqsg
Plus now change to online tutoring  so actually easier than f2f,btohqsg
Eh I thought also for flight calculations,btohqsg
Or even better  primes were useless since Ancient Greek times,btohqsg
Until now we have cryptography and shit,btohqsg
The earth is equivalent to a coffee cup,btohqsg
i just realised your username is cauchycriterion 👀,btohqsg
Cauchy named his theorem after me,btohqsg
good job you basically invented analysis,btohqsg
MOE would like to interview you on your integrity and ethics,btohqsg
Oh but non Euclidean geometry was invented before flight,btohqsg
the money doesnt go into the causes,btohqsg
it goes straight into the website's pockets,btohqsg
i did research on multiple sources,btohqsg
the people who create the petition receives $0 for the causes they start,btohqsg
and the millions and millions of dollars people donate goes intochange.org's pocket,btohqsg
also they will anyhow charge your credit cards randomly for money,btohqsg
Hey guys is there any way that I can get RI O level examination papers? Specifically EL  Maths and science (chem + phy) papers.,btohqsg
RI O level is rare  cause only like 20 people or something take it,btohqsg
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1T5iCp0UQcJvTnomE-FOaQBEe4V5B1o82you can try this for non RI papers,btohqsg
and to add on  their o level results is quite bad. I know their o level mean l1r5 this yr,btohqsg
partially cos their o lvl papers don't exactly set questions tailored to the o lvl syllabus closely,btohqsg
I see who uploaded the papers,btohqsg
Yeah  Amos Yee is a hero to the Sg students community,btohqsg
oh actually it makes sense? i feel like adultery isn’t something that should be punished by the law but like the couple should sort it out for themselves,btohqsg
like it can be recognised in the divorce for a bigger settlement etc but i think putting poeple in jail for it is too much,btohqsg
if u read the article it also says activists claimed the law was used to unfairly target women so that’s another thing,btohqsg
And pre-marital hand holding should be forbidden,btohqsg
We should purge all CS majors. They are turely the lowest scums,btohqsg
Trying not to be sexist here,btohqsg
But idr the name of the male panda,btohqsg
U were meant to see that,btohqsg
And u are free enough to come here,btohqsg
Maybe there are some law grads here,btohqsg
Save ur energy to argue with ur cm,btohqsg
This happened cos 周扬青went to defile罗志祥reputation,btohqsg
And apparently she did it to get more traffic to get new biz,btohqsg
Both are fucked up people seeking pure profit only,btohqsg
😷 A man claimed over 200 face masks using illegally obtained personal information.➡️https://bit.ly/2zLbl2K,btohqsg
Rip hahaha what a step up for yishun,btohqsg
For cheating  he could be imprisoned for up to 10 years  and be liable to a fine.For retaining illegally obtained personal information  he could be imprisoned up to three years  or fined up to S$10 000 or both.,btohqsg
What's the street value of masks now lol,btohqsg
Recently saw a box of 50 selling for $39,btohqsg
Also a kind person in my neighbourhood left their contact details to give ppl free masks,btohqsg
For 1 good person there's probably 10 shit ones,btohqsg
I would like to be good but I believe I'm bad from the views of more ppl than I am good,btohqsg
Again  there's 10 shit people who are quick to judge you,btohqsg
Lol salary talk yesterday and I saw this,btohqsg
Do you use Chinese in your work,btohqsg
Wtf he looks like a uni student,btohqsg
Meanwhile there's me wasting my life away,btohqsg
Y don’t you make like Terence Tao and get a PhD from Stanford by the age of 19,btohqsg
I can't get a PhD at 19,btohqsg
If you're so good at math why can't you just subtract 1 from 20?,btohqsg
This is why I'm not Terrence Tao,btohqsg
I think she expected the response la attention seeker success,btohqsg
Can you imagine dating a gold digger,btohqsg
Later you run out of money then she confirm dump the relationship sia,btohqsg
For those who need it  not me,btohqsg
But what happens if you date a rich person and you are poor,btohqsg
That brings to mind quite a number of ppl,btohqsg
Li Ann  Obama  Liu qiangdong  Ren zhengfei  Wang jianlin,btohqsg
When I think about it  one downside is that your rich gf might be accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle her whole life  then maybe you have to increase expenditure to keep up.,btohqsg
Hahahha you assuming the women doesn't earn her own money,btohqsg
What I am thinking is that your rich gf could have their own circle of friends that is rich then that is probably where you will spend more  like restaurant food,btohqsg
That's why门当户对is something most ppl seek,btohqsg
Erm pick someone ur own league,btohqsg
But tbh how are you supposed to know your league lol,btohqsg
Circle of friends  income level  habits  education etc ba,btohqsg
tfw everyone's out of your league because they're too good,btohqsg
Good in research != good in teaching,btohqsg
There is some truth to it ok,btohqsg
I want to join Ben leong dating service lol,btohqsg
