Interesting  because I've heard horror stories of Forester maintanence too,btohqsg
Just depends on how you maintain the car and drive as well I think,btohqsg
Heard of a Forester owner who did around 65 to 70k in a few years and his gearbox died. Needed to change the whole unit. Another one who's aircon completely shut off,btohqsg
Yeah man agreed... boxers are known to be slightly less reliable when preventive maintenance is not done,btohqsg
"Not covered in warranty either because they ""missed a service at the agent"" but always service at the agent",btohqsg
Can put up my lexus here for sale?,btohqsg
any Sienta hybrid driver drove up to genting before ? enough power to reach the top ?,btohqsg
Then eat happened to the COEs that people bidded  how can so little car sold when COE issued were so much more?,btohqsg
Nowadays car are so efficient  that why I always said the speed limit is too outdated   in actual fact nowadays cars are way too powerful haha,btohqsg
haha back to the good ol times when the ford model T was sufficient,btohqsg
This is not included as new COEs issued... These are under PQP which is based on 3 months average,btohqsg
but our sienta hybrid is not that powerful. üòÖ just to ask any bro here have experience driving up and share their views üòä,btohqsg
I thought u asking how come so little car is been purchased and where did the coe go to ? So I assumed it should went to cars that renew coe,btohqsg
Is more then enough I can confirm at most your rpm is at 3000 all the way,btohqsg
No  the renewal of COE is not included in the issuance of new COE... New COE is based on the numbers of car scrapped and LTA's allowance for vehicle growth.,btohqsg
Or maybe the data is onlyFor ad only have to read the fine prints,btohqsg
even with 1 driver and 4 adults on boards ? üòÖ,btohqsg
Agree  cars are powerful and stable to maintain slightly higher speeds but are the drivers trained and capable enough to manage them? Food for thought. Btw I'm all for a speed limit increase but just another point of view,btohqsg
Shouldn't be any issue to go up as I used to drive a 600cc car up there but certain part of the uphill slope need to use 3 gear,btohqsg
cool üòé üÜíÔ∏è üòéany passengers onboard,btohqsg
Should be fine sir! Genting not as steep as the Top Gear stunt dam! Sienta should work out  enjoy your trip!,btohqsg
Actually a lot of accident is due to frustration and cars moving too slow   most of the time I also get wander off as the traffic is really too slow   I can even look at the other lane   and other cars,btohqsg
genting is no kick to toyota they are solid machine üòé,btohqsg
Case in point right there  if you're getting bored while driving because traffic is slow. Probably shouldn't be driving at that point. Driving is all about patience and focus. Both of which are required more and more as the speed increases,btohqsg
Sir  if you driving  please look ahead. Dont get distracted and let your mind float away.#DriveSlowDriveSafe,btohqsg
actually I drove up KL last weekend and along the way I don't find similar model along the NSHW which makes me worry is this model suitable in Malaysia üòÖ,btohqsg
coming long weekend  aiming to drive up genting with 5pax on board üòé,btohqsg
Ya I understand but is really too slow   just look at at traffic light interval at turning right   how slow the cars move and how long the traffic light interval is . I hope the traffic light interval be like 50% faster and put in timer   so driver can concentrate and move off faster then taking own sweet time   some time a green turn right arrow only 3-4 cars past thru and got to wait another 5 minutes,btohqsg
The timer is actually counter productive because it'll make people see got few seconds left and speed up to beat the light which can be the cause of a crash again. Just depends on different drivers and what they're comfortable doing  all about patience again. Sometimes drivers may not have visibility of oncoming traffic on a blank arrow so they wait  which is understandable. Traffic light timings really depend on traffic conditions as well  timing changes throughout the day!,btohqsg
Agree with your point about the waiting though  sometimes can be annoying if you're rushing somewhere but I guess we just have to deal with it because all people using the roads ü§óü§ó,btohqsg
i agree with you Mr Arnav. Patience is a virture. Those few minutes spend may prevent a potentially fatal accident. Thks for your insightüòãüòã,btohqsg
If u notice most of the driver are not focusing on road while waiting for green light   some are in park gear   and when the light turn green   they have to take engage back to drive   and this lead to chain effect of mass delay,btohqsg
With timer at least they can be more prepared,btohqsg
While in Seattle I notice how fast the traffic light interval is   and the traffic is smoother   our traffic light interval really is unnesscary too long,btohqsg
That's true  but I guess that is just our local driver nature at times. A short honk is usually enough to wake them up from their TikTok/Facebook scrolling sessions.,btohqsg
If you look at the American intersection system you might also see how much bigger their roads are and how spaced out people are. Really cannot compare  different driving dynamics altogether,btohqsg
I mean on the small road   u press the green man button within 10 plus second it will be green man,btohqsg
When traffic is light having fast interval is really making traffic smoother   then to pile up a long stretch of cars  and the car that had had the pole start is a slow and road hogger the traffic jam is even worse,btohqsg
Road hogging issue is actually getting worst and cars behind them built up frustration and can lead to accident,btohqsg
Slow moving off   slow acceleration  maintain low speed,btohqsg
They think they are safe driver   but cars behind them is really frustrated   that why u see so many tail gating,btohqsg
what if they old people haha give chance luh,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt tail gate   I just endure with the frustration and over take if condition allow,btohqsg
I would say as long as the person isn't too slow like under 35 in a 50. It's still ok because you don't know what their skill level is plus if they have older people in the back who need a smoother ride etc. And going off lines  not every car has high torque to go off quick and people don't floor it everywhere I guess. Tailgating is what leads to the accident actually not the slow moving car in front. If the cars behind can maintain distance  you will be safe and then overtake the car when you have a chance,btohqsg
Mr Simple Guy  I am also inclined to agree with you. Road Hogging has been a very serious issue as of late. Too many road users believe that lane 1 is to travel at the speed limit which is a common ‚ùåMISCONCEPTION‚ùå.This kind of behaviour makes expressway INEFFICIENT  really inconsiderate. I am sure more needs to be done to educate road users on road ettiquete.,btohqsg
Yes one of the way to tackle road hogging is increase speed limit to 110 km,btohqsg
Is it safe? or should we all use TESLA AUTOPILOT to drive?,btohqsg
Most of the country are also at 110 km   Singapore road infrastructure is so good but limit is at 80-90   with modern Car technology and the amount of cars   80-90 is just way too slow,btohqsg
And then what  we will have people driving at 110 in lane 1 and others who still want to go faster,btohqsg
I hear home loan rates now up 1% this year,btohqsg
