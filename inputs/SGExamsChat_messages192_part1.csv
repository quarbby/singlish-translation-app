Or give younger sister that is sec 3,btohqsg
But she got her stuff also,btohqsg
I think so dont ask me my phy and eng cmi one ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Uâ€™ll be addicted but not that - u will actually become very organized n systematic even in ur own life!,btohqsg
sounds like an ad to me,btohqsg
If there was bell curve A1 would probably be in the 80s,btohqsg
Got mcq if u get at least 30 theres no way u will fail,btohqsg
I got 25 but still got c5,btohqsg
i hope they linient for science,btohqsg
Now weâ€™re left with MCQ sci paper.. is it the right time to throw wks of other subs away?,btohqsg
This isnt a particular thing introduced in 2020. Bellcurves never existed,btohqsg
Bellcurve sees whats the avg/most common score people got and sets grade ranges based on that,btohqsg
anyone has the ans key for pure phy?,btohqsg
This only exists in Uni mods,btohqsg
like the percentile all these ah,btohqsg
Moderation is based on difficulty of paper. If a particular question has a lot of ppl doing poorly for it. That ques will be marked leniently or the grade required to get a grade for that paper will be adjusted by a mark or two,btohqsg
Oh so moderation is question based,btohqsg
Conversly if u have many ppl doing well for it obv the grade required will be higher,btohqsg
No one knows but it makes more sense to do it by ques than the entire paper,btohqsg
And im sure u wouldnt want a bellcurve either. But ill leave it for when yall learn statistics in poly or jc,btohqsg
does anyone have pure physics answer?,btohqsg
The body size arm size head size and the face,btohqsg
What is the best budget 5G smartphone?,btohqsg
No bell curve but pretty sure grade threshold is still being used,btohqsg
cant think of something cheaper besides iPhone 12 mini lol,btohqsg
Samsung should probably have just that idk,btohqsg
If more ppl do worse merely A% rates just fall lor,btohqsg
Their goal is just to maintain a specific range of scores for certain grades,btohqsg
I have an exam later and i still have yet to study,btohqsg
A lvl gp A grade im quite sure is minimally 70 for example,btohqsg
It doesnt make much sense coz it will then be forgiving to those who make mistakes on the easier questions,btohqsg
Even if a paper is extremely hard and a lot of ppl do badly,btohqsg
We will nvr see cut off of an A fall from 75 to 65 for example,btohqsg
There will be a minimum threshold it cannot fall beyond,btohqsg
Yalah thats why u dun see so many hard ques,btohqsg
Hahaha i agree but is fun,btohqsg
Anyone has physics and bio papers,btohqsg
Anyone interested in joining wildrift community please PM me,btohqsg
Icic add me to this community,btohqsg
God Discord can be annoying to look at sometimes,btohqsg
I would agree with her  but then I would be wrong,btohqsg

Reminder that all of sgexams discord mods are turbo weebs,btohqsg
I wouldn't be brave to talk to them,btohqsg
They would probably just talk about how much they love to spend 500 dollars on their fav trending gacha game,btohqsg
Yeah that sounds like a hard hitter,btohqsg
