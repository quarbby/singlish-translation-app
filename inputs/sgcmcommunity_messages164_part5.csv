But I feel that their selling strategy worked ? Because I have a colleague who just bought a T cross too,btohqsg
this is peer pressure that's why you wanna buy,btohqsg
He was also sold the idea of ‚Äúget a T cross now and few years later can upgrade to some other car‚Äù,btohqsg
Not really. Because I went to see see look look first,btohqsg
don't listen to them la  get a skoda kodiaq,btohqsg
drive for 5 years maybe can change to EV liao,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a new thing  of course they‚Äôll be pushing it. Cars depreciate. The only country where regular cars appreciate is in Singapore  but don‚Äôt hold your breath on COE and resale being higher,btohqsg
Buy what you want  forget the gimmick of being able to trade around without losing money  it always will.,btohqsg
But the road tax is really cheap,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs really expensive.A secondhand might work for me more,btohqsg
Car only losses  no profit one ü§≠ü§≠ loose more or loose lesser only,btohqsg
"Actually can ""upgrade"" is because of the false sense that now coe very high  few years down the road if and that is if coe drops by half or more",btohqsg
Buy 4d toto also  if strike its loose less not windfall  or like tontine,btohqsg
It will only increase won't decrease,btohqsg
Omg. All countries luffing @ us. Pay so much for 1.0L,btohqsg
"Can only pray lo...like my dad's time when he change a 2009 altis for a 2014 one ""1 to 1""  only because coe not that high and the 2009 altis still got full 5 yrs left but his monthly is higher",btohqsg
So  the vw car agent is basically filling the customer brain with bs...if doesn't understand the car market  then will buy it lo,btohqsg
I know because I work in sales,btohqsg
But really was sold the idea at the point in time.,btohqsg
Lol means the sales guy's got skill..but just remember there's no free lunch where buying car in sg is concerned  even if low or no down-payment to change car  there's the monthly that we can't escape and definitely be higher than now,btohqsg
He was saying this one will be an upgrade. Not sure if monthly will be sane or higher ?,btohqsg
"Lol upgrade sure means monthly also ""upgrade"" one la",btohqsg
Oh from note to vw t cross yeah of course upgrade,btohqsg
I believe even if you take the car price less 30% and divide by 7(max)  monthly sure higher than what you're paying now,btohqsg

Your note I believe is about 800 to 1k monthly? Or 1.2?,btohqsg
if ur gna do grab  ur maintenance gna up.. just rent,btohqsg
Yes about $700 now.If change will be doubled $1 400.Very ex indeed.But the dealer mentioned to bank on the next change (VW to Audi) when COE drops in the coming 2025 plus minus. But I don‚Äôt know how the math work out. Shld have asked,btohqsg
If you buy during high COE and trade in during low COE  won't you lose alot of money instead?,btohqsg
"Now some owner can get ""profit"" cause they buy low COE and sell during high COE. So if you do that in 2025 when the COE supply is high  won't the value of your car get cut by alot?",btohqsg
Yes this is what they quote me for my current car. Profit of few K,btohqsg
You buy civic confirm can profit,btohqsg
Buy dogecoin!! In a few years  dogecoin to the moon!!!,btohqsg
sell high buy high  your monthly will jump much higher.if few years down the road COE drops significantly and you bought with loan. don't think it will help you jump to a more expensive car.you might even have to sell at loss and top up to repay your loan.,btohqsg
Wah that's very irresponsible of him to say that. He's asking you to bet on it but if coe doesn't drop  you'll be left hanging dry  not him.,btohqsg
High enough to cover the dp lo  like in my dad's case a decade ago,btohqsg
"Lol erase the word ""profit""  its a term such sales ppl use to try and smoke you.",btohqsg
no one knows when coe will drop  if it doesnt  u are screwed financially. while he still gets his commission,btohqsg
i remember there was a time ppl had to topup to sell their car.,btohqsg
yah keep within ur means. there is no need to upgrade now if u dun need.,btohqsg
Your money is hard-earned  dun let it go so easily,btohqsg
700 to 1.4k that's x2 of now,btohqsg
Wa this one jialat. You sell to get money end up lose money,btohqsg
no choice if u need to cut expenses,btohqsg
compensate 5k rather than 15 or 20k problem,btohqsg
that's what i know.so don't know what logic that salesman is trying to smoke,btohqsg
just drive ur current car until it cant meet your practical needs  then change to a bigger one,btohqsg
I think it's because of the loan so have to tiap money,btohqsg
all salesman just want their commission and their KPI. No one cares about you More than Urself,btohqsg
