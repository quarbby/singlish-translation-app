The phv co.s are being smart,btohqsg
And phasing them out in stages,btohqsg
So that the coe's introduced into the market aren't going in altogether and creating a surge of supply,btohqsg
By doing it in stages  they can control the number of coe's going back in and thus control prices,btohqsg
Higher COE is good for phv co.s and car sharing co.s because people are less likely to buy a car at the low to middle income sector,btohqsg
And will therefore use more of their services,btohqsg
so there is some form of market manipulation after all,btohqsg
