Can I ask which DBS promo is more worth it?1) DBS VISA AltitudeSpend $3000  get 43 000 miles2) DBS Yuu VISASpend $800  get $388 cash,btohqsg
should be fine  mobile virtual card has different number from physical card,btohqsg
My snack purchase stuck at $4.9 since yesterday noon,btohqsg
Do update us on your experiment hahaha,btohqsg
Uob promo is out. Is it still stackable with the One account 4% interest? And do I move the money out on 28 June Friday?Will I be able to move all $150k at one go? Does anyone know?,btohqsg
Should be possible. Tried it once on the same trip when my mum forgot her EZ Link.  (Im using the UOB KF for this)However do note that this two transactions will not be grouped together even if they are made on the same day.(1 transaction for the physical  1 transaction for the mobile card),btohqsg
Do you know when will the weekly limit be reset?,btohqsg
probably monday. Anyway can easily set a higher limit,btohqsg
I will stay at $5 for next week,btohqsg

What do you mean UOB promo is out? The earmarked promo is usually announced on the first day of the promo. Another promo?,btohqsg
Did you verify against SimplyGo app if they reconcile as 2 trips or reported as 4 trips? Visa will only report it as 2 transactions.,btohqsg
Hi  may i know if there is any cap for amuse card for oversea spending? As from what i understand   using in sg  there is fee charge over 1k.,btohqsg
I saw one called big savings or something,btohqsg
u guys! dun abuse amuse card! lol,btohqsg
Hi guys  for standard chartered smart credit card1. Anyone knows how many supplementary cards can one apply?2. Whether this card can be directly tapped at the Bus/MRT terminals or does it have to be added to SimplyGo app?3. Whether I can add it to Google or Apple pay and use mobile contactless to pay for Bus/MRT?,btohqsg
Why do you have to add to simplygo? Simplygo doesn‚Äôt make your card magically becomes a transport cardWhy can‚Äôt you add it to google or Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Hi All My Income Tax 1st Instalment is on Aug 2024.May I know when setup CardUp  what is the date I should put for deduction from my credit card?Thanks.,btohqsg
Ok understood can just use card directly or add to Google pay or Apple pay to pay via mobile contactless.,btohqsg
at least one week before 6th each month,btohqsg
Funny thing is that I explained what SimplyGo not too long ago only,btohqsg
When you setup on CardUp  they provide you with all the info you need. Ideally the previous month on 12th.,btohqsg
Yea probably they just don‚Äôt bother to search,btohqsg
Good deal. Spend $250 and get $250 cashback?Use it for daily bus and mrt transport.,btohqsg
Do you guys income tax with cardup split to many months or just pay in one short  I feel pay once is easier and not to think much in the future,btohqsg
Your cashback is for what transaction?,btohqsg
Those with DCS and Union QR can pay. But app discontinuing already.,btohqsg
I not using dinersSGpay lah .,btohqsg
looks like the dcs card app can do unionpay payments directly,btohqsg
Of course split lol. 0% interest  get to clock spending for certain cards. You have more breathing space for your cashflow.,btohqsg
Hi All.. Good afternoon...Yesterday I have a gathering with my ex colleagues.. We are arguing whether we should pay off our mortgage early or take our own time to pay off.,btohqsg
Yes. Usually if SGQr have xnap would have Amex pay and DCS as well,btohqsg
Ohh So only the unionpay version of dcs works,btohqsg
Nowadays I started use amex more cos I signed up with 3% CB. Seldom use DCS,btohqsg
https://dcscc.com/dcs-cards-app#QR-paymentWith the link explanation is better. Only UnionPay with UnionPay QR supported.,btohqsg
1st scenarioMy ex colleague have a 2nd home.. and the tenant is paying the mortgage.. He feel it is a must to pay off the mortgage asap as the interest rate interest.  But we argue that he will still have to pay income tax in the near future... Do you agree?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think any good card  i plan to use prvi  which is no different pay it monthly or annual  I know get free cash flow to put in bank for interest,btohqsg
Any card that net cashback/miles with CardUp is a good card.,btohqsg
Hi all masters here  i hv a doubt. I hv uob one account with uob lady spending with $500 now. I took part the uob big saving using uob one account.Could I apply another UOB lady account with $20k deposit to get uob big savings and also additional miles of 2 UNI$?So both UoB ONE accoutn and UOb lady accoutn will base on one same uob lady spendings of $500 only..Any prob?,btohqsg
2nd Senario..He should use the money or invest SRS for share then putting in the mortgage.. we told him but he feel that at age of 40..he shouldn't have too much commitment,btohqsg
Should not put 20k. 10k is enough. 0.05% p.a. is a very horrible rate. And no  if you already take part in the promo you cannot take part again.And to be net positive for the 2mpd on Lady's Card (not Solitaire)  you have to spend 1k not only 500.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no right or wrong in both scenarios. There‚Äôs nothing to agree or disagree about.If his investment yield a higher rate than his loan interest rate  then sure. But he can still pay it off early then any future cash flow he gets can still be put into investment. Don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs the conflict here. It‚Äôs just a chicken and egg issueWhats the link between income tax and paying off mortgage?,btohqsg
That's from 2 months ago. The next promo is in Jul  if there is.,btohqsg
Depends on the interest rate obtained,btohqsg
Does anyone know if uob krisflyer has a cap on spending for rewards? Tried looking at terms conditions but didn‚Äôt see it,btohqsg
does does shopback accept instarem ? so i can stack citi reward + instarem + shopback for additional cashback,btohqsg
Any datapoint on how often those upsized cashback (eg 6% becomes 15% for Klook) happens?,btohqsg
Mine is solitaire. So $500 per mth. In that case  perhaps i just put 10k to earn extra 2 miles. Thxxx,btohqsg
no instarem points for local spend  conversely may incur 1% fee if exceed 1k local spend in the month,btohqsg
You might need to calculate the breakeven point for the miles  depending on how you value miles too. I might be wrong but anything below 1k is not worth the opportunity cost. Ideally 2k.,btohqsg
