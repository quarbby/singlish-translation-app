I'm 171 and 47 kg I'm severly underweight,btohqsg
Miss you know I stand on the scale  I nearly tip over the scale and fell down,btohqsg
i think that weight is alright,btohqsg
youre of norm bmi  and bmi is useless  if you have large muscle mass  youre bound to be heavierim 150cm 50kg but i have both muscles and fats because i stopped going to the gym,btohqsg
Good to put on some weight  don't be like me. Freezing in every air conditioned room,btohqsg
Cause I have barely any fats to keep me warm,btohqsg
certain parts of my body that tend to be composed of fat are relatively large (not bragging btw) so could be a factor,btohqsg
bmi says otherwise but also because theyre tall hahaha,btohqsg

but I don't really like want to be 45kg or anyth,btohqsg
I just dw to like feel lethargic everyday,btohqsg
regardless of weight  being more active is a good thing,btohqsg
just dont be on a weighing scale thinking weight means health,btohqsg
so decouple the idea of exercising from just trying to lose weight,btohqsg
Is it good I stand for 1hr on the bus,btohqsg
do you have any backstory as to why youÊ¼re severly underweight  like do you have any form of eating disorder or is your appetite just near to 0,btohqsg

I stand from ang mo kio to eunos daily,btohqsg
i mean that's a start but it's very minimal,btohqsg
like sometimes even skinny people can have lots of health problems,btohqsg
No disorders that I know of  I love food but for a period of time was lazy to buy food. I had money for food but was just super lazy,btohqsg
Holidays I'll often sleep late  then skip pass breakfast. Eat heavy lunch and light dinner,btohqsg
The prob is  is it giving me weight,btohqsg
or maybe you have a high metabolism?,btohqsg
because being this skinny isnt exactly good for your health,btohqsg
standing expends some level of energy,btohqsg
I rmb going on a binge of fast food and oily foods  I did not even put on any weight,btohqsg
That was a good 6 months,btohqsg
well at least youre eating. i thought you have ED or something. thats good,btohqsg
yea some of my v skinny friends are like that too,btohqsg
also is having high/low metabolism a genetic trait,btohqsg
they just try to build muscle through their exercise,btohqsg
Yep my main diet was fastfood,btohqsg
If not what train for high metabolism,btohqsg
I have some muscle but not in the places you expect,btohqsg
