MCC Codes are a bit of a black box for the consumer. Whilst it could possibly vary  I think most of it is fairly similar  so whilst not a firm answer  I think that you could get a best guess of the MCC by referring to the following 2 websites:What Card: This website does not look it's up to date. But the MCCs (where available) are probably a guesstimate of what it might be today.https://www.whatcard.sg/Citi MCCs: Whilst other institutions may vary  I've compared a few codes and so far  all of them seem to use the same codes so I think it's a fairly decent guestimate of what the codes may refer too.https://www.citibank.com/tts/solutions/commercial-cards/assets/docs/govt/Merchant-Category-Codes.pdfNot an absolute certainty but I hope this helps to provide best guess for those looking for MCCs.,btohqsg

I dont think i spend too much for miles to be possible imo. (Abt 800 per month maybe) right now i using 1.6% cashback card. Dbs fresh live could potentially be 5% -10% (aka transport 10%). Family n friends is 8%. Citi rewards technically can get $50 vouchers which give about 2.2% excluding amaze card. I usually spend bulk on food (delivery and dine including friends and family food). I know not all cb eligible for each expenditure. Citi rewards could get from most thanks to amaze card pairing,btohqsg
