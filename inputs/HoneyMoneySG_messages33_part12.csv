Xnap able to use with what cards? Amex or cmrc ok?,btohqsg
Amex can as long as you can add to Google/Apple Pay (I believe UOB and DBS Amex cards can't be added). CRMC can also  but only 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
Ok I will try it out,btohqsg
So far had been working for me.  But may be it's my phone  find it slow in retrieving the cards for me to choose which card to use and completing the payment.  A bit stress when many people waiting behind me. Haha..üòÖ,btohqsg
Same here.  I am able to add Amex but not UOB Amex.,btohqsg
I used all 3 and now with DBS. Other banks support is hopeless,btohqsg
uob amex cannot add to any mobile wallet,btohqsg
I read that there are people saying failed to pay with XNAP with Amex selected and reason could be due to the stall don't accept Amex.  I had only been using Citi Visa or Citi Master so far and both working ok.,btohqsg

My gripe with xnap is that it depends on gpay  which does not support Maybank and boc cards. My first try at xnap... The app took ages to detect the qr.,btohqsg
If you can add the card to GPay you can use it,btohqsg
What is the best combination for xnap?,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  as of now  XNAP  is just adding a layer to scan QR Code and rest of function done by Google Play / Apple Pay.  So wo the 2 is as good as not able to use XNAP.,btohqsg
