u dont need to go to a good JC to experience overseas trips?,btohqsg
E math I only got like about 87% too,btohqsg
and u dont need to go to a good JC to qualify for overseas?,btohqsg
as i already said weeks before,btohqsg
u seem to have an inferiority complex,btohqsg
just cos u are in a 'not so good' jc  doesn't mean u cant go to uni right,btohqsg
i wasn't from a good jc either,btohqsg
i believe milo also can testify,btohqsg
thats like the biggest nonsense i seen,btohqsg
my qn to u is  why is it easier for someone to go to uni in a better jc?,btohqsg
its because to begin with  they are already slightly 'naturally' smarter?,btohqsg
they see your grades  they see your portfolio  they decide,btohqsg
the qualify of education given may help  but it doesn't mould/improve the innate 'ability' much,btohqsg
ofc one may disagree wih me,btohqsg
My thinking is.. better JCs=more studious peers+better resources=more incentive to study=better A level results,btohqsg
they don't rly care about which sch you're in,btohqsg
but to begin with  those ppl are in better jcs because they are more academically able?,btohqsg
so what makes u think that u are able to survive in a better jc that is catered to much capable ppl than u?,btohqsg
if you're only incentivised by more studious peers and better resources then I question your motivation to want to study in the first place,btohqsg
MOE quite elitist one just sayin,btohqsg
Most PSC scholars are from RI and Hwa Chong,btohqsg
i got shot down why i went to a 'not-so-good' jc,btohqsg
ACSI is mostly rich kids going overseas,btohqsg
But don’t better JCs offer more extracurricular opportunities,btohqsg
MI has that guy who went to Oxford under PSC to study some religious studies or something,btohqsg
Like Model UN and all that,btohqsg
u can be the next one,btohqsg
Yes  but it depends on what you want,btohqsg
its funny why ppl keep askin all these qns,btohqsg
No point in going to a school that offers the humanities scholarship if you’re not taking humans,btohqsg
aiya tbh if u have this thinking I'd much rather u go poly,btohqsg
but end up realise they cant rly cope well in acads,btohqsg
and all these stuff doesnt matter anymore,btohqsg
Extracurriculars is a legitimate question to ask about,btohqsg
tbh my ri friends last time ask me buy my school notes for them,btohqsg
its like asking whether XJC has a Medicine CCA club,btohqsg
but then ur results are like shit,btohqsg
then does such extra 'CCAs' matter anymore?,btohqsg
tbh i dont like h2 chem RI topical resources,btohqsg
ofc mr tener might roast me now,btohqsg
Anyway  school exam paper quality is irrelevant,btohqsg
Because in the end you’ll get every school’s paper,btohqsg
Either from your teachers or from holy grail,btohqsg
It doesnt matter in the end if u r a genius,btohqsg
the papers were leaked from a particular JC's drive,btohqsg
Or u could say the schs systems were Tampered w,btohqsg
anyways as long as u study hard  regardless of jc  u will definitely make it out there,btohqsg
i know of some YIJC dude who kept thinking doing HCI/RI papers is good,btohqsg
U dont necessarily have to do the best either,btohqsg
in the end his actual H2 Chem a lvl paper this yr he found it hard,btohqsg
