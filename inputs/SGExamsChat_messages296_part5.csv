I like the initiative  that's why I am helping out students :),btohqsg

I see thanks. I always thought no promotion allowed. Seen some ppl got kicked out so want to play safe,btohqsg

yeah cos they come here advertise their tuition services etc,btohqsg
as much as possible we wanna keep whatever is in sgexams platforms as accessible as possible to all students,btohqsg
we dont wanna put things out that are  behind a paywall because thats not education equality,btohqsg
