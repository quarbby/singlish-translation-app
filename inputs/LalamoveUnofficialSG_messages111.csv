They don't f care any1 one lah,btohqsg
This one also another one. Can‚Äôt pay proper fish tank movers,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt be too hungry to take these type of order. Will regret,btohqsg
thats y even i drive van  i also dun do van. $33+ carry till like Fxxk,btohqsg
So this type is cash or credit? This is what I was talking abt. Got both credit n cash sign üòÇ,btohqsg
Always see this type with 2 signs üòÇ,btohqsg
Of course she can eat fish !! Lobster   oyster   stingray all also can eat ‚Ä¶ all also free mah. Eat with our money üòÜ,btohqsg
I did 3 stacked order. Collection and delivery places very near..,btohqsg
U late 42 mins nia Kena suspended   I Kena from user food late for 40 mins and another 1:10mins . Why they don‚Äôt suspend them also ! üò°üò°,btohqsg
1) Deduct R/D $ like lightning while needs R/D to fill up the F Form if we want to claim waiting time against customer!2) Suka suka ban R/D.3)4)5).....List out why Riders/Drivers decided to leave LLM one fine day.,btohqsg
Well  whose tank is 120L? üòõ,btohqsg
But hor  bike lanes don‚Äôt jam leh! 815am  10am  12pm I‚Äôve tried‚Ä¶ no jam leh.Except for once I was coming back via Woodlands  ICA system needed a reboot. I was with probably 100 more riders stuck on a road lane  temporarily holding riders since that has the largest sheltered capacity.,btohqsg
Nice liddat can go anytime ‚Ä¶. Shell 95 3.28 haha .. 4 per litre is imminent,btohqsg
How did u accept 3 orders,btohqsg
Llm very niao 1. Either/or pickup/drop off late will catch liao,btohqsg
LLM got many drivers now. So they don't care if we are happy a not. To them  we can always turn off the app if we are not happy.,btohqsg
even those who have FT job also join llm .. they do after their work to cover their petrol cost.,btohqsg
Cos they believe all the marketing by llmüòÇ,btohqsg
with them.. all our job will be cut by 30% during peak hrs.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt be like that leh. Driver with FT jobs also need to supplement income. It is tough having to work 12 hours with 2 jobs 7 days a week with no off day üòÄ,btohqsg
I understand. everyone have their own needs n commitment. I'm just doing a comparison nia haha,btohqsg
Good day every one! Today weather is good so wish everyone yr order all soon soon and smooth smooth too!,btohqsg

Wait like they said it‚Äôs ah long li siao then we are like stuck with $200+ of chicken rice. Not like we can flip it on Carousell since no fresh chicken imports‚Ä¶.wahahaah,btohqsg
Now it's not I want to be cb n say  but I don't think this type of thing need to come into the gp chat n check or confirm. Becos all the warning signs are in the job order. Asking pple to transfer money 1st  western union etc. I'm sure media  police etc have also been spreading warnings.,btohqsg
then what‚Äôs this group chat for if it‚Äôs not to clarify our doubts?,btohqsg
people are just asking cos they are unsure. u don‚Äôt have to be rude to make such comment. be kind,btohqsg
Maybe admin should changed pinned message to ‚ÄúBeware Western union scam‚Äù.,btohqsg
Top of the chat always have this pinned msg,btohqsg
if you have nth to say u can‚Äôt don‚Äôt reply easy üòÉ,btohqsg
wow today always have this lol,btohqsg
If feel offended in anyway by my words then all I can say is I shall just share less lor. I'm not an old bird but those who know me prob know I will just share whatever I can. Except for spoon-fed for certain stuff. Cos I think best way to learn is to experience urself. Anyway now peak with good prices. Thanks Â§ß‰∫∫ n Rachel for speaking up for me. But don't waste time here  better go take jobsüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Just now I see got 1 rider go take 1 of the job Liaoü§£,btohqsg

I kena few times got add $2,btohqsg
Tips r added while u were bidding for the job. This type is the best happy surprise. Enjoy it when u get it,btohqsg
When I check the order again it add another $8,btohqsg
I kena before was restaurant never inform or ask then add 1 more stop $5 more but knn damn far away,btohqsg
Priority fees almost never exceed $6,btohqsg
This type gone b4 u can do anytg 1üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyway I don't do advanced job so I don't know abt that. Thanks for update. üëç,btohqsg

I do twice during covid. Already give up on this shop,btohqsg
For the people at JP Morgan ah,btohqsg
Nope it's cutlery n tablecloth for a resto there,btohqsg
Heard from a friend this type might b ah long‚Äôs new pattern to disturb the one that owe them money ! Not sure if true . Apparently they create many fake accts to order food from grab   panda and other platform to those houses that owe them money . Then all food delivery guys / gals will all arrive and outside their house waiting for money .üò¨üò¨,btohqsg
Sometimes they put the 3rd location as the initial location ,btohqsg
Despite multi charge $3 instead of 4,btohqsg
Anyone can advice if do llm what timing is good,btohqsg
Weekdays all timing is also good but depend if you can snatch the order or notThink past 10pm very hard to snatch orderAlso traffic condition laU want to do cbd or far distance is all your choice,btohqsg
Need help to finish a delivery.,btohqsg
Jln Jurong kechil to cck  6 stops.,btohqsg
For me fri-sun is good. 1000-1300 and 1700-2000hrs. For me lah. Dunno the rest,btohqsg
Anyway anyone here countered pick up more than 10mins from merchant and what do you all do aft that?,btohqsg
Peak timing got way of doing. Off peak also can make depending on how n what jobs u do.,btohqsg
Nowdays is more dependent on whether u can win the bid for the job. And whether have enough jobs. If can win bids everytime  anytime also can make money,btohqsg
For me  if job at Ion requires trolley  I don‚Äôt go. Firstly security sure ask u to to take service lift and secondly the collection very likely  takes more than 10mins so will have to pay for parking.,btohqsg
Didn't know need trolley. First time take n they didn't write in notes. Reach then realised that 1 box is ridiculous heavyüòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Walk abit then stop walk abit then stopüòÇ,btohqsg
Gentle reminder don't 4get to cash out tonight,btohqsg
After you takebthe order  they change to other far far location,btohqsg
Put go chinatown  pay cash. When order take  change Upper thomason Rd  ghost Place. Then refuse to pay the different.,btohqsg
This one hand in hand that place?,btohqsg
Llm said within 10km  basic price no change,btohqsg
I want to comment but later kena kan again so ü§êüòÇ,btohqsg
Kena one or two smelly pattern  u know next time not to take their orders,btohqsg
I got quite a few in my list  see their post I also won‚Äôt take their jobs  either last minute cancel  or add stop for few bucks without informing or those knn a lot of items but price like shit.,btohqsg
They all say can contact CS etc but waste time and end up  they not really helping at all. So save ourselves the trouble  see those ownself avoid lor,btohqsg
At least the Cs got entertain uüòÇ,btohqsg
But on a side note  we all know the Cs 80% of the time is cui. Sometimes lucky get good Cs from the other 20%. So when we get lousy ones  just try to chill  cos it's expected. As long as u nvr kena penalise  then ignore. In the long run it'll be better for u  cos u won't keep getting frustrated n high blood pressureüòäüòÇ,btohqsg
But it's ok to vent over here on the chat  helps to cool us downüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
U have another 30mins. They close service at 10pmüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I kena alot of shit when I first started doing llm last Yr. Then came to realise no pt gg thru Cs for alot of stuff  unless it's major shit. Even when resto late  unless it's late by very long  I also tell myself sua  not worth getting angry or stress. This job can get a decent income  but it's not gg to net me a super high income. So don't want give myself hbp over all the shit. Even if recipient cb or scold. I just 1 ear in n out. As long as I didn't do anytg wrong  I just f care all the other shit,btohqsg
Issit girl. She trying to hook up with uüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I tot ur lala is for lalamoveüòÇ,btohqsg
Sorry  I monk for many many yrs liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
I think restaurant is late n whether they want to compensate is depends on restaurant.  I kana pan pac Chinese restaurant late. They willing to paid. Those lousy restaurant sure no %$$  to pay,btohqsg
Then maybe the Cs is guyüòÇ,btohqsg
So I will pick n choose the delivery job just incase they late,btohqsg
Pick n choose is a must. Learn from experience,btohqsg
This is why when newbies come in n ask abt where do better  etc. There's nothing that beats personal experience,btohqsg
Even now  80% of my jobs r from reg restos. Once awhile pick those new or no restaurant type job,btohqsg
That's y I'm harsh when newbies come in ask things like where good to do  what day  time  this resto good or not  any1 do b4,btohqsg
Every1 have diff experience sometimes for the same resto  how to share,btohqsg
Nowadays people like to spoon feed,btohqsg
Delivery also must do homework de le,btohqsg
N honestly speaking  we're here to earn an income. Who would want to share where good etc? When the pie is already getting smaller. We stupid ah,btohqsg
Yup  my 1st 1.5-2 mths I do alot of homework. Recce resto  parking  routes etc,btohqsg
But I see from 1 driver n learn from him. He have a weekly draw chart with time frame.,btohqsg
What time is the delivery n free Timing to do,btohqsg
We see n learn from other to equip ourselves better,btohqsg
Previous got old bird share some stuff with me,btohqsg
But I also do few mths then we got discuss 1,btohqsg
Nowdays see some just come in say new then ask,btohqsg
I think I say enough liao. Later pple complain again. Anyway again remember to cash outüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I kena fine from 1st offence give chance until now $100+ for each fine. Until I scared. Just park cp. Pay for cpüòÇ,btohqsg
Also I do LLM job will choose only those dun need to pay Parking. Haha,btohqsg
This is of cos 1st choice. But sometimes no job cannot chooseüòÇ,btohqsg
Like orchard  area. I will not do at all,btohqsg
They catch all pavement themselves  hiding at any bushes or hotel,btohqsg
U do few hundred each mth ah? Fierce. I think my highest only 130+,btohqsg
Those who do orchard must have 2 pax ba. 1 driver n the other do collection,btohqsg
Also those who do MBS  to ION. I salute them. MbS so difficult park,btohqsg
Orchard just siam paragon taka wisma lucky plaza n sommersetüòÇ,btohqsg
But that's basically whole orchard liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Lucky plaza n paragon die die,btohqsg
I can nvr hit that high,btohqsg
N I only do wkends plus 1 wkday,btohqsg
But not everytime have space to park,btohqsg
That's y I don't like sommerset,btohqsg
Lucky plaza actually is can take,btohqsg
whoever take paragon order i salute u,btohqsg
parking go in go out $4.90,btohqsg
i take once i scared alr,btohqsg
got anyone park by roadside before anot? i see ppl do but i dun dare,btohqsg
maybe next time js open bonnet oni,btohqsg
cfm close one eye one HAHAH,btohqsg
DBL yellow line immediate pick n drop off,btohqsg
I dun know. Cos I dun do orchard area. I do only those have free parking. Haha,btohqsg
But the real problem got 2 :They have a ridiculous peak surcharge additional $2 if u park there between 11am-3pm,btohqsg
After 5pm though is $4.50  but is per entry,btohqsg
I don't take is cos scared of the traffic only. Waste super alot of time go in n out. Cfm the 10min grace not enough,btohqsg
$6 meh? That day I deliver to there don't have so expensive leh,btohqsg
Fully agree. It is just a platform for people to earn extra income. Drivers come and go. Won‚Äôt waste time contacting CS unless it is necessary and if I do  it is basically used as evidence.,btohqsg
I remember last year Christmas period  I took a lot of jobs by Collins at Bedok Food City and all their jobs were so delayed as they could not cope with the orders. I didn‚Äôt want to wait further so livechat CS but there was no response at all. The jobs on my app were still showing in progress until the next day!,btohqsg
in out instant $2.90 or $4.90 alr,btohqsg
I also kena b4 the job still there nxt morning. Just wait until nxt morning cs open again then cancel,btohqsg
I don't mind taking paragon if can stack 2 jobs from there with +$. Cos can cover cp n more. But then again  it's the time wastage cos of traffic that makes me think twiceüòÇ,btohqsg
Besides car park rate  traffic is the main issue for Takashimaya. I try to avoid especially on Saturdays.,btohqsg
Yup  peak period go in n come out can take quite some time,btohqsg
Hi  anyone do Ryde send before,btohqsg

Nowdays less jobs n more drivers. Cannot think so long. Since u say u not used to it  just do. If u don't start do  u forever not used to it,btohqsg
Do liao then nxt time u will know better,btohqsg
They won't know abt where can park where cannot park unless they know the locations well or they have tried it,btohqsg
I'm harsh but it's the fastest way to learn.,btohqsg
Even for me there's alot of other places or strategies I dunno,btohqsg
U want to learn fast or everytime meet a problem come in here n wait for some1 free to tell u,btohqsg
By that time job gone and opportunity also gone,btohqsg
Understood. If can want to settle down asap...,btohqsg
If u want u can spend 1 2 days look at the apps. Alot of places will keep popping up. Note them down. Then check the addresses. Then check where to park if any. N price of parking,btohqsg
So that when u more familiar  when u see the job again u dare to take,btohqsg
Then if u not familiar with the place  spend some time go recce the areas. The routes in n out,btohqsg
Very fast u can n dare to start doing liao,btohqsg
I dunno abt others. That's what I did when I first started. I can go half an hour early to pickup to familiarise,btohqsg
Fr me i prefer send to housing estate... easier. If send this town cbd area i lost w to park...,btohqsg
Drop off u cannot choose where. U can only choose pickup,btohqsg
Llm deliver whole island. If u only want hdb  n u also want choose pickup pt  then u get ready to starve,btohqsg
U can only choose area u want drop. Not the type of housing,btohqsg
Yap... i everyday also hve to top up $10 cash card.. all vendor wait need to pay gantry...,btohqsg
Once u familiar  u don't need top up so often,btohqsg
Oh u don't mean only hdb. U just mean avoid drop at cbd. Ah this u can chooseüòÇ,btohqsg
Normally i will see e nearest fr me to pick up... send far i dont mind as long e fare ok plus if possible stack order e best,btohqsg
Cos most jobs is send to housing,btohqsg
Yes2... cbd town area parking chialat,btohqsg

Discount + pts is very useful,btohqsg
Do u have PDVL? If u have  just go there to get. The uncle will readily give to u,btohqsg
If let's say I have the pdvl but I don't do. Can still get?,btohqsg
Will need to register a car number etc to get? Or register an acct with tada,btohqsg

No problem. Even u have no intention to drive now  will be good to have PDVL.,btohqsg
I got my shell card too by showing my PDVL,btohqsg
Applied but never send to us,btohqsg
Yes it's 20% but cannot get smiles pts,btohqsg
The smiles pts goes to llm acct,btohqsg
That is why I said  if got PDVL go down to Tada to get the shell and smile card.,btohqsg
üòÇno lah  they swipe a smiles card whenever we pump there,btohqsg
Can see the acct always alot of pts inside,btohqsg

Y keep asking where all things n info can get from website n apps.,btohqsg
Hands got time to scroll n read new n watch show on phone. No time to scroll thru the apps. Haha,btohqsg
Lalamove was suppose to compensate me for a job cancellation of 50% as there was nothing to collect when I arrived. CS claimed that this customer is one of their sales person‚Äôs corporate client so can only pay me $6 instead of $12. The job was listed for $24. I demanded for a new job order for the cancellation job but CS was firm that the LLM corporate sales person will credit $6 to my wallet on Monday as it was a weekend. More than a month has passed and nothing received. When LLM said they will pay later  don‚Äôt expect to receive it. This is their tactic.,btohqsg
The same goes for the waiting fee. If eligible  CS will compensate at the time when the request was made. Some merchants won‚Äôt pay for the waiting fee.,btohqsg
Yes so these days  I cannot be bothered to livechat. Waste of time.,btohqsg
Petrol 95 fuel up to 3.30,btohqsg
Crude oil prices could scorch this summer‚ÄúThe forecast here has always been US$150 a barrel this year  risk US$180  and a move as high as the obscene  that is US$250 is not out of the question for 2023  ‚Äú remarked ACY Securities' chief economist.https://bt.sg/U3e6,btohqsg
Wah caltex so fierce. This time they up 1st,btohqsg
management of LLM should wake up their ideas and look at the rising fuel cost... their job fare totally doesn't fit the rising fuel price. lol,btohqsg
Llm now is have time then do. If not find a full time job better,btohqsg
ya. I switching to phv liao. lol. easier. no need worry about summon  waiting for restaurant to pass u food n etc. mostly importantly  peak hr period.. the pricing is higher than llm. lol,btohqsg
just now fetch one passenger from guocco tower to west coast .. $30.85 nett. haha,btohqsg
llm will only react if enough drivers/riders quit or switch out.,btohqsg
hope more drivers comes to sense... petrol price is hiking almost weekly.... don't be the slave who serve a master that doesn't pay u well.. my advise is those lower pricing Job don't take.,btohqsg
fuel price got to rise a lot more first. from the speed jobs are being snatched  doesnt look like a shortage of drivers yet.,btohqsg
that's y lo. alot of people desperate also. maybe the jobs rate not much. once got job everyone snatch,btohqsg
Phv use own car not worth,btohqsg
Use own car can earn more den u pay the rental to help the ppl rent u car to be rich,btohqsg

Wow!Speaking of which my LLM-Shell application like kinda stonewalled‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt remember when I applied for it but definitely not receiving anything so far ü§£,btohqsg
Hihi..just wondering...you guys get your cash out already,btohqsg

How many jobs u do everyday ?,btohqsg
The main advantage is urs is hybrid  so got more mileage with ur petrol. I can get $500 for my $100 petrol if every day is like mothers dayüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Or like last wkend. Last wkend I got $600,btohqsg
Actually if hybrid  during off peak n little good price order period  can take multi stops,btohqsg
No wonder you r driving hybrid,btohqsg
That time I buy car  didn't think of petrol up so much n also nvr thought wld b doing llmüòÇ,btohqsg

Also just out of curiosity  do u feel that the system is able to auto filter yr job availability n only show u what u usually take. I noticed I m no longer getting Woodlands to Woodlands job n I have more motorcycle pick up then car..,btohqsg
End of the day is how much goes to your pocket. Tier is just another tool to blow up your ego to make you a slave.üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I want to drive llm and make maybe 1k a month. What kind of hours muz I put in? I am using a car. Thanks.,btohqsg
dun know how many weeks  never see mission liao,btohqsg
Ok thanks all. I am not afraid of hard work. But afraid of hard work and no earnings. So just asking to get a feel from all shifus first.,btohqsg
Most likely start next month cos now not in good health. Want to start asap to earn medical fees and support children.,btohqsg
Is not that we dun want to say. Everyday have different order.Everyday u are at different locationSo many different how can we advice u,btohqsg
No worries. Understand. Will just try next month to find out for myself.,btohqsg
I will start slow and scale up. No choice for the children have to do something.,btohqsg
Yes am considering that as well but I am not sure whether I qualify cos I am bankrupt.,btohqsg
I see. Then I will try for that too. Thanks for your kind advice.,btohqsg
Llm is getting tougher nowdays. Lesser jobs n harder to get jobs. Also like what Â§ß‰∫∫ said u might have to carry heavy stuff etc. U have to be mentally prepared,btohqsg
If ur not in good shape health wise I suggest u get better first,btohqsg
There will b jobs which don't say but need üòÇ,btohqsg
But if ur only aiming for 1k a month  u can take it slow,btohqsg
My condition is long term so I can't wait cos my children are young.,btohqsg
Yes. I aim 1k a month first and then scale up as health improves.,btohqsg
Eh not everytime. Â§ß‰∫∫ can get 100+ wkday alsoüòä,btohqsg
Every cent counts for me now honestly. So be it 500 or 1000 it's all impt to me as a start. Better than now sick and no income.,btohqsg
Ya doctor certify can't work. Heart issues.,btohqsg
Llm is physical work. U consider seriously,btohqsg
Ya. That's y need to rest these 2 months before starting work.,btohqsg
Don't know how serious is ur heart issue  but if doc says can't work u better don't start until uve been given green light.,btohqsg
Cos I need the flexibility to take care of kids and elderly parents. And being a bankrupt almost eliminates me from corporate job.,btohqsg
That's all I can advise bah. Cos only u will know ur limits,btohqsg
Thanks all. Will try and see if health can take it. Will start slow. ËÉΩË≥∫‰∏ÄÁÇπÊòØ‰∏ÄÁÇπ,btohqsg
Other than the physical exertions  there's also mental stress associated with this job,btohqsg
Yeap I read earlier posts and really is not easy. But I have few alternative left,btohqsg
Oh  then maybe I also cannot,btohqsg
That's y I try to be zen n relaxedüòÇ,btohqsg
can ah? I tot hospital will give treatment when they see money,btohqsg
Well I guess I have to try all then I know which one I qualify etc,btohqsg
Whatever it is  remember health is still 1st priority,btohqsg
I at coffeeshop more often than on the rd,btohqsg
if cant pay after wiped finish all medisave? sell house?,btohqsg
In my case I got shield plan. That is v impt.,btohqsg
And I was referred to Heart centre by polyclinic,btohqsg
then Wats the point of insurance. if everyone otang,btohqsg
Cos I need to keep petrol cost low. Not I atasüòÇ,btohqsg
Only a few dollars after subsidies and medisave,btohqsg
This is very impt. Referrals help cut costs alot,btohqsg
Just that sometimes it takes a longer time to get the appt,btohqsg
Just walk in. Don't make appt,btohqsg
No worries. These I have enough. Now main issue is income for future. Thanks alot anyways,btohqsg
For any of u who don't have shield plan. Please ensure u and ur family has one,btohqsg
And now government hospitals really v good,btohqsg
No need to go private ones honestly.,btohqsg
As in get the referral appt for the hospital from poly,btohqsg
Yes this one may have to wait. But they will assess if ur condition is urgent. If urgent its quite fast,btohqsg
Now covid is better so waiting time also shortened.,btohqsg
Yes I also thinking of that. Also have breaks in between which I need.,btohqsg
U can try fathers day wkendüòÇ,btohqsg
But after that u will see a big difference of prices for the jobsüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I guess best way to find out is to get my hands dirty,btohqsg
Actually I also like the fact that llm is more physical cos I want to slowly build up my health thru exercise,btohqsg
Another reason I stuck to sitting in coffeeshopüòÇ,btohqsg
If admin job just sit there,btohqsg
My condition won't improve in long run,btohqsg
Llm also have to sit sometimes for period of timeüòÇ,btohqsg
Ya for me most impt is flexibility. Cos of family and also if I don't feel well I can stop for a while,btohqsg
If I get a full time job which is unlikely due to my circumstances. And I mc or medical appt. Sooner or later also ganna ÁÇíÈ±øÈ±º,btohqsg
He has to take it 1 job at a time. No stacking,btohqsg
Ya I just have to take it 1 at a time. Rest in between if needed and just take whatever earnings my body can take.,btohqsg
For me now is I can work 1 to 2 hours. Then maybe have some side effect. Then need to rest for a while. Then I can do 1 to 2 hours again.,btohqsg
That's y free lance job is the only choice,btohqsg
If tell a boss I work 1 to 2 hours. Then need to break 1 hour etc. I don't think the boss will accept.,btohqsg
I shld be able to manage this. Just take breaks in between.,btohqsg
Haha if I do like that end up i will get lalamove by ambulance to hospital. Lol.,btohqsg
Pls don't do it like that nxt time. Cos when u have to rush n during peak hr with bad traffic  there's ways risk of accident,btohqsg
Unless it's really majority same resto/mall n drop offs very very close proximity,btohqsg
But that time covid time. Traffic very very smooth so can do like that,btohqsg
Ko liao. Good night guys n rest well,btohqsg
Take note Ah. Heavy stuff  if you encounter - please watch your back; do NOT bend over to lift. You might be in your late 40s or 50s  we are no spring chicken anymore to recover fast.Once injured  this possibility of LLM income will be greatly affected.,btohqsg
