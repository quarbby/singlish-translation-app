Thanks to the placement news at $0.060. Sold my Trendline shares first. Seems every volume spike best to out first since BBs like to flush us retailers to die.Hope some of you guys joined in Trendlines $0.060 .Congrats to those who did 🫡Now I get why they needed to flush til below the $0.060 rights price. It’s to make the placement deal at a more favourable price for the insiders.But thankfully anyways  no complains,btohqsg
Mentioned here again when felt Trendlines too cheap. $0.055 to $0.052 then.Would have been a decent 20 pips win in contra period uh,btohqsg
