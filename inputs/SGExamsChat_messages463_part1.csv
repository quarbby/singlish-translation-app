maybe for those with sports cca? idk,btohqsg
Well. We js went thru this programme called Fitness for Life where u select one sport of ur choice but that isnâ€™t NAPFA,btohqsg
nyone know if i apply1: course A2: course Bcan B and A offer u a spot  then u reject A to choose B,btohqsg
If im not wrong only one course can offer you a spot,btohqsg
what if u reject that spot?,btohqsg
Meaning eg if course B offers you a spot  means course A rejected you already,btohqsg
But why do u wanna choose Ur second choice over ur first,btohqsg
like maybe 1st and 2nd is medicine n cs,btohqsg
What i did is i applied course A in nus  course B in NTU  course C in SMU,btohqsg
My second choice was CS which i applied for in nus,btohqsg
My top choice was my current course in ntu,btohqsg
U wan course inside for cs I can tell u,btohqsg
I applied biz n info sys in smu also as a middle option,btohqsg
Thank GOD i didnt go cs,btohqsg

I can ask my friend's brother who is nus med,btohqsg
but how am i gonna do exams without sleep,btohqsg
In uni u feel the line btwn life n work slowly blur and meld tgt,btohqsg
In jc i thought 12 is late,btohqsg
But to quote Taylor swifts hit song anti-hero,btohqsg
i always sleep at 12 max,btohqsg
12 is when the brain juice flows,btohqsg
yeaa the overactive mind works the hardest in the darkest of nights,btohqsg
Apart frm med n cs any other choice,btohqsg
Because its serene and nothing much to distract you too,btohqsg
...unless you are your own distraction,btohqsg
I can tell u how much sleep u wont get for other courses too :3,btohqsg
Have you went out at like 3-4 am,btohqsg

The great thing about uni is you can customise your time table,btohqsg

Alot of uni stress is self induced,btohqsg
Everyone wants to one up everyone else,btohqsg
