Maybe our local dealer can show them who the boss,btohqsg
Will singapore one day do away with dealers,btohqsg
It takes one brand to do it first. Others will follow. Singapore style.,btohqsg
Now that Tesla has done it well. Hyundai to follow next?,btohqsg
Actually not easy to do away with dealer,btohqsg
U need to set up office like what tesla did in sg,btohqsg
But since Hyundai already got a factory seems to be easy for them,btohqsg
Traction control off. Fastest shift times in M mode.,btohqsg
Where is the 7th bar sir?,btohqsg
Then turn on traction control but M changes to MDM mode. It’s really complex. I think mdm  mode means computer control,btohqsg
I made a mistake. It’s at 6 bars. Default 5 bars.,btohqsg
Here’s where you manually turn it on to 6 bars max,btohqsg
That M mode is very enjoyable. Everything sharpens up. Throttle control much more responsive. Steeling taut feel suspension firmer dct shifts faster. Fuel use is also faster! 😢,btohqsg
Like traction control on but still allows you to have a bit of fun without killing you?,btohqsg
But the acceleration is simply superb. Ultimate,btohqsg
It bears the m3 badge for good reason 👍🏼 👍🏼,btohqsg

M3. Truly intoxicating   to drive. I’m looking for longer route to do. 7 6 5 and then 6 7. Playing with gears and revv is already so satisfying and to hear to glorious sound.,btohqsg
Good car. Euro styling. And manual,btohqsg
It’s quite common in America. I Thu k they called it Acura,btohqsg
V8 … ❤️ and that downshift of yours,btohqsg
You should just 6 then jump down to 4,btohqsg
7th maybe only if you’re at 120-140 bah otherwise a bit down the power band,btohqsg
Haiyah but what do I know,btohqsg
I only talk from playing Forza,btohqsg
And imagine from other people’s lives,btohqsg
Yeah I did that occasional. Quick down shift twice,btohqsg
Fast shift twice and you’re down two times. Gearing is short.,btohqsg
Torque is not high. Only 400 nm,btohqsg
But at high revv that’s where the satisfaction comes from 5000 to 8300,btohqsg
I think it’s better than Mazda,btohqsg
A bit lah hor. Makes the fuel consumed worth it. More smiles for the miles,btohqsg
Yeah  maybe someday we get a chance to sit in one,btohqsg
Mr. guliani you like Italian cars?,btohqsg
I like all cars that have some sort of character!,btohqsg
Italian cars. Full of characters. Alfa zagatto Lancia Bugatti etc,btohqsg
He’s Italian who later went to France.,btohqsg
wasn't he french but born in Italy,btohqsg
He’s a very intelligent engineer. Talented young man who showed his skills in France.,btohqsg
Yes. He later converted to French because of time spent there,btohqsg
I admire Italians for originality. Ideas are never plagiarized. Style is original. Each brand has its own style and beauty.,btohqsg
He converted much later after world war.,btohqsg
the brand itself was founded in Molsheim which was part of Germany and then France though,btohqsg
Today the same leaders like Elon musk are also engineers.,btohqsg
My personal favorites would be the gated manual 360 modena  458 and murcielago sv,btohqsg
of course there's also the mc12 and f40 in there as well,btohqsg
how about dark history of volkswagen,btohqsg
Maserati is absolutely gorgeous. I remember seeing the boomerang rear light GT3200 in Germany. It’s so unique and from far it’s instantly recognizable Maserati. Beautiful.,btohqsg
Then there is the modest Alfa 156 with rear hidden door handle that looks like a 2 door coupe. And so many other makers copy the design today. Ideas and beauty to original comes from Italy.,btohqsg
But in sg the dash board will melt,btohqsg
