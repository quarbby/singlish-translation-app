Is it harder than say physics?,btohqsg
bro what ppl in my sch wants H3 history,btohqsg
sometimes i even question if i want to do further my education at all,btohqsg
And this is why u do h2 geog instead,btohqsg
I took pure history I got A2,btohqsg
My H2 history internal exam D,btohqsg
I mean only reason is job and salary,btohqsg
basically forced to do this at this point,btohqsg
U need do study all sources question,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall pulling the Bellcurve up for my lit paper,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a constant B4 student and I‚Äôm aiming a A2 I don‚Äôt think I can anym,btohqsg
Amath and Emath in sec sch is like kindergarten math H3 math is like pri sch math with all the models n shit,btohqsg
Ngl I still can't do pri sch math lol,btohqsg
I kinda have dilema of going jc or poly tbh,btohqsg
cus poly is consistently must effort to do projects,btohqsg
*chuckles I'm in danger* welp I tot my ans was 1/3 u^3 but I tot wrong once I saw 11m for 1 step workingH3 math indeed.,btohqsg
but poly is consistently put work into subjects,btohqsg
There's like a 30min video about how to do this on youtube so don't feel bad about it,btohqsg
Can join my sharing session pm me.Tbh think of your dream job and uni course first,btohqsg
but im aiming towards a proffesion with science involved,btohqsg
im not sure of the actual field tho,btohqsg
i‚Äôd like to hear too haha,btohqsg
Take the next few mth to think about it.,btohqsg
Sure. U write a love story to the marker.,btohqsg
but i do have an interest for tech and engineering,btohqsg
What makes U wanna go biomed,btohqsg
I just like biology and how the human body works,btohqsg
Anybody know the difference between igcse physics and our O level physics,btohqsg
im aiming to be a pharmacist or a doctor,btohqsg
I mean i cannot do promotion la so just doing my annual sharing on 28 nov just pm me so i can send u the links nearer to the date,btohqsg
Biomedical sciences doesn't help for human body btw,btohqsg
Also wtf 1k msgs in 1hr,btohqsg
Im planning to go a field related to bio* i meant*,btohqsg
so im not really sure in the actual course,btohqsg
Pythagorean triples need use number theory and consider cases congruent mod 5‚Ä¶I think,btohqsg
but the drug side definitely interest me,btohqsg
Ok do u wan drug sides or make meds or find cure or ?,btohqsg
cus of stuff like adderall  etc,btohqsg
There is only one poly left that offers that HAHA,btohqsg
I rlly need D7 or C6,btohqsg
Same bro I‚Äôm not even asking much,btohqsg
And they have 0 project n etc,btohqsg
Can teach me how to get F9?@crying_over_social_studies,btohqsg
No man I sue Cambridge for like,btohqsg
I can tell u all abt rp  biotech,btohqsg
I skipped my eae interview üòÉ‚ÅâÔ∏è,btohqsg
I went for open house a few years ago,btohqsg
Tbh the e math p2 is not that bad.,btohqsg
Is biotech worth it? Or is it like biomed,btohqsg
I wanted go sp biomedical science tho,btohqsg
They send email give time limit for 3 days and I Don‚Äôt check email,btohqsg
if ur math is trash naturally u will end up w straight f9 even if u studied :),btohqsg
It‚Äôs really hard to get in,btohqsg
Ah i mean biomed isnt worth it for the most part,btohqsg
Is getting B3 for E math considered trash?,btohqsg
I can tell u more ltr,btohqsg
i remember its something gotta do with more hands on,btohqsg
ive been failing math since pri sch,btohqsg
Seab be fucking u ur entire life,btohqsg
Same bro pls I had a whole breakdown on how I can‚Äôt even go poly if I don‚Äôt have math,btohqsg
Tbf if u really aiming for F9  might as well dont do,btohqsg
wait can i ask why you didn‚Äôt take the poly route,btohqsg
Well at least if u grt f9  they wont show on cert,btohqsg
Hesitating weather to go JC tbh since I always slacked in Secondary school but i had the capacity to do well  Im scared about if i go jc then i continue my ways,btohqsg
like i know i was mainly able to understand content but i was lazy to put in effort to work,btohqsg
i doubt you‚Äôll have any time with people around you,btohqsg
They don't show it on certificate,btohqsg
But they show it on result slip,btohqsg
lol I don‚Äôt even want to go collect my results-,btohqsg
what do you mean by  that tho? like little time to go out?,btohqsg
Unless u some genius  i think u will suffer if u dont put in consistent effort. What jc u aiming for for curiousitu sake,btohqsg
Im aiming for a subv 10 pointer jc,btohqsg
Okay I‚Äôll manifest for a C6,btohqsg
but im pretty sure i wont make it,btohqsg
no like with people around you focusing i doubt you‚Äôll wanna slack,btohqsg
Im from a neighborhood school with like 200 express cutoff point,btohqsg
I took O level A math and E math while in ITE,btohqsg
I thot my l1r5 was gonna be more than 10 as well  but moderation saved me,btohqsg
and i get like 20 l1r5,btohqsg
I dont think im that worthy to get into such jc tbh,btohqsg
unless i retake Os and go crazy mug,btohqsg
my l1r5 for prelims was 20,btohqsg
I rmb we went thru this disxussion b4.,btohqsg
Okay jst hoping they lower math passing gradeü•≤,btohqsg
mid years was 29 lol dont even ask,btohqsg
Sis mine can buy 6  value meals from macs,btohqsg
Can. I know of a friend who basically screwed up his jae  went to poly  retook 2 subjects  got a better net score and went to acjc the following year,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt study at all bruh,btohqsg
I mean Os typically got better score,btohqsg
I was gaming all the way,btohqsg
DUDE MY POA 3/100 OVERALL AHHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
good qn cuz I scored btr then expected and have to follow fam tradition :'D. If I am given a choice  I will have gone to poly,btohqsg
hmm i really dk thi coz a math paper 1 was good for o‚Äôs paper 2 i scored like 38/90 LOL,btohqsg
Eh need pass el for o,btohqsg
can retake my bro d7 eng he retake it whn he go poly,btohqsg
Amaths the moderation q generous i think,btohqsg
i left like half the paper blank,btohqsg
but i doubt my english would fail in os,btohqsg
Might at least C6 i think,btohqsg
yeah my senior screwed up her paper 2 got B4,btohqsg
You all might hate me but,btohqsg
My friend last yr did not do half the paper as well. She wrote sorry on the qns instead. She got B,btohqsg
I actually find A math Paper 2 quite ok,btohqsg
I wrote on  my amath please give marks my future depends on it,btohqsg
HAHAHAH I WROTE WTF SPELLED OUT THEN SCRIBBLED OVER IT FOR THE LAST QN,btohqsg
I cried on my emath paper üòÉü§å,btohqsg
The markers will just look and laugh with fellow markers that's all. :P,btohqsg
Must be acsi. All the other schs lousy/s,btohqsg
The same i did when i see my students wrote on their sch exam scripts,btohqsg
hahaa....they dun get extra $$ for sympathy,btohqsg
They might get pay cut for marking not following marking scheme,btohqsg
I staple my credit card extra$$$,btohqsg
Must be acceoted in UK thou,btohqsg
Then your exam script will be stolen before it reaches the markers,btohqsg
but wont they use prelims result or smth,btohqsg
I try go UK and steal,btohqsg
Nah my Cher say can retake,btohqsg
But they can choose to retake,btohqsg
bro i praying to the bell curve gods let it be a b4 or b3,btohqsg
They will still give you the grade,btohqsg
yeah the range btw a2 and b3 is super big,btohqsg
yes girl let‚Äôs pray it‚Äôs like that,btohqsg
Tbh I wish i put in more effort in sec sch,btohqsg
give chance to the weaker students alsoü•≤,btohqsg
I was always slacking and getting away with Bs and Cs,btohqsg
People do way better in Os than prelims,btohqsg
I never mugged hard af for sec sch before,btohqsg
no point regretting if u go jc make sure u dont do the same thing again,btohqsg
The jc above 15 is jpjc or yijc,btohqsg
yeah thats kidn of the reason why i wanna go,btohqsg
nahhh secondary sch won‚Äôt mean anything to u after u go jc,btohqsg
i wanna redeem myself in jc,btohqsg
a shot at secondary sch 2.0,btohqsg
Kinda understood most of it but alot of it doesn't make sense to me like the simplifying and substituting of everything,btohqsg
But u can kind of see how it works,btohqsg
but idt can make it tho,btohqsg
like I was slacking in os,btohqsg
After O level ends  take a break and you guys can pm me if you want to headstart. I can share some tips on where to start for self  preparation,btohqsg
honestly i‚Äôm just scared ab the next 2 months to results,btohqsg
The tanh formula and the 1/x^2-y^2 formula is taught in H2?,btohqsg
I feel there are more fundamental things to cover than vectors,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fun if u see the fun,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even think I can enjoy during the hols I‚Äôm gonna be thinking about my results,btohqsg
Honestly i don't remember what's in the video,btohqsg
same i have no plans at all,btohqsg
After vectors  do permuation and combinations,btohqsg
I bought h2 chem notes for o level chem data base,btohqsg
tanh is not but it's not that much of a stretch,btohqsg
actually used it in o level,btohqsg
other than that it‚Äôs just moping around at home,btohqsg
headstart need not mean study A level topics in advance,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I made back up plans if I fk up Os,btohqsg
but rather upgrade your add math skills to the requirement of H2 math if you are taking,btohqsg
Honestly just read up on current affairs first. U are most prob gonna fail gp,btohqsg
because even with A1 in add math is just like a basic requirement to survive H2,btohqsg
Go overseas study and then come back for uni,btohqsg
they take 4H2 which is possible toomy friend from hwachong took triple science and maths and econs,btohqsg
So the 3D parts need to be calculated too?,btohqsg
HOW DO YOU KNOW IM GONNA FAIL GP,btohqsg
Or should i say 100% 3D,btohqsg
Last time can now cannot no?,btohqsg
Between H2 math and sec sch math,btohqsg
no  it‚Äôs like the sky is blue   everyone is bad at it,btohqsg
H2 math they are going super deep,btohqsg
yes but you end up taking 5 subjects in total,btohqsg
If ur good at H2 math  then H3 math is a breeze or nah?,btohqsg
But why wld u do that to urself,btohqsg
I know 2 H3 and 4H2,btohqsg
to give themselves more options in uni,btohqsg
H3 math they will go through deep like,btohqsg
if time table allows in sch,btohqsg
legend has it that my sch valedictorian finished a level syllabus in J1,btohqsg
Wot sch? Must be from legendary acsi (non lousy sch),btohqsg
that's nothing; some students in my sch finished a level syllabus in sec 3 and 4,btohqsg
Lowkey nervous to go there too cause most of the ppl in my sch goes there,btohqsg
Well improving the birth rate is noble too jk,btohqsg
just do the best yourself at your pace,btohqsg
they finish in 1 year 3 mth so be it,btohqsg
even if u finish in 3 years...as long as u do well that's all matters,btohqsg
Uh I‚Äôm only hearing it again now,btohqsg
The last time I heard it was 2018,btohqsg
I mean the rumour was cuz the staircase is damn ulu,btohqsg
More likely nowadays u go staircase u get covid,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs right next to the utility office sooo,btohqsg
Eh even my sch says most students from my sec sch go thereüò≠,btohqsg
Thats the countermeasure to dissuade the pregnancies,btohqsg
But i heard cj arts q good,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionask this dude anyth abt acjc (‚Äî-@footlockerpteltd,btohqsg
i feel like if u can go through jc,btohqsg
actl tho   it‚Äôs so near my place I shdve gone tm,btohqsg
JC is tough but not that tough,btohqsg
uh u got anyth qn for mi@wolkfie,btohqsg
I heard some scary shit in ns,btohqsg
Don't treat it like some monster,btohqsg
iirc cj lit is apparently better than most jcs,btohqsg
yeah but i can‚Äôt think of any rn HAHH,btohqsg
I tot girl can also go ns,btohqsg
That one counted in portfolio anot lol,btohqsg
idt I have to finis this sentence,btohqsg
Come to ny. Physics lecture got people come up sing :),btohqsg
Wow i wish my sch got,btohqsg
i‚Äôm concerned about the people in jc to,btohqsg
We asked the principal for 3 ply toilet paper but he rej,btohqsg
as in idk my ch culture was oretty bad,btohqsg
Jc culture in general is bad,btohqsg
Every jc has toxic ppl   every jc has good people . The kind of good and bad people differs in every jc,btohqsg
retain or not doesnt matter uk,btohqsg
My classmate in jc too but he fits q well in the sch,btohqsg
u see all kind of ppl,btohqsg
so like my current batch was so much more opening,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt have to be friends w thm,btohqsg
Can I ask what do snakes do,btohqsg
u lucky he not ur classmate sia,btohqsg
I mean most scholars are 19 in j1,btohqsg
So can tell urself u r on par with a scholar,btohqsg
Pretty sure almost all schs got scholars,btohqsg
OMG I saw this reddit post ab some guy who asked his friend for the topics and then friend purposely didn‚Äôt mention the important topics to study,btohqsg
but quality of scholars also differ,btohqsg
I mean if they do badly  they get deported lol,btohqsg
moral of the story rely on yourself or ur teachers lol,btohqsg
I think we talking abt the asean scholar or china scholar no?,btohqsg
agreed but the dude was probably threatened by OP,btohqsg
The earlier u start ur engine the earlier u burn out,btohqsg
Maybe can study organic chem if you‚Äôre choosing science stream,btohqsg
Study current affairs for gp  permutations  combinations vectors for maths  gfield and superpostition for physics,btohqsg
If u take computing study linked list and oop,btohqsg
unlearn some o level chem because u gon be bamboozled in electronic config,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt bluff‚Ä¶ you did that before jc right,btohqsg
You hardly reply to Chem q nowadays,btohqsg
No ah i think u shd just read up on current affairs,btohqsg
Ur prob not gonna study gp during jc haha,btohqsg
I mean like ur ur prob gonna wack it,btohqsg
Lol my sch marked gp damn leniently for promos,btohqsg
We got back and my class laughing we all thot we gonna fail,btohqsg
My essay qns was abt how relevant were borders today compared to the past,btohqsg
I cant rmb but relevsnce of borders,btohqsg
Different scholar the entry requirement may differ,btohqsg
I heard sajc food is dog shit as well,btohqsg
Hi all  does NTU have any module exemptions for poly students?,btohqsg
u dun go jc for food,btohqsg
Oh then i went wrong sch,btohqsg
Which jc has the best food,btohqsg
depends on what scholarship the student is taking.,btohqsg
Only poly near me is nyp. Their food not great,btohqsg
NYP last time still got mac,btohqsg
dunno has it come back after closed down,btohqsg
NYP got a few canteens maybe need to explore,btohqsg
Tone down already. Probably due to change in management. But the old AJC math dept is strong. After merger....,btohqsg
Lol my classmate thot got 97 but when he heard someone got 98  he started hitting the table hard,btohqsg
Tbh i legit think he need,btohqsg
cos next time in life how,btohqsg
Tia gong rather u study hard now,btohqsg
Like when someone higher than him  he start cursing and hitting wall,btohqsg
hi guys! what is your opinion on dropping Higher Mother Tongue at Sec 3 year end?,btohqsg
ASR value add more than SAJC,btohqsg
u can always approach the teacher,btohqsg
i judge quality of departments based on difficulty of papers,btohqsg
not based on performance of students,btohqsg
drop lor if it helps other subjects,btohqsg
sometimes i passby i see students wait at gate,btohqsg
either wait for parents  delivery or lovers,btohqsg
drop off at main gate i guess,btohqsg
i can also say im XJC reject cos my COP didnt meet XJC,btohqsg
is anyone gonna come poly üëÄ come NP :),btohqsg
SAJC alot of rejects from ACJC and TJC,btohqsg
haish why everyone jc one so sed :<,btohqsg
then maybe ACJC alot of rejects from NJC VJC etc,btohqsg
but the poly course I want required subjects is English  E Math/A Math  Chinese/Higher Chinese and best 2 other subjects,btohqsg
Cant believe affiliation us still a thing thou,btohqsg
Yea but its a rather unfair system,btohqsg
it wld be better w Higher Chinese in it too right? [I'm gonna apply for EAE nxt yr],btohqsg
go see pm I send u,btohqsg
Like just becus u live in a higher ses area  u have a higher chance of going to elite schs becus of ur pri sch,btohqsg
where to find lit past year a level papers,btohqsg
Acs barker unaffiliated 240+ affiliated 190,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why the percentage of ACS Barker students that enter ACJC,btohqsg
Is much much lower than you would expect,btohqsg
Just becus u were brought up near an elite sch  u have a greater chance of going to an elite sch,btohqsg
From a school that‚Äôs literally branded as ACS,btohqsg
like what r the odds of that?,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure only teachers have that stuff,btohqsg
Literature is not a subject you can really study without a teacher,btohqsg
Unless if you really really love the texts,btohqsg
Yea i wld assume so. The people in these schs are more likely higher ses  so more resources to devote to tuition  etc,btohqsg
Nah im in jc just tryna spot qns HAHAH,btohqsg
like 1 in 10 students wld be liddat,btohqsg
Btw now that the psle score change  how is affiliation affected?,btohqsg
They should stick the to old grading system imo,btohqsg
That's the issue that they're trying to solve,btohqsg
In the old system literally every single mark matters,btohqsg
Which doesn't make sense because 2 people of equal skill can be wrongly differentiated by luck,btohqsg
yes I lost my dream sch by 1mark,btohqsg
I feel every exam also liddat leh no matter the system,btohqsg
A more accurate way to differentiate people is by banding them,btohqsg
With a banding system  a 70 and a 74 are the same,btohqsg
Do u all agree with nationality playing a part in the jae/psle?,btohqsg
Or do u think its discriminatory,btohqsg
hey yall how was the f&n paper,btohqsg
Here's what MOE has to say about that,btohqsg
Which I think is fair enough,btohqsg
guys do you think running 50km is alot for a week,btohqsg
Like i mean the Singaporean first  pr second  foreigners third,btohqsg
Ig it wld make it harder to differentiate,btohqsg
I found it quite difficult tbh,btohqsg
not as bad as u wld think,btohqsg
is h2 a lot of content??,btohqsg

You can always look it up,btohqsg
You are also allowed to highlight words,btohqsg
So if I bring a very good note resource in? I will kinda do btr?,btohqsg
Not that this makes the subject easy  rather it just pushes all the effort onto analysing the text instead of remembering stuff,btohqsg
You can only bring the exam text in,btohqsg
The book ur studying I mean,btohqsg
Oh so not any book from outside or like my own let of compiled notes?,btohqsg
