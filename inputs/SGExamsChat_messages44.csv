A warranty is basically an agreement from the party that sells the laptop that they would repair your laptop within a specific period of time,btohqsg
Usually you dont have to confirm it(?),btohqsg
you just have to find a way to show that your laptop is under this warranty when you want to bring it for repair,btohqsg
But im not sure what you‚Äôre exactly referring to in this case,btohqsg
