"Hi all i understand from the faq in cpf website that if the total mandatory CPF contributions (from employment) exceed the CPF Annual Limit in the calendar year  any excess voluntary top-ups to MA will be refunded without interest in the following year."" Below is the link to the FAQ in cpf website.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/top-up-your-cpf-accounts-to-build-your-savings/what-is-the-voluntary-top-up-limit-to-my-three-cpf-accountsSo am i right to say that if your annual income with bonus add up to $102k or more  u r not eligible for top up to medisave since the amount will be refunded with interest and the amount the top up will not be eligible for tax relief?",btohqsg
Hi all! If I am shopping at Fairprice physical store itself but pay through the Fairprice app  is it considered as online thus can use Citi rewards for 4mpd?,btohqsg
yeah miles is a selling point to consider  but for me i am personally using cashback only cards for now as my expenditure is low at 600$ per month just nice for UOB evol 40$ cashbackSo any overseas spend is usually using trust card   as i don't really spend alot overseas as well   like going malaysia etc,btohqsg
I think someone just asked this earlier maybe try scrolling up a little to find the answer,btohqsg
Overseas for cashback. I useamaze + Citi cashback for8% groceries6% diningAmaze + Maybank fnf for8% groceries8% 58128% pharmacy (beware mcc),btohqsg
Hi  if using Trust card for overseas withdrawal. Do I have to change it to debit card on app or can just do withdrawal under credit card account?,btohqsg

Hi everyone! Am intending to sign up for HSBC Revolution card and have a few big purchases in IKEA below $1k for the month  and am wondering if IKEA is part of the bonus points list? Tried Heymax  wasn't helpful.,btohqsg
Base on Heymax  What is ikea mcc code? Is the mcc code part of whitelist indicated in HSBC Revo TnC?,btohqsg
Shows as 5712  not within the list I'm seeing on the T&C. But wanted to confirm if my understanding of the  eligible transactions is correct and the MCC matters even if paying via payWave/contactless payment in IKEA?,btohqsg
yes  both payment method and MCC matters for revo,btohqsg
If not in the Revo whitelist  spending on IKEA using Revo means no 4mpd no matter what method you use to pay.If you want to earn 4mpd  Heymax already shows you which card can get 4mpd on Ikea.,btohqsg
Thank you both for the clarification  understood now :),btohqsg
good to know this  but even with your use case   it doesn't fit into my use case after looking up both the cards as both cards have minimum spend of 800$,btohqsg
Can I use the Instarem amaze card (tagged to uob lady’s card) for local SG spending to clock the 2k spending in 1 year?,btohqsg
Only foreign currency spend minimim 10 max 500 will get instapoint,btohqsg

Noob Qn: If i need to purchase on USD website.Do i need to convert SGD to USD in youtrip before i can make payment thru the card?,btohqsg
For EGA  there is a MAB of $2 000. If not will charge u $5,btohqsg
no fall below fee if premier account. btw u replying a post in Aug.,btohqsg
Hahaha I went to check the app I thought I missed out on something but I also don't remember ZYM becoming a bank... Then I saw the other person name is ZYM,btohqsg
For their 3.5% promo  u need to maintain MAB $1 000 in order to receive interest. Interest is paid monthly  calculation method is daily. 2% additional interest is on incremental balance as compared to ending balance on July 31,btohqsg
Which fixed deposit interest is good for now ?,btohqsg
No. If no USD in wallet they will do live conversation on your remaining SGD,btohqsg
Less than $20 000  BOC better,btohqsg
For POEMS any idea what an immediate rejection of ‘exceed client limit’ means for a buy of approved ETF using CPF? OA over 20k and CPFIS account number is linked under bank info. CPF investment dashboard shows the amount within allowable limit.,btohqsg
You need to top-up cash. If cash is not enough  you cannot put order even with CPF/SRS,btohqsg
CIMB doesn't endorse MAB method..interest accrued daily upon the amount inside..then tally up on month endjust be mindful of your account balance ON THE LAST DAY of the month..u maintain that amount or be higher than the previous month's...,btohqsg
Hi  any idea if the same UOB account could be use for both Christmas Promo and CNY Promo (if there is one)? Say I register for the Christmas Promo in Dec 2023 then i only top up the registered amount on 30 Dec 2023  if there is a CNY promo and compare with day end balance of 29 Dec 2023 (also an assumption) 😆,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB ONE SAVINGS ACCOUNT  is there anyway to lock your money that it is not possible to cash out and only able to cashout/transfer at bank itself...while reveiving saving interest???,btohqsg
Hi for Syfe Cash+  is there a deadline?My payday may be on the 29th  not sure if I can make it to top up some more.,btohqsg
Only lockaway account. EIR 2.92% p.a. up to 125k till Mar 24. EIR 2.45% p.a from Apr 24 onwards.,btohqsg
Hi everyone ive got a question regarding transferring usdr to a singapore bank account. Do pm me!,btohqsg
Once lock in  cannot top up more. Need create another portfolio. Cut off time should be 3pm,btohqsg
Recently  I got a few transactions on my credit card.The description isdcvsdt.com.I called uob and they advised the merchant is dating app.I don’t install dating apps. I’m an old auntie.Uob doesn’t seem to be helpful only offering stop the card and send me a new one.,btohqsg
Ask UOB if you can chargeback the transaction? Sounds like your card details got stolen by scammers,btohqsg
Sorry got a dumb questionLet's say I got UOB Evol  ppv  krisflyer card of 2k credit limit eachIs there an overarching credit limit for my UOB account? Let's say it's 3kThen I can't charge 2k per card  yes?,btohqsg
Context :I called uob hotline because I have more than 5 uob cc for different purposesSuddenly all cannot charge even though I haven't hit my 2k/card limitThe bank told me there's a credit limit shared by all cards,btohqsg
Yes for UOB it’s one limit that’s shared among their cards. Different policy per bank (Amex is independent limit per card for example),btohqsg
I see. Felt so dumb because I never had this issue with other banks hahaTo safeguard my cards  I tend to keep my credit limit low to prevent big fradulant chargesSo for uob  I can technically increase my account limit to a big figure  but keep the limit of individual cards low?,btohqsg
Because some cards like uob absolute cashback Amex I only use a few times a year  big amount  for donations. A bit Sian to keep changing the limit for both the card and account,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I am planning to set USD X amount monthly DCA into VWRA on IBKR. So I will need to set up recurring SGD Y amount bank transfers for funding. I would like to check on the following:1) Assuming my monthly DCA is 5th of every month  which recurring bank transfer date should I fix?2) How do i determine the amount of SGD to transfer  since the exact SGD Y amount required to convert to USD X is not known?Thanks!,btohqsg
This is because UOB pools all your miles together.,btohqsg
Not sure what you mean by “account limit”  are you referring to how much you can cash transfer (like paynow  FAST)? If so then yes you can control that independently to credit limitIf you have large payment coming up you can always send an overpayment to the card then it’ll increase the spending power temporarily just for that purchase,btohqsg
Oh no haha I meant overall credit limitBecause on the app & Ibanking I can see my individual card limitsBut not this 'overall limit'Ya noted on the overpaying. Used that long ago for student ccs with fixed credit limit of $500,btohqsg
Not necessarily true as a general rule  for example OCBC’s cards have different points currencies but the credit limit is pooled,btohqsg
The limit applied to my uob cashback cards too (my cashback cards also got declined on charging) so I think this pooling of miles has no relation to the credit limits,btohqsg
Haha I referring to the name ZYM not bank,btohqsg
Is this one? I am also curious to know if it’s safe. Those that signed up  pls share 😀,btohqsg
Haha.. the person name in this group too,btohqsg
Fraudulent transactions on credit card are easily refunded. The moment the transaction is made  just report to the bank. They will immediately freeze the card and provide replacement. The refund will then be processed in a few weeks after their investigation.,btohqsg
Basically what they do for this is they take up a bank FD for you.,btohqsg
But just that the bank give them a better rate so you get it too. So basically only bank risk?,btohqsg
I also kept my credit limit low also to prevent fraud tooAnd also doesn’t really make sense for me to have a high credit limit considering EVOL doesn’t have much use for a high credit limit.Anyway UOB shares credit limit among all the cards  for HSBC  it seems to be individual for me  at least for my advance and revolution card which I get 2k each separately,btohqsg
They will investigate it for you lol. Just report immediately when the transaction is made.,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows which miles card to use for EV charging? Mainly SP and comfort delgro chargers TIA,btohqsg
I put in money 3 months ago  I get back the deposited sum + interest.Straight forward,btohqsg
Sounds good. I probably will keep a low limit on my Evol then haha additional security. The mile cards are for my spillovers,btohqsg
It’s immediate liao leh. The person I chatted with me didn’t mention about investigating and refund. Maybe I should ask again.,btohqsg
Yeah  I have abt 2-3 cards which I use  but mostly they are just really about 2-3k kinda credit limit.,btohqsg
I never see before cards in the same bank have individual credit limits tho.. would be nice to have such feature hahaha,btohqsg
Did you tell them it's fraudulent?,btohqsg
So far it’s ok. Got a couple of payouts and reinvested le,btohqsg
Oh have to be done on the website.. their website is just horrible to navigate lol I only used it to set alerts and never again open it. Anyway UOB TMRW can do temporary increase of credit limit so maybe if got any purchases in the near future can do that.,btohqsg
Jus tried. This is for increasing limit temporarily. Cant lower it.,btohqsg
Only for specific stuff. Not daily use haha,btohqsg
I don't think they actually limit right.. just putting reason only 🤔,btohqsg
What's the good platform and method to pay for JR regional pass? I have HSBC Revolution (travel exclusion from 2024)  UOB KF and UOB One card,btohqsg
If under 1k then I think u can buy with hsbc revo now. 4mpd right?Above 1k then maybe uob kf since uncapped. But lower at 3mpd,btohqsg
Hi All  i need some advices on what card to apply other than uob cards for travel spending like booking hotels and purchasing stuffs from klook for Japan’s trip. I’m currently holding citi rewards and i have applied amaze card ad well.,btohqsg
If not travelling often  probably go with new card with good sign up reward as new to bank customer. Temporarily charge any eligible spend on it.,btohqsg
I have Citi rewards + Amaze combo If I am at a restaurant and it allows me to key in credit card details through the online payment page in the phone  do I use my Amaze or Citi rewards cc to earn miles?,btohqsg
Yes. For 2 pax  less than 1k.Is Klook the best? Palego isnt any cheaper even with SIA booking reference number as promo code,btohqsg
pre pay via website  payment on app are considered online payments.If only option is to pay via contactless or card. Then must Amaze card. If dining place is located in hotel. Then likely don't have bonus point even if use Amaze card. Check on HeyMax for details,btohqsg
So if it’s PayWave  I use Amaze card  I earn Citi milesIf it’s restaurant (non travel related just normal restaurant) online payment enter credit card details  i use Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Btw I just saw there’s a cap of 9000 points being awarded to Citi rewards points  means if I spend more than $900  doesn’t make sense to use this card cos no miles earned  correct?,btohqsg
max $1k for 9x bonus points in a statement month,btohqsg
just make this mistake of crediting 2k to citi rewards 😭️️️️️️ wasted,btohqsg
Can I check if u tried this promo code? Was the discount cash back to UOB card on the following month or the discount was presented in the payment stage during the booking?,btohqsg
If I have already converted to Rm  is there additional charge when I used it got touch and go wallet?,btohqsg
Any guru can advise on this? 😊,btohqsg
You must switch to the debit feature. If left in credit card feature  it will be cash advance at 27% EIR,btohqsg
What is the best value to use citi rewards point  aside from miles?,btohqsg
Let me know if it still works. Or other uob code.Do you know which card gives miles discount for Emirates flight ?,btohqsg

If I take competitive route  will I need to pay anything if I didn't get the yield I asked for? Can anyone help explain,btohqsg
When you put in competitive bid  you are basically saying anything below the interest rates you do not want. I personally recommend putting competitive in case any glitch that the interest rates dropped too much. Downside - you are the last to be alloted if there is a lot of applications,btohqsg
Cash no. Cpf yes. Cpf yes because of bank as the platform,btohqsg
I will be using srs from posb,btohqsg

Hi all  does topping up CPF for tax relief make sense if my risk tolerance is still high? I.e. DCA into index/equities,btohqsg
Yes  cpf gives u a fall back plan in case your investments turn out bad,btohqsg
Is it because it’s guaranteed? What if I’m still very young with high risk tolerance - DCA into diversified portfolio w bonds thru robo advisors? My time horizon is retirement. Or would the tax savings from CPF top-up make a lot of difference LT?,btohqsg
Actually the tax savings wont make alot of difference at the start,btohqsg
Think eventual goal is to reach frs  by when is up to u,btohqsg

Thanks  how about for voo and qqq?,btohqsg
Moomoo or tiger  both about the same. I don't usually buy US ETFs though because of the withholding taxes. Rather just buy the Irish domiciled equivalent,btohqsg

"I own some HK stocks in IBKR. I noticed that from July 2023  I am subject to a 10% withholding tax on the dividend. The transaction description reads ""CN Tax"". Could someone pls advise what this is? I thought there is no withholding tax for HK stocks.",btohqsg
They are China companies listed in HK,btohqsg
Anyone know if ichange work like YouTrip or Trust card which auto convert foreign currency to SGD?,btohqsg
It did have 10% withholding tax. You can Google search.,btohqsg
I think it will do so at prevailing mastercard rate which defeat purpose as their strong point is exchanging the currency at the best money changer digital rate when it is high to store to use,btohqsg
Hi there!I'm curious if anyone has a formula or table that outlines the required RSTU amount for starting top-ups at age 42.Chris suggested 15k by age 30  but I'd like to comprehend the process and figure out the optimal top-up amount  considering I haven't done it before.Additionally  I'm interested in understanding how to reach the FRS.Any insights or calculations would be appreciated.,btohqsg
Not exactly what you are looking for but I found this calculator to be quite helpful in making CPF related decisions.,btohqsg
Hi all   would like to check anyone tried the webull transfer in share promo (intending to transfer share out from standard chartered) is the procedure simple?,btohqsg
Need advise...above 55  meet Frs  downsize pty  now how to use the return funds to top up OA/SA to meet 20/40k?VC3A will contribute more to OA than SA. Use the extra in OA for CPFIS?Is VC3A consider an income and will it be taxed in the next financial year?,btohqsg
After 55  you can only top up RA,btohqsg
It auto sweeps into moneybull every morning,btohqsg
After 55 can only top-up RA to meet ERS. Extra interest (2% for first 30k combined  1% for next 30k combined) for OA (capped 20k)/SAwill go into SA/RA directly.,btohqsg
I'm late to this. Assuming there's this promo  which usually comes with $100+ or more incentives.Isn't it advisable to zero the account to earn 4.07% for Dec instead of the usual 5%? (Assuming $80 difference),btohqsg
Anyone know if latest SSB is full allotment or partial?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if topping up cpf SA tomorrow by paynow will still be in time for next year tax relief?,btohqsg
Suggest to do it before 10pm,btohqsg
Curious...top up SA using cash or from Ordinary account?,btohqsg
OA to SA no tax relief,btohqsg
Just curious as why b4 10 pm? If can share 😊,btohqsg
Thot also can do VC3A? But OA/SA ratio is higher.Anyone has better solution. Objective is to enjoy the extra 1-2% rate.,btohqsg
If you have met FRS  I don’t think you can VC3A. You can loginCPF to check whether you can top up,btohqsg
PayNow leverages on FAST. Any FAST transfer after 11pm will only be processed next working day. Safest to do it by 10pm in case last minute downtime.,btohqsg
so gung ho.. tomorrow is last working day of the year.I would not even touch tomorrow.. want to do anything.. better do today,btohqsg
If can  everyone who is 55  will move all their fund from OA to SA. Bear in mind  after 55 and set aside FRS  all money in OA and SA can be withdrawn,btohqsg
There's ONLY top-up to RA after 55.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158071,btohqsg
If top up RA  where the money go if alrdy hit FRS?,btohqsg
Top up RA means retirement account. This will form part of the CPF annuity plan at age 65,btohqsg
or RA and FRS is seperate account then can we withdraw from RA?,btohqsg
if before 65  meet frs and top up to RA. Can we make withdrawal from the RA?,btohqsg
FRS is not an account. It's the full retirement sum. Once you hit 55  if your RA is above FRS  you can withdraw anything excess of FRS. And you can top-up RA till ERS. The amount will increase your payouts in CPF life.EDIT: VC3A after 55 and hitting FRS -https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158131,btohqsg
FRS is not an account. RA account is setup at age 55 for retirement purpose. You can’t withdraw from RA because it’s meant to earn compounded interest before giving you annuity from age 65 for life,btohqsg
ok. meaning I can continue to top up my RA beyond FRS and can still make withdrawal any fund above FRS before it totally convert to CPF Life at age 65?,btohqsg
I think we still can VC3A else for those above 55 and still working all thier contributions have to go to RA.,btohqsg
Wrong..at 55  when you work  your contributions are still going to split among OA  SA  MÀ.,btohqsg
If you top up RA  you can only top up to ERS. Assuming your FRS is 198 800 at age 55  assume it reaches 300k at age 65  this whole amount will be used to buy CPF life annuity plan assuming you choose the standard plan.,btohqsg
This will give you a monthly payout of approximately 1600,btohqsg
ok  My qns is if you hit ERS before 65  can you withdrawal  to left FRS for your CPF Life plan before 65.If I want only FRS for CPF Life.,btohqsg
I think one can VC to 3A as self-employed above 55.,btohqsg
Don’t think so because after FRS  only can top up RA,btohqsg
so we can have better interest rate on OA/SA than RA for the first 60k.,btohqsg
Once you reach 55  when you login CPF  you will know you can’t top up other than RA,btohqsg
Self-employed is as good as a working employee for both above 55.,btohqsg
Assuming VC3A is ok. The problem is still the cobtribution ratio  OA is higher than SA for below 61 or 55-60.,btohqsg
Top up is not subject to tax. If you contribute Cpf like an employee  you are subject to tax,btohqsg
if your tax bracket is low not significant.,btohqsg
also  is VC subject to tax?,btohqsg
The purpose of VC is to reduce tax bracket,btohqsg
This article may clarify your questions more accurately.https://endowus.com/insights/manage-cpf-retirement-before-55#cpf-withdrawal-at-age-55Based on the article  VC3A will split accordingly to what you mentioned  based on contribution ratio. Any contributions to OA/SA after RA is formed (hitting FRS) can be withdrawn at any time. Anything contributed into RA (top-ups to RA or MA that already hit BHS) will go towards CPF life.And like what Andy mentioned  top-ups to RA and VC3A will not benefit from tax relief.,btohqsg
The Fed’s remarkable featThe US central bank has managed to humble hawkish and dovish critics alike.https://bt.sg/S5ou,btohqsg
when is the best time to top up to MA? Will it depend on your monthly income?,btohqsg
usually first few days of the year when limit has been raised but employer contribution not in yet,btohqsg
oh is it different from topping up towards the end of the year?,btohqsg
If SA less than 40k  transfer OA to SA for 5.08% interest rate. Magic number OA 20k + SA 40k = 60k combined balance for 1% additional interest. No tax reliefs.If SA more than 40k  MA haven't hit BHS  VCMA 8k (or till BHS  whichever lower). Will benefit from tax relief. If MA hits BHS  additional MA contributions will overflow to SA.If SA more than 40k  MA hit BHS  RSTU 8k (or till SA hit FRS). Will also benefit from tax relief. Any RSTU amount will bereserved. If SA hits FRS  additional SA contributions will overflow to OA.BHS increases yearly on Jan 1  best time to VCMA is before CPF contributions so that more will flow into SA without reserving. Can also top-up after paying premiums for Hospitalisation and Careshield plans.Tax relief from self top-up is up to 8k (VCMA + RSTU). Also can get tax relief from loved ones top-up  up to 8k. Tax relief is by calendar year.More in-depth can be found on this video by Chris:https://youtu.be/sLG97H6Rap4?si=qH6SDhHYB4hfER_0,btohqsg
@magimagsjust nice. Can refer to this.,btohqsg
thanks! But i guess if i'm in need of OA money for housing  then better to top up MA?,btohqsg
This video by Chris should help you with deciding on topping up for tax relief or transferring OA to SA:https://youtu.be/sLG97H6Rap4?si=_1-eWP1Wx68nKByk,btohqsg

Can RA allow to withdraw all at one go ?,btohqsg
BeforeCPF life  anything above FRS can be withdrawn.,btohqsg
Can only see on computer view  mobile cannot see this view,btohqsg
Not too sure if this works coz I just did the calculation earlierAssume this value is 27th Dec so I create an excel table number column A 1 downwards till 31Column B I put 794.97 from 1st to 27Then 28 29 30 31 I play around with the bank account balance to get an average formula of day 1 to day 31 to be 500,btohqsg

Is it good time to move funds out of Uob one account anticipating Cny promo ?Is it considered 29th Dec transfer ?,btohqsg
Did you do RSTU or VCMA? Or are you self employed?,btohqsg
Seems that a handful of experts here had mentioned 29 Dec to empty UOB one acct to anticipate for CNY promo (if there is one),btohqsg
Do you mean empty to zero balance?,btohqsg
Why not empty on 30th December (a Saturday) instead?,btohqsg
By right 30th is Sat is biz day  probably do it early morning,btohqsg
Hi  cheapest way you can transfer funds to USA?,btohqsg

Hihi everyone  new joiner here. I just want to gather some opinions on how should I pay for my wedding cost like hotel banquet. Should I choose the wedding loan route or pay via credit card and which card is best suit to pay such cost? I currently own a hsbc revolution and citi reward card.,btohqsg
Hi good morning.Would like to check for UOB one card use for bus/train.Do I need to apply for the simplygo account to get the cash back ?Currently   uob 1 card attach to Apple Pay to tap in tap out for the trip.,btohqsg
simplygo app is just to allow u to check ur trips and raise dispute for refundur current way of tapping pay should be eligible simplygo transaction already,btohqsg
Oh I see.Thank you for the explanation 😇🙏🏼,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2023/06/08/best-credit-cards-for-weddings/This article is for miles.The important point is that hotel allow you to pay using multiple cards  allow monthly installment (to optimize rewards)  allows in-person contactless payments. And ideally need to test out the MCC code with DBS block card method / instarem block card method  or search mcc database like heymax. The mcc determines what card to use to cover huge expense,btohqsg
Ok noted. Will read on it. Just to confirm the HSBC revol will exclude mcc 7011 right? Which the hotel banquet will most likely fall under such category.,btohqsg
yes exclude 7011. See the milelion article on recent HSBC revo nerf,btohqsg
Depends on your spending = how best to accumulate. But should prioritize new-to-bank sign up bonus  4-6 mpd cards (uob lady  hsbc revo  uob ppv  uob VS  DBS WWMC  citi rewards+amaze......)  and maybe UOB krisflyer for 3mpd uncapped on some mcc subject to t&c. Can consider cardup/citi pay all or similar services to pay insurance / tax / other common excluded transactions. Usually you would use the 1.2mpd-1.4mpd cards (UOB privi miles  DBS altitude  Citi premier miles/pretige etc) for these,btohqsg
Should we do it today since this is the last working day in 2023?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I didn’t manage to get 10x points when using Citi Rewards with Apple Pay physically at the merchant.Is that what you guys are experiencing?Thanks,btohqsg
Apple/Google Pay is considered Mobile Wallet Payment and is excluded by CRMC for 10xThe only way to get 10x by paying with Mobile Wallet is to add the Amaze card linked to your CRMC to the Mobile Wallet instead  then the Amaze card's Online Payment will basically override the Mobile Wallet payment mode and give you the 10x  but afaik Amaze can't be added to Apple Pay,btohqsg
And then transfer back 2nd Jan?,btohqsg
Tml should be working day as well,btohqsg
not true only in-app mobile wallet is excluded  transaction in physical shop should be ok if it is those whitelisted shopping mcc,btohqsg
The experts mentioned that the CNY promo (if there is one) might take reference from 29 Dec instead of 30 Dec which is a Saturday 😬,btohqsg
which merchant? when is the transaction posted?,btohqsg
actually they just being kiasu  think earlier part of 30 Dec should be ok also,btohqsg
Did u empty to zero or with minimum sum?,btohqsg
Have anyone tried to lend out singapore securities to cdp to earn additional yield? Can i know the experience and if the added income is worth the hassle?,btohqsg
this card is mainly for online spend. For offline spend it only give 10x points for those whitelisted shopping mcc.,btohqsg
Ah yes ok but just going thru amaze solves everything hahah,btohqsg
Hello! Noob question on cpf hereHow is the FRS determined before age 55? Is it based on the combined balance from OA  MA and SA / OA and SA / just SA?,btohqsg

Hi@ChrisHMSG  i use ur promo code to sign up syfe. Does brokerage just need fund $2000 and no need to perform any trade?,btohqsg
It’s really to safeguard funds that you feel could be scammed (eg safeguard funds of aged parents). The lock can only be unlocked via atm or branches. For seniors who don’t use digital payments and transfers  it’s not a bad idea since they won’t move the $ digitally anyway,btohqsg

TPG so far my $10 monthly recurring card is counted ...as card spend..will update for M1 and starhub again...,btohqsg
just to check... if OA $0 but SA > $60k  so will still get the 1% additional interest on the $60k SA = $600?,btohqsg
Wouldn’t really go for a ETF for a long term investment but happy to hear some thoughts from@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
I guess it's for those who completely wipe their OA after buying house lol,btohqsg
What’s wrong with etf for long term?,btohqsg
does anyone know when does UOB one account takes in the MAB for the day ?,btohqsg
Nothing wrong actually.. just intraday movements like a stock is not necessary to monitor & you need sufficient liquidity in the market too which s27 lacks .. no offence meant.. but the other two i mentioned earlier looks cheaper too especially from the fees but just  curious which one to go for as the investment pattern is different between them,btohqsg
Yes  as described in my Magic number video and confirmed by Melvynhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16fAYxVZ1Us,btohqsg
Personally I would shy away from amundi as1. Shorter track record2. Higher feesHowever the two funds have slightly different philosophy so you should also factor in your investment outlook,btohqsg
I have already done the comparisons more than 1 year back and it's still valid (Not sponsored)  but yeah some people just prefer to go with digital advisors (with a recurring annual fee)https://youtu.be/A7ayhwNiQv4?si=nHAvAZzEockvVMt_,btohqsg
Thanks for your inputs. Agree with you on the track record. Sorry  Higher fees you mentioned is in comparison to iShares ? Amundi is 5 bps only.,btohqsg
Thank you boss.. will take a look,btohqsg
Yup iShares is 0.03% if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Money that goes into RA cannot be taken out. The only chance is at age65 to withdraw up to 20% of the money in RA. Alternatively  declare to pledge property and leave BRS in RA.,btohqsg
But of course if you think in the long term mid cap will significantly under/overperform large cap then the difference in fees will be more than offset relative to the difference in returns,btohqsg
Hi  if already at BHS ($68500)  do ppl next year VCMA $3000 to reach $71500 . Do we get tax relief for $3000 or $8000??,btohqsg
You can’t get more tax relief than what you top up…,btohqsg
Yes. You can RSTU the remaining $5k if you want tax relief at $8k.,btohqsg
as in TPG recurring payment is online?m1  starhub  singtel need to ownself pay monthly on their app/website to be online,btohqsg
err..login at their web portalcan select recurring card ad payment mode ..fill up ur card details..after they deduct...my interest tracker showed as eligible..haha,btohqsg
got UOB recurring card payment too..i just filled up and mail to them... can't confirm yet thou...,btohqsg
Are you asking about GIRO payment or credit card payment? Lol.GIRO payment will be eligible for UOB One account bonus interest.Recurring bill payment will not be eligible for UOB EVOL card cashback and spending.,btohqsg
What’s the difference between topping up MA start of year and end of year,btohqsg
I remember someone asked this earlier  you can try scrolling up or searching with the relevant keywords,btohqsg
Got it ! Thanks for clarification.. 👍,btohqsg

If u meet uob one interest requirement  can consider putting 100k there for the 5% interest.,btohqsg

Yea  only downside is need to use uob credit card… but will consider  thanks :),btohqsg
$500k constantly revolving in say 4% tbills (will surely go down soon) is approx $20k a year or $1.67k a month of passive income.You should consider deploying into higher return investments.,btohqsg
Hmm  yea but is there any alternatives that are as “no risk” as tbills?,btohqsg
Bank savings accounts I guess. Watch out for promos and read the tncs to try and earn over 4% pa.,btohqsg

There’s one Widget if one tops up SA (Under Retirement dashboard)  but don’t see that relief number change after topping up MA,btohqsg
Have to manually track and calculate,btohqsg
Lol ok  looks like MA visibility not well-covered by CPF team. Thanks all!,btohqsg

Personally  I would not recommend to apply cards just for a single purpose such as just for a tripCancellation most likely will hurt your credit score  but maybe others can help. As  previously I cancelled one of my  long standing credit card and my credit score dropped from AA to DD.You can try to apply  it does not harm anything~,btohqsg

credit bureau but iirc it is within a month from the notification where they notify you,btohqsg
Looks like I have to apply for another credit card to get a free report 😀,btohqsg

Anyone knows if we work from overseas as a digital nomad  is that eligible to get Exit Permit for NSMen?,btohqsg
I missed the usd3k bonus from webull promo. Not gonna miss this one. Thanks Chris for sharing amazing promo,btohqsg
hi chris is your link working?,btohqsg
nice..last night while many of us were rushing  many faced issues using UOB Absolute. Keep hitting snag..,btohqsg
Yes  just a download link. Remember to add the code on signupCHO8137,btohqsg
will drop so much? I have useless cards that I want to cancel,btohqsg
Hey guys  I a bit confused. Is it get $400 capitaland voucher after funding 4K in a snack portfolio? Or need to buy their insurance,btohqsg
Check TNC  likely to be no rewards,btohqsg
Must hit $500 or that quarter is $0 cashback,btohqsg
even for basic things like transport?,btohqsg
is this the same promo? how come $1280 now only $400?,btohqsg
UOB One Card is a tiered based cashback card. Hit tier  then get cashback. Don't hit minimum $500 tier  don't get ANY cashback.,btohqsg
The $880 flash promo (invest $10k) ended at 11.59pm on 29th December.This is the one that many people (including myself) was scrambling for.,btohqsg
Anyone has iChange referral code to share? Chong's referral code no longer valid (I think too many people use perhaps),btohqsg
I doubt not using your card will affect credit score lol. I have 2 cards unused that I didn't cancel and my credit score is unaffected.,btohqsg
Don't need. It cost less than $10 for an ad-hoc one. Check credit bureau's website if you still qualify for a free one.,btohqsg
Why not ask your unit S1?,btohqsg
oh i blur saw sethisfy post about snack last night and today chris post is different. thanks for explain,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGyour ichange referral seems to not work (?),btohqsg
last night:invest $10k (hold 30 days)  you can get $880 + $400today:invest $4k (not sure must hold how long  i didn't read)  you can get $400,btohqsg
Does the reward categories for Uob ladies card apply for overseas? Let’s say I select dining and use the card for a restaurant overseas  would it qualify?,btohqsg

Hi! Does anybody know if i can use citi rewards with atome,btohqsg
how do we top up? Is it must use AMEX card?,btohqsg
Do not ask for money in the group.,btohqsg
If I put money in DBS SRS  how do I declare for tax relief? - Pardon me for my ignorant question if has been asked,btohqsg
Can use master/visa and some say Amex (my Amex failed so I used MasterCard).,btohqsg
don't need to declare  auto submitted for tax relief,btohqsg
Is an excellent question. Your tax relief is what u have contributed for the year. The bank would not let u contribute more than the 'quota'. The bank would transmit your contribution info to iras backend (transparent to u),btohqsg
I just transferred amount to DBS SRS  understand passed cutoff at 7pm but hope no issues,btohqsg
No issue. As long as is before 31 Dec cutoff :),btohqsg
Just saw this but wanted to clarify,btohqsg
Yeah this is also what SRS website mentioned,btohqsg
Most likely won't count le. But hope you still get it,btohqsg

Hi! Was wondering if anyone knows about this :)If let’s say I’m using my UOB Lady Card  and I book an accommodation on Airbnb. And I select  pay $350 in December  pay $400 in January. Is it considered a 0% instalment payment plan? Or will I still get 6mpd for both Dec and Jan since I selected the travel category? Thank you!,btohqsg
IPP is provided by bank itself through partnership with the merchant. They will specifically say 0% IPP.,btohqsg
So if it’s something like this it shouldn’t be IPP? Because there’s no bank partnership?,btohqsg
Who using posb everyday card to pay for utilities like Geneco and SP?For bills above $100  are we able pay the excess via AMEX then set recurring to posb everyday?,btohqsg
however  you need to find out how is airbnb helping you to split the cost. Are they using another like BNPL vendor to split  and what's the mcc code for the such transactions.,btohqsg
Ah! I see this makes sense. Sure sure I will find out about it :) thank you!,btohqsg
Yea u should still get it.,btohqsg
Hello  is there any credit card I can apply as an 20 year old? I’m trading forex and I’m making low to mid 5 figures monthly for the past 4-5 months. Looking to start building my credit but not sure they will accept “forex” as an source of income,btohqsg
I wanna ask if withdraw need any fees ?,btohqsg
I've a question for stand chart's save up level up promo. If I register in Jan  does it mean I need to empty my bonus saver account on 31 Dec which is tomorrow so that my period end balance on 31 Jan is compared to 0 (which is the period end balance for Dec)?,btohqsg
They won’t.Even fixed income interest is only taken as build on / reference.U need iras recognised income for credit card credit limit purposes.,btohqsg
Self employed banks may ask for 2 years iras Noa if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Anyone know if we can top up SA account for parents age 80+? And how can they withdraw the money?,btohqsg
Wow I did not know that to redeem hsbc miles  we have to sign up for the hsbc mileage programme?Where there is an annual fee of $40?,btohqsg
hey guys  anybody with experience with reward points for hsbc revolution? I got the card on the 22nd of nov  made a transaction of $450 on the 23rd of nov (posted on 24th nov) from easybook  which should qualify for the 9x rewards  so technically by the end of this month i should have more than 4k reward points but i only have 2k+ (im guessing from other transactions) any idea why? Thanks!,btohqsg
yep have to pay $40 for one year unlimited transfer of points,btohqsg
U can do transfer SIA and transfer Cathay to feel better. Sounds like better deal,btohqsg
Update: iChange replied that the code of chong268 is still valid.,btohqsg
A few ideas- Some banks will accept a fixed deposit in lieu of proof of income to secure a credit card- If you’re serious about forex trading long term  trade through a corporation and use it to pay yourself a steady income,btohqsg
Yup a pte ltd  but there are overhead costs for this option so this requires more commitment,btohqsg
Ohh but this means I wld have to contribute to tax right,btohqsg
Hi hi may I know how to use amaze on Kris+? Amaze cannot be added in iPhone E wallet. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Yes  all part and parcel of being recognised as legitimate by the system 😁,btohqsg
Ohh”-“Then nvm. I’ll wait to get a job after my degree then use that to apply then my trading won’t be taxed.Thank you!,btohqsg
just confirming this Snack or whatever  nothing to do with NTUC Income agent right?? Don't want to deal with them.,btohqsg
I think after fulfilling 4k  u can redeem it 02jan onwards and u can jus ignore this app,btohqsg
But... i m not sure if confirm can get it by 02 jan... also... how will they transfer the money back? Is it via paynow or bank transfer?,btohqsg
After redemption the funds will go to your paynow account.,btohqsg
Thanks.... wah like that seems like free money cos u can gain some cashback from UOB absolute card... haha,btohqsg
Yeah it was much better on 29th night.Current promo is also not bad la. But not as good.,btohqsg
Hi! Have a question on cpf top up if anyone can help.In the scenario say if I’m $3k away from 2024’s BHS of $71 500  then I top up $8k to my CPF MA on 1 Jan 2024  I supposed only $3k will go into my MA as it hits the BHS ($71500)  and the balance $5k will flow into my SA?In this instance  will my tax relief (for topping up CPF) be $8k next year? (Or will only get $5k as the tax relief)Thank you 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Cpf will refund u 5k without interest. So u only get tax exemption for 3k,btohqsg
I see  thanks!Can I top up MA $3k and then top up SA $5k on 1 Jan 2024 instead? To get full $8k tax relief?,btohqsg
How much is 40k citi thankyou points worth?,btohqsg
And what can you redeem with this citi thank you points,btohqsg
16k airmiles  else redeem vouchers from citi's rewards catalogue if you don't fly,btohqsg
U can consider paying insurance from ur MA along the way then top it up back to BHS again,btohqsg
UnderstandGuess i’ll get it done on 1 January  so will split top up $5k to SA and $3k to MA to get $8k relief 😊,btohqsg
SA is not max out yet right?,btohqsg
There are a few Chris cpf video just watch and it be explained.,btohqsg

Hi guys. What's the best miles card if I monthly spend is around 2k up and spend on hotel and flight tickets,btohqsg
Would I get 4mpd from Citi Rewards if use it to pay with KRIS Pay app?,btohqsg
I didnt know too! Guess it makes sense to save up even more more miles on hsbc then,btohqsg
Yes  you can do that.Tax relief cap of 8k is shared between sa and ma.,btohqsg
no  cos kris+ app need to pay in-app via google/apple pay which is excluded from 4mpd. If u using android phone can workaround it by using Amaze+citi rewards mastercard on googlepay.,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. Any suggestions to which card to use cos I’m using iPhone,btohqsg
dbs wwmc. or hsbc revolution/uob ppv for whitelisted online MCCs,btohqsg
It’s the end of the next month after your statement cycle. If your statement cycle is until Dec. Then the bonus points will be in jan,btohqsg
Oh I see  so if my transaction is in the cycle of 5 Nov - 5 dec then bonus points will be in Jan?,btohqsg
Yup. You will get the 1x first then the next month after your statement cycle then will have 9x if eligible,btohqsg
Ohhh ok  thanks! Got confused as somehow I got some bonus points but not all,btohqsg
Probably you got some other transaction in the previous months that qualify,btohqsg
Hmm yea  but I only started the card on the 22nd of Nov so not even 2 months but somehow I got 3k points when I haven’t even spent 2k with the card yet,btohqsg
Haha lol  extra points just take it. If January dont have then can call the bank,btohqsg
Hi all  is there a way to check how much we are away from the 8k cpf top up for tax relief? I remember singpass used to be able to see but seem like they already remove this. Thanks,btohqsg
Have to ownself check using historical transactions,btohqsg
I see. Quite disappointed that singpass remove that feature but thanks for clarifying Chris!,btohqsg

Hi EVOL experts! I noticed my EVOL Cashback credited this month is only 0.3%  after looking at last month’s bill  I noticed that I have spent >$600 in transactions  but after the Cashback credited last month  the net bill is $599.95.Is the Cashback computed based on the net bill? 😢 Or the >$600 I spent in transactions?,btohqsg
I think no because of mobile app,btohqsg

Anyone knows any credit card which approvals can be done in a day to use immediately? I wanna catch a 1.1 promotion,btohqsg
Other 4-6mpd cards. Probably should wait to see Jan 2024 singsaver/moneysmart promo.If you new to bank credit card status  it’s possible get the card with most desirable rewards first then  after a while  get the card you actually want (for situation where the card you want has worse new to bank gifts),btohqsg
Iirc hsbc revo transfer fees is per year and not per transaction? And fee auto renews yearly.,btohqsg
Will I get 6mpd if pay mcc4131 under UOB Lady transport cat?,btohqsg
According to heymax  no.Read milelion article  no.https://milelion.com/2023/03/20/explained-which-mccs-are-included-in-the-uob-ladys-card-travel-category/,btohqsg
Can some1 clarify how does the cit rewards 4mpd work out? It'*s not a direct conversion to miles right? Need to convert from the earned points then to miles right?,btohqsg
Hello. Can I check what cards can be used to earn miles for lasik surgery at Clearvision?,btohqsg
Hi! For the hsbc revo card  if the 1st 1k I spend does not fall into the eligible transactions category and the next 1k I spend does  do I still get the 4k miles?,btohqsg
Is difficult because don't know which mcc code exactly. heymax suggests mcc 8011 / 8042. I'm assuming the mcc code is such and you're paying via contactless/ mobile contactless  and can get the cashier to allow you to use multiple cards to pay1) UOB visa signature 4 mpd  contactless payment  min 1k max 2k2) UOB preferred platinum visa 4 mpd  mobile contactless payment  max $1110.3) Amaze card linked to citi rewards 4mpd  payment via amaze  max 1k but incur 1% fee for mcc 8011.For those general spend cards  not certain.Hopefully someone else with real life experience can share,btohqsg
how long will it take for DBS to credit krisflyer miles ?,btohqsg

https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/card-privileges/uob-dollar.pageNot too sure worBut I also experience the same thing for 1 of the months  but I did not go find out in depth.,btohqsg
ah okie okie thank you ☺️,btohqsg
For these 2 Mcc codes  Citi premier is a clear yes. DBS altitude = should be yes according to wording  as they exclude hospitals (8062).,btohqsg
normal lah  dated next business day,btohqsg
prepare for possible uob savings promo in next quarter like the xmas one,btohqsg
okie thank you so much 😊,btohqsg
note that citibank excluding mcc 8062 wef 17 Jan 2024,btohqsg
Sorry I meant that spending at UOB merchants will not be counted towards UOB evol cashback,btohqsg
actually spending at uob$ merchant does count to $600 min spend and get 0.3% cashback under others category,btohqsg
Hi all  about moomoo 5.8% promo. If I subscribed $40K in October 2023  when will I get the bonus Interest?I received a small amount  $70 last November. Is that it?,btohqsg
Took less than 2 working days for me. Did it last month.,btohqsg
No rush to do on 1st jan cos all top ups will only earn interest in feb. So might as well top up last day of jan,btohqsg
I missed out top-up srs tis year  passed cut off date...any alternative investment to invest srs money to have same return amt as tax relief ? For one year(short term) investment.,btohqsg
I would suggest tracking your spending daily to make sure you spend at least $600.1. Only posted transactions within statement month count to min spending  non posted transactions will count towards next month.2. UOB$ merchants will count towards min spending but will not be considered under online/mobile contactless if you receive UOB$. If you don't hit the minimum amount to get UOB$  you will clock online/mobile contactless. CONFIRMED by CSO.,btohqsg
No rush but MUST do it before cpf contributions. Once you miss it  you'll only end up having to RSTU more amount which will be reserved.,btohqsg
If I spend to hit the $500 spend today for the UOB one account  is it too late?,btohqsg
Yes cause it need be posted ~,btohqsg
Try again next month 😅 I'm guessing you're using a UOB CC without min spending?,btohqsg
Well the best way is to track your transactions daily to prevent it from happening again,btohqsg
hi all  wanted to ask a question on CPF and the difference between SA vs MA top ups and  supercharging of OA/SA which i still do not really understand... if i top up my SA (RSTU)  what are the actual implications? what happens to the SA that is contributed by cash?I understand it as the SA amount topped up will go into my RA and cannot be shielded. but how does that work? once my SA hits 40k  i can put all of the amount above 40k into investments before 55 right? doesnt that shield the same way?,btohqsg
The topup amount tgt with the interest this amt earns until u r 55 will be marked as reserved. If the total reserved amt is less than 40k  then it dosnt matter  since u cant shield the first 40k in SA anyway. If the rserved amt is more than 40k  then u cant shield the reserved amt which is more than 40k.,btohqsg
Oh! on the statement it shows $628 spent but on the UOB one account spend meter only show $400+. Will I still be eligible for the bonus interest? 😅,btohqsg
I think can  go to cpf website Home>my cpf>Retirement and scroll down. I believe that amount is for both RSTU + VCMA (I did 8k VCMA) even though the retirement page is for SA. But ya  sad that they removed that feature from the singpass app,btohqsg
So just to confirm that i understand correctly. basically if my RSTU reserved amount goes >40k  (eg. i topped up 50k total). i cannot invest that 50k  but anything above that i can still invest for CPF shielding?,btohqsg
"Ahh thank you so much. I see it now!@ChrisHMSGcan take note too.To be clearer is Home -> mycpf -> My dashboard -> Retirement. After which  scroll all the way down to see ""Tax relief""",btohqsg
One account is based on calendar mth spending,btohqsg
HiAbit confuse when i open the page.Is this investment or Life Term Insurance?,btohqsg
no it wont. based on calendar spending. basically  you better spend $100 today to be eligible for ONE interest,btohqsg
Also  it took more than 1 working day for the numbers to update on that page for my case. So I guess don't expect it to reflect the updated amount immediately,btohqsg
Oh I’ll still be eligible if I spend today? Probably won’t be posted yet tho,btohqsg
i click on the link provided. Its bring me to this page.https://www.snackbyincome.sg/products/invest?utm_source=user_invite&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=snack_invest&utm_content=invest_referral_msg&shortlink=9444579b&c=Investment%20Referral&pid=User_invite&source_caller=ui,btohqsg
My lady statement is changed to calendar month alr 😲,btohqsg
based on my understanding... it is based on CALENDAR month  not POSTED/STATEMENT month. so even if you spend today (ie. calendar month DEC; posted month JAN)  it should be ok. but not an expert in this. take with grain of salt. just my understanding,btohqsg
Hi all  wondering Chris in YouTube video does mention invest interactive broker using RSP will have cost efficient and cost around 0.38usd per trade  wondering if self trade every month without fixed amount of investment  will still able to get cost invest around 0.38usd or how it should be calculated?,btohqsg
Thanks 🙏🙏 just liaised with the cso,btohqsg
Will pending transactions be posted today yall think? 😂 I have some pending transactions,btohqsg

Thank you for the consistent support throughout the year! All the best to everyone and have a great year forward to 2024 💯,btohqsg
If you are SEP  you can only do VCMA as a SEP (and not as a member)  which combines with VC3A cap of 37 740,btohqsg

Hello. Just wanna checkLet's say I had 1 uob cc earlier on and changed my statement cycle to follow the calendar month (example 1 Dec to 31 Dec)Subsequent uob cc I signed for  do they follow this statement cycle?Asking this because I noticed that regardless of how many cards I have with uob  there is only 1 cc statement per month and it seems to follow my first cards billing cycle,btohqsg
I had a few transactions on the last day which was posted at the following month and they accept my request back then. I guess no harm trying if you have something to buy,btohqsg
No time to try this man sorry just reached sg appreciate though!! 🙏,btohqsg
yes. for uob  all of your cards follow the same billing cycle.,btohqsg
Like I call in tmr to request for them to add my new transaction to be for the Dec minimum spend? Or call now?,btohqsg
I think you can call them like on the 3rd or 4th when the bonus interest would usually be in,btohqsg

But the monthly effective interest to earmark 100k there isn't worth it because stash monthly interest not so high right?,btohqsg
It is 3 percent for 100k then u plus the 558 for earmark,btohqsg
I rather rotate 2 humans uob one with earmark. Balance put in hsbc Ega or scb Esaver,btohqsg
It is up to individual preference  if stash 3 percent plus ard 1.7 for the earmark. Dont see the harm in doing uob one and uob stash in rotation.,btohqsg
After all  the bonus is given first not after  plus your fund is safe in earmark  cant be hack haha,btohqsg
So the earmark date is 31st dec 2023?,btohqsg
New promo earmark reference balance is 31 dec  earliest earmark date is 29 feb release in late may,btohqsg
What is uob stash eir with the cash bonus?,btohqsg
#uobsavings#earmarkthis should be a useful picture for reference.,btohqsg
Ok I guess not too bad since on par with hsbc Ega. (But this one is liquid can in out anytime),btohqsg
But stash is tricky  for safe sake  i will just not touch the acct at all for the whole period even when interest is credit so as not to trigger the below mab clause,btohqsg
Uob one itself would have gotten 5%. May not be as effective if put in stash with only 4.7 as compared to leaving it within uob one itself.,btohqsg
That is in the case when uob one is already earmark  then stash come into picture,btohqsg
Yeah it is weird so I never dare to touch stash. It’s like ocbc 360. Psudeo fixed depositAnd if hsbc ega gives 4.5%+  I rather go with that.,btohqsg
Ega also not that great  u get 3.5 plus 1 for max 1 month then need to withdraw out the park elsewhere as the 1 percent is on incremental from the previous month,btohqsg
That’s why I use 2 Human uob one and 2 human hsbc Ega,btohqsg
Not all have 2 human bank acct lol,btohqsg
See if easier to find 2 human or juggle uob one and uob stash loh,btohqsg
Comparison date is 31 dec 2023.,btohqsg
In general it is only norm to have 1 human  so we discuss the norm first haha.,btohqsg
wats the EIR of the 4 tiers of the UOB rising dragon?,btohqsg
Thanks... time to put back 100k in now..,btohqsg
I only know about 6.5% eir for $100k tier (assuming $10 31st dec balance).The other amounts will be less.,btohqsg
Best to put in today or 2nd Jan? I heard from a few of u guys said 2nd Jan then put in.,btohqsg
No. Do it on 2nd only. But need to be more than $100k to get $100k mab. Use excel. I think I calculated $103400,btohqsg
the lower tiers always seem not worth..haha,btohqsg
What is the reason for 2nd jan?,btohqsg
think i throw into my CIMB 3.5% more worth..doing calculating now..haha,btohqsg
Hmm I still have not transferred out the funds yet   still in time to be eligible for the promotion?,btohqsg
Can we do it with joint accounts?,btohqsg
U can consider use other uob acct (usually people use uob one and uob stash to rotate) if u forgot to withdraw from uob one then consider uob stash if u have 200k (100 in uob one  100 is stash),btohqsg
No harm transferring in on 1 jan right? Just potentially one less day of interest? Then we only need to transfer 100k not 103400,btohqsg
The main acct holder need to register i think,btohqsg
I don’t advise it.I advise use 2 separate humans all individual accounts.Use joint account only to facilitate the movement of funds so lower chance to trigger bank checks.,btohqsg
still need 103400 to get mab $100k,btohqsg
Uob dont process on public holiday  u see the money inside but the date will show as 2nd jan so u be below 100k mab for the month of jan,btohqsg
Uob will recognise your inward money as 2nd jan only,btohqsg
ys sia..tricky..sometimes also not sure they count the way i do or not? hahadamn! my MAB messed up liao now..haha..either sit 100015 everyday and throw anything out that comes in...or maintain 100 but deposit 465 for 1 day and withdraw on the next day,btohqsg
Just dont withdraw at all for the whole earmark period that is the safest haha,btohqsg
If earmark till may then empty all out  leave zero for jun to prepare for next earmark,btohqsg
ya safest but the MAB rises..haha..then hard to track,btohqsg
Actually one year can do twice right..next window to empty account I supposed is in March?,btohqsg
If no withdraw the mab should auto increase due to interest credit. So just dont touch at all for jan to may  empty out 1 shot like ocbc 360,btohqsg
Can do 4 time a year if got 200k and can rotate between uob one and stash,btohqsg
Yeah I using 2 humans each take part twice per year from my memory.The key takeaway is 6.5% pa each time u take part  else 5% when no earmark. Either way very sweet.,btohqsg
yup.. monitoring via excel..not sure my workings correct anot..haha,btohqsg
hiii can i confirm that scoot & pelago is definitely part of the travel category for UOB Lady's card right?,btohqsg
I always over budget slightly.If need to maintain $100k mab I make my excel hit $100 500 mab for example.,btohqsg
ya..datz why interest credit..must vigilant check..hahahai throw out whatever comes in....on the very day,btohqsg
But with interest rate predicting to go down in later part of 2024  i would say just enjoy the high interest rate while it is there,btohqsg
yours one account? overshot abit no harm....stash MAB must chin chun sia...,btohqsg
Yea I only play uob one account.I didn’t like how stash mechanics work like ocbc 360 so I avoid both,btohqsg
oh ya sia..one account 7.8 sure drop later in 2024 i guess...hais,btohqsg
Stash need to be higher or maintain,btohqsg
i try maintain..if keep on high-ing....scared lost count..haha,btohqsg
So best is dont touch and just wipe out one shot,btohqsg
Long time ago. Citi maxi saver or what had such stupid mechanics too. I hated it,btohqsg
if i top up my cpf now is still count toward 2023 or 2024 tax relief ?,btohqsg
What year are u in now?,btohqsg
ah i thought still got chance :o,btohqsg
Lol.. can top-up now also for 2024,btohqsg
Is either too early and too late lol,btohqsg
take note if you're paying via paypal it'll be 4121 - transport cat,btohqsg
so i transferred out 100k at 10pm on 31 dec 2023  dunno if can still be eligible for the UOB rising dragon if i deposit 100k on 2 Jan 2024,btohqsg
Nope. You have to minimally have 120k for the $88 tier. Your transfer on 31 Dec is only processed on 2 Jan,btohqsg
If you transferred on 30 Dec 10pm still ok,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG..  Strange.. seems like CPF MA interest went into MA? Looks like unable to topup 3K into MA.,btohqsg
Same here! Was gonna ask this too,btohqsg
Ya..the yearly interest has automatically gone into the BHS...only can top up a couple of hundred vs the whole 3k..sian liao..,btohqsg
Anyone use xnap here? Whats the best credit card to use? Not sure if citibank rewards card award point for this kind of mobile transaction,btohqsg
If your bhs is 68.5k and received int  wait a while  the interest will either flow to OA or SA. When it is back to 68.5k  you can top up the 3k to reach the new BhS.,btohqsg
Just realized the same this morning. Sad,btohqsg
Amaze link to citi reward card,btohqsg
Why would it flow to OA and SA??,btohqsg
MA interest is transferred out to either:1. SA (if SA < FRS)2. OA (if SA >= FRS),btohqsg
"Bec ur MA cannot be more than the stipulated BHS. So in 2023 the BhS is 68.5k. anything more  will need to ""splurge out"" to either OA or SA",btohqsg
Watch from 05:20 i explained  every year this question will pop out one. Just wait awhilehttps://youtu.be/cSC7CXZwHwc?si=-heTBTwQi98G8azw,btohqsg
Didn't pay attention in class (as usual 🙈,btohqsg
xxxx new clicks on Chris' video 😄,btohqsg
But every month still need to increase the balance,btohqsg
I withdraw my uob one account cash last night. Would anyone be able to advise if it is still counted please? I would still try it out nevertheless.,btohqsg
Stash is maintain or increase leh. So no withdraw plus interest every month should work,btohqsg
Hihi  newbie here on UOB earmarked promo.If my UOB One has a balance of 1k on 29 Dec 2023  I register to participate in theRising Dragon Savings Promotion& deposit 100k on 2 Jan. Is it that I will get the $588?,btohqsg
Nope  withdraw on 31dec is process on 2nd jan,btohqsg
Oh I see too bad. Thank you Queenie.,btohqsg
Yes provide u maintain the 100k till the amt is earmark on 29 feb after u register for the promo,btohqsg
Hi. I am not able to top up 3k to Medisave  as interest got credited in my MA account. Earlier in 2023  my MA was already reached to 68.5k and I wanted to top up 3k today.,btohqsg
So even if exceed 100k  just keep inside?,btohqsg
Pardon me for asking. 30 Dec is Saturday  would it still be processed if it is at 10pm please?,btohqsg
If it was me i would just keep inside from jan to may loh so it dont lose the bonus interest due to withdrawal that cause mab to fall,btohqsg
U can check your acct transaction to be sure,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I will go open stash account first 😁,btohqsg
U can always open on 30 jan then pump in the money required for earmark on 1 feb to maximize the return,btohqsg
Thank you Queenie for the enlightening comment. Haha too bad for me,btohqsg
I believe need to wait for the interest in MA to be transferred to SA. usually CPF does it on 1 Jan so probably it will be reflected tmr,btohqsg
I did rstu 8k 1 week ago. But the money is still showing ‘reserved amounts’When will it go into my sa/ra?,btohqsg
Anyone still keep the TnC for the previous (around Oct 2023) WeBull's moneybull US$120 / US$$1500 promo?                                                Is it from today (1 Jan) onwards can safely withdraw/redeem out the Fullerton Cash fund ?  I remember them saying on 5 Jan 2024 will receive the bonus USD 120 or USD 1500 or USD 3000.,btohqsg
Thank you. I checked transaction history for previous  year. 31st Dec 2022  interest was credited about 2.6k and on 1st Jan they moved partially 2.2k to other accounts.,btohqsg
How does the rotation between 2 accounts work? I have 100k earmarked in UOB Stash till 15 Jan 2024. If balance in UOB One is 0  does it mean I can join the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion by transferring the 100k from Stash to One account after 15 Jan? Or it has to be fresh funds from other bank?,btohqsg
My earmarked funds from UOB one account will only be back in mid March. So actually still have to wait,btohqsg
Finally the uob one cny promo only ask 20k. Haiz wasted,btohqsg
Fresh fund from other bank. But u can always transfer out from stash and transfer in from other bank under family name that u trust,btohqsg
Good morning all. Time to top up CPF. But CPF website high traffic 😂,btohqsg
Rotation only work well for people with 200k. As uob one base plus bonus is 5 percent  better then stash which is 3 plus ard 1.7 with earmark,btohqsg
I see. So I can transfer the 100k from UOB Stash to my other bank account  then transfer back into UOB One. Even if my Stash drops by 100k  it will not affect my UOB One joining the promotion since it is not a direct transfer of fund from Stash to One  is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Yes by left  by right is cant but if u use a third party name to transfer in is consider fresh fund,btohqsg
My apologies but can I ask since I am not eligible for the cny promo  I can transfer my funds back to my uob one account today then?,btohqsg
U can transfer but the mab will fall below 100k as today all incoming is process on 2nd jan,btohqsg
Oh I am transferring from my posb back to uob one. I am not sure does uob one gives out daily interest or based on monthly average like OCBC 360 please?,btohqsg
Hi  I have a UOB one account . Can I create a stash account end of Jan and deposit say 100k to enjoy the CNY promo ?,btohqsg
I only transferred out the money yesterday which would be processed tomorrow thus my balance on 31 Dec is unaffected and I don't have extra funds to put in haha.,btohqsg
When is the earmarked bonus payout ?,btohqsg
If u have extra 100k to put  beside the 100k in uob one,btohqsg
Oh  you're right. If only have 100k then should just leave it in UOB one account  cos 5% is better than 4.7%. I opened Stash too quickly 😂,btohqsg
Anyone know for CRMC  if using mobile app  how to check points history to check whether transaction have 10x points or not?,btohqsg
That’s what I meant. But I didn’t get the answer. Can I open the account end of Jan,btohqsg
I interpret her answer as a yes,btohqsg
Yes u can open on end jan then register and transfer in 100k,btohqsg
So u mean either or account will be earmark at any point in time and sometime both account will be earmark during overlap,btohqsg
It depend on how u plan the earmark start and end. It can overlap at time  but with the rotation  one can do 4 earmark a year max. 2 on uob one  2 for stash on assumption that uob keep having such saving promo,btohqsg
Sorry Queenie  if my withdrawal from the uob one account is processed tomorrow along with the deposit (assuming I do it now)  would you think it would cancel each other off?,btohqsg
I have uob stash earmark for national day  then i withdraw my uob one on 29th Dec  so I can register for this cny right,btohqsg
U need to see the transaction record,btohqsg
Yes  actually all can join just if u have enough fresh fund for the promo compare to the end day balance stated by bank,btohqsg
Those funds which I transfer out on 29th Dec  hehe,btohqsg
As you mentioned  the withdrawal shown processed on 2nd Jan haha,btohqsg
Anyone knows when will the snack investment be invested?,btohqsg
Should required few working day  usually fund purchase not immediate,btohqsg
Mine still not invested also. Started on 28 Dec,btohqsg
Ohh lol  I see the terms they say if before 3pm will be invested on the same day,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGcan we withdraw the investment then put back the 4k for this month challenge for snack?,btohqsg
The CPF interests are in  but reserved amount never increased… are the interests related to the reserved value  not reserved too?,btohqsg
Sorry  how u plan is for any promo  u earmark both uob stash and uob one?,btohqsg
Only one acct can be register for any one promo,btohqsg
Thanks  I reading again the tnc  thanks!,btohqsg
Did anybody notice that the interest credited to the CPF Medisave account on 31 Dec 2023 was not transferred to the Special Account?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know cpf vcma will the interest earning be different between deposit on Jan 1st vs Jan 31st?,btohqsg
Anyone realised that the new funds is measured against 30 sept 23 instead of 31 Dec 23? Is this a mistake from UOB?,btohqsg
This month $240 challenge I feel do last few days better.,btohqsg
Read theTnCof the “UOB Rising Dragon Saving promo”.The info on the rest of the websites just like the burger’s like of advertisement. What you see is not what you get. 🍔,btohqsg
What some do (I don’t):1. Earmark uob one for Christmas promo2. Earmark stash for cny promo.So they have 2 x $100k earmark simultaneously.,btohqsg
Even tnc has typo. Page 2 illustration Is nonsense.,btohqsg
Yeapp noticed that too. I thought was suppose to go SA if FRS not reached?,btohqsg
When does 2024 MA top up 8k tax reliefs refresh cycle ? Check CPF retirement dashboard seems still not renewed for MA,btohqsg
The person needs to rush to finish the document n head to countdown at Marina .😂,btohqsg
I cannot access cpf digital service now😅,btohqsg
Interest went back into Medisave account.. Now can only top up $200+ today..,btohqsg
invest the $4k just before the promo ends.. otherwise u have to hold the $4k investment till promo period ends,btohqsg
