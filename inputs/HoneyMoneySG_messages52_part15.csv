No which I'm fine. Just that their definition means don't count towards linkpoints means don't count towards spend outside FP group,btohqsg
Means I don't hit the extra linkpoints % for FP spend,btohqsg
Hi guys I applied for the Citi Rewards via SingSaver. Just got approved.Was wondering for the $500 qualifying spend on SingSaver & $800 qualifying spend on Citi Rewards Welcome Gift  does the spendings need to be eligible for the 10X reward points?Or I can just book my flight (not eligible for 10X points) thats $800 for example  and fulfill the SingSaver and Welcome Gift criteria in this way?,btohqsg
Apply via singsaver got what use ??,btohqsg
any idea if flight booking can fulfil those criteria?,btohqsg
Singsaver drags and takes a long time to issue the rewards  not good experience ðŸ‘Ž,btohqsg
They are already 2 months late for mine  and that is by their given timeline,btohqsg
Same. Still waiting for HSBC new account opening with conditions fulfilled in Jan,btohqsg
Anyone can share their thoughts on USD fixed deposits? DBS offering 4.97% for a 12 month term. Thinking of transferring my SGD there  how risky or recommendee is it compared to SGD FD's?,btohqsg
haha u can search for it.. there is one member here AI Architect i think.. he knows quite a bit about USD FD.,btohqsg
You can only get 1 of the gift  not both. They do not have to be eligible for 10X  you can check the T&C for exclusions,btohqsg
All type of credit card for rewards ? How to check?,btohqsg
They almost lost my application that time. But still within the timeline they stated of 6 months.,btohqsg
If your current FD has higher rates  I suggest you put a new 10k cos the rate is just 2.3% for secured credit card with UOB,btohqsg
All type of credit card got rewards or only specific?,btohqsg
Click on the link  whatever card have or don't have it's there,btohqsg
Like this ? Free $350 cashback?,btohqsg
Yes- provided u meet the criterias,btohqsg
Yes  but read the t&cALWAYS read the t&c  don't end up complain why not eligible this and that ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows if spending at optometric stores (e.g. owndays) can use UOB lady? And what category does it fall under?,btohqsg
but what is the difference? I can also go official  DBS website to sign up  they give the same cashback ðŸ™„,btohqsg
Then look at other cards  some cards like Citibank has different sign up bonus,btohqsg
How to differentiate? That is my questions ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Lol what do u mean? Compare from moneysmart/singsaver to the official bank sign up rewards?,btohqsg
Anyone here invest in syfe income+?,btohqsg
See the SingSaver's Exclusive Offer on the card,btohqsg
Can i know why that is recommended ? Will the current fd rate drop ?,btohqsg
If you already have a fixed D and would like to used the current one with a promotional rate say 3.55% then the rate will drop to 2.3% once u use it as collateral for a secured credit card. This was what happen to me and I decided to put a separate 10k at 2.3% and keep the current FD at 3.55% that was placed sometime last year. Not sure if it varies per the knowledge of the counter staff but good to clarify when you are there,btohqsg
Currently have SDD FD with Citibank  completes next month  thinking of placing that in a USD FB (The UOB rates look even better),btohqsg
Thanks. So the welcome gift as indicated in the photo I sent just now is not from singsaver.,btohqsg
you converting to USD to place?,btohqsg
Yes was considering to convert the entire amount from SGD to USD once matured and place it into the FD,btohqsg
oh so if i choose singsaver means no more welcome bonus from citi le ah?,btohqsg
other than the obvious risk(fx which can go either way  you lose sdic protection as well. so in the (unlikely) event uob somehow dies  you wont get your money back because sdic dont cover foreign deposits,btohqsg
this applies to all banks in singapore  so you can look at all the other banks you are comfortable with and compare rates,btohqsg
UOB Stash at 3% (must maintain at or above),btohqsg
You can workaround the salary crediting requirement for UOB One account,btohqsg
Are you able to hit $500 minimum spend?,btohqsg
How? Asking for a friend as he will be working in DBS and his salary have to be credited there,btohqsg
Sorry must be qualify spend exclude utilities  tax  etc..  usual exclusion.If yes for $500 UOB one 5%OCBC 365 4.6%,btohqsg
"So just ""pay"" yourself 1.6k per month? No point in higher or lower right?",btohqsg
right. 1.6k is the only amount to do,btohqsg
$90.50 for concession  more expensive than you tap daily,btohqsg
What are the requirements to have your credit card annual fee waived normally?,btohqsg
Depends on where you stay and how much you want to travel la. If you stay at clementi and study at NUS then maybe dont need concession pass. Plus $90.50 is for both train and bus and some students travel mainly by one mode of transport only.let ppl do their own calculations and decide whether its worth it or not.,btohqsg
Is Altitude AMEX and Altitude VISA $5 000 cap separate?,btohqsg
Depends. Some banks state in their tnc if you spend a certain amount it will be auto waived. Generally if you spend on the card regularly the appeal to waive should be successful also,btohqsg
Does crmc with amaze get cashback on movies at cinema?,btohqsg
90.50 is lesser than what I spend on bus/mrt in a month. Lol. Everyone got different public transport spending.,btohqsg
Every bank and card has different behaviour. Why not state the card so people with ample experience will shareFirst condition. Spend a bit on the card. If the card is just gonna sleep in the drawer preemptively cancel it,btohqsg
