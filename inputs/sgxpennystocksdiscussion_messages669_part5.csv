Moya dark horse of the 'M' counter IMO. Contra pressure done.Keep this one in watchlist closely. Valuation wise  those can hold can really consider to buy and 'chiller' it since Billionaire Salim is in it $0.08x and another big Fund is in it $0.1x. Now  is big discount IMO for this counter which PE is 5-6?Big Bargain especially for those who have holding power.Furthermore they won the tender for Batam water. It shows strong connections they have.,btohqsg
