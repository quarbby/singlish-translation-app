YA HOR WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I TOOK ONE,btohqsg
Are there any unrefurbished c151 or c651 trains left,btohqsg
Tbh I wonder how train enthus get all these figures,btohqsg
C651 was never refurbished successfully in the first place,btohqsg
the 2 that were refurbished got scrapped after testing,btohqsg
oh ya i forgot abt the c651 refurbishment,btohqsg
the refurbished ones kinda sucked anyways,btohqsg
When was the last c151 refurbished?,btohqsg
the new rail financing framework thing,btohqsg
There was a unsolvable fault after refurbishment was completed so all refurbished carraiges were sent to scrapped,btohqsg
NRFF  New Rail Financing idk last F,btohqsg
due to THIS  LTA bought 106 R151s to replace 66 C151s  19 C651s  21 C751Bs,btohqsg
U REP KHI SAY WHAT IS C151,btohqsg
Was that why the remaining C651s haven’t been refurbished?,btohqsg
what the fault is we don't rly know,btohqsg
basically kinda like an audit to see the feasibility of the currently running trains  whether they can run for longer (operating  maintenance cost etc so on) or was it a better deal to scrap them all and get new trains,btohqsg
used to be only 66 R151s to replace 66 C151s,btohqsg
c651 I go in it’s a bit scary honestly,btohqsg
but they extended to 106 R151s to replace the q old C651 (which has q a lot of design inspirations/copied from C151) and the problematic C751Bs,btohqsg
problematic since they had gearbox problems since debut,btohqsg
i heard from my friend  who worked  or probably interned in TWD,btohqsg
C651s were the best rolling stock in terms of reliability,btohqsg
erm u friend might also be me,btohqsg
If one breaks down pretty sure the rest would be affected  and most of the breakdowns seem to be caused by signal issues and not one particular train giving issues,btohqsg
only 2 of them were refurbished,btohqsg
