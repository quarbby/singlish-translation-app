it is not a scam... it is likely one of those where once you start  you cannot get out early without taking a large loss,btohqsg
Don't seem like fixed deposit. Not covered under SDIC. Capital guaranteed only if the bank still exists. ü§£I help you calculate  it's 2.25% p.a EIR. Better to just leave it in Maribank  GXS bank and other fixed deposits. ü§™,btohqsg
Didn't realise that maribank also got their own plunging chicken promo.,btohqsg
Plunging chicken but very mild version,btohqsg

No la. Earmark promo. Since Feb.No need to be fresh funds  as long the money is in the bank  can just earmark.3 months earmark  $40 cash credit for $50k  but EIR only 3.02% p.a. ü§£,btohqsg
Hi  I‚Äôm sorry if this is a basic question. If my SSB next payout date is 1 Aug 2024  with next payout amount of $100  if I were to redeem it early (for example  today 3 July)  will I receive a prorated payout for 1 Aug (less than $100)  or I will not receive any payout at all?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Amaze no limit for fx spend.,btohqsg
Yes there is Fullerton SGD Cash Fund MMF.Note that Buy trades must be Stock/ETF only,btohqsg
It looks to me return is not at a guaranteed rate but only capital guaranteed. It means your deposit of 300k can get zero return as a guaranteed result unless the shop closed. It is not a fixed deposit.,btohqsg
Us dedollarization will take many years but I do think at these prolonged high interest rates  usd will depreciated vs sgd,btohqsg
Guys just FYI I have joined JHsbc ega July promotion  asked customer service and they said only sms is activated the everyday bouns already. I didnt do 5 transactions. As I am aware it only count fresh funds and any funds out of the account within 30days will be count as non fresh hence no point to do such 5x deduction anymore. Correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg

I also like to ask  if i didnt sign up for this month promotion since im on 2 hsbc account  the giro deduction on the account without promotion  all i need to do is the 5 transaction a $2k in to enjoy the 1% cashback on giro right? The 2k in need to stay in the fund or can move out again?,btohqsg
2k can move out. But leave enough for ur giro deduction.,btohqsg
Ok thanks  reading the tnc again. Per the tnc   the 2k can be jz a fast transfer in from non-hsbc correct,btohqsg
Hi  may I ask if purchasing Taka vouchers fulfills the qualifying spend criteria?,btohqsg
The wording quite ‚Äòtricky‚Äô. It‚Äôs not stated that the promo is a fixed deposit  but that it is a promo which a lot of people that‚Äôs doing fixed deposit are interested in  giving the impression that it‚Äôs similar. My guess is it‚Äôs an endowment (similar to Income Gro Capital  Singlife Secure Saver etc.).The $2250 for $100k and $9000 for $200k are paid out at end Dec 2024 and end Jun 2025 respectively? Or at the end of 2.5 years?If former  EIR is 3.7% p.a.If latter  EIR is 3.62% p.a.,btohqsg
Hi all need some help for a new credit card noob here.I just recently applied for the citi rewards + amaze combo.I am a little confused as I have read mixed updates.If I were to go to gaincity tomorrow and use the Amaze + citi combo to pay via the physical Amaze card  would I still eligible for the 10x points?Also does it really convert all amaze transactions to online tansactions making it fool proof to just use the amaze card for all daily expenses such as food and grocery shopping maximizing the rewards?,btohqsg
Yes and yes. Take note of the 1k limit for Amaze domestic spend though  there‚Äôs 1% charge beyond the 1k.,btohqsg
it specifically said capital is guaranteed. It didnotsay return or interest is guaranteed.As SDIC only guarantees $100k  hence  $300k of capital guarantee at the end of 2.5 years obviously is not come from SDIC.,btohqsg
Hi all  for the uob lady's card. If I'm picking a new reward category today (no prior changes in the current quarter) is the change effective immediately? Or is there a waiting period?,btohqsg
