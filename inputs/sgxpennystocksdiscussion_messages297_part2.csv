A moment ah. I sms-ing my masters.,btohqsg
Wah my masters tell me both Ma and Zhang still interested in ICG... but unable to comment further... like bo kong also leh... super jialat and sianz need to seriously consider changing my masters to Jerry's one alr... I see later Intl cement channel got say anything or not...,btohqsg
Why alphie not in group anymore?,btohqsg
Hmm  I find MLMG similar to Alphie except MLMG provides regular updates,btohqsg
Lol you are gif king Sam,btohqsg
For people invested in Intl Cement. Should be the first and best probable explanation thus far. But never state the conclusion/objective of this change... so still for your thoughts.,btohqsg
Victory Gate Ventures Limited (VGVL)‚Äôs subsidiary is International Cement Group (ICG). In layman‚Äôs term  it means that VGVL‚Äôs son is ICG. VGVL has 4.5 billion shares in ICG.Before the transaction  VGVL is owned by Mr Zhang Zeng Tao and Mr Ma Zhaoyang at 70% (3.15 billion shares) and 30% (1.35 billion shares) respectively.After the transaction  Mr Ma Zhaoyang has transferred the entire 30% of his stake (1.35 billion shares) in VGVL to Mr Ma Zhaoyang. This simply meant that Mr Zhang Zeng Tao has 100% stake (4.5 billion shares in VGVL ‚Äì Mr Ma Zhaoyang has relinquished his ownership in VGVL while Mr Zhang Zeng Tao now fully owns VGVL.However  VGVL (also Mr Zhang Zeng Tao) later awarded 1.35 billion shares to Mr Ma Zhaoyang  an amount of shares Mr Ma Zhaoyang initially owned in ICG and therefore this leaves us with no change in effective ownership in ICG by Mr Ma and Mr Zhang.,btohqsg
CSF on ascending triangle. T4 yest saw a slight flush to 41 and then recover back. I foresee some play tml. Hopefully a breakout. Price held well despite T4 and weak market sentiments. BB might be planning for a run to next resistance 47.,btohqsg
Anyone manage to get 41 yesterday? I was sold 100 only grrrr.. wasted my queue!!!,btohqsg
Csf bb keep cha cha 41-45,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt manage to get also. Too fast. The flush then straight buy up. My EP is at 43 and 44.,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs see tml show. Pray BB can play. As of now I think the play is there. Still. My SL 39.,btohqsg
Is gif popular on Edmw also?,btohqsg
Same I also no conclusion. Whhaha,btohqsg
You‚Äôre welcome bro. Hope it can shed some light for those still in CSF.,btohqsg
I think csf steady  should be able to break up the triangle,btohqsg
Today got two batch of big buy up at 43,btohqsg
But I think broader market weak  latest bb didn‚Äôt want to push,btohqsg
I dunno how he can come to this conclusion seriously,btohqsg
Ok if tmr market sentiment good...I may support. Thanks bro,btohqsg
wah boss furion you disagree entirely ah... I still find the explanation ËøòÂ•Ω la cos today's transfer of shares not quite straightforward too.,btohqsg
So complicated mehA and B own company C in 70:30 ratio.C owns 100 share of company DB wants the shares of D. By pro-rate he takes 30 share of D. A now fully owns C since is all his shares (70 shares of D) inside now.Take his stuff walk awayRefer to AOC in ausgroup how Alan Wang took back his stake and everyone else at same time,btohqsg
Why theHe give his stake in victory awayLater victory give him 1b shares...Where‚Äôs the later? It‚Äôs part of the deal,btohqsg
wah ÊûúÁÑ∂ÊòØ furion... this makes a lot of sense.,btohqsg
Shld just say this in the 1st place ...save more time for netflix,btohqsg
Viot.nasdaq is fast gaining. Like ifast. Just sharing.,btohqsg
I read the explanation I can watch alice halfway again,btohqsg
Wa this really secret to success man,btohqsg
Act blur till cannot act. Then hoot a few,btohqsg
MT continue to Chiong for next few days! Pray for dividend!‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
They say hire based on bachelor,btohqsg

Ya HR is ka ki lang,btohqsg
so every new coin release will require solar farm to power their blockchain... can invest in energy stocks... probably why gov. wanna buy electricity from m'sia? ü§î,btohqsg
