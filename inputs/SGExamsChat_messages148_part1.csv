Interesting topic ive popped myself into,btohqsg
People born on or after 2000,btohqsg
What does the SIA staff say when he needs to pass?,btohqsg
Usually they will open up the thing automatically  except immigration,btohqsg
But the first 2 numbers r not the date of birth,btohqsg
But the president apparently doesn't need an NRIC,btohqsg
She didn't even sing the anthem in the national day celebrations.,btohqsg
Looks like an auctioned car plate number,btohqsg
Hahaha. But difficult for the secretary sometimes as they have to count 6 zeros after the S,btohqsg
Yeah like counting the number of rooftops in the insignia of warrant officers,btohqsg
At least the Singapore PM and the diplomats uses this  not an ordinary passport,btohqsg
I don't even know what that represents  apart from some rank,btohqsg
All the rank insignia have informal names,btohqsg
Like junior officers' ranks are called kit kats,btohqsg
So to be an officer you need a PES A? Does the PES status have anything to do with promotion (or whatever it's called)?,btohqsg
A or B1  if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Those in NCC? White Kit Kat,btohqsg
Ur PES does affect your career,btohqsg
Do you think I'm male or female?,btohqsg
You’re asking about NS so probably female,btohqsg
Otherwise why would a female be so interested in NS?,btohqsg
Quite a few women are interested in a career in SAF,btohqsg
U wanna have some triple arrow volley,btohqsg
How do I make my pw group bonded,btohqsg
It's a joke  the navy sent me something asking me to consider joining them after I get PES F,btohqsg
I accidentally delay the bonding session by 9 months,btohqsg
I call for meeting and force them to attend and listen,btohqsg
Why go for SG diplo passport when you can go for UN Red Document,btohqsg
I think at this point u just try to finish ur pw stuff,btohqsg
Still too watered down for a 4-year course,btohqsg
No need to do bonding or wadever,btohqsg
And then I just do all the work for them,btohqsg
The red laissez-passer haha. I've seen the blue one in pyongyang,btohqsg
Held by a vietnamese. And the wife spoke very good french,btohqsg
If you've seen the red one then >_________>,btohqsg
They sent my batch that too,btohqsg
It was really cool how they got an alumnus of your school to write a letter to u,btohqsg
Not sure how exclusive the red ones are  but I assume heads of UN offices/programmes will have them,btohqsg
Have you been assigned a PES status?,btohqsg
If you have been through everything is there a point knowing?,btohqsg
No I haven't been through everything,btohqsg
MINDEF doesn't release an official reason  right? So I wouldn't know what they considered,btohqsg
You can see the medical report,btohqsg
But they said I need to request it,btohqsg
Maybe things changed since ur time,btohqsg
They said do you want it for court case etc,btohqsg
Although i have the official exemption letter without any reason given,btohqsg
But even if u don’t have an official reason  most people have a pretty good idea of y they have their PES I believe,btohqsg
Like if u declared a medical condition then that’s probably why you got PES this PES that,btohqsg
They don't  but obviously it's a function of what you told them,btohqsg
