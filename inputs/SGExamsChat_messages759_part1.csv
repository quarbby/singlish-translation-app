Like Iâ€™m referring ur sch mates who transfer from MI to JC  if they could have retook some o level subjects while in Mi they couldâ€™ve used those scores to jae into a better jc,btohqsg
be grabfood delivery yk that guy say make 5k,btohqsg
speaking of which i shld get supper,btohqsg
this guy is damn bipolar  he can argue against smth then later change his words and pretend he never see properly,btohqsg
wah i legit gg to leave this chat imagine they all legit lurk this channel then search thru my msgs,btohqsg
they have the score to go JC,btohqsg
Then when delivery accident your leg kena bang and disabled u forced to retire with no money wonder what went wrong,btohqsg
ownself nvr buy insurance my problem or the guy problem,btohqsg
gig job but don't spend the money to protect youself,btohqsg
atp you need to defend for yourself,btohqsg
i keep seeing those monks that have to vote to go into the thai army,btohqsg
Bro I mean by right that's why gig jobs are so attractive,btohqsg
their face after they get selected,btohqsg
Short term ok u take the money hit and run,btohqsg
anyways imma sleep I can't take this shit anymore,btohqsg
Ya but I mean if they suddenly wanted to transfer they might have wanted to retake some o level subjects so can go into a jc with better score,btohqsg
Long term bro gg gig jobs cannot do long term one,btohqsg
my uncle drive grab taxi also make 4-5k...be it the maintenance of a bike is lesser,btohqsg
atb for tmr rose  please get through the day without getting beaten up,btohqsg
So thatâ€™s why I say itâ€™s unfortunate they donâ€™t have the option cos they canâ€™t register while in MI,btohqsg
If my grandmother had wheels she would have been a bike,btohqsg
they're burnt out by structured curriculum in school - they won't do better in an unstructured  self-motivated curriculum to do private Os,btohqsg
grab taxi need >26 or smth dumb,btohqsg
i wanted to drive grab while waiting for uni,btohqsg
idk if i can even get through tmr without sleeping and complaining for the 100000th time,btohqsg
U making comparison to different gigs wdf bro,btohqsg
my class is so antisocial with the introverts bro,btohqsg
Hmm yes but like since o level can combine 2 years  if they focus all their energies into improving their score for 1-2 subjects I think they will actually improve,btohqsg
yea true..thats why i did say the maintenance has to be taken into account,btohqsg
Hello uncle irwen holland village please,btohqsg
Iâ€™m thinking if I should take MC,btohqsg
Scdf I have to be careful not to take more than 30 in a calendar year,btohqsg
8hrs under hot sun vs 8hrs in aircon...i think in sg weather and context  its clear..too bad theres a age requirement,btohqsg
Nah I will go polyclinic if I need,btohqsg
plus because of our size...a $50 fare does not take 2-3hrs to accomplish,btohqsg
not an eventuality - if i were a teacher i wld discourage my students from doing that but instead try to help them be better at their current subjects,btohqsg
Iâ€™m referring to your sch mates who wanted to transfer lol. Since they dead set on leaving MI they might have wanted to retake if they could to just go to a better JC,btohqsg
But then also it may have been too late by the time they decided to leave,btohqsg
nah idt they wldve wanted to either,btohqsg
If I were a teacher I would say do as I say not as I do,btohqsg
@esch123japanese stall finally opened for 2-3 weeks in a row,btohqsg
