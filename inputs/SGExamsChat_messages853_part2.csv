I think you'll still have some bde but much lesser,btohqsg
but BDE are the SU right,btohqsg
but all my BDE is used for the second major alt,btohqsg
oh if udh BDE then means u can't SU any mods,btohqsg
but its all on data analytics,btohqsg
cause i second major data analytics,btohqsg
For 2nd major  can only su up to 12 aus,btohqsg
As long as they are not part of core,btohqsg
I assume you didnt know about flexible grading option too?,btohqsg
other courses have how many su,btohqsg
Like it just mean for your 2nd majors stuff overall can su 12 aus,btohqsg
In 2024  they decided to allow everyone to see grades first and then su,btohqsg
eh single major also 12 leh,btohqsg
Oh. That means most likely overall for single major can su up to 12 aus oso,btohqsg
for academics related qns and the intricacies of each course,btohqsg
btr to ask the profs and admission officers during open house,btohqsg
I nvr dare to overload HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
could have overloaded 1 mod but I scare I die,btohqsg
i doing max load this sem,btohqsg
if im not wrong single = double major in terms of au,btohqsg
it's just that for double major your bde is replaced with your second major modules,btohqsg
Don't worry i taking 19 au,btohqsg
i still dont get why second major is considered overload,btohqsg
analogue  digital  java and 3 cc technically,btohqsg
idt 2nd major is necessarily consideredoverload,btohqsg
you might just be doing higher load than others,btohqsg
what do yall learn in analogue and digital anw,btohqsg
why do you need an entire course for that,btohqsg
who y1 learn this kinda shit  even eee don't,btohqsg
they think you can do it,btohqsg
i only have 4 AUs of BDE i'm taking in school,btohqsg
ye same  I took last sem alr,btohqsg
gonna do mooc for the rest,btohqsg
Basically whatever uw from the shit long list of mods,btohqsg
hi guys ive some questions... could you help me with it?,btohqsg
"1. Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDE):a. From my understanding  BDE courses are often graded as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U). For the second major in Data Analytics  I do not have the freedom to select other BDE courses and must follow the prescribed second major structure. Could you confirm if these BDE courses under the second major will still be graded S/U?b. I noticed that the total Academic Units (AU) for CCEB (single major) and CCEB + Data Analytics (second major) are similar. Despite this  I often hear that pursuing a double major significantly increases the workload. Could you explain why this is the case?2. Course Registration (STARS):a. Will I need to undergo the ""STARS Wars"" process to register for the second major courses in Data Analytics?3. Comparison Between Single and Double Major Programs:a. Could you provide a detailed comparison between the CCEB (single major) program and CCEB with a second major in Data Analytics in terms of:b. Total number of AUs required.c. How BDE courses are structured (i.e.  does the second major in Data Analytics fully replace my BDE requirements  and are they graded S/U?).4. Career Prospects:a. In terms of employability  how would I fare as a CCEB graduate with a second major in Data Analytics compared to students from the School of Computing with a more niche major? I’ve heard that employers may favor Computing students for certain roles.5. General Insights on Single vs. Double Major:a. I came across the idea that a single major allows one to be highly specialized in one field  while a double major provides broader knowledge in two fields. Given this  I have some concerns:b. Why is a double major perceived to be more stressful if the focus is broader rather than niche?c. Why do double major students typically earn a higher initial salary compared to single major students  who presumably have deeper expertise in one area?",btohqsg
wow you are really overthinking a lot,btohqsg
1a) No  they are letter graded. S/U only apply if you apply the BDE as FGO. For 2nd major  you are required to use you BDE credits. However  12AU of those credits used for 2nd major can be S/U.,btohqsg
what job prospect do u think i suit then?,btohqsg
also not all AUs are created equal. 3 AUs in one major isn’t the same workload as in another major,btohqsg
so are the number of AU that I can get S/U same for double and single major in NTU?,btohqsg
then what do ppl mean by: second major is more stress  when its all the same,btohqsg
1b) The simplest explanation to explain single  double major and second major is basicallly a cake.A single major = 1 cakeA double major = 2 cakeA single major + 2nd major = 1 and a half cakesA single major + minor = 1 and a quarter of cakes.When I mean cake  assume 1 cake = number of courses taken by a single major you are required to take.In some cases  the modules may overlap  but roughly this is the simplest analogy I can give. It is just the number of courses/AUs.,btohqsg
yea i understand..im thinking between 1 cake and 1 1/2 cake,btohqsg
as in the total number of AU  and the S/U I can get,btohqsg
Of course there are rare cases od single major + 2nd major + minor.,btohqsg
And then there are also cases of single major + 2 minors,btohqsg
You have more core modules to clear while other people can explore more options with their BDE (I believe),btohqsg
from what i see now  its like: second major is exactly the same as single major just that the electives are chosen. grade wise its all the same.so why ppl don't choose second major?,btohqsg
nah i js thinking between single major  and second major.,btohqsg
