not really lehtp law kinda skews towards paralegal and admin  so as far as that goes unless uâ€™re literally the creme de la creme and somehow make it to a law degree then yeah,btohqsg
Not 100% since it's not medicine but A level has better chances .,btohqsg
Honestly   if you're interested in law and going to poly  just take another course like IT or smth then score well and apply to law school in uni with a good gpa and portfolio.,btohqsg

Yijc teachers are quite willing for consultation. Sci dept I wld say is quite good but not say like very very good. The lecture notes for science and math are not very wordy. Have heard some say yijc tutorials are ok.Research wise/science opportunities typically more to those who score quite high in Os (like A*Star research) or during mid term J1. So not very broad. In terms of sch culture  we do have certain sch events that are quite fun but the culture is pretty slack. There isnt much sch spirit plus passing rates are not so high. (Though if you study hard enuf  possible to score well for A levels). The students arent so motivated mostly because some arent very sure of what to do  but wld recommend setting a plan B in case.,btohqsg
Damn random but i recalled one of the uni staff administrators say that YI is kinda boring so...yea...,btohqsg

Poly or alevels !ðŸ˜­I got L1R4 of 14 and L1R5 of 22 for my O-Levels. My original plan was to do JC and take A-Levels  but now  since Iâ€™m unable to meet the raw 20 points needed for JC  I feel stuck about what I should do. Iâ€™ve always wanted to pursue dentistry  and Iâ€™ve heard that A-Levels is the right route for that. Iâ€™m turning 18 this year  and I could still go for MI to give my goals a shot  but I feel very pressured since Iâ€™m slightly older than the usual batch entering. Iâ€™m not entirely sure about MI and whether itâ€™s the right choice for me. Iâ€™m also uncertain about whether I will do well in the A-Level exams eventually. Is poly a safer choice? ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
study hard in ite and get good gpa to come to poly,btohqsg

"there's no such thing as a systematic ""right"" routeyes  studying in jc for As can allow an easier push to uniand yes  studying in jc ks said to be usually for those ppl who aren't sure of what they want to do aft  sec schits more of doing what u  know (at least feel) what's best for u",btohqsg
In places like China  they have to study for A levels equivalent   they called it National College entrance exam and that's the only feasible option they have,btohqsg
SG system allows setbacks   for varying type of schools created for wider range of scores,btohqsg
