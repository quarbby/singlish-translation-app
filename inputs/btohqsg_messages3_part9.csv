If u see this the playground just TOP but blocks were TOP long ago,btohqsg
So some might see 100%  havent collect key. Cos hdb release in batches de,btohqsg
yeah I have checked the BCA website and the TOP was issued in January though the progress bar is shown at 100% on BTOHQ recently,btohqsg
Than still need few weeks bah to months,btohqsg
Some also might see 95% collect keys haha,btohqsg
but once TOP issued  means can get keys right,btohqsg
See how the contractor want to submit for TOP,btohqsg

Such units are considered as one and have one address  utility meter and so on.eg. a 3+3 is created by combining (2) 3-rm units and building a passageway through.Not all flat types exist in each estate  and a 4 ‘A’ layout in one estate might differ from another.Also  floor area are estimates as newer flats are generally smaller  while upgrading of older flats would have added additional rooms/balcony/toilet.,btohqsg
Hi!Seeking your kind opinion. Should I and my partner BTO or purchase resale?Our total income doesn’t give us any BTO grants plus the waiting time of 5 years. We’re currently renting  so rental cost is a factor too while waiting. Resale on the other hand not very cheap.Given our situation  any helpful points or comments for us?Many thanks!!,btohqsg

Can I ask! If the bto results no queue number will you be informed? 😨,btohqsg
Hello  may i check  my husband will be going away overseas for a month (plus quarantine it’s 6-7 weeks) he’ll be away to be exact. On the BTO page it states that our project is 100% completed so we’re afraid we’ll receive the letter for collection of key when he’s away. Can anyone advise what he need to do or prepare so that i can collect it on behalf of both of us?,btohqsg
I read up on hdb that we need a solicitor to prepare a POA but im guessing we need costs to that and what if we didn’t receive hdb better during time while he’s away- then waste money😂,btohqsg
Will probably call in on Monday for more info.,btohqsg

Waterway Sunrise 2 - Ballot on feb 2017 but may only get keys sometime in 2023,btohqsg
BTO sure affordable  sure make money when sell after MOP  but the wait.... zzzzzzzzzzzzz,btohqsg
there are several mechanisms in place to prevent people form gaming the system. eg.- young couples got time to wait  but not enough money- older folks  got money to buy expensive units  but no time to wait.- on top of these considerations  some lower units are built with balcony  tall units without. location alsoall in all  whatever good that buyers can think of  HDB would have put a restrainer to it,btohqsg
