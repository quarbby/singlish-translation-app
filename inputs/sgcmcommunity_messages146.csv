Thanks for sharing sir. Good lesson for all.,btohqsg
I can replace that with an rx8 or RX7,btohqsg
I know many owners who drive around with spare engine oil in their boots and they are not BMW drivers!!! 😬😬😬😬😬,btohqsg
But actually dream house looks like that. With space for cars to park and to look at them every morning over breakfast,btohqsg
Idk lah but I feel conti cars tend to leak,btohqsg
Heavy foot  timeliness of sorting out regular wear and tear issues etc etc,btohqsg
Plus tend to be more complicated  high temps  high pressures for performance reasons etc,btohqsg
Squeezing more out of the car puts more stress on the system so….,btohqsg
I think your first car should be a bmw,btohqsg
you mod for performance you live with the consequences,btohqsg
Or maybe ppl shud do preventive maintenance,btohqsg
Feel like SG dont have this culture,btohqsg
A lot here assume that they don’t need to do this cause of how small Singapore is 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Yeah then go msia break down,btohqsg
Hamilton Scott? Pretty nice house with car lift to your house,btohqsg
That time I saw 3 cars broke down while in the jam on the bridge,btohqsg
Like some people will buy honda instead of bmw,btohqsg
My choice to be poor 😫,btohqsg
Ehh btw can bring groceries out of MY?,btohqsg
I read max is like 100rm worth only leh,btohqsg
Can but they got a weird law about cooking oil,btohqsg
U exit sg more than 48hrs alr,btohqsg
Either 1 or 2 per pax,btohqsg
Ahh 48 hour is what rule,btohqsg
Swee then I buy 2 big bottles of cooking oil,btohqsg
Why U need cooking oil tho,btohqsg
If you drop your food  within 48hrs you still can pick up and eat,btohqsg
I tot u dont cook one,btohqsg
He TOLD ME HE DOESNT COOK,btohqsg
He TELL ME WIFE DOESNT COOK ALSO,btohqsg
I don’t know la  but to make it worth lo  probably donate to shelter or what,btohqsg
I feel buey song not to utilise it if got limit,btohqsg
How much is it over there,btohqsg
Last I remember almost same as sg,btohqsg
LOLOL I don’t know leh  I haven’t go market yet  eating at Aeon,btohqsg
But I get back to you on the price,btohqsg
Major misconception. Because our driving pattern is low distance  high cycle driving. Which means the car is subject to constant hot/cool down situation which accelerates thermal degradation on material.,btohqsg
Precisely cus we move so little we get more wear n tear on the machinery,btohqsg
No wonder all the 🇩🇪 brands all susceptible to issues.,btohqsg
They are not built for such things,btohqsg
Since ww2 german engines very hard to maintain,btohqsg
Built for perpetual motion to keep it running I guess,btohqsg
Sure ah? Cuz I read 2 website 1 say 1 litre 1 say 2 litre,btohqsg
LOL woiiii Mai like that leh,btohqsg
If cannot just drink on the spot,btohqsg
This 2 bottles of 5 litre each leh,btohqsg
Just don’t 2L + 1 whole large pack of cigarettes,btohqsg
I don’t think they will ka chiao you over that lah,btohqsg
All the queue cutter appear liao,btohqsg
Because most people don't care about their cars enough to learn a bit about them,btohqsg
Got ambient light  big screen  badge. Lai I will pay 300k for it,btohqsg
That's the attitude we live with,btohqsg
My colleague say he gna tune the car,btohqsg
Expected changes to torque and hp?,btohqsg
Then I ask remember take pic of the chart,btohqsg
Not as nice  landed with living room as the garage even better,btohqsg
then I say: oh rmb do more maintenance  cus once u up is high chance more wear n tear  and also need watch the fc. Some i heard tune until fc single digit,btohqsg
Yeah a lot of people half knowledge or chop carrot by workshop,btohqsg
But half the time the tune is not optimized for the owner's driving style and Singapore driving conditions,btohqsg
And they don't know what fuel grade to pump based on the tune,btohqsg
Tuning not necessarily got chart one,btohqsg
The chart only if they Dyno the car,btohqsg
Or if it's a piggyback with a base chart that they send to everyone,btohqsg
Dyno isn’t worth if you’re not chasing power anyways,btohqsg
Do on the road tuning more better,btohqsg
Eh up 20 not so bad sia for vios,btohqsg
The fact that he ask me: what chart,btohqsg
<ADV> Go 15km further with the New & Improved Shell Fuels and enjoy an additional 3% direct discount with HSBC credit cards in the month of May. Enjoy up to 24% fuel savings today! Conditions apply. Unsub  manage settings in app,btohqsg
Maybe just want pops and bangs,btohqsg
I mix w msia caltex 97,btohqsg
He said 15 inch rims he say wanna add bbk,btohqsg
Oh I tot shell got UOB,btohqsg
that's why sg workshops good business,btohqsg
too many people little to no knowledge,btohqsg
sometimes don't even need workshop to poison  your friend will poison you,btohqsg
you need cool heads as friends,btohqsg
I heard from sgrc tuas no check HAHHA,btohqsg
This is why sgcm has u,btohqsg
actually i also quite itchy backside one,btohqsg
but i've learnt over time what is the important things to mod hahahha,btohqsg
like going fast no point  zoom zoom speed ticket only  and meet the next red light,btohqsg
Ltr i see one w High GT wing sure its u alr,btohqsg
the day i buy a corolla is the day i stop modding my rides liao,btohqsg
Update us what’s the time to clear on the way back haha,btohqsg
Hahaha yeah been a bus’s few weeks/mths,btohqsg
Saw your car at the previous cars n kopi,btohqsg
Hopefully can catch you on the next one,btohqsg
Sure man. My schedule freed up recently.have been to a few meets lately,btohqsg
Is it when you drive at fast speed   petrol consumption lower ?,btohqsg
it all boils down to your driving habits,btohqsg
Lesser stop and start  better fuel consumption,btohqsg
I manage to hit 500km in my fd2 and used half only LOL during my Malacca trip,btohqsg
But in sg i barely hit 400,btohqsg
FC is reliant on you being gentle on the brakes  the accelerator  and anticipating driving conditions like traffic lights etc so you let off the gas and coast,btohqsg
I clock 1000km with 1 full tank,btohqsg
so if anyone tells you tuning your car can get better FC it's all a load of bull,btohqsg
theoretically you can.... but the lengths that you go to  the drives will suck too,btohqsg
Does your brake pads fade faster if u brake later?,btohqsg
Or the amount of wear is the same if u double the braking distance,btohqsg
does peeling skin peel faster if you rub harder?,btohqsg
Skin does peel faster. But the amount of peel is it the same,btohqsg
If say I rub at 50% speed but double the amount of time,btohqsg
you mean if the rate of wear is proportional?,btohqsg
Oh that the time to come back?,btohqsg
I was contemplating whether to go  but see the estimated time to come back I gave up,btohqsg
Is sirocco still worth buying for 2nd hand?,btohqsg
Probably 4-5 hands by now. Haha but find one that has the gearbox rebuilt,btohqsg
Cos any other unit would probably require it in their lifetime,btohqsg
Or buy the manual scirocco r,btohqsg
I would recommend the 86/brz over the roc even though it’s more exp,btohqsg
More street cred and more reliable too,btohqsg
My single friend wanna buy la. She like it,btohqsg
Get the 2.0 instead of the 1.4,btohqsg
ask your single friend to buy my mx-5,btohqsg
Haha okay I got a joke abt scirocco,btohqsg
Scirocco shud change to Off peak car. Monday to fri leave in workshop. Weekend then drive,btohqsg
He got a response from you!!!!!,btohqsg
Gti mk7.5 or audi a4 2.0t?,btohqsg
Or throw nasi padang at me,btohqsg

Looking forward to Audi A4 baby seats in 9 months time,btohqsg
Aren't you already a multi billionaire who drives to Thailand at 200kmh with no seatbelts in an x6m,btohqsg
I think that's a question you should ask the man in the mirror,btohqsg
Should someone tell him the purpose of this group 🤔,btohqsg
We still waiting for his photo,btohqsg
If you call having a car that gives you joy  having a partner for life being a slave,btohqsg
You might need to rethink life,btohqsg
Of course overspending might make you run from paycheck to paycheck to pay off dues,btohqsg
/reportinappropriate comments inside a car grp HAHHA,btohqsg
I'm guessing you're lonely and never felt the feeling of love,btohqsg
Hope not lehh  I haven’t enjoy enough,btohqsg
You really need to go out and enjoy life,btohqsg
Why worry and think so much?,btohqsg
Jovi Tani managed TO GET IT TO VERTICAL PARK AT MY HOUSE,btohqsg
I’m not a billionaire but I love my car and my partner and I’m very happy with life. If you call that being a slave to life  then so be it,btohqsg
@arnavguliani@historyofmanare you guys affected by me being happy with cars? 🤔,btohqsg
I think not used to MY food GG  after every meal there my stomach cramp up,btohqsg
Your problem 🤪 you wanna be in debt with a nice car I will also support,btohqsg
i mean sometimes we seem to forget,btohqsg
We are in here for a good time not a long time,btohqsg
Yes in SG car is expensive,btohqsg
That’s why I should buy the RS6,btohqsg
But it doesnt bring me as much Joy vs doing other stuff,btohqsg
Eh i eat okay and I got weak stomach leh. Maybe u not used to it yet,btohqsg
Eat grass nvm  as long got style,btohqsg
Wa A part of me shud say No but the other part says GO FOR IT,btohqsg
Yeah my golf the high spec one,btohqsg

I think most of us here took a car loan  which is no big deal if you can pay it lol,btohqsg
My A4 2021  but got no park assist meanwhile some old golf gets it,btohqsg
Yeap. I think loans r quite common,btohqsg
Yes  I am affected because I am happy that you are happy,btohqsg
Like for a big ticket item,btohqsg
Your A4 is PA bogo spec,btohqsg
Audi bring in the car but with low spec,btohqsg
Got many options but they never get any of the good stuff,btohqsg
My repayment is less than 1/5 of my salary  no shame taking a loan?I take house loan  reno loan  car loan but it’s all by choice  I took it because I know my money can earn me more than what I lose in interest,btohqsg
I JUST STEP BRAKE N CHANGE GEAR ONLY,btohqsg
My A3 did not come with android auto also,btohqsg

Wkwkwk you all say until like that I damn sad  but true la 35 tfsi seriously,btohqsg
Eh teach me how invest leh. My portfolio 20 yrs ltr then take out one,btohqsg
When I’m out of job  I still have my side line? Even if my side line fails  I can literally pay them off?,btohqsg
I can literally pay them off? Read last sentence leh,btohqsg
And sell off car la worse comes to worse,btohqsg
Worse case scenario is you liquidate your assets lor,btohqsg
Because he earns more if he put the money somewhere else,btohqsg
was looking at cpf investments earlier on as well,btohqsg
LOL judging by that  I don’t think you know enough to be talking sh1t to him,btohqsg

Comparison is the thief of joy,btohqsg
Just some people don’t know where their line is  need to be humbled,btohqsg
Oh hello there  you found this account to support yourself as well,btohqsg
Pak Mood with the wise words,btohqsg
The time and money he spends,btohqsg
Hahaha no lah cause I once also jealous of everyone,btohqsg
Then like it made me so miserable,btohqsg
I notice Hor  people don’t like go tuas ah?,btohqsg
Tuas is far from the usual places people go,btohqsg
and i stay central with a direct expressway,btohqsg
But tuas is fun to zoom,btohqsg
Hanor and wen I enter never check petrol gauge  when exit never check boot,btohqsg
er but tuas fuel check more common,btohqsg
I think maybe everyday I can go in pump petrol sia since CCK near tuas,btohqsg
usually if too busy they dont check,btohqsg
like eg if tuas check 5 times  woodlands 3 times within the week,btohqsg
but by right come in shud just at least open every boot to see,btohqsg
I wouldn’t consider the time I enter and came out to be “busy” leh  short queue 30-40 min in out,btohqsg
usually if 5 mins pass custom then got fc one leh,btohqsg
LOL got 5 min thru one ah?,btohqsg
maybe quota for that month nvr hit more strict,btohqsg
but my boot empty cus new car,btohqsg
I still think the 10 litre oil might kena,btohqsg
But waa damn shiok even the vpower racing petrol is like $50 full tank,btohqsg
It's not preferred because those who want to get groceries  wash  food or go home in JB prefer woodlands,btohqsg
i 97 alr $50 full tank leh,btohqsg
Since it opens into the city,btohqsg
Idk leh I paid the guy 160rm when I came back,btohqsg
I've never come back without having the small check of boot while queueing,btohqsg
Can speed all the way to Bukit Indah Aeon,btohqsg
Your tank sure have fuel left,btohqsg
V power racing is about 5.5rm/L,btohqsg
Hmm then probably left like half tank or abit less,btohqsg
Then how you say $50 full tank boss 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
Btw do you usually tip the petrol station guy and how much,btohqsg
Idk leh I today too excited to come back with my car filled,btohqsg

For me I usually fill the fuel myself,btohqsg
Caltex ksl is u ownself pump one,btohqsg
Literally to everyone  from petrol kiosk  to valet to restaurant,btohqsg
Just call them to authorize the fill and pay cash,btohqsg
Then the night shift guy rmbs me,btohqsg
Shake car can get extra how much petrol?,btohqsg
I saw someone drive up a brick leh,btohqsg
IF UR TANK IS 54 litres,btohqsg
it shud only BE 54 litres,btohqsg
Nope  I only fill upto auto cut,btohqsg
NO WAY U GONNA GET 55littes,btohqsg
But maybe cut off at 50 litre?,btohqsg
I’ve said this before and I’ll said it again,btohqsg
Common sense not so common now,btohqsg
The extra space is meant for ur fuel to expand AND CONTRACT,btohqsg
Must fill to brim HAHAHAHA to the 54 litre,btohqsg
Btw in MSIA 5Rm To them is 5 SGD to us,btohqsg
Either the $ or L need to be nice number,btohqsg
Same I let it auto cut,btohqsg
I will see if can squeeze abit more to a whole number,btohqsg
Ooo will keep that in mind,btohqsg
Their pump attendant earn arnd the same as us,btohqsg

Why no buy leh  A4 and A4 avant same same but feel like I need more practicality out of the car  but if buy Q3 the boot will be smaller.A5 can consider but might as well go for Avant,btohqsg
I’m not even good with my mother tongue  how to learn another language LOL,btohqsg
Maybe you talent lies beyond your mother tongue,btohqsg
Then should have bought the avant in the first place,btohqsg
How much money are you going to be losing,btohqsg

It felt like kena “talik back” that kind of feeling,btohqsg
Meaning down from 3rd to 2nd gear,btohqsg
I not very good with tech terms,btohqsg
Before you let go of your clutch  hit the pedal abit to increase the rpm,btohqsg
I only do general servicing leh…so I dunno if the workshop guys got change or not,btohqsg
I think it happened after the last servicing,btohqsg
Ask them if they change your atf fluid,btohqsg
Any indicator to see if needs to be changed?,btohqsg
Or I have to drag it to the workshop for a check,btohqsg
Up gear or stopping no issue,btohqsg
But if reducing speed or slow down…can feel it,btohqsg
Just get it check when you can,btohqsg
Machiam like “anti gravity” like that,btohqsg
Like rough j erk forward when downshift?,btohqsg
It’s not rough but enuff to notice,btohqsg
Yeah just get your gearbox checked,btohqsg
I starting to fall in love with it,btohqsg
It might also be the adaptive values for the transmission need to reset. It might have adapted for something odd in the style of your drives. Do you use paddle shifters? Or do you have shifters?,btohqsg
