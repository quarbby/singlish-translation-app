and i rmb there were alot of people that sign,btohqsg
Even the 377a one worked coz lawyers actually went to fight the case,btohqsg
Get naz out of sg lmfao what about that,btohqsg
Uhhh got a few pertaining sch before also,btohqsg
There was one on spca ?Â¿ or some other animals related shit,btohqsg
Unless localised this will never work,btohqsg
Petitions by non-powerful people* don't work,btohqsg
Have you tried being more powerful?,btohqsg
is there a way to unsupport it,btohqsg
inb4 sgexams becoming a student union and getting shut down by the government for unlawful assembly,btohqsg
wait i mixed it up with the national service riots in the same year of 1954,btohqsg
Who back to school next week?,btohqsg
unpopular opinion  but they've already contributed to the economy by studying here. they chose to study here  and they're to a certain extent also competing with local students in school. the govt doesn't have any incentive to help them. if their own govt dw to help them  why shld we,btohqsg
I can't tell if Kueh raging,btohqsg
Why the caps on Dir Vecs,btohqsg
Why is this unpopular lol  this is popular,btohqsg
it's unpopular amongst the foreign students i guess,btohqsg
they come here by choice to get a better education  so idk why they expect the govt to help them,btohqsg
they're kind of in a tight spot tbh,btohqsg
cause they're overseas their own government wont help them,btohqsg
cause they're foreign the local government wont help them,btohqsg
Seems like education not very good if they can't think so far/s,btohqsg
(if you're a foreigner who migrated here and intend to get citizen status but have yet to get it  that's a diff story),btohqsg
Eh but it's always been like this for foreign students. If you go to US/UK/whatever top-Uni you will have to break through a lot of stuff,btohqsg
its a very shit position btw,btohqsg
But I think government should help them a little bit,btohqsg
"something something ""basically a citizen in every way except on paper""",btohqsg
I more surprised that apparently people commented in support of it on LinkedIn,btohqsg
How? It's going to be politically unpopular,btohqsg
Scholarships  we given them already but now is COVID  different crisis,btohqsg
I'd rather the govt spend $ on migrant workers than foreign students,btohqsg
If they are keen to be part of us  we should help them a little at least,btohqsg
Their political budget not as infinite as their financial budget,btohqsg
coming here for an education isn't wanting to be part of us imoagain  if they intend to get citizen status then it's a diff story,btohqsg
You need to be a tax-paying resident,btohqsg
Once you are a tax-payer WEW citizenship quite easy,btohqsg
Maybe reciprocity? See how Singaporeans are treated overseas. If given help also  then we should help them,btohqsg
BTW SG's non-0% income tax bracket is like 25k  and it's not always trivial for people to get >2k in pay so yeah,btohqsg
i doubt govts are helping singaporeans overseas tbh,btohqsg
literally no incentive for any govt to help a foreign student,btohqsg
lots of people my family know would beg to differ,btohqsg
Then the principle of reciprocity applies and we dont have to help them :D,btohqsg
Wait did they grow up here or elsewhere,btohqsg
I guess my social group only grew up here,btohqsg
"spouting shit like ""citizenship quotas"" to explain why they didnt get citizenship",btohqsg
even so  national interests is still more important than principle of reciprocity,btohqsg
and then the whole family doesnt get,btohqsg
eventually  they give up and run back to india,btohqsg
Liddat the children can get citizenship if they are a tax-resident  parents are judged separately,btohqsg
We're a very rich country and so we can afford to help them like how we help the migrant workers,btohqsg
