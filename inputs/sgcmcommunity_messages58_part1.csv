Saw this at City Square  Cartimes offering 10 years warranty for new cars,btohqsg
Looks like you were there pretty early. The shops in the mall haven't even opened yet - J,btohqsg
I think all the bigger dealers have started offering 10 year warranty to lock people into servicing at their workshops,btohqsg
And they offer only for engine and gearbox which  if maintained well enough  are unlikely to fail,btohqsg
Smart business tactic to drive up both workshop business and give people another carrot when buying a car,btohqsg
Today I learned that bridgestone used to manufactures tyres in sg,btohqsg

Yeah suddenly all these spam accounts start popping out from nowhere - J,btohqsg
Good for attracting first timers but if handled poorly would lead to increased complaints due to buyers unclear of how the warranty actually works,btohqsg
Yuppp  but with a first timer who doesn't know too much  they are pretty successful at making enough money,btohqsg
That's how C&C has been running with the mercs,btohqsg
"Almost all of the regular Mercedes owners I have spoken to say that they buy mercs for the 10 year warranty and have been repeat buyers. They trust the ""process"" and will never go to an independent workshop for service to preserve their warranty. (non regular refers to those who are enthusiasts and like fiddling with their car)",btohqsg
Their reasoning is that they believe independent shops will not be able to maintain the car as well and/or not provide support when the engine/transmission dies,btohqsg
Which is very unlikely in the case of modern cara anyway,btohqsg

This I agree also. It's like#我们不一样lol and there's a believe that these are built to run with originals and not OEMs or refurbished parts,btohqsg
impressed with how precisely they fit it without falling off on the other side,btohqsg
original parts are also OEM parts packaged in Mercedes box😂😂,btohqsg
don't forget the occasional Mercedes logo stamped on the parts themselves 😁😁,btohqsg
like I know some Toyota n lexus share exactly the same parts . the same part packed in Toyota box n the one packed in lexus box price will differ alot.its branding😂,btohqsg
For vw/audi/skoda/seat  same part numbers n pricing generically same.,btohqsg
wahahahahaa how to protect against dings,btohqsg
