Hi guys  just started FT work this month and about to open a UOB one savings account. ðŸ˜„Is there always a promotion for opening a uob one savings account or just this time only? What are the previous promos before this one?Should I wait to open on 1 Aug (if there's a new promotion) or just quickly open before 31 july before this promo ends. (I dont really use lazada hence the hesitation),btohqsg
Prob standard chartered as I forgot I have a Citibank joint account already so Iâ€™m not considered new to bank,btohqsg
I have these very strange transactions from my UOB savings account. I called uob hotline. They are unable to verify for me what is this. Does anyone know what is this? Should I close my account immediately?,btohqsg
Not weeks but months. Other method  as far as I know  is you do the transfer/payment manually using UOB one account to SC credit card every month.If you feel it is inconvenient  then schedule few transfers with preset amount in advance for next few months.,btohqsg
Wow ok  thanks. Such an uneficient process...,btohqsg
most likely fraudulent transactions best to report,btohqsg
Looks like overseas fraud transactions. Faster freeze the acc before they start deducting bigger amounts. They always start small hoping you wonâ€™t notice but it escalates quickly,btohqsg
how does cashbacks for UOB looks like in transaction history?,btohqsg
Pls take note if your preset transfer amount is less than your outstanding SC credit card bill  you will be charged with late payment fee.GIRO is still the best way to ensure your bill is fully paid.,btohqsg
Dont need to close acct  just call uob fraud hotline and tell them u din perform the transaction and get them to send u new card if u need to use the card,btohqsg

Any idea where I can check my day-end balance for 30 Jun 2023 (which is the reference for the increment fund)? Not able to find on my statement.If my day-end balance on 30 Jun 2023 was high (i.e $75k-$100k)  then wonâ€™t really be able to reap the optimal benefits even if I chose the earmarked $50k amount option (which would be better to park the required amount to top up to the $100k limit for UOB One interest  and the remaining into another HYSA)?,btohqsg

Good morning. What would be the best cc to earn miles on big ticket items?As a new BTO owner  I'm gonna be spending quite a bit on electronics and furnitures.,btohqsg
Check out ocbc titanium rewards in This videohttps://youtu.be/X0IdGXQTyxA,btohqsg
For big ticket electronics  titanium card.,btohqsg
For big ticket item like getting a rolex watch etc what CC will be useful,btohqsg
Most cc cards have limits for miles earning per month for 4mpd or 3 mpd. For rolex  this threshold is going to be breached easily. Probably a general spending miles card like uob prvi or citi ultima,btohqsg
