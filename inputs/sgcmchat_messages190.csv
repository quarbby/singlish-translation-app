i js spotted a mr2 heading to bishan/amk,btohqsg
rainy days make for nice shots,btohqsg
y censor rear plate  nvr censor front,btohqsg
his goals are beyond your understanding,btohqsg
the rims on that car very nice thou,btohqsg
when are u gonna give me ur 20inch,btohqsg
imma have to give u in installments,btohqsg
then he will randomly message stuff,btohqsg
@Sarahzouywhy u join the chat to middle finger me,btohqsg
front is for business  rear is for fun,btohqsg
you can sit inside  sit on the bonnet  touch everything  chase clout on IG..all without getting your ass kicked,btohqsg
i want sit on@ArghMeinGottbut he dont allow,btohqsg
His at least it's half half,btohqsg
like a 2.5/10 tbh but cool idea bro,btohqsg
would love to actually do that w a double exposure in post editing,btohqsg
Looks like that porsche cafe place at bugis,btohqsg
have you seen@usernameusernameusernameusernameR15 with plenty of milage?,btohqsg
ya behind the sg car choice group,btohqsg
im smooth...and pretty fucking good looking,btohqsg
not even free to go out 😭,btohqsg
Whats a good camera to take car pics?,btohqsg
any cheap prime lens is good enough lol,btohqsg
camera will only come into hand when it comes to convinience  low light etc. don’t need smtg expensive to shoot good,btohqsg
Any diff between mirrorless and dslr,btohqsg
look at aj photos on ig @a_junn,btohqsg
this one u need to research,btohqsg
apsc  full frame and the 3/4 or wtv its called sensors very different also,btohqsg
if i were u just go for a cheap dslr  spend more on lens. cheap dslr don’t mean very old. D5400 can alr,btohqsg
or you could use the psp camera,btohqsg
I have a d3500 but i might get a m50 mk2,btohqsg
i care more abt my lens,btohqsg
Mirrorless is much smaller and autofocus is better usually,btohqsg
Tradeoff is less batt life and some people prefer optical viewfinder,btohqsg
If u got the money i wld say go mirrorless,btohqsg
But most of the cheaper cameras on the second hand market now are dslr’s,btohqsg
Cheap mirrorless like the m50 or z30 worth?,btohqsg
M50 mark ii is very good,btohqsg
He uses the m50 mark ii only,btohqsg
Its probably the best beginner mirrorless,btohqsg
But pair it with viltrox ef-m to ef adapter,btohqsg
To use ef lenses of more variety and cheap,btohqsg
wouldn't recommend a M series.. canon is looking to phase it out soon (or more or less has done it),btohqsg
look for the R series cams... easy to use  small n compact for most too.. lenses are also easily in range (EF too with the RF to EF adapter),btohqsg
if you can squeeze your budget abit i would reco a R8 or RP..R8 is on the newer side but is crop sensor.. RP is on the older side (precovid) but is fullframe,btohqsg
been using the RP for 3.5years+ (still using) and its a great workhorse with good support,btohqsg
but at the end of the day do your own homework and research and see what works best for you.. the R compatibility has started to grow.. M series would be a no-go for me,btohqsg
was gonna go but lz and bz,btohqsg
gt3 at dempsey hill this afternoon,btohqsg
Just use the viltrox efm to ef,btohqsg
A beginner also wont need an ff sensor,btohqsg
I think canon system wise its best to look between the m-series and the r10/r50/r7,btohqsg
Editing is what makes the images pop off,btohqsg
and i’ve beaten my ass over it,btohqsg
the lens is legit what makes or break everything,btohqsg
i still can’t achieve the photos i want STILL after editing sadly,btohqsg
Save money go japan buy lenes,btohqsg
nope my lens js not cripy,btohqsg
for what go japan bro 😂,btohqsg
I bought my lenses in japan I saved about like about $800 sgd,btohqsg
I edc a $150 sigma 50mm f1.4,btohqsg
Editing can cover what your lens doesnt,btohqsg
and if u weren’t using a prime here the bokeh wouldn’t be on point or it wouldn’t be as sharp,btohqsg
i edc a $40 50mm f1.4 too,btohqsg
will gatekeep my gear to my death,btohqsg
my biggest hint is that it’s a very capable lens and it is AF,btohqsg
Was wondering why u don't post on ig,btohqsg
It's alright if u don't wanna share we chill,btohqsg
My biggest theory is ur capping,btohqsg
don’t believe then don’t believe lor,btohqsg
Oh man they dont do well at all so theres no point,btohqsg
Af lens in the $50 range is something super old or ain't real,btohqsg
once say AF yk samyang is out alr,btohqsg
I can only think of manual lenses,btohqsg
dont want share what gear i use,btohqsg
i also have a 35mm i cant rmb how much it costed but its fucked up w fungus,btohqsg
it was below $100  maybe $70. wasn’t mine tho,btohqsg
What sorta magic ahh lens is this 💀,btohqsg
Bro made the lens for $50 frfr,btohqsg
i’m legit nt gonna say what lens it is la but feel free to speculate,btohqsg
bro if i cld i wld def do that,btohqsg
imagine having the power to make every focal length for $50,btohqsg
tbf i only wanted AF cos my cam doesn’t have peaking,btohqsg
Dude u going to the canon Fiesta thing?,btohqsg
I dont support some of those creators so still contemplating,btohqsg
Radical kindess is not very kind..,btohqsg
I'm just gonna go there to network with the other creators like not the big ones,btohqsg
Dude if I ever meet u got stuff to talk about,btohqsg
I have a list of sg creators i dont fw,btohqsg
Honestly the canon fiesta is prob gna be full of kitlens r10 r50 lol,btohqsg
Sigma 70-200 f2.8 35mm f2 and sony 50mm f1.8,btohqsg
Shucks thats a good contemp setup,btohqsg
Rn i have my r6ii and a few lenses,btohqsg
I love this setup I ain't changing gear for a solid 5 years or something,btohqsg
Probably get a 150-600 from sigma,btohqsg
I was contemplating getting that one lol,btohqsg
I ended up getting a 500mm f4 instead,btohqsg
Quite a big lens but its worth it definitely,btohqsg
The sharpness is crazy and its used by professional motorsport photographers,btohqsg
Sigh gotta delete i dont wanna get doxxed,btohqsg
You wanna take it to dms,btohqsg
damn you sound like ur gonna take him out on a date someday,btohqsg
