Tbh this one is quite hard to answer because the most we know is JC batch typically enlist arnd Jan to April or May while those from poly is somehwhere btw April to Dec.[may not be true for some who enlist later than expected due to delays in health screening]As for pre medical screening  I think I did mine 11 to 12 months before I enlishested  though some had to stretch it out even further. Wld recommend calling cmpb to ask.,btohqsg
Pretty deadly mostly becus you need to memorise and even digest a lot of info  esp since you put H2 Bio and H2 Geog.However  did have a friend who scored like 80+/90for A levels so he did pretty damn gd but he was from BCMg but the 2019s batch.(our rp scoring was a lil diff),btohqsg
i see i see  so far i put BCmG as my second after BCmEhopefully can get my first choice,btohqsg
tbh he shld have just taken BCMG,btohqsg
Well different ppl strong at different learning style ... if he/she good enjoy memory work and have the ability to handle memory intensive combination  I will encourage him/her to select such subject combination,btohqsg
I have seen ppl in China on tv shows with photographic kind of memory  this kind really suited for memory intensive subjects and courses,btohqsg

so can‚Äôt completely throw the subject out of the window also,btohqsg
idt it will matter that much,btohqsg

Is doing leetcode good training for noi?,btohqsg
I mean. I wld suggest a 4h2 uh. But problem is  you need to attain the o level score to get 4h2. Not everyone can just get 4h2 just because they want it,btohqsg
Even if they did choose a 4h2  it still depends on the demand. So it wld be also good to figure out a 2nd choice of subject combinations,btohqsg
Odac seems really fun but 3.5 and 4hrs of cca,btohqsg
