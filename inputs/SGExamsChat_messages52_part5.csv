On second thought it doesn’t really make sense,btohqsg
but it doesnt rly fix a proportion,btohqsg
If I take this logic I might as well say PMO decide my grade and your grade right? Cuz PM is head of PMO  and PM is head of cabinet. Cabinet make executive decision  inclusive of whether to even fund SEAB. Hence PMO decides your grade.,btohqsg
This took you very Long to type,btohqsg
I wanted to type what I meant,btohqsg
But I realised it made no sense,btohqsg
theres someone called mr ong ye kung,btohqsg
i doubt he knows how it works,btohqsg
Wikipedia:All percentages with their corresponding grades shown here are just approximate guidelines because ultimately at the end of all major examinations (Primary School Leaving Examinations or PSLE in short  GCE N  O and A Levels) the Ministry of Education  Singapore  will *Moderate* the results. Hence  an A grade for instance may no longer be at 70%. It could possibly be 68% or even 73% depending on the performance of the cohort. This is usually done to preventgrade inflation.,btohqsg
u cant give everyone A just because they all did wekk,btohqsg
Lol I think he knows  I not sure if he want to get involved though. He can since COVID-19 is like catch-all justification for any kind of action.That said I still don't think he wants to get involved with SEAB's setting of grades.,btohqsg
This is not a valid argument.,btohqsg
More like they set a shitty paper,btohqsg
but usually i see ministers as ppl just speaking publicly of what happens in a ministry  with a scholar guiding them what to say,btohqsg
ya thats why its by percentage  and their mood ofc,btohqsg
Scholar only tell you X-year Y-students did Z-paper. Psychometrically this meant ABC and so XYZ.,btohqsg
You can’t give 1 out of 2 of all H2 Maths students A just because they did well,btohqsg
mm ye  was referring to that,btohqsg
Perm Secs are not secs. They are also not PR managers.,btohqsg
a percentage cannot lead to 1 or 2 persons (thats less than 1%?!),btohqsg
since when mor says top 50 percentile can get A...,btohqsg
unless the paper was hard n everyony did well,btohqsg
Actually  a naive implementation can. Not that I know of any course (e.g. Uni) which does this.Uni-wise  once cohort size <10 or <15  all grading standard rules are dropped.,btohqsg
still its their discretion  no hard and fast rule,btohqsg
Since when did they publicly say anything explicit about national exam grading at all,btohqsg
No discretion or power is unfettered in Singapore's public service.,btohqsg
I hate A level F math,btohqsg
Cause the other 50% didn’t do well enough to meet the minimum mark,btohqsg
the minimum mark again is decided by moe and can change when exam difficulty changes,btohqsg
The term 'unfettered power' is basically a phrase by itself  though yes the meaning likely comes from that.,btohqsg
so its a balance between percentile and raw performance in essense,btohqsg
Ugh we’re here talking about structure of Govt and I’m procrastinating a paper about public administration in SG 🙃,btohqsg
simi balance? you think New Balance?It's just an excel spreadsheet. Shift numbers around only,btohqsg
If the min mark was 70 and everyone got 70  then that’s 100% distinction,btohqsg
Just praise and praise can liao ez A,btohqsg
mark breakpoints will affect grading changes due to raw performance,btohqsg
Even if not A still got B+,btohqsg
percentiles will moderate the impact of shitty cohort perfomance,btohqsg
Lol it’s not a good or bad paper it’s a nature paper,btohqsg
#conspiracytheoryif everyone got 70  set a random seed and add random truncated gaussian noise to all scores and use that as the final score so there is no 100% distinction.,btohqsg
actually cambridge also tweaks the raw score.. theres something called a mark scheme,btohqsg
Nature as in how do you characterise and understand it,btohqsg
Then the people who should get A may not get it,btohqsg
All papers that lay claim to being objective are subjective.,btohqsg
theres the percentile factor to mitigate this impact,btohqsg
Nobody is trying to be objective,btohqsg
This is in response to dunkin’s suggestion,btohqsg
Are yall that worried about grades,btohqsg
Basically the projected US unemployment rate is ~10%,btohqsg
you cant be unemployed if you are infected (unable to work) 🧐,btohqsg
