My tutor used to have a clock in his office that counts down the days hours and mins to As,btohqsg

I kena covid during my Alevels last year,btohqsg
Of all the time to kena I kena at that time,btohqsg
I never knew Asians knew what a dishwasher is,btohqsg
I told my mother she said to not be a lazy bastard and clean the plates with hand,btohqsg
i went and saw the green solution  i thought we doing the vanadium shit,btohqsg
when I got a robotic vacuum cleaner many years ago  my mum and sisters said the same thing,btohqsg
then after that they also want robotic vacuum,btohqsg
But like legit tho it's like a decent size one the dishwashers,btohqsg
I told them not lazy then wash clothes by hand and don't use washing machine lor,btohqsg
Asian mum will then goIt's different.,btohqsg
U can cook with a dishwasher tho so it a 2 in one appliance,btohqsg

yaPopular takes 40%  distributor another 20%,btohqsg
small amount. I really print to help students,btohqsg
self publish. We earn about $2+ per book,btohqsg
Apart from easily pirated  certain books are still better as hardcopy,btohqsg
I think certain books got QR codes for that,btohqsg
Reminds me of those research articles that are paywalled,btohqsg
Side note arh if yall rlly need a pay wall research article u go email the main guy and ask for it 90% of the time they send u the pdf free of charge,btohqsg

last time I used to buy so many books from Amazon  but end up never read also,btohqsg

Amazon is the best place to buy books tho,btohqsg
But same.. I am on a 2 year backclog in terms of reading the books I bought,btohqsg
so I write my own books ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I sometimes wish there was an executive summary included for books as a feature,btohqsg
there are a lot of it around,btohqsg
but I don't want to read them because I cannot be sure the summaries are accurate,btohqsg
imagine someone feed the whole book into chatgpt to summarise,btohqsg
