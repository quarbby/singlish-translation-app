Pay in between the lowest n highest,btohqsg
Guys. If coolant over the max level. If that's OK?,btohqsg
Anyone experience taking out spare tire and there is noise when entering and exiting  vehicles but put back spare tire no more noise. Sound like suspension.,btohqsg
It’s ok it will flow over in to the small reservoir when the pressure is high …,btohqsg
Fill to brim also won't explode,btohqsg
What’s the point of putting max indicator?,btohqsg
To me  BYD E6 and M6 problem is size,btohqsg
If new driver and not very confident. Don't buy a mid-size mpv,btohqsg
SP Mobility launches EV charging rewards programmeThe rewards programme allows users to accumulate points when they spend a minimum of $1 on EV charging  requiring a minimum of 500 points for redemption.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Can use points to offset charging bill now ⚡️,btohqsg
A bit rim scratch and body sideswipe will do the trick,btohqsg
1st car I drove when I got license was a Estima. Nothing scares me ever since.,btohqsg
Except height ah  too tall then later multi storey carpark problem,btohqsg
Length and width big is shiok,btohqsg
U don’t like performance n driving experience?,btohqsg
I do but I prefer big SUV with comfort and driving experience,btohqsg
Ioniq 5 N. But Performance not my number 1 concern  I prefer size and practicality first  as well as must be packed with convenient driver features and tech,btohqsg
Bro suv n sports car 2 different animal in performance.,btohqsg
U want big then sacrifice performance. The bigger the more scarification,btohqsg
I prefer small car since characteristics lean towards agility (in terms of reacting responsively) and ample clearance in tight areas such as MCSP,btohqsg
For me  the size of C-Segment SUVs is a good fit for me.,btohqsg
Have you bought your new car yet?,btohqsg
No  I rent. That’s why I did have some opinion on some cars,btohqsg
U mean which deal for the same car amongst dealers?,btohqsg
All these r small things As long as engine n gearbox ok,btohqsg
If engine or gb spoilt  ur life will be v miserable,btohqsg
lazy  don't want to do homework way: see depre  essentially tells you how much you pay per yearrecommended  do your homework: go and understand what the different prices/numbers mean. list price  depre  arf rebate  mileage etc,btohqsg
And after 20th year  it's just scrap metal,btohqsg
Even if u lucky enough to get special permission and a 3rd 10th yr COE to keep beyond 20th yr  U have to have deep pockets to revert  and inspection and all to ensure it's road worthy.,btohqsg
And at this time  makes no sense to spend $100k to renew a year 2000 car,btohqsg
I see. So should assume the value of the car after 20 years is almost negligible already.,btohqsg
Curious. Is there any way to find out or estimate what’s the percentage of PARF vs COR cars on the road?,btohqsg
Nowadays buy car so many considerations ah,btohqsg
My only consideration is loan can approve? Got money pay loan?,btohqsg
Everything else is waste time to find out,btohqsg
