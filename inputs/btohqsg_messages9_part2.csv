You're right. Typo on my part.,btohqsg
It's easy to predict when CM comes out. For the last few times  its always the same pattern. More and more news pointing to over heating appear over the days.,btohqsg
Then boomz  usually Fri late afternoon the CM will announce.,btohqsg
Well it does show that people are more willing to pay higher cov for prime areas  I.e. more centralised locations,btohqsg
Glad to see HDB resale prices going up,btohqsg
'Wealth' is correspondingly up too for many I guess.,btohqsg
Sure every one of us have someone close to us who 'enjoy' this benefit.,btohqsg
I wont say surprising  coz IMO is a very liveable area,btohqsg
Count the number of shopping malls vs say the North,btohqsg
For me  I feel the east has more factors for the buyers to pay cov for... Tho it's not relevant now  the airport.,btohqsg
Now with WFH and suburbanisation  (Uniqlo can be found almost every corner for instance) every place is SG is equally livable. Plus with Grab and Panda,btohqsg
It seems that EHG calculation is done after booking of flat  not during balloting exercise.,btohqsg

Resale HDBDue to the increase in demand for resale HDBs  every 1 in 3 buyers has paid a Cash Over Valuation (COV) in 2021 as compared to 1 in 5 buyers in 2020. As COV data is not usually published  here we have a list of HDB COV amounts and their respective transactions to give potential buyers a more accurate sensing of the market.https://stackedhomes.com/editorial/hdb-cov-database-2021-a-crowdsourced-compilation/#gs.5rkmz7,btohqsg

Collection of keysWhen you come to collect the keys to your flat  you must bring the original copy of these documents  of all persons listed in the application:Identity cardsCertificate of insuranceYou must buy fire insurance from HDB's appointed insurer  FWD Singapore Pte Ltd (FWD)  if you are taking an HDB housing loan.

May I know if I apply for bto using mcps scheme  does the main applicant mailing address used for the application need to be within 4km from the project launch if say the co applicant current address is within the 4km radius,btohqsg
the mailing address doesn't matter  only the parents' registered address and BTO project location,btohqsg
mailing address is just for HDB to send you a physical letter confirming your participation in BTO exercise and the number of chances you have for this exercise,btohqsg
even the ballot result/queue number is sent via email to main applicant,btohqsg
Either applicant's parents will be ok,btohqsg
Anyone mind sharing what are the other fees and how much these fees when signing agreement and collection of key?,btohqsg

Then click breakdown and that's all for these fees costs?,btohqsg

The answer is all there. Just need to click and do a bit of self due diligence.,btohqsg
