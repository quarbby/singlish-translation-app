I got some exp in coding,btohqsg
no itâ€™s just a general term,btohqsg
usually itâ€™s like they give a problem statement and youâ€™ve some time (maybe a few days) to work out a solution project,btohqsg
so itâ€™s not just being good at coding,btohqsg
like one i took part in asked about projects that would align with singaporeâ€™s vision of sustainability,btohqsg
yea it commonly tackles social/business/innovation problems,btohqsg
but for more public ones you can check Devpost,btohqsg
every year ntu has a deep learning week that i think is open to all students,btohqsg
second half of the year so probs look for others for now haha,btohqsg
in field camp i got hip pain because i nvr adjust my LBS properly lmao,btohqsg
first 2 chapters of my Physics book done  yay,btohqsg
higher nitec ite graduate soon ðŸ’€,btohqsg
data engineering (under school of electronics & info-comm technology),btohqsg
From my draft copy to the editor,btohqsg
omg this reminds me of physics,btohqsg
yes i say that as i turn 26 this year,btohqsg
at least you gain age experience,btohqsg
ohh nice good way to visualise the components,btohqsg
All explanation questions.Now doing Dynamics  eg,btohqsg
A rocket is accelerating forward by burning fuel to eject gas backwards. Explain how the ejection of gas backwards produce an forward force on the rocket.,btohqsg
Explain how cushions may reduce the risk of injury during a fall.,btohqsg
A rocket  filled with fuel  is standing vertically on a launchpad and at rest. Gas is ejected upon ignition  such that an upwards thrust is exerted on the rocket. A short interval passed between ignition and lift-off. Explain this observation.,btohqsg
I'm not good at this lol,btohqsg
last year A lvl  many questions came out from my initial drafts already lol,btohqsg
I'm behind time  supposed to finish all these 2 days ago,btohqsg
idk if I can survive in JC ðŸ’€,btohqsg
so you can tell if its going to rain?,btohqsg
it's more like collecting data from a data source then use coding/scripting to provide analyses  insights and solutions,btohqsg
I need to collect data from a government website about the age groups in sg,btohqsg
essentially rocket equation without the rocket equation haha,btohqsg
Once collected  I'd use a programming software like Jupyter Notebook which has Python to breakdown the entire database,btohqsg
or if I need to generate data visualisations such as pie charts  I'd use Pycharm,btohqsg
"A man was tasked to push a wheelbarrow. He refused and argued: ""according to the Newton's third Law  when I try to pushthe wheelbarrow forward with a force F  wheelbarrow exerts a force backwards exactly equal to F. Since the forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction  they cancel out and the wheelbarrow and myself will not move"".Evaluate the man's arugment.",btohqsg
python in juypter looks like this,btohqsg
It looks like a plain google docs lor,btohqsg
anyone have their phone lag before,btohqsg
like i cannot press the button,btohqsg
i try force quit also cannot,btohqsg
I got mine for less than 500,btohqsg
two years and still working just fine,btohqsg
i think i just go apple store,btohqsg
has anyone worked in an ios apple store?,btohqsg
ello fren long time no see,btohqsg
is that tzuyu as your pfp,btohqsg
oh man super classic question. i like it,btohqsg
when the teachers started talking i just BURST INTO TEARS,btohqsg
i prob was the only kid in the cohort that cried lmao,btohqsg
idk if im gonna cry but,btohqsg
its like a chapter of my life is over,btohqsg
i just fear the unknown future ya know,btohqsg
