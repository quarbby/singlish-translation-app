Congrats for those who gets a que for it,btohqsg
Thanks for all ur well wishes ! But not much amenities except market in Khatib ?,btohqsg
Seems like there will be future amenities,btohqsg
They know but still want to try la. Not fresh grad but working as freelancer,btohqsg
Not sure leh i not freelancer haha,btohqsg
IMHO  and just my 5cents thought:a freelancer do not have a steady income  how to buy a unit when not enough cash  cof n I don't think bank wants to offer loan.,btohqsg
Freelancer I'm not sure how hdb assess their income...,btohqsg
Just my humble opinion:There are so many jobs in the market  may be your freelancer friend can take up a regular job  then pursue his passion as a freelancer during off time unless he is in his 50s  or have enough savings in his bank account.Passion cannot put food on table especially if getting married   so need to be realistic in this hungry world.,btohqsg
Actually some freelancer i know makes lots of money. Just that its difficult for hdb to assess the income,btohqsg
You may be right but I guess this apply to experienced freelancers.Also when there is no doc of the proved of income  it is difficult for hdb n banks  just like if there is no proper education certificate n want to teach or do something  1st thing to see is the paper - proof of education.,btohqsg
I am a freelancer too..unless you can provide HDB with some form of invoice or monthly contribution into your bank account or statement as well as cpf  then HDB will only allow or grant you HFE.However  you may not be eligible for any HDB loan.,btohqsg
Also  bank..therefore..you may need to pay cash & cpf for your new BTO.,btohqsg
Yes  exactly - a monthly contribution/statement is needed. I agree with you.,btohqsg
Yes . Freelancer do find friends that have company to IN CPF for them but they will pay on their own pocket via cash back just to have cpf contribution,btohqsg
To add on: banks these days are very straight. I went to one of the bank to invest a product with cash. So need to open an account in order to do an investment  it took 1hour for the bank officer to do a background check on me by inputting all needed data.  So imaging it is not a loan from bank  I'm putting $$ into the bank.. so to get a loan I guess is even more difficult if there is no monthly paycheck..,btohqsg
Do u get grants as freelancer if i may ask?,btohqsg
One can top up own cpf  right? Don't need to go thru 3rd party.,btohqsg
Freelancers are the same as self employed right?,btohqsg
U guys heard ofphaxxx workers? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No grants...anyway  I'm a second-timer...Even though I didn't take any cpf grants before but my first SBF is considered already subsidised by HDB...so no more...in fact my pay levy.,btohqsg
Not really...because its not a fix thing..like if u lucky u get the job..we don't have like own company or agent representing us...what more the amount we get for any gig varies,btohqsg
Ya  guess only if you own a company  then it is classified as 'self-employed'.,btohqsg
Or those phv drivers or food delivery riders are self employed?,btohqsg
I think they have prove of their daily earnings  like grab they have weekly statement,btohqsg
Also they are encouraged to contribute to their cpf yearly at least a min amount..,btohqsg
Maybe if they can prove consistent earnings at least 12 maths Maybe HDB grant loan?Guess best ask them,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I am trying to renew my HFE letter as it expires on the 27th October. Would like to seek advice on the following:1. Do i have to renew my HFE for the upcoming launch in October?2. If i wish to renew my HFE  how can i do so? I have navigated throughout the hdb website (It leads me around in a circle: Cancel HFE -> Submit request with HDB -> Mention HFE has been used with a flat application -> Cancel HFE)Appreciate any advice on this. Thank you !,btohqsg
You only can re-apply on 28th Sept. 1 month before your HFE expire.,btohqsg
Ah i see  thank you Victor ! Much appreciated,btohqsg
Ask for an early expiry  I did that,btohqsg
Maybe the checks were to ensure that the bank account will not be used for money laundering?,btohqsg
In case this will be useful for anyone,btohqsg
I chanced upon a mutual friend posting on her ig. Perhaps this might be useful for you..,btohqsg
Best to cancel/renew the old hfe. If not grant and loan amount will be attach to the old hfe which u used for the initial application,btohqsg
Donâ€™t need to cancel. Can write in to renew it.,btohqsg
Just like I said  ask for an earlier expiry for that HFE,btohqsg
Ya true. Better to write in to renew early,btohqsg
Iâ€™m trying to apply hfe  anyone see this error msg before? What does it mean? I emailed hdb le but still waiting reply,btohqsg
What scheme are u applying under ?,btohqsg
Hi   yishun beacon have tele grp?,btohqsg
What did u input into hfe ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what HDB would ask for during unit selection if one is a self employed?,btohqsg
Do u just need to have your singpass?,btohqsg
Both u and ur spouse employed for past 12 months? Or at least 1 employed for the past 12 months?,btohqsg
U tried to reapply for hfe but still cannot?,btohqsg
Have u tried clearing ur browser cache or signing up on different browsers ?,btohqsg
No eh. But I did try on husband phone using his account  also same error msg ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U try clear cache or use another browser . Sometimes Hdb hfe portal abit weird . Last time I encountered a lot of issues when signing up too,btohqsg
