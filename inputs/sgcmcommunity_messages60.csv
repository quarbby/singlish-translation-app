Wonder which dealer he bought it from...and that dealer sure claim innocence,btohqsg
Depends dealer got give warranty. If not is claim Insurance only right?,btohqsg
I think the buyer should file claim under lemon law,btohqsg
Hope got comprehensive insurance can claim for fire. Market value only,btohqsg
Dun know insurance will pay real mkt value or not? Quite sianz,btohqsg
While waiting for claim  still must pay the bank  if any,btohqsg
So how they determine the “mkt value”?,btohqsg
U mean the claim will take a long time to settle?,btohqsg
But confirm plus chop below market rate,btohqsg
Confirm not the inflated price of 70 000 he bought,btohqsg
Cause they have to investigate also,btohqsg
For this case idk leh  10 days still freaking new leh,btohqsg

Fren carcam battery pack exploded  lucky small fire  whole car stink of smoke smell,btohqsg
That would be unfair cos buyer sure buy above market value...and dealer's pocket is safe,btohqsg
All insurance for full total lost claim is always market value. And market value is always super low compare to the same spec/year/car you buy in the used market,btohqsg
What buyer paid definitely includes dealer's pay,btohqsg

Burden is on the owner to proof is the dealer fault,btohqsg
That’s a weird thing that comes from you,btohqsg
Yes just like car on fire is dealer problem,btohqsg
Imagine that dealer sell them a lemon,btohqsg
Owner bought it from dealer only recently. Good enough reason,btohqsg
I just trying be fair ma   how u know the owner did not do anything to the car,btohqsg
How to start with the dealer lol,btohqsg
U mean the dealer put a time bomb Meh,btohqsg
You just imagine u are a car dealer and some 1 car on fire come to you after you sold the car   u of course will said that we had done a proper hand over and I don’t know what u had done with the car ma,btohqsg
of course you star with dealer because that is where you buy from.,btohqsg
just like when you buy a new car from a dealer and the next day it catches fire  do you blame yourself? no. you go back to the dealer you buy from.,btohqsg
you dont assume owner did something.,btohqsg
hand over does not mean they can wash off hands . if this were the case  then car makers can shirk responsibility.,btohqsg
some problems can surface months or weeks later. that,btohqsg
that is why they do recall to protect themselves and the customers,btohqsg
I just trying to point out that this is not that simple and easy,btohqsg
sure it is not simple and easy,btohqsg
but it starts with the dealer. why? because he bouhgt it so recently from him,btohqsg
I also can said your dash cam is not from us,btohqsg
nevermind how to prove it. start it from therew,btohqsg
Maybe the wiring is they do got properly,btohqsg
i am pointing to what must be done,btohqsg
You said wire defect and such without proof,btohqsg

dont argue like a child please,btohqsg
10 days can do a lot of thing,btohqsg
you are speculating to say owner did someting?,btohqsg
Lol up to you lol   to me 10 days I can do a lot of modification. Liao,btohqsg
let the dealer take responsibility and prove it,btohqsg
U are speculating owner did not do anything,btohqsg
Burden is on the owner not the dealer,btohqsg
i am only saying any sane person would push back to dealer,btohqsg
Dealer is not lodging a claim   why got the burden to proof,btohqsg
Burden is on the owner to proof is the dealer provlem,btohqsg
as owner he bought the car from dealer and it caught fire fire back at him. whya re you taking the slack,btohqsg
Lol why can’t you accept some facts,btohqsg
Keep insist dealer will need do something,btohqsg
if you are the buyer what do you do,btohqsg
and you dont even want to let the dealer know about this?,btohqsg
I will claim insurance and try on my luck on dealer,btohqsg
But I know he will said the same thing to me,btohqsg
What did u do to the car,btohqsg
No proof and contract did not state cover fire   argue what lol,btohqsg
Unless buyer has such a clear case to go after the seller,btohqsg
Ya that what I mean lol,btohqsg
No proof   no agreement   no case lol,btohqsg
It’s the owner’s mechanical risk which is then covered by insurance. See how post mortem by insurance surveyors goes bah,btohqsg
aiyo y bother so much . let owner settle. he more miserable than all of us here😅,btohqsg
10 days really can do a lot of thing   I believe every 1 here sure got a freind that go mod the car on the first day   from cam to audio to anything,btohqsg
Unless of course the car sits there with no engine turned for 10 days and the car catches fire spontaneously. But even then the case has to be built.,btohqsg

Morning guys  anyone driving 218i AT? Any drawbacks to consider?,btohqsg
Sialah I thought like airwave like that,btohqsg
The new one with idrive 8,btohqsg
I feel like those are better and around your budget also,btohqsg
If buying new from pml and ready stock  as of now idrive 8 has a big problem. The infotainment will crash in redhill and henderson area.,btohqsg
If the se never share this  they are not being honest,btohqsg
Need to wait for the germans to patch it,btohqsg
I heard they are testing the new update now. How well it goes wont know.,btohqsg
Do you have any other cars in mind?,btohqsg
Getting from ppsl  x1 is a little out of budget.,btohqsg
hoe much is the 218 now,btohqsg
Does it have 3rd row for pax too?,btohqsg
No have  but with bigger boot with folding seats,btohqsg
Erm… that sounds like an isolated issue.,btohqsg
BMW doesn't believe in purpose built 7 Seaters,btohqsg
Knowing them idrive issue is isolated and will be solved soon. I’d use it to get the price down.,btohqsg
Monster as in trying to kill you?,btohqsg
Heard one of the@SGCM_Adminadmins drive a wish.,btohqsg
Idk what world you living in lol.,btohqsg
Don’t knock it until you try it man,btohqsg
Toyota wish handles very well for its size,btohqsg
I drove my dad's wish. Stopped at traffic light when card pass by the car will roll from the wind...,btohqsg
The one I looking at is 2019  at around 120 range.Current car sell can profit about 15k due to coe going up,btohqsg
My family used to have a wish,btohqsg
important is u like the change of car,btohqsg
Sounds like a reasonable deal if ppsl will commit to solve the idrive issue regardless.,btohqsg
Cx 5 same price range for same age  but petrol is 🥲,btohqsg
What car are you driving right now,btohqsg
Yes. For itchy backside car owners always the case,btohqsg
Where is mr mazda when you need him,btohqsg
Eh wah vezel quite good leh,btohqsg
i tihnk u will miss the vezel,btohqsg
cheaper  better fc and easy maintain,btohqsg
Why are you upgrading if you don’t mind me asking,btohqsg
Not hybrid leh  pick up very asthmatic,btohqsg
ice car to me daily drive is about fc,btohqsg
gonda e is a head turner,btohqsg
but as range too short  need to have dedicated charger to charge daily,btohqsg
singapore u want charge at where lol,btohqsg
Power bank ma... Charge the car like how you charge phone,btohqsg
Cannot tahan cvt  and think of smt with better pickup. And since now got some money back  want to see see around. Only Mpv or suv considered cause love the folding seats to carry stuff  and too tall for sedan (if not would have taken civic  or Mazda 3/6),btohqsg
you will know what is pick up,btohqsg
Maybe U test drive liao u will keep the vezel,btohqsg
On paper  torque is better lo,btohqsg
No one in the team drives a Wish HAHAHA-R,btohqsg
What price are you looking at?,btohqsg

when i test drive   it beat all my expection   and i notice for ice car just get a jazz,btohqsg
My place no charger though. Only got this iX running a cable from his balcony down.,btohqsg
it not that troublesome for charging u can talk with ppl that drive ev,btohqsg
the volvo side of me would recommend you to get the 1st gen XC40 T4 Momentum but honestly the options are pretty dog shit so honestly dont get it😂😂😂,btohqsg
most are happy on the petrol saving,btohqsg
but at least its fast for its price,btohqsg
Volvo parts are really expensive and long wait time. Resale value not as good as Merc and BMW . However it's a solid and safe car.,btohqsg
You will only enjoy petrol savings when you travel a certain distance to cover cost of insurance  premium and road tax. So if wanna buy ev for it to be cheaper  you need to calculate the equilibrium distance which i believe in SG is alot.,btohqsg
wah at first I thought got another Mr Volvo. End up its because Mr JX changed his username😂-R,btohqsg
ev it self got green loan  and 45k rebate,btohqsg
the raod tax difference is low,btohqsg
my eletricity bill per month is $80 only,btohqsg
and i drive like 24k a year,btohqsg
this alone is big difference already,btohqsg
dont need go malaysia and wait in the jam just to save petrol,btohqsg
uhh only E6 is below 130k,btohqsg
unless uw like a renault twizzer or smtg,btohqsg
Just get a standard model 3,btohqsg
Road tax is 2 k plus,btohqsg
Uhh expensive if you buy from wearnes. You go to stockist and purchase is much much cheaper. You have to understand car dealership business model is no long earning from selling you the car. They earn when you come back for replacement parts etc. Therefore i alw recommend volvo friends that are out of warranty to just get parts from unico or xinzhong.,btohqsg
Personally i have never seen volvo parts that are hard to get ah... unless u crash ur car then the internals like piston etc need replace but by then i think total write off liao,btohqsg
And yes  volvo resale is sh!t🥲🥲🥲,btohqsg
But you buy the car you love.,btohqsg
If you want to get volvo  better love the car  or pray that coe keep going up😂😂😂,btohqsg
I know somebody who bought v90 at 14k depre... coe go up up up  now V90 is at 22k depre,btohqsg
Buy and sell within 1 month  earn 20+k,btohqsg
No. Its acknowledge by bmw asia,btohqsg
But its the latest idrive 8. Dun affect the old 6 and 7,btohqsg
Something to do with gps. So it affect the i4 ix and the latest 218,btohqsg
If price goes down for you to get the deal done  and bmw commits to solve it for you as owner after the sale  perfect 👍🏼,btohqsg
Had this experience with my chery 😝,btohqsg
Lol. I am one of the earliest impacted by this. Did get a feeling They didnt treat me too seriously back and work on it slowlt then coz ix has low sales volume. But once i4 and the new 218 also on the new os  thr complain should come pouring in.,btohqsg
At very precise location the infotainment will reset. Dun know what logic. But thats how it is.,btohqsg
saw some 1 ix3 also need to be tow back  as the key dont work,btohqsg
Are they stockist? Am looking for parts,btohqsg
unico abit ex but i think have more relevant parts,btohqsg

just need new wheels  suspension  bbk  exo  manual swap  stage 2+,btohqsg
this car has a very strong engine block,btohqsg
if you want can alw swap w S60r parts,btohqsg
Manual is out of the book,btohqsg
Am thinking of upstroking it 😂,btohqsg
yeah dont bother to bore ur engine block. S60r 2.5 tend to have cracked cylinder walls as the walls are too thin. When u use the S60R rods u will uprate to slightly more than 2.3.  then just tune and get bigger snails.,btohqsg
Also do take care of your automatic transmission,btohqsg
manual wld be better but auto is fine too,btohqsg
Plus urs is I5 tho  just straight pipe and it will sound good,btohqsg
for legal reasons this a joke ah,btohqsg
@xunxunxunxunbtw is it illegal to twin turbo a turbo car?,btohqsg
U meant already legal have 1 turbo but you wanna add another turbo?What do you think 😂,btohqsg
Apparently they only say you cant turbo a NA car,btohqsg
So which means is legal though,btohqsg
you can if the exact same engine comes from the factory w a turbo,btohqsg
volvo have inline 5s that came from factory NA and Turbo,btohqsg
its legal to turbo the NA,btohqsg
but u have the ensure emission are within legal limit,btohqsg
So can twin turbo a b55?,btohqsg
Don’t let anyone stop you from doing the things you like,btohqsg

I think he's trying to say that with a relatively new driver also only 2500,btohqsg

Many Tesla owners are younger peeps too  under 30. So their insurance costs a lot more even if they have a few years of driving experience,btohqsg
It all depends on your own profile,btohqsg
But yes  if you have a harder time getting insurance on regular cars or end up paying more than most. Teslas and higher power EVs will cost you more to insure or in some cases may not be able to insure,btohqsg
