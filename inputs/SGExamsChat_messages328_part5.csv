Its a very niche tool. I dont think ull get much help here,btohqsg
Might wanna check the products own forum page,btohqsg
I've tried the forums but nothing's working gahah  just trying my luck here. Thanks tho :'),btohqsg
Have u tried splitting the attributes into its own bar,btohqsg
Im assuming ure trying to do this,btohqsg
Where yellow blue and red are attributes,btohqsg
But u can split em up in their own bars,btohqsg
Should be easier to color code,btohqsg
Not quite  itâ€™s a normal bar chart  not stacked - just wanted to highlight the ones that were the lowest to draw the viewerâ€™s attention there first. But itâ€™s fine haha  I appreciate your effort nonetheless ^^,btohqsg

It's like how my brother took his exams in a separate room but with additional time,btohqsg
it would be on record lor,btohqsg
It's like quite unfair for some people,btohqsg
Imagine yourself being in a solo room without pressure. You can probably do better than those in halls or classrooms with pressures.,btohqsg
My brother took in a separate room and he did better than what everyone expected,btohqsg
I didn't sit in hall for mine so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯,btohqsg

Idk how is that possible but I'll wait for my friends posting for meds,btohqsg
No. Our local universities do not discriminate between those with AA and those without.,btohqsg
We'll have to trust what they say in parliament lorh,btohqsg
If what they say is true  and we don't have any reason to suspect otherwise,btohqsg
