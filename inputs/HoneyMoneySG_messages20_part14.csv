Hi guys  whats the essential difference between OCBC titanium and other 4mpd cards since the limit is the same @ about 12k/year ?,btohqsg
OCBC Titanium Rewards has an annual limit while most other cards have a monthly limit. You also need to look at the eligible transactions for 4 mpd for OCBC Titanium vs other cards.,btohqsg
okay thank you. but isnt the limit about the same since its around 13k while others is about 1k/month (12k/year) also then would amaze tactic work for OCBC titanium rewards ?,btohqsg
But Titanium doesn't give 4 mpd for everything with Amaze. Only shopping transactions.,btohqsg
And you don't need to pair Amaze with Titanium to get the 4 mpd since the bonus rate applies for offline transactions as well. Unless you're shopping in FCY and you want to use Amaze to get the better FX rate.,btohqsg
btw any one knows which CC earn points from paying insurance and adding as recurring payment?,btohqsg

Also  some Maybank cards allow. Such as Maybank Visa Infinite (1.2 mpd)  Maybank Horizon (0.4 mpd)  Maybank Platinum Visa (3.33%),btohqsg
i alwasy encounter issue submit myinfo to maybank always need me to maually submit,btohqsg

UOB Absolute Cashback Card nerfs GrabPay top-upsFrom 15 January 2023  UOB Absolute Cashback Cardholders will only earn 0.3% cashback on GrabPay top-ups  instead of the current 1.7%.bit.ly/3BEfAtLDiscuss this@milelion. Join@milelionroarsfor more updates,btohqsg
top up as much as u can before it nerfed,btohqsg
Max is 10k/month to top up to grab  so Dec and Jan max is only 20k,btohqsg
Anyone know if Amaze has Apple Pay support in SG?,btohqsg
Lmao I just received this card few days ago and they decided to nerf it. If only more insurance company accepts amex then this card still serves it purpose,btohqsg
Overseas spending any recommendation for CC or amaze which linked to Citi rewards card,btohqsg
I saw online that annual fee waiver for CRMC is 'N/A'  does it mean we cant call in to waive the fee after the first year?,btohqsg
Oh no Samsung pay just rejected grab mastercard. Any other virtual wallets to link grab card for easy payment?,btohqsg

UOB Absolute Cashback Card: W.e.f 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%. To find out more about the change  visit UOB Absolute Cashback Card website.,btohqsg
Anyway to convert AMEX to master card?Any convertor available?,btohqsg
Gg UOB Absolute + GrabPay MasterCard combo,btohqsg
Should we top up Grab max $5k before nerf??,btohqsg
Then slowly spend the $5k over a period of time,btohqsg
At least this will buy us time to think of another strategy,btohqsg
Already ShopeePay just imposed 2% fee on all credit card/ debit card top ups  so doesnâ€™t make sense to use UOB Absolute to top up ShopeePay le,btohqsg
You can consider to if you still use grab services. At least UOB warned the users unlike Grab that silently nerfed the e wallet top ups while o was still traveling ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
