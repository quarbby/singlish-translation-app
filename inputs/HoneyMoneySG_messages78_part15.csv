I don't have uob account. So I open and just put 80k there for 2 months? How much will I earn?,btohqsg
Doesn't work for me. Have to salary credit  spend on cc and do Giro just to get the %. Too much hassle for 2 months of interest.,btohqsg
CIMB fast saver lor..3.5% for first 6 months..but no lock period..u can withdraw after 2 months when u need it,btohqsg
Haha shag! I'm alr a fastsaver account holder. Opened 5 years ago.,btohqsg
So I don't get the 3.5% right?,btohqsg
Looks like maribank 2.88% is the only choice now. Somemore interest credited everyday.I've looked around but can't find any leh. Unless someone here got better idea. Haha see if anyone got ideas tmr morning.,btohqsg
think u misread my posts as well as the TnC. Can get 3mpd on Kris+ without any min spend  but Kris+ dun clock towards the $800 SIA group spend.,btohqsg
Moomooo. Need to take a risk.,btohqsg
Buy shares? This 80k I need in Feb.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/149116Check with Chris for more details.,btohqsg
Alternatively  UOB Stash ?Maribank can withdraw anytime. 2.88%.,btohqsg
Can consider BOC. They have 2mths at 2.9% 3mths @ 3.6%,btohqsg
Thanks for this! I think they change to 1 Month 2.9%. Just googled their promo rates,btohqsg
May i check uob evol use on public transport need to link with contactless or can just tap the card to qualify for the 8% rebate?,btohqsg
Yes many weeks ago  but my family members yet to receive â€¦ been more than a month for them  but my colleague gotten her card within the same week of application â€¦,btohqsg
Anyone knows what happens to a UOB savings account that has no money in it  left unattended for 5 years?I canâ€™t seem to get through a CSO to find out if it has been terminated or left dormant indefinitely until funds are transferred in again.,btohqsg
If that UOB account has a minimum balance requirement  then there will be a fall below fee which makes your balance negative  which will in turn attract the overdraft fee. Currently I have to keep 1k in each of my 3 unused UOB accounts.,btohqsg
The minimum balance is $500. The account definitely will be negative and incur an overdraft fee. Does this fee continue piling up under my name or will the account be closed?,btohqsg
Nova launcher is now deemed as a risky app by many bank apps like DBS and UOB. Any way to fix  or must always do the assessibility change each time you need to open bank app?,btohqsg
Yes  OP mentioned he is existing customer,btohqsg
Yes those fees will pile up with interest charged. I was horrified when I saw those fees and quickly top up account back to minimum balance of exactly 1k each account. Little did I know I would kenna another round of fees end of month so my 1k got deducted and is below minimum balance again but I wasn't aware hence got charged fee again. So it's a vicious cycle.,btohqsg
My bad  then 3.5% interest is for the incremental fresh funds. The rest gets the base 1.5% interest rate.I closed my accounts quite some time back and reopened for the promoâ€¦ but it seems Iâ€™m considered as an existing customer getting the 1.5% rateâ€¦,btohqsg
Blacklisting by UOB. Faster go appeal ASAP before account closure. Your hsbc also received this letter?,btohqsg
Time to consolidate my funds and close accounts that I canâ€™t maintain anymore to avoid this then.Iâ€™m guessing that if remain unattended  they will empty out the account and then close itâ€¦,btohqsg
I actually want to close my accounts but UOB asked me to write in via physical mail or visit branch. So I am really happy UOB auto close because I don't need to use UOB accounts.,btohqsg
But this letter is a blacklisting  in future cannot come back again even 100 years later,btohqsg
I don't want to go near UOB with a 10 ft pole ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If my spending mainly is only on mobile contactless spending  is UOB EVOL card still a good card?,btohqsg
Ouchâ€¦ UOB isnâ€™t as efficient as it perceived to be. Iâ€™ve been waiting to cancel my cards with them but they kept on delayingâ€¦Even so harder when asking for a credit limit increase.,btohqsg
Hi everyone . Any suggestions on platform to buy s&p 500?,btohqsg
Anyone has tried using OctaFX platform? Whatâ€™s the verdict compared to other brokers?,btohqsg
I'm using Nova Launcher Prime  just checked my banking apps and there aren't any issues  just a data point fyi,btohqsg
hi  very random question. i have the following cards. citi premiermiles  citi rewards  cimb visa infinite card  instarem amaze card.what's an easy way to do card spending (like get the most miles or cashback back  in +ev value  i travel often too  but dont mind cashback just as it is)  (i spend 5-10k a month)  mixed variety of stuff.for now retail spending i have instarem amaze card paired with citi rewards card...for online shld i use premiermiles or rewards? or what's the best strategy. haha.for retail shld i stick with amaze+rewards or change to amaze+premiermiles?thanks for reading!,btohqsg
Hi  masters. For uob one account 500 spending  can I ask if it is according to transaction date or post date. Letâ€™s say if I bought some thing at 31th November and it is posted on 3rd December  does it consider spending on November or December?,btohqsg
Many thanks. So for transaction like this  it will be considered a spending on December?,btohqsg
Hi experts  anybody sign up for heymax? If use heymax to vouchers  it can clock towards credit card spending?,btohqsg
think u should apply more 4mpd-6mpd cards or cashback cards with high earn rate like maybank family and friends  citi cashback  uob evol (but cashback cards need to meet min spend). Idea is to spend on cards that give most miles/cashback and meet min spend.,btohqsg
UoB daily limit can transfer 100k?,btohqsg
max can transfer out 100k per person per day,btohqsg
Nope. It is now up to 200k,btohqsg
Great  finally the review it  guess too many people feedback on the limit,btohqsg
thanks probably apply for the citi cashback and throw everything there,btohqsg
no ah  citi cashback (not citi cashback+) has cashback limits of $80 only,btohqsg
should have had my 31 November copyrighted and trademarked! hahaha,btohqsg
abit of reading  like all the 4-6mpd card like got cap per month. abit lazy.  maybe 1 max  then throw the rest into another card...,btohqsg
why not be just a tiny bit hardworking to get 3-4 times the miles,btohqsg
How long does it usually take to receive credit card after applying? (HSBC / UOB / OCBC) As a new customer,btohqsg
3 working days for me to receive the physical card (UOB). HSBC / OCBC im not sure. Sorry!,btohqsg
Citi reward better or uob vs? For oversea spending,btohqsg
how much? include travel related spend like hotel?,btohqsg
