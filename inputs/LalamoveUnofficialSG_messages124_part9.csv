Apparently some of this holders not smart. They like to keep it close to their phones. So they keep it in their phone cases. Flashing this while calling someone and putting it on their heads.,btohqsg
😂 you kidding….like Kaki Bukit to Jurong for $17. 3 drops,btohqsg
Some are zero overhead drivers  driving company transport for delivery.  Free vehicle  petrol etc... After office hours just rest....,btohqsg
Many failed their Maths in school ...hahaha,btohqsg

14 dollars for 20 km...technically you loose money ...now the coe that high you won't be able to to replace your vehicle ...its just silly to treat us like slaves...the amount just don't equate to the salary and time...,btohqsg
This one very common. Cause now use signal must pay. Per signal $10. 😒,btohqsg
Did anyone noticed there is some order pickup place and drop off place the same?,btohqsg

Going to tear down the bloody stupid die fastest sticker anytime after joining less than 3 month  this bloody application is means for customer use not suitable for driver usage.. they only listen to customer feed back and complain.. Go to hell Llm,btohqsg
I only earn less than $50 after deducting my cost and you teach me how to fxxk around with ur application messaging need improvement and those kind of threats messages  mother chee bye I am working under ur care and you provide nothing to me a all.. I’m a bloody fools like others driver listening to ur comments and the fare price really fxxk big time and you want driver to act ur customer have to treat like god’s.. really go die fastest.. Those driver out there take care this application is really suck big time.. pui pui pui pui pui 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 Die in peace lalamove. Move ur mother Cher ur !!!!!!!,btohqsg
Lastly I will leave here  those driver still driving take care… this cheebye application is really treat driver like a fools.. I hope more driver leave this application and see whether is customer satisfaction or driver important… they can’t survive without driver..think abt it and all the best ahead.. good bye 👋,btohqsg
Hahaha  drivers out there need to stand together to boycott this app without fears. Now we we know why is there so many foreigners driver out there doing.. I feel you drivers,btohqsg
Full time as llm driver is not feasible. If u were to rent a vehicle  its as good as digging ur own grave.,btohqsg
Only suitable for shot gun driver. Good deal then take  else watch tv play game or hp...,btohqsg
CS responses  live chat waiting time super long. Need help also can't afford to wait else can't meet delivery requirements,btohqsg
If happen to see a foreigner or find  and follow them. Collect evidence and report to MOM/LTA. Taking car plate only is useless. Need more evidence such as liaising with the shop to provide u guys with the order number to report. Take picture of them holding the order and delivering 👍🏻,btohqsg
They will still refer to MOM/LTA,btohqsg
More direct if they are using foreign vehicle,btohqsg
U can call police to hold them back while they refer,btohqsg
Pass to police do the job,btohqsg
90% foreigners doing the job? The rest local start leaving,btohqsg
Most importantly is to get the customer involved in Pickup point and dial for police assistance  once customer get involved they will afraid of getting involved and stop this platform in future 😀,btohqsg
I heard a friend mentioned that good delivery jobs are snatched by modified apps and distributed among their group. Only lousy jobs are released to the app list  don't know it real? Anyone knows?,btohqsg
Maybe is true but need not bothered about it.. let them have less demand on customer and less driver doing on  we will see how lasting they can go,btohqsg
Want to destroy them there is definitely a way to do so.. created more problems with users and Dropoff customers,btohqsg
Wondering negative income still have people snatch  even stacking margin still sucks.,btohqsg
Demanding more money on agreement when Pax want to take a ride together with goods.. or whatever you can think off.. don't agree than cancel,btohqsg
How expect to reply  it's either their staffs or die hard fans 🤣😂,btohqsg
Just ask the user to cancel if inappropriate.. never force yourself to do the job if is not right.. they will ban and remove 1 day is a matter of time but before you get ban made sure you do the damage first. Understand!,btohqsg
That is why I said demand for more money,btohqsg
They don't agree ask them cancel  the don't cancel make it as bug as possible and call for police assistance,btohqsg
Can  I will follow ur protocol.  I think u are good  don't let them take advantage.  We not taxi,btohqsg
Take all evidence and report to authorities. Authorities didn't want to act  call newspapers hotline for interviews  post on social media,btohqsg
Don't help carry let them load themselves  don't climb staircase tell them there is additional charges,btohqsg
If you are still continuing doing from today onwards start every pickup/Dropoff find fault to collect additional money.. there are many users taking advantage on driver,btohqsg
Anything they don't agree is either they cancel or you call police in.. make it big as llm don't act on driver,btohqsg
User pay cheap fare want service.. staight tell them fuck you!! I don't believe to my knowledge I can't bring them down hahaha,btohqsg
You set the rule  I play on the rule and follow what you have stated on the rule,btohqsg
And I make myself sure more users will dissappear in short run,btohqsg
