but the joke is that BTO is as expensive as car lol,btohqsg
That's with assumption if COE rising keeps going up each month. In a few years...will hit that amount.,btohqsg
Then choose either bto or car,btohqsg
Bto can get 30s loan   car only 7 yrs,btohqsg
haha well good luck to the TFR at this rate,btohqsg
BTO can still utilise your CPF as initial payment. Car...outright cash initial payment.,btohqsg
Bto is 2 person  google and see lor,btohqsg
Special case for singles 35 yrs old and above to purchase 2 rm flexi HDB BTO in non-mature estate.,btohqsg
Maybe bank loan max can 30,btohqsg
Damn 100k Coe for cat A,btohqsg
its literally 20% of a HDB now,btohqsg
I think some of the previous launches (precovid)  2 room flexi after grant is like 80-90k,btohqsg
Grant need payback when sell hse de,btohqsg
I was referring to a normal 4 or 5 rm abt 500k so 20% of a HDBðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
This one pay back to your own OA bro  technically still your money,btohqsg
I dun see why I use my own money still need payback leh,btohqsg
Its not my money if i have no control over it,btohqsg
Anyway without grant  recent 2 room flexi at tengah is $125 000 to $155 000. Still cheaper than Toyota altis LOL,btohqsg
Thanks for telling me this. Officially CAR MORE EXP than BTO 2 Rm le,btohqsg
COE is alrdy the price of a 2rm flexi HDB BTO alrsy,btohqsg

Idea is for everyone to forget abt owning cars and move towards car light n ev,btohqsg
Grab / PHV fares are noticibly more expensive also. I feel like compared to last year I am paying close to 20% more,btohqsg
Grab insist is due to higher demand,btohqsg
Pfft its due to increased cost,btohqsg
Cannot be coe up ur rental car rental stay the same one,btohqsg
The cost must be covered. If the fare dont up how driver earn or make a living,btohqsg
GST increase 1% but food cost go up >10% each time. Let the debate go on. lol,btohqsg
that's some BS from Grab sia lol,btohqsg

COE is part of that amount too,btohqsg
Simple coffeeshop kopi-o raise by 20cents. haiz.,btohqsg
because GST is applied at every stage along the supply chain,btohqsg
so by the time really reach the final consumer,btohqsg
Then the same concept of Grab fee rising cos of other cost rising.,btohqsg
coffee bean at port -> container truck -> warehouse -> lorry/van -> coffeeshopsee how many times it is taxed in that chain? lolhaven't even add in laboralso  don't forget COE for the vehicles used,btohqsg
Public transport would be the cheaper option once our car 10yr ownership is over.,btohqsg
Nissan E-power cars really helped Tan Chong sales apparently,btohqsg
