For me  I look to trade some and will hold half for longer term.I prefer to look one hurdle at a time. First is for it to test $0.081/$0.082  and clear convincingly then believe it should be able to test year High $0.090.From there then see price action and market sentiments to determine.If don‚Äôt feel good then will cut or take profit too.,btohqsg
So true the temptation to buy an sell especially with the app on phone it is just a tap away üòÇ,btohqsg
