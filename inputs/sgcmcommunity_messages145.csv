The richest people I know dont necessarily buy fancy cars. In fact they do all they can to be low key so people don’t think they are rich. 🤔🤔🤔,btohqsg
In fact  I love all VW Campers!!,btohqsg
But still  you can deny the fact that if you’re able to afford a McLaren in Singapore  you’re technically rich,btohqsg
Unless one owns a large yacht to park in backyard. But then again  the large yacht can’t go through to go all the way to the backyard 🤔 plus there no dividing wall for privacy one,btohqsg
Some are rich coz they’re sharp with how they spend their money. Thus rich get richer.,btohqsg
Can afford and actually buying one is a bit different,btohqsg
Of coz there are really rich who really have no problem changing one supercar to another just like that,btohqsg
Interesting question: how many supercar owners are actually full cash owners?,btohqsg
What kind of residential housing are they living in?,btohqsg
Actually for me if you own a car for leisure  you’re already considered well to do,btohqsg
I also.. but only rich in heart ❤️ ❤️,btohqsg
KEKEKEEKEEKKE I GOT NO CAR! 😳😳,btohqsg
On the other hand life is short. If cars is what one loves  by all means spend sensibly to pursue this hobby if it makes one happy.,btohqsg
Live for yourself and not for others.,btohqsg
