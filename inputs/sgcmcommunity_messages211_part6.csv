5 cars in Singapore to pick if you're thinking of COE renewalWant to keep car ownership costs low? Here are five car models that are perfect to be given a new lease of life with a COE renewal.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Here's cheap COE cars option for ya'll,btohqsg
This is 2020 edition.😂 Does it make sense to renew COE at PQP close to 100k? That will be an interesting article to explore.,btohqsg
Throw 100k to renew Honda Fit,btohqsg
100k++ for 10 year old Honda fit with 100k+ mileage. The jokes write by themselves.,btohqsg
I might get a small car like a Swift since I’m just fed up of big cars. Just fun to drive and quite simple car,btohqsg
A bit hard to find a good example for 3rd gen,btohqsg
Who will loan 100k for renewal coe,btohqsg
Actually  I don't understand this point. CoE loan is probably the safest loan. Motor value is 0. So it is a pure COE cost. Backed by government. Anytime can scrap and get back unused COE. Loan tenor can be less than 10 years. Wonder why interest rates are so high for COE,btohqsg
Next time. When the third-gen swift becomes a COE car or Used 4th Gen Swifts are on the resale market. That would be the time I will ask my dad to sell his future next car if I don’t like it,btohqsg
golf is the best if u willing to pay  i drove both before,btohqsg
i am not a car expert,btohqsg
if u ask me as a user of both car model  i say golf,btohqsg
vios - vezel - swift sport - forte - mazda 3 - impreza - golf - veloster - A4 - prius - aruz - innova - GLB250 - cefiro - almera......i find golf give the best experience and make me love DSG,btohqsg
I still owning a golf btw,btohqsg
New car price is terrible nowadays  are there still finance company risk to do full loan?,btohqsg
lend me yours for test drive,btohqsg
Si fei Lou quote nice to drive,btohqsg
Balance owed  they bring u to court,btohqsg
Can u guys don’t do funny noise to ur exhaust? I thought my car spoilt,btohqsg
Any car dealer deal with DRS customer before? How do they apply for car loan?,btohqsg
Bank is out. Will be those finance company w high interest,btohqsg
Is want or don't want only,btohqsg
Hi  does blackvue dashcam accept any brand of sd card? Or need to use theirs?,btohqsg
Just make sure it meets the speed requirements,btohqsg
Any1 recall the Korea plane crash after hitting head on with the concrete barrier?,btohqsg
If the plane hit the concrete at a angle instead of 90 deg  will more ppl survive? The pilots can land earlier n at a angle. more distance travelled n more brake force.,btohqsg
Did you see the crash reports? The landing gear never even deployed.. how you expect braking when flaps deployed but then there is no brakes from the landing gears at all,btohqsg
And the aircraft can only angle so much before the tail strikes the runway,btohqsg
U don’t understand what I say,btohqsg
You expecting like this is it?,btohqsg
If smaller aircraft probably can but heavier like that Jeju Air 737-800 (41 tons empty).. difficult to execute because of the total weight incl passengers and luggage  if consider human factors and FAA emergency checklist.,btohqsg
It is like a bus and a car. Car can brake and change direction faster than a fully loaded bus.,btohqsg
Before land can adjust angle alr. Anw I asked ai it’s possible. If pilots skilled  can land earlier also. Can save ard 10-20% lives,btohqsg
AI is not human. Have you considered the human aspect in aviation.. it is not just autopilot and then that's it the pilot hands-off.,btohqsg
Common sense . If u can land at 90%   why not other angle,btohqsg
Anw don’t want debate with u on common sense,btohqsg
Then next time got fully autonomous aircraft  you become first tester  okay?,btohqsg
Lol all this aircraft arguments in a car chat,btohqsg
I'm more like  got ppl really entertain tht joker,btohqsg
Tesla Model Y Juniper  headlight really getting smaller and smaller,btohqsg
LED lights don't need to be big,btohqsg
Anyway small light bars are all the rage in car design these days,btohqsg
Compare Model Y to Xpeng G6?,btohqsg
