All q to buy mask ..,btohqsg
But what he says is correct right? If rental too high does not make biz sense then donâ€™t rent right? It is not as though they had no choice forced to rent which our company always experience from our big customers,btohqsg
COE  housing super high.Only for Chinese rich to be hereGo Malaysia Thailand Indonesia for retirement,btohqsg
My neighbour in Malaysia bought this  for $100k Rm,btohqsg
I better rent out my apartmentand retire in Malaysia,btohqsg
How to do business in Singapore?So high price,btohqsg
Soon Singapore will be in recession.Too high price who can afford???,btohqsg
EV expecting to become more expensive soon?,btohqsg
If no one rents the stalls at those high prices  automatically they will reduce the rental prices. Problem is the stalls all got taken up. Demand n supply leh,btohqsg
Agree. That is why so many biz give up then when enough give up auto the prices will lower. If there are takers of high prices difficult to reject it right? Same way as property owners if can rent at higher rentals which landlord will want to rent out at lower rentals?,btohqsg
Singapore no advantage of technology but to attract super rich from China,btohqsg
Frankly I too think cost in Singapore has gone too high bcos small place n so many people want to come here n global inflation add to the problrm,btohqsg
The biz catering to them huat lor,btohqsg
Some Huat some at a loss,btohqsg
Govt has to balance nicely asap but I think such situation is fluid n not stabilised yet lah.,btohqsg
Actually the whole world is in a mess and unstable,btohqsg
Too expensive hopefully Lawrence Wrong can make miracleHopefully neighbour countries like Malaysia Indonesia Thailand go bust,btohqsg
Bigger countries hv more say than smaller countries esp trade now turn my protectionistic. Globalisation at stake too. If that happens Singapore will be in big trouble. If Govts prevent or stop their local biz invest overseas by law  we die,btohqsg
They hv big domestic mkt leh,btohqsg
Agree. Must watch a while for global picture to stabilise lah. We too small country hence cost easily go up esp Singapore so far so in demand n marketable,btohqsg
Actually in our company biz we notice Singaporeans funny: if they can buy a new brand of item at lower prices they still buy the high price items they hv been using even savings as high as 30-40%!,btohqsg
Fact is times are bad globally n tougher for smaller countries like SG that depend on globalisation. That is my view lah,btohqsg
My car will expire in three years timesâ€¦,btohqsg
Understand your anxiety. I realise I mostly park my car so I sold it n now take grab. Much cheaper,btohqsg
Than expensive is correct mah lol,btohqsg
That's the point of COE in the first place,btohqsg
Because I paid no debt but I better sell,btohqsg
May be Govt shd consider coe quota for foreigners n separate for locals?,btohqsg
Is the foreigners pushing up COE prices?,btohqsg
Or like golf club membership local n foreigners hv separate prices,btohqsg
Foreigners I think only park money here... they don't park themselves here lol,btohqsg
I am ok lar my car fully paid 5 years ago,btohqsg
But fact is Govt n locals do benefit by their money being here leh. I think their family members may be here too n they consume here too leh,btohqsg
I sold my 6 year old car at 60% of my purchase price. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
That's why people can fully pay up their car mah.... lol,btohqsg
Some locals benefit  some lose lor. Those who gain never speak up ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I not disagreeing with inflation but I think COE not the right thing to complain about inflation ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Same as housing n foreigners here: who earn the high rentals? But then the new buyers suffer so I suggest to them wait lah. I think prices shd come down,btohqsg
But in any situation  sure have some win some lose mah... must learn to pivot lor,btohqsg
I donâ€™t know but I am sure Singaporean landlord earn higher rentals too. I know my friends do,btohqsg
Aiya retire alse where car very cheap,btohqsg
You can Lah bcos you bought property before mah. And you can rent out at high rental to live overseas ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Erm... ok so we in agreement ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If car is your only concern  why not... as long as you can get PR in other countries,btohqsg
I hv always said locals some benefit some lose leh. Problem is those who lose keep speaking so loudly leh ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
