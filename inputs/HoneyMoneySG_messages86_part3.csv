Hi  i wondered if someone could advise me on this. If i want to buy an osim chair ard 8k  which card should I apply for. Thx,btohqsg

Hi  can I check if my parents have yet to reach their BRS and BHS in their CPF account should I TopUp their MediSave account first or just TopUp their retirement account will do? The current age of my parents is 63 y/o.,btohqsg
Miles vs cashback is a very personal question  there is no strictly better or worse. But broadly speaking  miles = better value but more restricted redemption options  cashback = worse value but flexible. Comes down to what you value,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to ask how long does the withdrawal process takes for moomoo ?,btohqsg
Miles need to stratgies and plan abit. If ur spending 2 years also cannot redeem a pair of tickets then jus go for cashback.,btohqsg
If i would like to get miles  which card to apply for,btohqsg
For your 8k spend  should split up into several cards to max out the miles earned. Otherwise go for new-to-bank sign up bonus.,btohqsg
Just my thoughts.. if their MA enough to cover all the insurance premiums payable by MA  then top-up their RA for them to get higher payouts.,btohqsg
Can see which one of the current credit card signup bonuses you can qualify for  these are usually the best value for large purchases and if you're considered new-to-bank (see the bank's t&c for the definition of this)Edit: removed link,btohqsg
please do not share links from competitors,btohqsg
Can I ask for UOB UNI$ from different card example UOB ladies & UOB Priv  will be consolidated into the main account correct?,btohqsg

Any different in term of % if subscribe from moomoo?,btohqsg
if i dont subscribe to moneybull but subscribe directly fullerton fund  in webull  is it the same?,btohqsg
uni$ are pooled as in can be redeemed together but may have different expiry date,btohqsg
Anybody uses the landlease voucher? Read online can only use all at one time,btohqsg

Able to hit at least $250 in online transactions (Spotify  netflix  other online purchases) and $250 in mobile contactless transactions (pay groceries with phone)?If yes to both  can look at UOB EVOL card.If you can also do salary credit of $1.6k  can also look at UOB One account for savings to get EIR 3.85% to 5% p.a. for your savings.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have such high expenses yet,btohqsg
Maybe can look into low/unlimited cashback cards with no min spending.,btohqsg

Hi all experts  Can I ask if I do a big purchase at capitaland today  can i scan the receipt tmr and the date will be credited as tmr? Tq in advance,btohqsg
Best (and technically correct) way to view it is that the interest is calculated daily.Each day the deposit is delayed is another day's worth of interest not earned,btohqsg
Thank you! I will begin searching now. ü•≥,btohqsg
Any idea what‚Äôs the earn rate of UOB Lady Solitaire card? Saw that there is a cap at 6k/mth,btohqsg
Ah  Mis-read  so it is 3k a month,btohqsg
During calendar month  capped at UNI$8400  equivalent to S$3k,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs a part 2  where the next S$3k spend will only accrue Bonus UNI$,btohqsg
Which is capped at UNI$5400? Maybe I am not understanding it üòÜ,btohqsg
