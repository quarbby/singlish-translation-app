üçèPika World Daily Review ‚Äì 13 Sept 2022üß©üéØStrong showing in stocks‚ù§Ô∏èEquity rose on Monday  giving it the fourth straight time of gains as investors look ahead to today's inflation print.The expectation is for August's CPI to show a decline of 0.1% based on a monthly basis. If inflation shows persistent signs of slowing  it will bode well for equities  as investors will bet on the Fed to dial back the aggressive rate hike stance.Nonetheless  Pika World remains cautious given that a series of Fed speakers had been firm in their fight against inflation and will want to see more continuous signs of inflation moderating before changing course in monetary policy.‚úèÔ∏èGeopolitics playing out: Ukraine gains a positive noteüî´There are also signs of relief that as Russia suffered setbacks in the war  it could push Putin to the bargaining table. But  technically  investors are generally surprised that Ukraine is performing pretty resilient in the war and that some see a turning point.The war does have implications for the stock market. Investors looking at the most optimistic outcome will be the end of the war and the restoration of mass commodities supply that will help tame the global food inflation narrative.üì±iPhone demand appears strongüî¶From the words of AT&T CEO  he is seeing firm demand for the latest iPhone 14 unveiled last week. However  he considers a more accurate focus in the coming holiday season when consumers begin to make their choice of gift purchase.It helps to give Apple's shares a boost.‚õ≥Ô∏èWhat's on the menu today?üéÅAt 8.30 pm  we will receive the monthly Core CPI for August. We expect a 0.3% growth  similar to the previous period.The Core CPI  based on month to month basis  is expected to decline by 0.1%. Likewise  we should expect the CPI on a YoY basis to moderate to 8.1% from 8.5%.The data is critical as it will shape the narrative for the week running up to the FOMC meetings. Even if the readings appear softer  it is almost certain that the Fed will raise the interest rate by 0.75%.It is 13 Sept  Tuesday at 9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. It is a critical data day  and Pika World wishes all friends a safe trading week!,btohqsg

This guy have always followed me but always think negative  complain and worry when stock goes against the flow and said ‚ÄòMoya is a bad investment‚Äô.For me  the mind is clear . Clarity is there and so some counters to me is sure win as long as can hold.So  This guy still holds 1000 lots of Moya Asia and he will make at least $22k tomorrow.Question now: Will he wire me some tips as gratitude lol. I guess I already know the answer.,btohqsg

Depends on how Antoni plans to extract it,btohqsg
If he acquires just the water plant  maybe got special dividend  but after that the stock gonna die,btohqsg

üí∞Pika World Daily Review ‚Äì 14 Sept 2022üóΩüí£Inflation is scorching once moreüî´The stock market suffered a rout as inflation figures came in higher than expected. This gives the Fed pull the engine to step on the pedal of lifting the interest rate. The sell-off deepens as the trading continues.The past optimism of the inflation peak suddenly evaporated as market participants were nervous about the Fed‚Äôs tightening cycle. The falling price pressure appeared to be pretty short-lived.Some analysts are betting on even a full percentage rate hike increase. It will be an unprecedented move. The 2-year Treasury yield responded soundly as it hit a 3.75% high. The US Dollar Index naturally move higher as higher bond yield makes holding the greenback more attractive  pulling global capital to the dollar.üéØCracks are forming in the marketüí∏Indeed  as Pika World continue to DCA into an index fund  we are also mindful that the worst might not be over yet. Yesterday saw S&P 500 falling below its 50-day moving average as traders appear to be less confident in purchasing stocks at the current price level. It almost reached the 3900 level  where buyers were seen to step in and push the index higher.üïπProducer Price Index (PPI) up nextüî≠Today we will also receive an essential fundamental indicator of Inflation: the PPI. On Friday  we will also gain insight into Michigan‚Äôs consumer sentiment survey. These are critical data to help us map out the possibility of underlying inflation strength and consumers‚Äô responses to them.Indeed  the PPI is somewhat a forwarder indicator as it shows the change in the price of products by manufacturer  and it could directly feed into the end price sold to consumers. Inflation appears to have also been spread toward other spectrums of the economy  such as services which is a worrying sign as they could be stickier.‚úèÔ∏èWhat‚Äôs on the menu today?üì¶At 8.30 pm  we will receive the monthly Core PPI for August. On a monthly basis  we expect a decline of 0.1%  a much smaller decline from the fall of 0.5% in the prior period.It is 14 Sept  Wednesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. The market is in a risk-off mood again  and Pika World wishes all friends a safe trading week ahead!,btohqsg
Sanli. Bought sanli at 93. Support line + water play,btohqsg
