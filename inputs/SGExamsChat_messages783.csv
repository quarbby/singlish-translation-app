I think anyone can just say they took the circle line on the way to sch and they’d be excused,btohqsg
I wish I could use it as an excuse for my late coming to my office but they know where I live so it won’t work lol,btohqsg
I mean your sch needs not to be along the ccl what. It’s possible that the person takes the ccl along the way to sch but changes train/bus,btohqsg
So very easy to say you got affected,btohqsg
One time I forget to take the slip from the mrt office the discipline master asks me to go back and take 😭,btohqsg
Wait what sch were you from last time,btohqsg

I plan when to Keng in such a way my promotion is not affected,btohqsg
Their superiors just don’t give a damn lol,btohqsg
Anyway NSFs are entitled to 365 days of medical leave a year,btohqsg

SAF can report sick to private/govt polyclinic as much as you want if your superiors don’t care,btohqsg
@POLKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/1970s-hdb-lift-and-nanyang-coffee-roasting-machine-added-to-national-collection?utm_campaignNow that my friends managed to convince the National museum to add a lift  maybe there’s hope you can get the National museum to preserve old trains lol,btohqsg

I said that I have a picture of our president with a very well know american pedo,btohqsg
And I kenna got axed  interestingly. I've said the same thing before at least twice and nothing happened. Yes both times was said after he become president,btohqsg
I didn't even know they had a Tele group hahaha,btohqsg
Other buses I've modeled  yes I modeled this bus as a Singapore bus because it was used in Singapore. But here I converted it to a bus of my own game,btohqsg
Yea drama every other day 🤔😂,btohqsg
Cover image for the sg based bus game I made. All these buses were modeled by me,btohqsg

Person not in sg  he asked because he needs to go sg for business trip,btohqsg
Yea but he will get into trouble if he ever returns,btohqsg
Unless he renounced sg citizenship then idk if it becomes not ns default,btohqsg
Can  but idt u can pass to me,btohqsg
Depends. It seems like he doesn't even have an address on file.,btohqsg
NS default requires that notice be given.. if there is no address there is literally no notice reminding him of the obligation,btohqsg
Just avoid SG imo but if cannot then just gamble and have a good lawyer on speed dial because i think this case can probably get away with just a fine,btohqsg
I mean u can buy the seasoning if I remember correctly. It's usually an option for the fish too,btohqsg
👑 Queen of Tears has dethroned Crash Landing On You as South Korean TV channel tvN's highest-rated drama of all time.https://cna.asia/3UhUbPxDid you catch the 109-minute finale?,btohqsg

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6SOO-sPoiv/?igsh=MWt0M2dhN2h1NGxjYQ==i want try reading it but holy fuck why is his accent sounding like a douche bag,btohqsg
His undergraduate till PhD studies were all completed overseas. Think he might have spent at least 10 years overseas. He might have picked up an accent during his time overseas la. He worked overseas for quite some time as well,btohqsg
My accent is of the 字正腔圆 阴阳上去 type,btohqsg
ye  think i saw an interview of his talking abt it he really liked studying apparently,btohqsg
got like a degree for all kinds of studies,btohqsg
actually curious what does it take to go those overseas super good unis  assume need both 90rp and super strong extracurriculars,btohqsg
i legit lazy to comment much so just 💀,btohqsg
I’m sure about that. But the fact that he is an associate professor now  I guess we can say he has a strong interest in his area of studies,btohqsg
I choose the wrong womb fr,btohqsg
insane how he can balance both being a politician and a prof,btohqsg
So many politicians who are also holding appointments in private sector. This is marketed as a strength in our political system,btohqsg
ye ik  many come from diff backgrounds,btohqsg
but i thought most of them is like retired into politics kinda?,btohqsg
Nope. That is very far from the truth haha,btohqsg
Our parliament is made up of multi-hyphenates,btohqsg
oso random but  do MPs not knock on ur door if its closed when they are doing their outreach thing,btohqsg
in my like almost 8 yrs here nvr had my mp knock on my door,btohqsg
My mp has only came to my hse once in the last 13y,btohqsg
And that was coz my parents were complaining about stray cats,btohqsg
What the heck is a house visit,btohqsg
when your superior wants to check whether you a chaogeng warrior,btohqsg
Never heard of that before.. I private property condo..,btohqsg
Last time I saw my MP was during the switch and they only show face at the club house,btohqsg
only hdb they do i think,btohqsg
sheesh wow i would just spam mc in NS if i live in a condo like that,btohqsg
Exactly my point.. when asked for comment all I said to the officer was does this mean I don't get free healthcare,btohqsg
cus condo mostly under the management of the condo,btohqsg
He told me to fuck off,btohqsg
They come before lmao the security guard can stall and call,btohqsg
U got 15-30 mins to fucking zao back,btohqsg
i think my mp came last yr for some outreach thingy  cant rmbr  but yea they knock quite loudly  but my fam nvr ans so they left some pamphlet thingy at our door,btohqsg
Hi Calista  I just want to give you a heads up  will be conducting a community outreach program at your house later this afternoon.,btohqsg
They always post about it  then I be like I don’t see them at my house,btohqsg
Real…but opposition came to my house before,btohqsg
They only come when they need their seat,btohqsg
Tbh I dun even know where and when are the mps…anyway I hv no time to care about such things,btohqsg
If it's a backbencher it doesn't rlly matter too they just gonna get carried by the anchor.. they just show up to sign for the MPS sessions and that's it,btohqsg
My grc has 3 cabinet ministers,btohqsg
They are that worried to give my grc 3,btohqsg
My has that and that's about it,btohqsg
They scared of Nicole Seah and then moved him from Tampines,btohqsg
Wp said it was like a few minutes before the closing deadline of nomination  they hopped him over,btohqsg
About that... no more Nicole liao but honestly don't think it makes a difference,btohqsg
Actually wp would hv won if Heng swee Kiat did not move to East Coast tbh,btohqsg
He back then was the heir apparent,btohqsg
Nicole Seah was popular but she screwd up…in politics  just 1 mistake to screw you,btohqsg
Yeah it was damn close even with HSK,btohqsg
Another shock close was West Coast,btohqsg
That one for next election is legit gonna be gg,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure pap will find its way,btohqsg
They moved ng Chee Meng out of Sengkang,btohqsg
If they do means they conceded Sengkang,btohqsg
Also need to find another anchor for Marine Parade,btohqsg
Their new Sengkang grc for ge2024 dun seem to have anchor leh,btohqsg
So I think they probably choose to concede Sengkang (just like Aljunied),btohqsg
Ya probably means they cut their loses and consolidate,btohqsg
Coz they dun want to lose their ministers,btohqsg
Ok not really cabinet  2 cabinet + 1 speaker,btohqsg
The new speaker is in Marine Parade lol,btohqsg
See Leng and Edwin Tong alone is also cmi,btohqsg
Anyway they already revealed the full Marine Parade team,btohqsg
Cannot shift so they probably gonna take the risk,btohqsg
There are 2 ministers and the speaker of parliament,btohqsg
But they are not particularly strong anchors,btohqsg
All are the current gen one,btohqsg
What if they go for Aljunied,btohqsg
What next they gonna go for Hougang?,btohqsg
Tbh I doubt so…unless something happened to Pritam,btohqsg
But wp need find new good mps..can’t rely on the old ones,btohqsg
one spot not so important to them,btohqsg
Now only mainly hv he ting ru  Jamus lim  denis,btohqsg
Maybe can move He Ting Ru to East Coast,btohqsg
The wp at Hougang is strong so defo not,btohqsg
Sengkang is 3 vs 4 already ?,btohqsg
And + wp won Hougang by a higher proportion than Aljunied,btohqsg
and its one spot in parliament not so important to them,btohqsg
Neh they already lost 1 mp in Sengkang,btohqsg
And he ting ru herself ain’t strong enough to tank,btohqsg
And also I dunno if husband and wife in same grc will be weird,btohqsg
Cuz Pritiam and Sylvia gonna sit their ass in Aljunied,btohqsg
Their Aljunied grc is probably gonna remained strongly fielded,btohqsg
Coz wp wun want to risk losing that,btohqsg
With Sylvia and Pritam tbh I think is enough to carry,btohqsg
And plus I’m just praying that Pritam court case goes fine,btohqsg
It has went down to slight margins,btohqsg
I tot it was like 59.95,btohqsg
WP would be bigger if they had the power to compete in every grc,btohqsg
I think they will never change Aljunied tbh…,btohqsg
They only won Hougang by big margin,btohqsg
Oh yea I heard he coming to Marine Parade,btohqsg
not as close as 2015 though,btohqsg
Aljunied mp has stayed that same 4-5 for that long  they wun change tbh,btohqsg
this time they will remind you its 10th,btohqsg
Unless u managed to kill off another founding father then yes,btohqsg
But all dead liao maybe u kill GCT,btohqsg
I’m voting this year and I can tell you I wun care about it when casting my vote,btohqsg
Yeah.. noAlso LKY literally said he dw to be worshiped,btohqsg
not sure if they respect him,btohqsg
Problem is their manpower not their power,btohqsg
And also yea they also need to fight w the other oppositions coz 3 way fight is not it,btohqsg
only way is to do some coalition with the shitty parties,btohqsg
Neh Singapore wun be going for that,btohqsg
WP don't do 3 ways one their strategy is just focus on East for now,btohqsg
And then make sure to be the only opposition,btohqsg
Tbh Pritam has said no to this,btohqsg
By product of our first past the post winner takes all system,btohqsg
U will have a 2 party system for that no matter what it's damn annoying and honestly no one talks about electoral reform. It would be much better to have a proportional representation system,btohqsg
Nvr seen before in my entire life,btohqsg
Like primary sch we used the normal projectors but our projector is much much smaller and portable than that,btohqsg
Oh god am i old or are you too young,btohqsg

But yea I have never seen such a projector b4,btohqsg

"""where the borders should be drawn"" what subject is that?",btohqsg
My friend told me malaysia kfc much nicer than sg one,btohqsg
But tbh i only like the tender chicken and mash potato,btohqsg
Last time the coleslaw was nice but now meh meh,btohqsg
UK one best  but they dh mashed potato,btohqsg
It's also a fast food chain in Malaysia,btohqsg
SG has one but in sentosa I think,btohqsg
uk what fried chicken is best? those u get from the western store at kopitiam,btohqsg
With PR also those Singaporeans who want a pap govt but vote for more reputable opposition parties like the wp might end up changing their vote to pap instead. Cos they know that there would be enough opposition supporters to ensure that they would be sufficiently represented in parliament. At the same time if we adopt a a mixed member proportional representation system which combines both FPTP and PR (such as in New Zealnd)  there might be some who split their ticket. For example  for the constituency MP they may vote for the pap if they think the person makes a better municipal MP (like lee bee wah)  but for the party list  they may vote for the opposition if they want them to be sufficiently represented in parliament. There will also be voters who want pap to form government and will hence vote for the pap in the party list vote  but if they particularly like their opposition mp may choose to vote for them for the constituency MP.It would also be interesting to see what proportion of seats come from FPTP and what comes from PR as well. Personally  I think NCMPs should be abolished and there should be a certain percentage of seats allocated to PR. Could be something like 2/3 from FPTP  1/3 from PR.,btohqsg
ok at least it’s not the Netherlands proportional system,btohqsg
Even without PR  I think at the very least FPTP should be replaced with a supplementary vote system or ranked choice/preferential voting. This will encourage more political participation at least  as different parties would have less incentive to step out of a race to avoid a multi cornered contest. With preferential voting in Australia  this has helped to elect more members on the cross bench.,btohqsg
change to Don Don Donki Food Hall?,btohqsg
Yeah if they allocate everything to PR and leave no seats for FPTP where winner takes all  it could make it harder to form stable governments. But at the same time  for PR  there are different ways it can be implemented. Some PR methods can help to favour the larger parties  and would award them bonuses/ a larger proportion of seats than the proportion of votes they got to increase the likelihood of stable governments forming. Turkey adopts a voting system called the d’hondt method which favours larger political parties.,btohqsg
Wise choice. If they partner up with opposition parties that keep fooling around they’ll be dragged down together. The WP members were very wise not to endorse anyone in the 2023 presidential election unlike some others.,btohqsg
I think he will likely just be fined at most  but below the threshold for him to be forced to vacate his seat,btohqsg
Also lolol I got blocked from Pritam’s Facebook page last time when I commented something regarding the Raeesah Khan saga. I wasn’t even saying anything insulting so idk why it happened. I hope it wasn’t Pritam himself who did it but just one of his aides,btohqsg
it is probably an assistant who runs his page,btohqsg
Found Yeo's and Milo in the middle of Ohio,btohqsg
I hope so. If I ever see Pritam I will ask him because I genuinely hope it wasn’t him,btohqsg
Surprisingly for Seng Kang Lam Pin Min was kept there,btohqsg
I guess the pap leaders are not as keen to get him back into parliament compared to Ng Chee Meng lol,btohqsg
Hihi  did you get your free burger yesterday? Issit yummy? Wahaha,btohqsg
Could also have the opposite effect  cos now that they compete in all  ppl who want a pap government but want some minor opposition representation  in parliament would be scared that they win all and end up not voting wp instead. Whereas if the wp just contested in a small proportion of seats  they know that those unknown/clown opposition parties would have no chance of winning. So they can safely vote for the wp without worrying about the opposition forming government. In 2015  the wp contested almost 1/3 of the seats and besides the lky factor  that could be one reason why they did not do very well then. In addition  if they put up candidates in all constituencies they would be taking away resources from seats where they have a real chance of winning  and may also end up worsening their relationship with other opposition parties.,btohqsg
Actually  in the 1991 general election  Chiam see tong and some opposition leaders deliberately tried to convince opposition parties to field candidates to contest less than half the seats so that there are enough walkovers to guarantee the pap would return to power on nomination day. So on election day  people could vote the opposition without having to worry about the pap not forming government. They called this the “by election effect”  where more people were likely to vote the opposition knowing that the pap would not lose power just from losing a seat/a few seats. And the opposition did quite well that election compared to previous ones.,btohqsg
"""The WP has been open about its electoral agenda for some years now. The medium-term goal is to play our part in ensuring at least one-third of Parliament is not in the PAP's hands "" he (Singh) wrote.It is not in WP’s goal to do so. In fact  a political analyst recently mischaracterised WP’s plan in The Straits Times and had since apologised:https://mothership.sg/2024/04/pritam-singh-error-apologise/",btohqsg
There is a threshold and his fine must not exceed (i cant rmb if it is $1k or $10k),btohqsg
Tbh i feel bad for him…like technically not his fault,btohqsg
Yea wp was asked that qns but chooses to siam answering,btohqsg
Ahhh okie. My friends are curious about the taste hahaha okok,btohqsg
Has to be less than 10k,btohqsg

BK and KFC also introduced new burgers,btohqsg
i ended up buying 2 burgers to eat by myself,btohqsg
Coz the queue for free burgers was too long so you bought your own?,btohqsg
ran out of stock by the time i got there and asked the store manager,btohqsg
lady luck wasn't on our side i guess 😢,btohqsg
Seems like McD has free stuff from time to time. Better luck next time~~,btohqsg
tried to stop eating mac but only last 2 weeks 💀,btohqsg
i have not eaten macs in 2 months,btohqsg
I wake up to see an entire essay... Singapore is a small ass country proportional representation could literally be along the lines of party list PR which is what Korea has for the National Assembly. Keeps the FPTP system while making sure the national vote tallies with the same amount of seats.,btohqsg
The spolier effect is a separate issue which I think is almost impossible to fix in our current political climate. Ranked Choice Voting is sometime I desperately want as well but it will never happen precisely because the parties will lose power immediately when implemented. I don't think anyone even the strongest sinkie will vote 10/10 for a PAP candidate,btohqsg
Not to mention ret*rds who have no idea how those work.. we have trouble getting boomers to even cross a fucking box properly ffs,btohqsg
imo a 3 seat GRC system+direct proportional voting might work bttr,btohqsg
Fuck the GRC system just make them all into SMCs,btohqsg
U want racial equality sure. Make certain districts disproportionatly Indian or Malay Voters,btohqsg
Either that or designate that certain SMCs can only have candidates of that race,btohqsg
wouldnt the taiwanese system be bttr then?,btohqsg
I mean we literally model it based on that system,btohqsg
Exactly the GRC itself was so they could pack districts,btohqsg
the SG system doesnt allow for defections,btohqsg
It doesn't even allow for PAP MPs to vote otherwise lmao,btohqsg
Even so most dun dare say no,btohqsg
when have they even lifted the whip?,btohqsg
i remb once it was on a abortion bill in SG  they lifted it,btohqsg
and even if WP comes in power  its not like the whip will be lifted for WP,btohqsg
The NMP scheme I think TCB voted against that,btohqsg
that goes to the extent of UK  US elections,btohqsg

Using an open list or closed list?,btohqsg
Still maintains party autonomy to choose,btohqsg
Tbh even with multi cornered fights as long as the opposition party contesting is not reputable they won’t win much votes. Just look at the 1992 Marine Parade grc by election and Pasir Punggol grc in 2020.But yeah it does help increase participation and Oppo parties are more likely to field candidates in more constituencies,btohqsg
lol maybe we can just have supplementary voting at least? Can’t be that hard to get people to understand how to tick a second box,btohqsg
With GRC tho even the smallest vote share is like enough in terms of gaining 1-2 seats,btohqsg
Some seats were less than 4 percentage points from being won by the opposition  if those seats were won we would have had quite a few more opposition MPs then,btohqsg
Dk if it's just tactical voting but still means 30-40k ppls votes just remains unrepresented,btohqsg
It have never found a single pap MP who actually voted against it lol. At most it was just an abstention. tan Cheng bock who claimed he did but apparently he was lying  I checked all the parliamentary records and those motions against the NMP scheme he voted against  the whip was lifted. When the constitution was amended to increase the number of NMPs and the whip was not lifted  TCB merely abstained instead of voting against. But at least they still can choose to just not vote at all if they strongly disagree with the government. Inderjit Singh did exactly dad for the population white paper in 2013,btohqsg
He did not actually vote against the whip,btohqsg
Tbh I find it surprising none of the pap members bothered exposing it but wtv lol,btohqsg
I mean he did receive a warning for the action tho,btohqsg
Dk if it's just the threat of voting against,btohqsg
If we do that it’s better since old ppl won’t figure out how to do RCV with party list lol. But Australia has been doing that in some state elections and I think for their senate too,btohqsg
Pap MPs have complained about it in debates too,btohqsg
Back in the 90s it was especially after the kicking of Barisan out,btohqsg
At the end of the day they still vote Aye,btohqsg
Our standing rules are a fucking joke as well,btohqsg
In the past when GCT wanted to introduce the NMP scheme there was this sunset clause to appease many of the pap MPs who were uncomfortable of implementing it. So at the beginning of each parliament term  in order to have NMPs they would have to pass a motion that “this parliament should have NMPs”. TCB voted against all of them at the start of each parliament  and in 2002  pap MP Leong horn Kee joined him. But the motions all had the whip lifted so TCB never voted against any of them. In 1990  TCB voted for the NMP scheme when the whip was not lifted  and in 1997 when the constitution was amended to provide up to 9 NMPs from 6 previously  TCB abstained.,btohqsg
Yeah but also they can choose not to vote by not being present in the chamber. It does feel weird if the MP speaks against it but is forced to vote for it though,btohqsg
Even if abstain the motion will still pass assuming quorum,btohqsg
From the 2002 motion to have NMPsMr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):Mr Speaker  Sir  first  I would like to thank you for allowing me to join in this debate on Nominated MPs (NMPs).The objective of the NMP scheme is  of course  laudable. As explained by theLeader of the House  Mr Wong  the addition of up to nine NMPs will add to the quality of the debate in this House. I surmise therefore that the NMP scheme is introduced not so much due to the lack of PAP MPs  but to overcome the lack of opposing and discerning views in Parliament  arising from the lack of Opposition MPs.Sir  allow me to state my case on why I feel that for this new Parliament  there is no need for an NMP scheme  in spite of the fact that there continues to be a paucity of Opposition Members in this House. I would like to bring up some new angles  instead of what some Members have claimed to be old angles  as raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock. There are many reasons why this new term of Parliament could do away with NMPs. I think the NMP scheme has been useful in the past  but I think it will serve limited use in the future.My first point is that for this new session of Parliament  the PAP Whip will be lifted. That makes a big difference. The Leader of the House has said that in cases of certain Bills that are not critical - even the PM himself has said so - he will allow PAP MPs to speak up  which means that now  except for some critical Bills  we have a new body of MPs to take on issues - the PAP MPs. With this new Parliament  the new PAP MPs  as well as the old PAP MPs  can therefore speak with more conviction and freedom. Their views on Government policy can be more engaging. In the past  we all know that the PAP MPs' mouths had been gagged. We could not speak up  because there was a Whip behind us.Some hon. Members:No.Mr Leong Horn Kee:You can speak against it  but you have to vote for it. It sounds very illogical. Anyway  now that the Whip has been lifted for those who want to speak  I think they can speak more readily and more heartily. But  of course  they have to be responsible for whatever they say. Therefore  I think we do not need more NMPs  because we already have such a large body of PAP MPs. This is one major difference.Sir  the second difference I would like to say is that we now have a large quantity and quality of MPs  and new PAP MPs  in this Parliament. There are 24 new PAP MPs and one new NCMP. Certainly  with these 25 new faces put together  and with the old existing veteran MPs  what more views can be offered in this House and not more effective that can be covered.We have heard how well most of the MPs who have spoken - all the 50-over of them - how well they have covered their points  and how eloquent they are. As you have seen  even including a poem by my GRC colleague  Dr Ng Eng Hen. And also we just saw this morning how well a new Minister of State  Dr Balaji  had fielded the barrage of questions from the other MPs. Many of these questions are from the new MPs themselves. So these are examples that we are going to have good debate in this House with this new crop of good MPs.Sir  even the hon. Member  Mr Chiam - I remember he told me just two days ago - that it was most refreshing to hear our new PAP MPs speak. Is that not right?Mr Chiam See Tong:Right.,btohqsg
You can see also that some pap MPs were dissatisfied with the party whip  but tbh most political parties in Singapore would rather have them for the sake of stability,btohqsg
Oh don't get me wrong a party whip is still a role that needs to be done.,btohqsg
It's just without defections plus a whip just means there is literally no choice,btohqsg
But also I don’t know why some of Mr Leong Horn kee’s pap colleagues disagreed with him when he said that the whip prevented them from speaking up  that dude was speaking facts,btohqsg
Even for the MPs whom are supposed to be the literal lawmakers,btohqsg
Yeah good for stability but it makes them vote against their conscience at times,btohqsg
lol kj is still railing against the wp since he thinks wp sidelined jbj,btohqsg
Kj is no jbj for sure,btohqsg
I mean lifting the defections Clause would still ensure a functional democracy and would be inline with the Westminster system,btohqsg
The defections clause should still exist for votes of confidence and supply imo,btohqsg
The moment they vote against I do think it’s reasonable for them to be expelled,btohqsg
They should also not be allowed to switch or resign from the party,btohqsg
Defections are a different procedural method than Confidence and supply agreements,btohqsg
Allowing defections just lifts the caps and places more independent MPs,btohqsg
They can still caucus with PAP,btohqsg
I mean if an MP was elected on a party ticket  they ought to at least take the same position as the party for votes relating to confidence and supply to ensure stability,btohqsg
It’s not reasonable to allow them to cross the floor on such occasions,btohqsg
Which again.. is so because of the GRC system,btohqsg
If it's an SMC the MP was elected on their individual merits,btohqsg
those small parties are pretty ass,btohqsg
Nah I legit don’t think that should be allowed. If they can resign and join another party/become independent they may not support the party’s position that they were elected on. Like imagine if pap formed government with a one vote majority  but their MP defects to the opposition and brings down the government. Not a good idea. If he really disagrees with them he should not be allowed to switch without a by election where the MP can get a fresh mandate from the voters,btohqsg
True  with the grc system I guess it fosters more camaraderie since they’re like forced to stick together. It kind of brings them closer to the party  since they also won’t want to betray their friends that they campaigned with,btohqsg
Erm bringing down the government.Have u ever heard of a minority government,btohqsg
Even with just a 1 vote majority and defection it would still be fine assuming u get a compromise with member of other parties then,btohqsg
In fact it's better to force Bipartisan solutions sometimes,btohqsg
I’m saying if they change sides and back a no confidence motion by the opposition when they were previously a ruling party MP  I don’t think it should be allowed,btohqsg
Allows for idiotic plans to be cut down,btohqsg
minoritiy governments would require confidence and supply which really is er..,btohqsg
They can still choose to bring down the government if the other opposition parties refuse to do any confidence and supply deals,btohqsg
i mean look at scotland rn  for the SNP  they might have to govern with alba after a new FM is chosen,btohqsg
Even if they did push a motion of no confidence unless the entire opposition votes Aye it will not pass,btohqsg
And also even if the vote of no confidence goes through without an alternative arrangement the now minority government will continue over as caretaker,btohqsg
So it will still be fine,btohqsg
Belgium had a caretaker government for like years lmao,btohqsg
Well that’s assuming if they don’t do that. It’s possible the other side completely refuses to work with the ruling party and are hell bent on bringing down the government,btohqsg
Won’t it force a snap election?,btohqsg
Actually can send me the link lol I want to take a look,btohqsg
U don't have to do so it can be totally up to the executive branch,btohqsg
If the government is not able to function at all tbh and has to keep on negotiating or held hostage by other opposition parties to get sufficient votes what’s the point tbh  if at the previous election the voters delivered then the mandate to govern in majority but because of some MPs who defect midway through the parliamentary term that’s not happening,btohqsg
Also motions of no confidence aren't totally bad u can have motions which purposefully test the government's support on certain issues,btohqsg
everytime i open this chat  always got random wall of texts,btohqsg
Depends on what u mean by function confidence and supply agreements could still be drawn up or if there's a deadlock or hung parliament the previous budget could be used as the current budget to tide things over,btohqsg
Or the threshold for supply motions could be lowered to ensure funding,btohqsg
wait whats the diff btwn conf+supply and coalition?,btohqsg
Depends on country but broadly conf+supply is more lax,btohqsg
PH  BN and PN are equally shit,btohqsg
even as a harapan supporter  god damn bro  malaysia regardless of whos PM will drive malaysia into the ground,btohqsg
That one is systemic issues that u can't just pin on electoral system liao,btohqsg
I always thought in the case of no confidence motions  regardless of what the issue is about  if the government fails it they’d had to call snap elections. Even if that’s not the case in some countries  I’m pretty sure it is for most.But anyway  I think that as long as MPs are elected on the ticket of a party  they ought to be forced to at least support them on issues concerning whether the government can function. Even if there’s no snap elections and all that  the caretaker government would be forced into doing deals with opposition parties when they were supposed to have the mandate to govern in majority the last election. They should not be forced to bend to the opposition’s demands unless that’s what voters want by delivering a hung parliament imo,btohqsg
Not necessarily and sometimes the threat of a no confidence motion is enough.,btohqsg
The British PM resigning was because she knew she was fucked and that allowed for the party itself to reshuffle and place a new PM,btohqsg
and like bersatu and the party-hopping shit,btohqsg
the tories are fucked this yr (good thing),btohqsg
wanna see how badly they do in this week's local election,btohqsg
Yala  but it’s also a different story if an MP wants to defect even if their own leader screwed up. If they don’t support the leader they can always defect provided that they resign and re contest the election in their constituency. In the case of PR  the party on which they were elected on can select a replacement by going down the party list,btohqsg
Ya u can have compromises that ensures both sides remain unhappy but happy enough to grumble along,btohqsg
Yeah that’s precisely why I think the anti party hopping law is needed. But it’s kind of like karma catching up to them LOL  in 2020 some PKR MPs defected to bersartu during the Sheraton move  now the reverse is happening,btohqsg
That's what politics is meant to be,btohqsg
I hope they win less than 100 seats,btohqsg
then there nearly was the dubai move,btohqsg
i want a labour-libdem govt but nvm,btohqsg
Not happening for the next parliament at least,btohqsg
Tbh I don’t know the details of what exactly was discussed during that meeting,btohqsg
imo itd be along the lines of 360-400 for labour,btohqsg
up by 10  but they only seem to do well in by-elections,btohqsg
Bipartisanship is good but like also I feel like parties shouldn’t be forced to work together if they are completely incompatible  and if a member of a party does not support the party’s agenda and wishes to quit the voters of the constituency in which the mp was elected should have to approve of that move  which can be done via by elections,btohqsg
Probably think it will swing to Labour but result in a hung parliament,btohqsg
I think they will get a landslide similar to Tony Blair’s 1997 election,btohqsg
The local elections on Thursday would be a good bellwether,btohqsg
At least they can spoil the election for the Tory scum further,btohqsg
but what are lee anderson's chance at re-election,btohqsg
Idk but all the MRP polls suggest that reform would win 0,btohqsg
Nigel farage pls campaign more for reform,btohqsg
Goes to show the changing ideologies of a party,btohqsg
It's almost impossible for a party to keep the same shit for years,btohqsg
no way one can be in corbyn's labour and defect to bojo's/may tory,btohqsg
No way  if they are on Corbyn’s side they’d probably just remain independent or join parties like the Greens/George Galloway’s party,btohqsg
Ya lmao u didn't know that hahahha,btohqsg
I wonder if Corbyn would contest as an independent though,btohqsg
That was why he actively campaign and it worked for the brexit vote,btohqsg
Ya but can’t win a seat for himself in the British parliament,btohqsg
The anti immigration parties are expected to do well,btohqsg
If he does I hope he can win,btohqsg
The more Farage campaigns  the more votes reform would steal from the Tories -> increase Tory attrition,btohqsg
Oh I kind of liked the policies he was proposing,btohqsg
Anyway now that he’s not labour leader more people are comfortable of switching to labour from Tories,btohqsg
Which is good cos in the short term we need the Tories out at least  in the future we can think of stuff like hung parliaments being more common and having a labour/lib dem government,btohqsg
There are some ppl who speculate that Starmer will be a radical leader and implement many reforms if he wins government  but he’s not saying he would be one cos that will scare away some voters. They think that Starmer would be like Clement Attlee 2.0 which I honestly hope so. Attlee did many good things for the UK like the NHS,btohqsg
Ahh lib dems.. we will support you if you make us Deputy,btohqsg
i have that small hope theyd rejoin the EU,btohqsg
Didn’t go well for Nick Clegg at all lol,btohqsg
wtf happened to him 9 yrs later,btohqsg
Tbh even for Cameron it didn't end well,btohqsg
Unless Starmer u turns  not happening. But if a referendum were held now I’m sure they’d say yes,btohqsg
He lost his seat and went to take some other job,btohqsg
We will follow the British publics mandateProceeds to resign,btohqsg
Lib dem voters hated the coalition and punished them heavily in the 2015 elections,btohqsg
lib dem js wanted power back then,btohqsg
Tbh I think they still want that now,btohqsg
