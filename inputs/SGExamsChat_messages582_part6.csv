If you know what you're doing,btohqsg
no i just procrastinate so i end up having to do things last min,btohqsg
so the best thing to do,btohqsg
but end of the day up to the zl person,btohqsg
is to make it so my last min work is as good as possible,btohqsg
Econs n geog cramming last min is ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
cos she also say if not she just marry a rich guy ðŸ’€,btohqsg
but also bc i do physics so the last min cramming is gonna be v different from like,btohqsg
I mean gfu can work under pressure,btohqsg
Can't wait to be back there,btohqsg
but rn i can't last min my work,btohqsg
if i try to last min,btohqsg
Same I do consistent style cuz my workload,btohqsg
I'm not doing commerce in Uni,btohqsg
So wot now? Ur actually forced to manage Ur time wisely?,btohqsg
yea i take like half an hour every week to allocate time to do each thing,btohqsg
bc my work doesn't typically have an end point,btohqsg
so if i don't allocate i'll be in trouble,btohqsg
Ahh don't u need a timetable for that tho,btohqsg
But ya don't worry I swear I nvr take up more work alrd,btohqsg
(someone asked me if I sign up for SMO tho),btohqsg
in uni i could still last min ba and only had a study schedule for finals period,btohqsg
I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH SHIT,btohqsg
but now my phd work is kinda hard,btohqsg
it varies  i didnt use a timetable in JC,btohqsg
my supervising prof gives me 10 things to do and if i last min or hyperfocus on one,btohqsg
I honestly will kinda need it,btohqsg
i have 9 things not done,btohqsg
you got insane physics skill as passsive though,btohqsg
Else I'll defo waste it all just crocheting,btohqsg
ya it varies lor  person to person  i function with a mentality of ''I will do as much as I can whenever I can'' so I still get things done,btohqsg
my time allocation now is more just making a bit of progress for each item then move on,btohqsg
instead of a set amount of time,btohqsg
no one in their right mind would put themselves to do h2 geog twice,btohqsg
The new h2 geog is bs,btohqsg
Its abit harder in the sense that its less interconnected,btohqsg
the current geog syllabus everything interconnected one,btohqsg
so u study one chapter the content is replicable somewhere else,btohqsg
Idk abt H2 for obv reasons,btohqsg
cuz the broad theme is the same,btohqsg
same cluster normally is kinda interlinked one,btohqsg
last time 9751 syllabus different themes still is interlinked,btohqsg
Ohya content we have like 1 cluster,btohqsg
How do geog ppl even ace geog,btohqsg
C1: Development and ResourcesC2: Tropical EnvironmentsC3: the same as the H1 one,btohqsg
Like I got f9 for Os egeog,btohqsg
It's not even pure geog ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I did pure geog got A2,btohqsg
i had a friend who jumped from u to A,btohqsg
And believe it or not  I actually chose the wrong sub combi LOL it was supposed to be ehist instead,btohqsg
