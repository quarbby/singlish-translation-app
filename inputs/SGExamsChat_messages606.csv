Bro I'm telling you worst case for me is ntu applied physics,btohqsg
I've nvr heard of one that don't need interview,btohqsg
If I get less than 63rp I'm going SIT,btohqsg
50 60rp people even can go in,btohqsg
But that is if your portfolio good lah,btohqsg
I'll probably go for gaming design and user experience in sit,btohqsg
I rather die in physics than chem,btohqsg
i was high 60s and had to do an admission test,btohqsg
but hmm decent grades and great portfolio ok,btohqsg
i got full marks for 2 of my tests,btohqsg
Good as in lots of shit in it ah,btohqsg
I'm dumb so what aptitude means? Like ur recent score,btohqsg

But won't they do that in interview,btohqsg
Lol nvm I just rmb there's also another aptitude test right,btohqsg
1h 30min in front of laptop,btohqsg

I nvr hear anyone talk abt sit,btohqsg
People desperately wanting to come into ntu physics,btohqsg
While im just here floating my way through,btohqsg
the course are set in a way to make u fail or barely pass,btohqsg
No matter how hard u try ah,btohqsg
my that friend is my phd buddy,btohqsg
and the culture for digipen abit bad,btohqsg
so he transferred with his sights set on becoming a scientist,btohqsg
even if u got the notes from senior  they wont share around,btohqsg

Pls some of the phones that kids have rn are bigger than their face,btohqsg
You just observe irl can alr,btohqsg
i only change phone cause the old one really cmi alr,btohqsg
Screen size is at least half of their face and more,btohqsg
The amt of kids that own phones rn is quite concerning,btohqsg
Idk why parents let them indulge in it at such a young age,btohqsg
I see it among infants also wdf,btohqsg
im p sure i only got to touch phones in like prisch,btohqsg
One iPad for an infant in a baby chair,btohqsg
i think my class kids didnt bring phones,btohqsg
got 1 girl only bring 1 pen to sch,btohqsg
then got a few with the smiggle pencilcase with calculator,btohqsg
It would be funny if the phone dh data tho,btohqsg
that was like my dream in prisch omg,btohqsg
*Downloads offline games with WiFi and proceeds to play ltr when outside*,btohqsg
Then got one guy his tablemate keep touching his pencilcase and brush eraser dust to his table,btohqsg
then the dude with pencilcase buaysong,btohqsg
Lol peak sch drama be like,btohqsg
actl when i saw them fighting i was like,btohqsg
i still used this in sec2,btohqsg
rn i js use transparent one that can bring to exams,btohqsg
do yall think its difficult to fail olvl english or nah,btohqsg
but where is your current standard haha,btohqsg
i come from like maybe top 20 sg sec sch but,btohqsg
my english always d7-c6 for the weighted assessments,btohqsg
like its one mark from passingüò•,btohqsg
idk if its my sch standard diff or what,btohqsg
idk abt my paper one cuz,btohqsg
ok la if ur sch papers damn hard means o level should improve lor,btohqsg
my sch lc not hard eh,btohqsg
I think I fail my el,btohqsg
lc 10% only dont worry too much,btohqsg
then like i took my own sweet time to write the starting stuff,btohqsg
then the main plot i compress in the end cuz,btohqsg
It really varies from person to person,btohqsg
Different ppl have diff strengths and qualities,btohqsg
but i eae must pass englishüò•,btohqsg
Eh does your sch set v hard papers to begin with,btohqsg
idk fr other subj cuz i nv compare,btohqsg
ok la i say my own exp. my sec sch actually near your one. sst el papers also pretty hard. Hard until entire cohort only handful of A2s and no A1s. I prelim C6 jump to B3 for O level,btohqsg
the listening they gave everyone close to full marks cuz,btohqsg
Oh it's time management then  I mean you can practice the same type of qns that you'd normally choose to write for compo ah,btohqsg
Then you focus mainly on that,btohqsg
cuz like i normal write uh,btohqsg
but then my tcher say i shld write situational,btohqsg
Wait wym are u talking abt SW or like essay,btohqsg
so i basically only wrote situational once for the past four years before gg in for olvl,btohqsg
that one fun to write  ok one,btohqsg
It must be realistic and practical,btohqsg
ok what if like the main point never write alot,btohqsg
I focused on that and screwed other types of writing,btohqsg
but the infront bs write too much,btohqsg
got vocab and stuff will fail onot,btohqsg
Normally you have the intro   building block then climax   ending and conclusion,btohqsg
my building block too much i think,btohqsg
it took up like half the story,btohqsg
Ah so ig it's like too much suspense?,btohqsg
like i keep yapping and never get to the point,btohqsg
What I can advise is that I imagine a slope uk like this slope,btohqsg
So I visualize this in case my building block too much ü§°  it's like getting to the top of the mountain(climax)  and when u reach it   you'd want to release like a sudden BANG/BURST of energy,btohqsg
yaa like ik how to write but,btohqsg
its cuz i got too much stuff to write but i write too slow so i needed to push everything to last few paragraphs,btohqsg
Yea I time myself and used that  goofy  method so I don't digress  I'd roughly figure out the flow I want my story to go/end,btohqsg
Imo I have to brainstorm/map cause I think of alot of impulsive shit,btohqsg
"That was the only way I improved my compo LOL squeezing and investing time into that then when I think I ok alr   I challange myself with diff and and write out ""actual quality"" compo then hand up to cher",btohqsg
I got lucky A2 for English,btohqsg
My cher say my essays all borderline A,btohqsg
i never got A for english ever,btohqsg
My English teacher was the discipline master,btohqsg
Same  I studied in Fernvale Primary School and graduated in 2018.,btohqsg
Gimme I only got b3 after 2 times retake,btohqsg
I think this year the Os eng syallubus changed,btohqsg
my eng cher in p6 always gave us food. somehow even tho she was quite good i only ended up with a c,btohqsg
ik somehow still managed to do el sbb in sec sch,btohqsg
