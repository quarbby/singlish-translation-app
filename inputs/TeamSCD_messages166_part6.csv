cs3 is a good starter car tbh.,btohqsg

Vios  altis  cs3  Lancer ex  jazz/fit  avante  cerato ,btohqsg
I wouldnt recommend any vw for first car,btohqsg
Try to stay away from conti cars as first cars,btohqsg
Not bc of car price  it's the one during the ownership of the conti cars,btohqsg
Hahah the price to pay to own a Conti car,btohqsg
But to compare roc and golf,btohqsg
Get 6 speed instead of 7 speed,btohqsg
But u get 1.4 uk cfm something will spoil,btohqsg
U get R nth will spoil LOL,btohqsg
Common misconception 1.4 if taken care properly quite sturdy however more likely to spoil as compared to 2 / R,btohqsg
2 / R spoil the bank will break ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
That one not bad  if not the 2door version also good,btohqsg
R only need to change clutch pack / MU if rly suay,btohqsg
1.4 need do the whole thing,btohqsg
U change both MU and clutch oso cheaper than 1.4 gb overhaul,btohqsg
No kids yet enjoy a 2 seater while u can. Copen/s2k/miata/mr2 etc,btohqsg
Me and a friend both bought roc. I got the 1.4 and built it to run about 220hp on wheel  ans he bought the R.Our maintenance and breakdown items were about the same.In 10 months  i went thru 2 MU  he went once. Same damage. 3k for R vs 1.3k for 1.4.Nitty gritty  bushings  rods  etc about the same price.Roadtax  fuel economy  1.4 hands down.,btohqsg
If money is not an objection  buy the car you like  enjoy the process and enjoy the issues.However if you want something reliable  Japanese vehicles in my opinion is more reliable,btohqsg
But i've been proven wrong before by some JDM friends. ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Actually depends on hw u drive it oso,btohqsg
If u like to zua that kind R better,btohqsg
The only mr2 I know in sg is blackbird mr2,btohqsg
Unless u say there is a few unit,btohqsg
But if just transport can get 1.4  the fuel savings diff rly huge,btohqsg
