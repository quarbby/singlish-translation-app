🚀Pika World Contrarian View to an Easing Inflation🚀Recent data has shown that the fight against inflation is making progress. The positive outcome of this result is well noted. The Federal Reserve will be less likely to increase the interest rates  which could help keep demand for goods and services at a healthy level.Ultimately  that is a positive outcome for corporate profits and  eventually  stock price.The flip side could be true too.💰Growth limitation is a risk we cannot ignore🎲A key issue with muted inflation is that companies will have greater inertia in raising prices. As the interest rate flattens or  in some cases  starts to decline  the demand for goods and services growth tends to result in a minor price increase in the short term that limits sales growth.Eventually  we could see a disappointing result in sales and earnings. That could come as an outright miss in expectations  and analysts could start to lower their forecasts as evidence of lesser room for price increases become prevalent.It is a real possibility.🥁Price  Sales  Profitability💸The recent economic data could hint at such a possibility. Look at the  Producer Price Index  which  in concise form  measures the price that companies pay to their suppliers and for materials. It has been slowing down in price growth  given firms' preparation for a slowdown in demand.Morgan Stanley drew a relationship: When the PPI of those similar to recent results surfaced  the total year-over-year revenue declined by about 5% for S&P 500 companies. As we know  sales have thus far fallen by 0.8% in total for the second quarter profits  according to some articles we read  which could usher in a steeper decline.The worst outcome will arrive when comapnies are not well equipped to cut costs at a rate to keep pace with the fall in revenue.Yes  now you may get our hint- Disinflation risk could heighten and consume sales growth. While things have yet to bloom in that direction  keeping this idea in our minds could be helpful.Just a random read and thought  so catch up soon again Pika Nat.🫕,btohqsg
