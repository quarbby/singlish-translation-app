the tories are fucked this yr (good thing),btohqsg
wanna see how badly they do in this week's local election,btohqsg
Yala  but it’s also a different story if an MP wants to defect even if their own leader screwed up. If they don’t support the leader they can always defect provided that they resign and re contest the election in their constituency. In the case of PR  the party on which they were elected on can select a replacement by going down the party list,btohqsg
Ya u can have compromises that ensures both sides remain unhappy but happy enough to grumble along,btohqsg
Yeah that’s precisely why I think the anti party hopping law is needed. But it’s kind of like karma catching up to them LOL  in 2020 some PKR MPs defected to bersartu during the Sheraton move  now the reverse is happening,btohqsg
That's what politics is meant to be,btohqsg
I hope they win less than 100 seats,btohqsg
then there nearly was the dubai move,btohqsg
i want a labour-libdem govt but nvm,btohqsg
Not happening for the next parliament at least,btohqsg
Tbh I don’t know the details of what exactly was discussed during that meeting,btohqsg
imo itd be along the lines of 360-400 for labour,btohqsg
up by 10  but they only seem to do well in by-elections,btohqsg
Bipartisanship is good but like also I feel like parties shouldn’t be forced to work together if they are completely incompatible  and if a member of a party does not support the party’s agenda and wishes to quit the voters of the constituency in which the mp was elected should have to approve of that move  which can be done via by elections,btohqsg
Probably think it will swing to Labour but result in a hung parliament,btohqsg
I think they will get a landslide similar to Tony Blair’s 1997 election,btohqsg
The local elections on Thursday would be a good bellwether,btohqsg
At least they can spoil the election for the Tory scum further,btohqsg
but what are lee anderson's chance at re-election,btohqsg
Idk but all the MRP polls suggest that reform would win 0,btohqsg
Nigel farage pls campaign more for reform,btohqsg
Goes to show the changing ideologies of a party,btohqsg
It's almost impossible for a party to keep the same shit for years,btohqsg
no way one can be in corbyn's labour and defect to bojo's/may tory,btohqsg
No way  if they are on Corbyn’s side they’d probably just remain independent or join parties like the Greens/George Galloway’s party,btohqsg
Ya lmao u didn't know that hahahha,btohqsg
I wonder if Corbyn would contest as an independent though,btohqsg
That was why he actively campaign and it worked for the brexit vote,btohqsg
Ya but can’t win a seat for himself in the British parliament,btohqsg
The anti immigration parties are expected to do well,btohqsg
If he does I hope he can win,btohqsg
The more Farage campaigns  the more votes reform would steal from the Tories -> increase Tory attrition,btohqsg
Oh I kind of liked the policies he was proposing,btohqsg
Anyway now that he’s not labour leader more people are comfortable of switching to labour from Tories,btohqsg
Which is good cos in the short term we need the Tories out at least  in the future we can think of stuff like hung parliaments being more common and having a labour/lib dem government,btohqsg
There are some ppl who speculate that Starmer will be a radical leader and implement many reforms if he wins government  but he’s not saying he would be one cos that will scare away some voters. They think that Starmer would be like Clement Attlee 2.0 which I honestly hope so. Attlee did many good things for the UK like the NHS,btohqsg
Ahh lib dems.. we will support you if you make us Deputy,btohqsg
i have that small hope theyd rejoin the EU,btohqsg
Didn’t go well for Nick Clegg at all lol,btohqsg
wtf happened to him 9 yrs later,btohqsg
Tbh even for Cameron it didn't end well,btohqsg
Unless Starmer u turns  not happening. But if a referendum were held now I’m sure they’d say yes,btohqsg
He lost his seat and went to take some other job,btohqsg
We will follow the British publics mandateProceeds to resign,btohqsg
Lib dem voters hated the coalition and punished them heavily in the 2015 elections,btohqsg
lib dem js wanted power back then,btohqsg
Tbh I think they still want that now,btohqsg
