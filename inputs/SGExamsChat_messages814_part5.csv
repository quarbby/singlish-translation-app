I won't really trust fresh grads to lead a team though,btohqsg
if they cared about my a levels i'd have been out v fast lol,btohqsg
They mainly care about your penultimate qualifications,btohqsg
The rest actually is just good to know ig,btohqsg
i think uni automatically cancels out the past..but if u screw up uni highly unlikely they will look at A level and reconsider,btohqsg
once you're decently far into uni  anything before that doesn't matter,btohqsg
just like once you start having work experience  your degree matters less and less,btohqsg
But if you have two equally applicants who have meet the skillset round,btohqsg
jc/poly and sec sch can be lumped together tho for pre uni things,btohqsg
They will end up looking at who they can work well best,btohqsg
Personally you don't have to be too extraordinary in terms of skill sets,btohqsg
then the bosses will have to see..which varies from company to company  which person is better to fit into the company,btohqsg
hearing my mum interview someone...after the interview she is always v certain who is better,btohqsg
Like you can hit the skills and some employers believe that skill sets can be trained,btohqsg
Some people have the potential one and this type of thing need experience to see,btohqsg
There's always a preference one. I highly doubt it comes to a point whereby 2 candidates are the same,btohqsg
So people are also looking at that,btohqsg
Either one has more relevant internship with a specific company,btohqsg
this one depends...coz if employer believe the skill set can be trained  but someone hits it 100%  he / she will get the job,btohqsg
I had a nightmare a scholarship rejected me cause my ip4 was too shit,btohqsg
You confirm won't have two identical applicants,btohqsg
but honestly once you secured a degree in this day and age..most of your past results should not redefine your placement,btohqsg
What you usually have is two or more applicants who actually hit the requirements,btohqsg
identical twins: I beg to differ,btohqsg
Then out of like say the 5 people,btohqsg
i have dreams about my gpa every sem in uni lol,btohqsg
But ig y5 promos should override y4 promos,btohqsg
they say if theres a significant improvement from ip 4 to 5 then its also a plus,btohqsg
I had dreams whereby it fell so much I got kicked out unemployed,btohqsg
i dont think private companies will take the risk to train..then for the employee to leave for another company. This is more or so what govt companies have,btohqsg
At that stage  it usually boils down to potential  likeable etc,btohqsg
i had a dream my promos too bad and cannot take h3,btohqsg
i had a dream that i got no As and BBCB for my As,btohqsg
And then i broke down crying,btohqsg
the fact that i didn't dream about As shows how little i cared,btohqsg
Umm what I mean is not that the private companies training the guy,btohqsg
I don't have dreams about As,btohqsg
But more of like the idea that skills can be developed because you are exposed to it,btohqsg
No but the paper works well as pangsai zua,btohqsg
Like as a fresh grad  you confirm won't have the chance to deal with like production system,btohqsg
I dreamed that i was collecting a level results and he was there,btohqsg
Like you probably know what cloud is but then never actually really exposed to it,btohqsg
might as well use the blank paper,btohqsg
So these are probably one of the ways the company sort of is able to train you and hence you developed the skills,btohqsg
But ig if the person in my class who pon promos  promoted,btohqsg
if i could promote  anyone can,btohqsg
Because sometimes people lack that exposure,btohqsg
Y6 senior is the peak of zen,btohqsg
Are there people who y7 in ip,btohqsg
i didnt even know i did not collect my O lvl cert,btohqsg
