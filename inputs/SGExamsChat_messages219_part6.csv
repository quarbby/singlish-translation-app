i abit no hope for private one liao,btohqsg
cause i want can provide materials one,btohqsg
well if you're under financial aid  approach organisations  some might be able to help!,btohqsg
im currently a volunteer tutor under an organisation anyway,btohqsg
as a uni student  i think that rarely happens,btohqsg
or jc girl abt to go uni,btohqsg
More reliably can get materials one,btohqsg
just go carousell can find one hor,btohqsg
imo providing materials in sec sch a bit hard,btohqsg
only materials provided usually is crafted worksheets,btohqsg
even i dont give materials for sec sch  not needed,btohqsg
hi if anyone wants pure chem or pure phy materials pls dm me asap!! (for o lvls) I have tons and tons of tb workbooks etc ty:-),btohqsg
unless u want like v summarised notes,btohqsg
^ is this promotion idk sorry:|,btohqsg
i mean cause mostly when i go private is i ask some questions i donâ€™t understand an d the tutor to read and solve the questions which takes time,btohqsg
better to do urself then get from others,btohqsg
and some like when they explain abit confusing as well,btohqsg
ah thats why need face to face ma,btohqsg
tbh doesn't mean notes will help if u dont understand their explanation,btohqsg
physical but I hv digital stuff too my parents want me to clear my stuff asap tho,btohqsg
usually ppl will ask for help if they dont understand notes to begin with,btohqsg
thats why i kinda need like stalford those kind of tution,btohqsg
but stalford is 60 for 1hr30 i dont have the money ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
u want those that teach from scratch one ah,btohqsg
even i do that amt for 1hr30min,btohqsg
if u wanna expect $25/h or low rates  usually dont have too much high hopes on what u can get out of it,btohqsg
i think ill try find private one again,btohqsg
usually those that do very low rates are either fresh grads (from jc/poly) or they aren't rly good,btohqsg
if is the former  its worth a try,btohqsg
bruh this made me remember i had beef with this nanyang tution center,btohqsg
ya they also have a telegram grp also,btohqsg
u must have done something lor,btohqsg
i only replied like 2 days late,btohqsg
and i said ill think abt it,btohqsg
and they left me on seen,btohqsg
then like i asked again they block me,btohqsg
the worst subject in the world,btohqsg
if you want I can try and help,btohqsg
uaksjxkekdk but I'm a recent grad lmao,btohqsg
ok not rly but doable la,btohqsg
and i was a f9 student for amath,btohqsg
all u need to do is just,btohqsg
know ur concept/content well for every chapter,btohqsg
this is true amath isn't rly that difficult when ur used to it,btohqsg
honestly true but its just if you didnâ€™t do for like 2 days you forget everything liao,btohqsg
If that's the case  it means u have no interest in the subject,btohqsg
wah when i was in sec sch uhh,btohqsg
no lah its just i have mild adhd and i lose concentration easily,btohqsg
the teacher useless then we need self study completely,btohqsg
consult your teachers if they're good!,btohqsg
