Which one is the Best cash back offer card  for gadgets buying ?,btohqsg
I have to agree. I did some due dilligence at the side.Bank Promotions typically exclude staff and their family members. These are stated in tnc.Separately  where it is a basic bank product i.e. DBS Multiplier account etc  there is no such exclusion. But tnc is not stated anywhere (I might have overlooked)I have checked with my friend in DBS and also staff in OCBC that staff in their banks qualify for basic bank products.The norm  just assumption  but good to check.,btohqsg

Hi  credit card rewards aside  does booking flights on travel websites say for a scoot or sq flight (expedia  trip etc) earn ‚Äúmiles‚Äù for the flight itself?Eg  when u book via scoot or sq directly from their site - u will earn miles based on your flight destination,btohqsg
Hello experts  I would like to check if I‚Äôm able to fullfill the $800 SIA  Scoot transaction yearly.Would UOB PRVI miles CC still be more worth than UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
I see the local spending still same as per travel  dining and etc,btohqsg
Yes depending on the fare class u booked.,btohqsg
uob krisflyer has 3mpd for some categories of spending e.g. dining and some online travel agency and some online shopping mccuob prvi is 1.4mpd for local spend,btohqsg
Fcy some country give up to 3 mpd so different cc have different use case. And uob priv is useful for cardup etc,btohqsg
I just heard about it  any advice,btohqsg
Its legit. No frills. You start from here and come back with real questionshttps://youtu.be/KySLEgLYqR0,btohqsg
