Thks. Does Amex true cash back charges annual fees?,btohqsg
does anyone know for the AMEX KrisFlyer Ascend new signup promo 38k miles (w $1k spend + $397.85 fee) - are the miles direct credit or voucher type,btohqsg
Thks. I think pay thru giro then. The annual fees is higher than the rebates .,btohqsg
Should I prioritize investing more in SG banks or S&P 500?I currently have investments in OCBC and the S&P 500 (VUAA) but am unsure where to allocate my next investment.Will potential Fed rate cuts in 2025 impact Singaporean banks?,btohqsg
I changed my UOB one card after reporting loss and the new card on my Apple Pay is rejected  when I take mrt but works fine on Shopee. Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
Hello peeps!I‚Äôd like to ask if paying through UEN for bank transfer/PayNow considered an online payment? ü§î,btohqsg
What rewards you plan to get from this transaction ?,btohqsg
This paynow deduct from your savings account. Why will earn miles?,btohqsg
How do you use bank transfer or paynow to deduct money from your credit card?,btohqsg
Pls elaborate on how you intend to use your uob prvi card to pay through paynow...,btohqsg
Hmm.. maybe I‚Äôm confused with the payment method.. Can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong..Bank transfer/PayNow - from debit card/saving accountOnline transfer - from credit card or debit cardUEN - I dunno what‚Äôs this üòÖ,btohqsg
Imo banks will be fine unlesss financial crisis. And its also better to diversify ur investments to minimize impacts.,btohqsg
Have you ever used credit card   debit card  bank transfer  paynow n pay to UEN before?If not  suggest you pay $1 to your telco bill using above difference method to understand how it works.,btohqsg
Bank transfer/paynow/online transfer (that does not ask u to input any card details)- all from bank accountUEN- google this,btohqsg
Anyone have error logging to GXS app?,btohqsg
But too bad they remove the free lounge pass and up the fee. Still thinking if i will keep the card. But i think i can ask to waive the fee and not opt for the free hotel,btohqsg
If can still waive af  worth keeping for amex pay and their offers from time to time.,btohqsg
Thats what im thinkng also. Bec for me amex still a good card.,btohqsg
What is this shieldy bot verification that i need to complete?,btohqsg

hi gurus  i sold some positions on Syfe Trade. i understand that their rate from USD to SGD isn't the best. the only multicurrency account i have is HSBC EGA. may i ask whats the best way to withdraw the funds? to get a better spread / reduce losses due to it (it's not much tbh only 1k usd). im not too sure if the terms im using are correct too üòÖ thank you in advance!,btohqsg
I am curious also. Can we transfer USD from Syfe Trade to HSBC EGA? Would there be a fee?,btohqsg
This group really grew. I remember last time only have 3k people. Now have 17k üí™üí™üí™,btohqsg
Actually 1k and below the difference is not worth the additional trouble and hassle,btohqsg
sure! thanks Chris! out of curiosity if it's a large sum  i suppose withdraw to EGA? tbh i havent researched on this yet..... üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi everyone I know everyone likes trust cashback card because it doesn't have fx fees for overseas transactions  but the way I see it a paltry 1.5% cashback for travel is offset by simple 4mpd cards even accounting for 3.25% fees and an additional 1% giro benefit from EGA (am assuming trust cant be added to ega). Is there a flaw in my reasoning?,btohqsg
U forgot about the juicy 15% bonus category when used overseas,btohqsg
Sorry if I‚Äôm not clear I meant:1. I won‚Äôt use trust cashback for overseas non bonus category2. The 15% bonus category when used overseas with no bank fx spread is unmatched.,btohqsg
I agree the real draw is the 15% - but this has to be a category that we frequent. Most likely not travel. Which is why I am thinking lady card etc are still good for travel,btohqsg
Dining is da best in my opinionTravel keep on Uob lady.,btohqsg
Yes up to the cap for sure,btohqsg
Yes makes sense. Thank you Mt and Anthony!,btohqsg
I'm using trust cashback a bit different from Mt. I chose category specifically I won't hit my bonus cat.My overseas spend combo is crmc + amaze and trust cashback. Many things like train tix  transport booking  etc. will get 1% cashback and 3.25% less as compared to general spend card. This is particularly helpful if I know I won't hit UOB VS 1k spend in that trip.,btohqsg
Ah I see interesting got it,btohqsg
Same I am using wellness and beauty which I know I won‚Äôt hit   then I also have youtrip with yen at 116,btohqsg
Same. I'm also on wellness category üòÅ.Youtrip is superior for yen. Plus a bit of additional 1% cashback if use master card top up + ega.,btohqsg
Last week was 6.30pm so just waithttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/244185,btohqsg
Haha ya‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt see myself spending 2k on spa üòÖ,btohqsg
Btw guys  if you‚Äôre already on HeyMax  might as well join their new campaigns on public transport if you don‚Äôt drive.Very satisfying to see random HeyMax miles just roll in.You will need to join the campaign and link the Visa card you‚Äôre using.,btohqsg
UEN is the company‚Äôs registration number,btohqsg
Hmmm I‚Äôm not sure how to visualise your strategy. Got some numerical examples?,btohqsg
Nothing special actually.Take my last trip in Taiwan. Hotels all prepaid w dbs alt promo. Need to use cards to pay for express train to Taipei then train tickets to Taitung. All together about 250sgd and not covered by crmc + amaze. And 200sgd on dining. All together cannot hit 1k for UOB visa signature.Hence I used trust cashback card for 3.25% less fcy fee and 1% cashback.,btohqsg
If you link your trust card to your DBS card and your DBS card to your UOB One card  technically you can stack your cash back. Spending on 1 credit card and enjoy the rewards of 3 credit cards üß†,btohqsg
Trust card cant be link to dbs. And dbs card doesn't do anything with UOB one üòÅ.,btohqsg
To be fair. They got until 2359,btohqsg
Why not use Uob ppv at 4mpd - 4% fx costs? Still higher net benefit than trust 1% - 0.8% visa?,btohqsg
TSA train tix i bought from their websites so üòÖ. Dont own dbs woman world mc due to short expiry.,btohqsg
