DLL‚Äôs roles in the licensing agreement include develop  make  manufacture  market  distribute and/or sellthe licensed product and the licensed service. DLL may outsource the manufacturing of the ART kits to thirdparty manufacturers.Leveraging on DiSa Serialization technology  DLL has developed a system that is capable of reading theresults of ART cassette and accordingly  authenticate and automate the delivery of tampered-free test resultsto the intended recipients or authorities. The sales of ART kits will be bundled with this system making it acomplete ART solution that would ease the administrative burden of the business owners who are requiredto do mandatory regular ART tests for their workers.We do not expect any material financial impact on the Group for at least the current financial year ending 30June 2022 as the commercialisation of the ART kits will only commence in 4 to 6 months‚Äô time from now andit is subject to DLL‚Äôs ability to obtain approval from the relevant regulatory authority.The Group plans to raise fund at DLL level for the commercialisation of the ART kits.Chey,btohqsg

üçéPika World Insights: AppleüçêüíéPlenty of MerryüíéApple stock has been on a remarkable ride. The stock price had mooned by about 141% for the past 2 years  almost reaching the $3 trillion market capitalization given the strong growth across different segments ranging from iPhones  Macs  iPads  and wearables. More importantly  services now is a primary driver of the group revenue.So what are some catalysts to push the price higher?üí∞#1: Healthy iPhone demandüóΩPika World takes a contrarian view on the expectation of weaker consumer hardware demand in the coming year. The large installed base of Apple means potential for more rooms of upgrades  especially with the rollout of 5G in many countries.It is expected that iPhone 14 will come with a swifter processor and longer battery life that could help meet exactly what consumers yearn for. In addition  a foldable phone is also possible in 2023.‚åöÔ∏è#2: A VR/AR reality Headsetüí°It is expected to debut in the second half of 2022  and there appears to be optimism for growth in this segment. More details could be released in June 2022 where Apple usually holds its annual developers' conference. Some analysts expect the device to be priced from $750 to $1000  potentially delivering material revenue growth for Apple.üèãÔ∏è#3: Service business segment is shinningüíéWhile there are regulatory hurdles and litigation on the payment gateway  Pika World believes it will not have a material impact on the company as most analysts thought. Users may prefer a sense of convenience and security and pay slightly more. For developers  their chase for higher-margin using off-store billing may lead to a lower conversion rate and ultimately lower revenue. Hence  there isn't a strong incentive for both users and developers to move beyond the current pay model.üíµ#4: Strong balance sheet for dividend growth‚õ≥Ô∏èApple generates about $100 billion of free cash flow annually. It has always issued large shares buyback plans in May for the past 4 years. There could be another $90 billion authorization buyback ahead and a possible dividend hike.üöò#5: The rumour Apple CarüöñThe prospect of an Apple car gives joy to investors. It is expected to be an outsourced production and could contribute up to a 15% increase in sales. In addition  immense opportunity can come with an IT ecosystem for Apple cars that can further contribute to service revenue  encouraging a robust expansion of higher margin for the service business segment.We hope you enjoy this read! If you find it useful  share it with your friends  as it helps us reach out to a larger audience.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
