Happy Mother‚Äôs Day to all.2021 been tough as hell. I believe many took bad beats. But I‚Äôm still optimistic that there should be a good rally coming for pennies judging from the recent play up of Sheng Yao. There is chance for them to become the new penny leader because for them to bring it to this price level  we are talking multi millions $ of pump action.Quote of the day:Motherhood is the biggest gamble in the world. It is the glorious life force. It‚Äôs huge and scary ‚Äî it‚Äôs an act of infinite optimism.- Gilda RadnerWhen you look into your mother's eyes  you know that is the purest love you can find.- Mitch AlbomEnjoy everyday with your love ones.

Let‚Äôs see. This period I would probably be aiming any micro c/w construction related counters since micros might be in favour due to ShengYao rise. Anyways  micro usually need to hold. Hence if buy  need to be ready to buy up.I would recommend the below construction related micro counters1) Asiatic safe to enter at $0.007 or $0.008. Neo Garden towkay bought in at $0.008 recently. Follow the smart money should be okay. Should have some plans going. We shall see.2) CSC safe to enter $0.013 or $0.014.The recent rally they cleared $0.016 then price retraced. I feel that $0.013 is bottomed out for now.Good luck. DYODD and watchlist it whether got volume coming in. If have then join  otherwise  opportunity costs.,btohqsg
Asiatic very quiet recently. Anyone have ?,btohqsg
