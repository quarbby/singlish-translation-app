unless you want to do rhd conversion in the USA and then import here then maybe can. but costs a lot,btohqsg
Nie Ga 2the Ranger is Body-on-Frame pickup is it?,btohqsg
Are Hotwheels ID Worth The Money And Hype? - Nissan Skyline GT-R (BNR34)  Hotwheels IDhttps://youtu.be/uUEM5uzsuwALet me know what you think of it!!🙏🏼🔥,btohqsg
not *all* LHD cars are banned however,btohqsg
if you're a country diplomat you can get a LHD car,btohqsg
cars with the CD plate can be LHD,btohqsg
"however you will need to display a sticker with ""Left-Hand Drive""",btohqsg
had a friend whose parents were diplomats  they had a LHD BMW 760Li iirc,btohqsg
Some forums say that when they leave the country  they re-export them back to their home country. True or not?marc,btohqsg
oh wow this is so cool,btohqsg
however car exports are not uncommon for owners,btohqsg
iirc there was someone who exported their Legacy to Aus?,btohqsg
F150 is a much bigger truck,btohqsg
The ranger is based on the Ford everest,btohqsg
Ford doesn't want to do rhd f150s etc. because they don't see a market for them since most rhd places are small,btohqsg
So the truck is too big anyway,btohqsg
The cars usually get scrapped or exported back with them to their original country if there is no other diplomat to take over,btohqsg
Too bad they didn't go ahead and stance it make it like VIP Style🙃,btohqsg
Malaysia now got their hands on rhd F150,btohqsg
Australia also have but they're not exactly ford direct,btohqsg
The new Ranger looks like an F150,btohqsg
They trying to make it look like an f150,btohqsg
I did see a ranger with a f150 front,btohqsg
I believe he jus changed the front bumper,btohqsg
Found this a few days ago,btohqsg
Myvi king of the road ocer there so the truck e brake and probably bow down before it hits.,btohqsg
We'll just keep driving them in video games I guess,btohqsg
i didnt know hyundai make trucks,btohqsg
The horde has been alerted   too late now,btohqsg
Good of him to kena this karma,btohqsg
Looks like photoshop for a bit,btohqsg
Cus the car is pixelated while the environment is blurry,btohqsg
U miss 100% of the shots you don’t take,btohqsg
Although I have to say u missed every shot u took,btohqsg
@stonkyboiboino way u letting that slide,btohqsg
i got bundle of keys for a reason,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAH if u can even run fast enuff to catch it,btohqsg
yeah no sane person would do such a thing,btohqsg
Recently went to the UK for a shoot,btohqsg
the plate isnt the forza one,btohqsg
can tesla enthusiasts stay in their lane,btohqsg
convinced 99% of them are HURRDURR TESLA IS DA BEST,btohqsg
But I think it managed to spike to 2.8 coz power shift,btohqsg
Which is not good at all,btohqsg
Coz no lift shift all that,btohqsg
Ya.. they don't understand the significance of a manual or internal combustion engines.,btohqsg
imo performance times matter only to some extent,btohqsg
you can't beat the adrenaline rush of VTEC or the sound of a flat 6 with a dental drill whirring up,btohqsg
Got better one. When battery run out of juice,btohqsg
only drawback is that it keeps exploding,btohqsg
Dun worry Tesla will blow up in flames and leave you with nothing to salvage 😛,btohqsg
the ego burns with it too  hopefully.,btohqsg
busso be bussin in the engine bay fr 😜🔥,btohqsg
I think we have a few gtv6 left in SG right?,btohqsg
"""left"" is a bit of a stretch",btohqsg
good to have them around nonetheless,btohqsg
If happen to spot  it is God's blessing to hear the Busso. 🤲🏽🙏🏽,btohqsg
was at Autoinc awhile back and they had a really clean one,btohqsg
Oh this one doesn't have that plastic bonnet piece,btohqsg
They boasting about 0-60mph acceleration only. Heck even motorcycle also similar feeling of 2s 0-60mph like the gsxr or busa.,btohqsg
Bet those egotistical Tesla owners have not ridden or owned a motorcycle,btohqsg
not everything needs to be compared to a bike,btohqsg
Bro I guarantee you. 0-100 in a Tesla is definitely more fun than the bikes you compared,btohqsg
Is it because they are encased in the car itself with AC?,btohqsg
It’s called instant torque. Smth bikes don’t have,btohqsg
my aircon louder than the entire ev tho,btohqsg
Your aircond is like a Mercedes AMG. Low is Comfort mode  medium is Sport mode  high is Sport+ mode,btohqsg
Point is pls fix your aircon if it’s that loud,btohqsg
Will smoke you anywhere anytime any place,btohqsg
And still be quieter than ur aircon,btohqsg
He will say later smoke will come out of the batteries 😂,btohqsg

And then smoke will come out from ur engine,btohqsg
The motor that powers the wheels?,btohqsg

Quad tail pipes is the v10 right?,btohqsg
You should see the way they mod they vans,btohqsg
Their bosozoku style Hiace.. the KZH chassis I think,btohqsg

Eh if they make the Inline 4 themselves.. maybe we can get a modern 924? 😏😏,btohqsg
924 was also a VW engine,btohqsg
The modern 924 is the cayman..,btohqsg
Eh...? Thought Cayman is turbo flat 4?,btohqsg
Yes but that's the modern equivalent sir.,btohqsg
Like that you might say the 992 is not a 911 because not N.A. anymore,btohqsg
992 all turbo? then all of that gen is a 911 turbo?,btohqsg
All 992s apart from the GT3 and 3rs are turbocharged...,btohqsg
Cus I go back to check on 911 bring back memories to the video with Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson 😅,btohqsg

Nissan might as well Tesla swap,btohqsg

Its just the lexus version of ghe alphard right,btohqsg
Minus number of rear seats and added luxury comparable to a Mercedes S Class,btohqsg
More reminiscent of a Maybach but a Malaysian style Maybach,btohqsg
Can still put some cabin luggage in the boot even fully reclined it seems,btohqsg
Ye lexus is toyota w improvements,btohqsg
Tapi this LM I feel more like Uber-luxury improvements with a terrible front end. 😅,btohqsg
same powerplant from the Nismo variant  just more powerful.,btohqsg
Got a way to fix it though,btohqsg

because enthusiasts love to shit on it,btohqsg
but that aside  genuinely a solid car,btohqsg
I never understood why car enthusiasts shat/shit on it tho,btohqsg
Like isit just because its a hybrid,btohqsg
hybrid is the best of both worlds imo,btohqsg
I feel that hybrids are just cars,btohqsg
Like its stupid when people hate on electric cars oso,btohqsg
I honestly dun geddit like sm ppl like electric sm ppl like gas just leave each other be bro😭,btohqsg
but i find it abit hypocritical lol,btohqsg
most likely your power source is natural gas  unless you use your own solar,btohqsg
Yeah not saying its justified but its q stupid how ppl go out of their way to shit on them,btohqsg
Usually if without COE they will indicate,btohqsg
