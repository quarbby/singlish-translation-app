Hi!  just want to know  i booked a flat last year september. It‚Äôs been 6months & i haven‚Äôt been called to sign the lease agreement. isit normal üòÖ,btohqsg
Why deduct 100k? Deduct 50k only la,btohqsg
Point 3 yes as it is payable only to HDB,btohqsg
Normal. Just chill haha the later it is  the better,btohqsg
Tell me about it. Mine close to 8 months and counting. üòè,btohqsg
Isn't it a good thing? Hahaha,btohqsg
Yep kinda is haha.. can save more CPF funds .. üòÅ,btohqsg
And your CPF earn interest monthly. So it's a good thing haha,btohqsg
These are the housing grants available if you're going for resale flats.,btohqsg
Hi  I have a few questions regarding BTO and grant. I am currently still in school  however my partner has been working for a while. She recently had a job change and would allow her to be able to pay for the house fully. We are currently looking to book for the May bto.1. When can we apply for the bto grant  preferably before her pay raise so we can maximise the grant amount.2. Since her salary allow for us to cover for the installment. Would it be possible for us to apply as co-occupier instead or co applicant. Doing so to prevent stamp duty tax.Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
1. You cant choose when you apply for it. The application will be done when you go for your selection of flat appointment - one of the sets of documents required will be (her) income documents from the 12 months preceding the launch. i.e. income documents from May 2022 to Apr 2023 will be used to determine the grant amount2. Yes  you can apply as main applicant and co-occupier if you wish. To do this  you need to indicate so in the application form.,btohqsg
Thanks a lot this was very helpful. I assume we can't use my part of the grant if I apply as co-occupier,btohqsg
Np! Actually i would think that the full grant amount would reside in the CPF of your partner since they are the main applicant. But Im not sure of how grant disbursement and usage applies for your situation. Might be best to clarify with HDB on this!,btohqsg
Thanks this is really helpful ! Hope u have a great weekend ahead,btohqsg
Any HDB officers in e house here??,btohqsg
Doubt so and doubt they will reveal themselves haha but do free to post your questions.,btohqsg
When will they start calling appointments for Feb 2023 ballot,btohqsg
Depends... Each project different due to size of the launch.,btohqsg
Hi  i have checked the OBF unit have been all taken  but yet to receive to update from HDB to inform us that no longer required us to go down yet. Does it mean still will stand a chance?,btohqsg
U should receive some sms like this informing u not to go down.,btohqsg
Yes. If you provided your email add,btohqsg
Fernvale vines supposed to top tis year jan. But till now some units not top. Going to compensate ma?,btohqsg
hello. my BTO will be ready by 4th quarter 2024. I also just received my Appointment to Sign Agreement for Lease email letter (next month).my question is  will this affect me if I have been laid off this month?or will it affect the key collection appointment (next year)  considering that there's a gap in my monthly CPF contributions?,btohqsg
Dont think it will affect.But if you need to re-do your HLE  then it may affect.,btohqsg
If your ehg and loan approved  shouldn't be a issue otherwise it depend on the period of unemployment also.,btohqsg
Lucky for me  my EHG was approved days before my layoff. But I haven‚Äôt had any appointments regarding my HDB loan yet. Will that be during the key collection appointment?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if I need to redo my HLE‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt gone for the HDB loan appointment yet. I guess I‚Äôll have the ready the HLE before that appointment?,btohqsg
I think u can do ur HLE now,btohqsg
Cos u still have ur current income,btohqsg
The moment HLE short of income  then u may have some problem alr,btohqsg
HLE should last u about 1 year,btohqsg
So if ur house is coming year end  they will depend on ur HLE.,btohqsg
understood. but if I do now  HLE should be valid until May 2024 (if it lasts for 1 year). my house won't be ready until 4th quarter 2024. when should I expect the HDB Loan Appointment to come? a few months before house is ready?,btohqsg
I'm afraid the HLE won't be valid if the appointment comes after May 2024,btohqsg
If we go by a normal process  this is gamble u may need to take,btohqsg
1. Apply HLE now. Pray that the validity can last you till 2024 Q4,btohqsg
2. Apply HLE now. Even if the validity cannot last you till 2024 Q4  there are cases where i heard even when the HLE expires  HDB still uses the old HLE.,btohqsg
Actually just apply now  it wont do u any harm,btohqsg
true that. I'll go apply today. thanks Seb!,btohqsg
Even if they want u to reapply  it will be 1-2 months before u get keys. Which by then is about end of 2024 Q3.,btohqsg
But I do see a lot of cases whereby HLE no need to reapply even though it expire.,btohqsg
Cos i am one of them,btohqsg
But i still reapply because i need a higher amount due to CPF investment,btohqsg
Thats why i say its a bit of a gamble,btohqsg
Cos i dono when they will change the rules,btohqsg
But fret not  i think it would be safe to just apply and see how it goes :),btohqsg
Just to note  HLE is not the final amount they will loan u.U can always appeal and get higher loan amount.,btohqsg
another scenario... let's say I get a new job in May  there will be a gap in CPF contributions for April. I was planning to fill that gap with cash-into-CPF  just so that there will be a continuous flow of CPF contributions without any gaps. it should be fine right?,btohqsg
My HLE was 300k  but i needed 400k.They ask me to resubmit  which is the same as what i did the first time  and they just give me 400k.I dono whats the diff tbh.,btohqsg
Dont have to fill that gap with cash,btohqsg
Keep cash with u  cash is king.,btohqsg
If they ask u why that date no work etc. say layoff lo,btohqsg
Now everywhere is layoff  its common,btohqsg
They will make adjustments for u.,btohqsg
From my understanding of how it runs  im guessing they dont want people to buy beyond their means  so thats why they give a lower loan amount.But if u are legit case  they will up the loan for u.,btohqsg
Cos their calculator says i can loan up to 700kBut when i apply  they give me 300k -.-!,btohqsg
Then when i appeal  they ask me how much im short.I say 100k  then they say ok grant u 400k.,btohqsg
"It is their way of going ""prudent"" loaning",btohqsg
Cos previously the HLE goes this way ...both couple apply for 1 HLE  base on the HLE amouunt  look for the flat u want to buy,btohqsg
So in my case if HLE say 700k  people are gonna look for a 700k flat.which will take donkey years to pay back,btohqsg
So there's a bit of basis behind their decision,btohqsg
hahaha! yeah  $700 000 loan would've been insane. anyway  thanks for sharing! I hope all goes well for me,btohqsg
Hi  mind sharing how long you waited for this bto...?? 4-5 years? Which bto (name)?,btohqsg
Garden Vale at Tengah. I got it under the SBF exercise  so the wait wasn‚Äôt so long. I applied in 2021. At that time  they said the delay was going to be 1 year‚Ä¶ but it turned out to be 2 years,btohqsg
Sorry just curious ah  what if you touchwood rejected for second HLE? Am planning to move funds from OA to SA so abit concerned if future HLE gets rejected when nearing to collect keys,btohqsg
U wont get rejected for HLE.HLE is just loan eligibility.HLE just tells u how much u can loan from HDB.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check with you on this. U mentioned u appeal and resubmit to get this amount. Was there a big difference in ur salary increment or just the same? Was it very complicated for them to give a higher loan?,btohqsg
I have just appealed for mine,btohqsg
Not for a huge increment in loan but an approx about additional $50k-70k.,btohqsg
No incrementAnd not complicated. Just submit the same exact thing.,btohqsg
I have been waiting for 1 year and still counting lol,btohqsg
Can we cancel HLE after we get our keys? Because we calculated that after 5yrs  old CPF is enough to fully pay the BTO.,btohqsg
Just tell them you wanna pay up fully using CPF during your key collection can liao,btohqsg
Hi does Kim keat beacon have a gc as last time have but I think the bot kick me out   do anyone have a link or smth?,btohqsg

Hi Group  I currently got a number from August last year  however have yet to go for appointment. Is it still possible for me to book for the upcoming May project? Would I lose my chances for May if I didn't go for my appointment?,btohqsg
Yes possible to book as long as you haven't selected a unit. Once you select  all other ballots will be forfeited,btohqsg
Noted  however if I didn't select I would be subsequently penalized. And that penalty would not effect my q for may?,btohqsg
It won't affect the ballots you have on hand,btohqsg
Hello all! Wanted to check if anyone has dropped out of the MCPS scheme and has any repercussion to it? Our queue number is pretty far but our parents changed their minds not wanting to be tied down by the MOP,btohqsg
After lease signing  if my combined income exceeds the 14k for BTO  what happens? Or it won‚Äôt matter by then?,btohqsg
Need to wait till you received the appointment letter/application package to know if you are under MCPS first.Chances are if your queue number is far out  your ballot is likely not from MCPS already.,btohqsg
It doesn't matter as you have already locked in your HLE liao. HDB won't fault you for earning more income.,btohqsg
HDB will only headache if we unable to pay e mthly installment....,btohqsg

Wa means lesser applicants since they have to apply for hfe before they can ballot for a flat,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still a bit confused. Right now I have a HLE that will expire in Aug.Does this new system allow us to manually renew the HFE if we already have an existing queue number + HLE,btohqsg
tldr: this hfe thing only affects those who apply for may bto onwards,btohqsg
but does this hfe thing mean that those who are not working are unable to apply for a flat? since no income = no loan = invalid hfe = cannot apply for flat?or does it just mean that they just need to apply and get a hfe to say that there‚Äôs no loan amount available at the moment  but still can apply for a flat,btohqsg
No income how to apply for flat? Book bto also need valid HLE isn't it.,btohqsg
being a student means you‚Äôre automatically under the deferred income scheme  where hdb will only assess your income nearer to key collection  then they will give u ehg and hle if you‚Äôre eligible,btohqsg
and most students don‚Äôt have a full time income,btohqsg
at least u don‚Äôt need a valid hle at the point of application,btohqsg
HDB should have considered this and their HFE will be different accordingly. HFE feels like the eligibility check  HLE(if applicable) and grant check all at once,btohqsg
yea i hope that hdb has considered no income ppl hahah ,btohqsg
just not sure if no income = invalid hfe = cannot apply haha  since it wasn‚Äôt mentioned abt this scenario,btohqsg
What are the things to look out for when selecting a BTO unit?,btohqsg
Hmm different projects have different considerations  some may be near highway which causes noise pollution  some may be near the sea or water bodies which may cause mould/higher risk of dengue/ metal furnitures more susceptible to rust.,btohqsg
May need to consider how high you want  any unblocked views  privacy  proximity to rubbish chute etc,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the insights.,btohqsg

Hello im currently schooling (grad next tear) and my partner has been working has been working for a year. Is it better to apply for a resale  bto or sbf? Because i saw that for ehg  the lower the income the better the grant. If i apply for bto am i able to apply for the ehg now or when i collect the keys?,btohqsg
Bto n sbf got difference?? Both new flats ma,btohqsg
sbf can also include new flats from earlier BTO sales that could be already TOP and are not booked / taken back by HDB for whatever reason,btohqsg
But still consider new flats. I feel,btohqsg
The lease may not be 99,btohqsg
the lease period could be different if its already completed,btohqsg
From TOP date la. I understand,btohqsg
Difficult to answer. Depends on your objective and needs and priority,btohqsg
If just to max out grants yes apply when lowest income,btohqsg
Tat one call hdb to ask better,btohqsg
Buying hdb is definitely more than just maxing out grants esp your first home.,btohqsg
Draw out a decision matrix and weigh each requirement with score to help u,btohqsg

Hello all  if I‚Äôm applying a bto with my sis and my mom (second timer)  able to get matured estate area?,btohqsg
mature estate i think only reserve 5% of flats for second timers  application rate will be mad crazy  need luck to get q number for mature estatetampines and amk for aug 2022 second timer application rate for 5r was 200+ for 1 5r flat  around 100 for 1 4r flatkallang proj in nov 2022  90+ vying for 1 4rqueenstown proj for feb 2023 was 40+ for 1 4r,btohqsg
Getting 3 room is much better?,btohqsg
It just pure luck for second timer,btohqsg
getting 3 room mature estate is better  but application rate is still pretty bad  around 40+ for 1 3r flat,btohqsg

Is HLE is required in second appointment?,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs the only time they will assess income?,btohqsg
i think they will access again when u pick up the keys to ur flat. Just to make sure that there are no major changes to ur income,btohqsg
They will assess again just before key collection. As your salary would either increase or decrease it would affect your loan amount...,btohqsg
Mine took 20 months but that‚Äôs coz they took their own sweet time approving my ehg,btohqsg
Oh really we took 7 months to approve,btohqsg

If I reject flat selection in the first place for May BTOif HDB calls me to go  I still can reject it without any penalties right?,btohqsg

If your household's income is more than 9000  you do not qualify for EHG.

Hi  does anyone know anything about the process of withdrawing from the MCPS?,btohqsg
Depending on what stage are u,btohqsg
Got the appt letter but haven‚Äôt gone for the appt yet  would you have to know what comes next?,btohqsg
But if I‚Äôm not wrong MCPS is under public queue?,btohqsg
public q is split into 2 subsets  mcps and public scheme. Eg: Mcps A  public scheme B  public scheme Cscenario: U balloted and got a q number of 100. this means that 100 is the best number out of the 3 ballots (A B C. B and C can be any number after 100  or even no number)Not sure if there‚Äôs a process of withdrawing from mcps  but if u can  it means u will get a further q number B and C  or even no number at all if B and C weren‚Äôt successful,btohqsg
but seeing as how you‚Äôve already gotten the appt date  i don‚Äôt think u can withdraw from it now? If u withdraw means u forfeit your number and u don‚Äôt get a flat,btohqsg
Can withdraw now u can ask hdb,btohqsg
I do know some ppl is like that,btohqsg
I already have a HLE If i input for HFE will be my hle affected?,btohqsg
if you already have a HLE and u want to ballot for May BTO  then u only need to do HFE preliminary check  dont need HFE letter,btohqsg
Its May alrdy..Knows when they will open?,btohqsg
maybe next week or next next week,btohqsg
+ 1 next week become next month,btohqsg
call in HDB and ask them your q number Public number or MCPS number.If Public number then continue no tie downIf MCPS number you can ask if your public number got anything anot. You may then decide from there,btohqsg
Hi  I have applied for Sep 22 BTO  Nov 22 BTO and keen to apply with this upcoming May exercise. We thought that we stood no chance for our late queue  and am getting ready apply for the May exercise. Recently though  we got our flat selection appointment date for our Sep selection. I am wondering:1. Is it possible for me to reschedule our flat selection during the May application period  so we can reject the flat selection while we apply for May?2. Would rejecting the flat selection for Sep 22 effect my eligibility for Nov 22 queue?,btohqsg
1. if u reschedule your flat selection  other ppl will select before u even tho u have a better number. But seeing as how it‚Äôs already pretty late into the sept bto selection  i‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre left with lower floors? u can reject the sept bto instead if u don‚Äôt want the lower floors2. is it your first time rejecting? if yes  it not will affect your may bto. if no  it will affect your may bto.

I know there is an option to authorize someone else  but it isn't very convenient in my current case. Are there any options to reschedule the options? I couldn't see that as an options in my HDB portal. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
U have to authorize someone if u can't make it. Print the Authorizion letter from hdb and fill it up,btohqsg

SW  don‚Äôt think can check availability of units left from btohq website  only from hdb flat portal,btohqsg
HDB | Flat Supply & Applications Receivedhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/BP13J011SBFNov22.jsp,btohqsg
That's why it boggles me why the govt can't build ahead of demand instead of bto system now.They can even build in advance like 5k or 10k flats  very fast snapped up. Even for sbf there's like almost 20k applicants,btohqsg
Hi! Yall got apply for HFE under fianc√©/ fianc√©e scheme? Did they show u the estimated grant amount when u did the preliminary check? Cause for mine  they did not state the estimated grant amount during the Preliminary check only straightaway ask me to apply for HFE üòÖ,btohqsg
wonder wad these guys work as,btohqsg
Yes mine had. I think u can redo the prelim if you go click on apply again,btohqsg
Mine had issue. Said that we are not eligible for grant when our combined income is under 9K,btohqsg
Ooh mine had issues last week stating we did not meet the MOP requirement even tho both of us are 1st timer  hahahahaha,btohqsg
Btw is it possible that 2 of us can apply as co-applicants first. To get a higher hdb loan approval via HLE.Then later upon key collection 5 years time  can we change to occupier if we want to?And vice versa  can change from occupier to co-applicant upon key collection?,btohqsg
Cos the issue we face was  if we just do occupier   the loan is lower at 200K  and we're afriad hdb will reject our application for mature bto even if we are able to fork out the cash,btohqsg
They won't reject your application at this stage. At most during your key collection if you cannot produce the amount  they will repossess back I think... But can appeal also,btohqsg
This is the form you will need to sign when booking of flat,btohqsg
Hi  do u mind sharing why do will u receive less grant when applying as occupier as opposed to applicants,btohqsg
I am in a similar situation. But I thought the lower the income the more ehg grant we will receive? I am also unaware that applying as occupier + applicant will effect grant eligibility. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
PS typo  lower loan .. not lower grant. Yes you're right lower combined income = more grant.Cos the loan  looks at the applicant income n max they give 30% of your salary.So just 1 person income = lower loan given,btohqsg
Tyvm. Cos my friend who already booked the flat a few years ago (haven't collected keys)   said it was possible.  So we had wrong info,btohqsg
üôèOccupier .. shouldn't affect grant eligibility .Only affect the loan amount,btohqsg
any queries can call in hdb to double check. My bf did that. But he had to wait for 10 ppl in front of him to finish,btohqsg
thats amazing  we tried to write in 1 month ago and they have yet to reply,btohqsg
Also if on occupier..half the grant money will go into the occupier cpf...The new rule,btohqsg
thats interesting. We are just afraid our application would get rejected if they think our combined income is too low to apply as occupier + applicant. May I ask would that be possible ? Anyways currently I am studying my masters and only my other half has a salary  we applied HLE previously and they approved,btohqsg
I'm not quite sure on the terms. Is essential occupier n occupier different?,btohqsg
Oh. I think the hdb guy on call said like you can appeal after getting the HLE. But will take some more time   so depends when u looking to apply the bto exercise also,btohqsg
thanks a lot ! that was very helpful. Best of luck with ur BTO!,btohqsg
We also having similar issue. But more like if on occupier scared that cos low loan amount  they may not approve .But only get the HLE then U will know what type of house U approved to get.We were looking at prime area. So the hdb said HLE will also tell u whether u eligible,btohqsg
Did ur HLE get approved for prime too ? I suppose your loan amount would also be similar to mine since it's occupier,btohqsg
previously we applied for a 600k bto as applicants  and our loan was ard like 400k? In the end both were approved.,btohqsg
We have yet to try to apply as applicant + occupier thou,btohqsg
Oh ok this is both applicants right.Ours was if occupier   the estimated loan is only 200K,btohqsg
ya  but I had no income lol haha,btohqsg
so there is good chance that if occupier  we will get even lower loan?,btohqsg
hi! anybody know/can predict if there is any tamp bto cmg up soon?ü•π,btohqsg
Yes.. cos only 1 person income. Duno still can get 600+K BTO not. üòîNow we are also at crossroads. Be on applicants  or occupier scheme,btohqsg
no  you‚Äôll only know 3 months before the whether there will be a launch at the estate,btohqsg
Alot of ppl trying to put only 1 main applicant and the other half as occupier to avoid ABSD so in future the occupier can purchase another property with taxes. It is the game of trust as if your name listed under occupier for BTO  all the downpayment and monthly installment will deduct from the owner of the HDB  all short fall has to be made in cash,btohqsg
Secondly  in the event of divorce  if your name listed as occupier  I dont think you will be eligible to have a share of the HDB,btohqsg
"So there are alot of pro and cons to "" play"" with the system and rules  do consider all the facts before apply for BTO",btohqsg
HDB make it very clear if in the event during signing agreement of lease  not enough CPF or cash to pay  your application will cancel your application. By tapping on only 1 main application  spared cash is required,btohqsg
600k BTO = 120k downpayment  you have to check if depending on only 1 applicant  after wipe out his/her OA  what is the remaining balance gotta fork out in cash  and understand the monthly loan repayment amount VS monthly OA contribution on the main applicant   typically for 600k BTO   monthly installment will be around $2200 ++   only main applicant CPF are eligible to use it to pay off the amount  whatever shortfall need to be in cash,btohqsg
Yea this is to eliminate marriage of convenience  previously the EHG will only credited to main applicants. However there are small amount of people using this loop hole to beat the system.Eg  SC as main applicant   SPR as occupier   based on the old regulation   they will only counted SC utilised the EHG  after MOP   both of them divorce  SPR become SC  he/she can purchase a 2RM or find another SC or PR ( first timer ) to apply another BTO with EHG grantBy revising the regulation  even now listed as occupier   they are no longer eligible for another EHG,btohqsg
Yes we have considered that in terms of cash to see how much we need to prep in 5 years for upfront cash n also monthly cash repayment to topup for any shortfall .Thanks btw,btohqsg
Hi  just to clarify. If under occupant and applicant how would the EHG grant be distributed. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Cause I had the same issue as yours,btohqsg
it was the prelim check.. we did 2x also same result. so probably we are gg to submit for the actual HLE then appeal if it still say we not eligible for grant,btohqsg
Hi. New here...Is Blk 638B ready in actual?#JustAsküòäüòä,btohqsg

HDB: Please¬†submit¬†additional documents for your HFE letter application by 05 Jun 2023. View and submit them at HDB Flat Portal.,btohqsg
I don' t see any feedback at HDB Flat Portal.,btohqsg
Yes I‚Äôve gotten that message before but regarding HLE! You can submit the docs via MyDocs@HDB,btohqsg
If I recall correctly  there‚Äôs a drop-down menu where you can select the type of document you are submitting,btohqsg
yes. they didn't mention which additional files I should upload.  Are they the same file as I uploaded when I applied for HFE?,btohqsg
i received too. but idk where to see what additional file is pending.,btohqsg
Oops I misunderstood üòÖ For that you‚Äôll have to log into My HDB page.MY HDBPage > Overview > My flat > Application status > New flat > Click onto your Sales Regn n.oOnce you‚Äôve done the last step  just scroll through that page and there‚Äôll be a section showing/leading you to the pending docs you need to submit,btohqsg
Hopefully it works for y‚Äôall as I‚Äôm not sure if it might be different for HFE,btohqsg
Tbh their system isn‚Äôt user friendly at all. I only found it myself after spending an hour clicking around ü´†,btohqsg
This is where the 1st step begins,btohqsg
I checked just now. It is different from HLE.,btohqsg
Hi  im sorry if this is a repeated question  but if let's say my partner and I have applied for HLE in March 2023 but coz there's this new HFE thingy  then for May BTO 2023  do we have to apply for HFE? but my HLE is still new and valid for 6 months. Thank you in advance ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
you only need to pass the prelim HFE check  dunnid to apply for HFE,btohqsg
Unless u want to apply for may launch onwards then apply hfe,btohqsg
HDB would have sent you an email  they would have stated in the email if you need. -can confirm to check if you need,btohqsg
anyone encountered difficulty with prelim hfe? got stuck at the filling up of income part and couldn't go to the next page,btohqsg
if they have existing HLE  they only need to pass preliminary HFE check for May BTOonly for August launch onwards they need to apply for HFE letter,btohqsg
nope  did u fill in all the blanks?,btohqsg
i see thank you so much!!,btohqsg
I think u should have receive some email like this,btohqsg
i dont intend to buy a resale  only bto/sbf,btohqsg
did u apply for resale back then?,btohqsg
Hi all  I declined my Nov 2022 flat selection and have another upcoming. I plan to reject that to try for the May BTO. Could anyone clarify when the flat rejection penalty (strike) is applied?If immediate  it might hinder my first-timer status for the May BTO. Also  how does the system view our status? I have a flat selection on May 30th and might be able to apply for the May BTO before rejecting the flat. Will HDB consider it pre or post penalty?Apologies for the complexity. We've contacted HDB without luck. Your assistance is appreciated  as an immediate penalty would prevent us from applying in May 2023.,btohqsg
once you are invited for a flat selection and you reject the chance to book  it considers as one time penalty but i‚Äôm not sure when is it applied ü§î maybe can ask@CPFHDBBot,btohqsg
When is your upcoming one? As long as you reject twice  you are considered second timer status for any upcoming BTO launches that you apply for after the second rejection. However  from my understanding  it does not affect the current ballots you have on hand.E.g. I have 3 ballots on hand  I reject 2  I still can select for the third one.,btohqsg
upcoming one on the 30th may.would you happen to know when the strike will be imposed? as I have rejected my first flat selection (19 may) and have yet to receive any letter regarding the strike.i heard rumours that it will only be issued after all flats are exhausted?,btohqsg
Not too sure leh... Might wanna call HDB at 18008663066 to check. (Heard it takes more than 30 mins to get through).,btohqsg
For your upcoming one  if you don't outright reject  they might wait till end of selection and impose the second timer penalty. This is likely as people can miss their appointment and get rescheduled on a later date. But for confirmation  please check with HDB directly...,btohqsg

What to do if chose and made booking $1000 for flat. But something happened to family and your plans along the lines while waiting for your 2nd appointment? And wish to revoke. Could we cancel and reballot for a 2 room flat instead.,btohqsg
you can  then you forego the $1000,btohqsg
Cancel need to wait very long to process before u can ballot new again,btohqsg
If anyone know where to print the hfe letter once approved?,btohqsg
Why need to print? It's in the system  HDB can see,btohqsg
Oh ok I tot it's a letter,btohqsg
Does anyone know the Feb 2023 bto launch‚Ä¶ roughly which date in June to go ballot?,btohqsg
Can Cancel  forgo the $1000 if you haven‚Äôt sign your lease yet. If you already signed  then the penalty is 5%. Once cancelled  you‚Äôre  banned from applying for BTO for a year. But from what I heard  you can appeal against the ban. Success rate I am not sure.,btohqsg
They havent open up for sbf let us know which are the houses available?,btohqsg
Usually they will open up early to let us know isnt it?,btohqsg

How to refer to our HLE loan amount again?Want to do some rough calculations,btohqsg
Wanna ask... if theres launch..b4 applying can see weather the layout is open kitchen and gt balcony ? Just curious cos im aiming for that kind of unit for 4 room,btohqsg
Firstly u must get a good Q then u can plan your desire unit like have balcony etc.... Now is still too early to think right.Before applying of course can see layout and floorplan. Applying of BTO & SBF have deadline just apply before,btohqsg
My sister Q number at Yishun Boardwalk also cannot get a balcony unit. Balcony unit is limited. Good Q number all will go snap out . Hope u can get a good Q number la,btohqsg
Where can we find the layout and floorplan of projects?,btohqsg
Yes whenever hdb launch bto exercise they will provide the information,btohqsg
my advice is go ahead directly to apply BTO location u likeapplying BTO is similar like lucky draw  not every one can get  and very difficult to getregarding decorations or layout  this is your last priority,btohqsg
1st time applying?Wait till BTO launch then can see.,btohqsg
Me 3rd time then get a number within flaymt supply last year may 2022.,btohqsg
1st 2 tries all out of Q,btohqsg

That's why  ballot first . Can get Q number then plan,btohqsg
Hello just to ask  how does hdb calculate the 12 mths income to determine how much grants and loan the couple will get? Is there a fixed formula for it?,btohqsg
Gross income of all applicants (including essential occupier)How to calculate Gross Income:Applicants + Occupier Salary + Recurring allowancesIncluded: Shift Allowance  Transport Allowance  Meal Allowance  Commissions  Anything that you claim/recieve every month frequently.Excluded: AWS (13th month)  Performance Bonus  One time bonus  One time claimsGross Income does not include Employer's CPF Contributions,btohqsg
Thanks.How about if 1 of the applicants only started working for about 4 months?How do we calculate the average income for the past 12 months?Is it ($xxxx x 4)/12?,btohqsg
I think they have to wait until they are in the new job for 1 yr ba. Coz for enhanced housing grant you need to be working for at least 1 yr to qualify,btohqsg
This is what i had understood,btohqsg
It's ($xxxx X 4) / 4 for my case. I only worked 4 months within the past 12 months and they just divided it by number of months you worked lol... My EHG was issued like few days ago so I think should be quite updated? Not sure for your case maybe can check with hdb,btohqsg
Because of this my grant dropped precipitously,btohqsg
Thanks. I will check with hdb for more info :),btohqsg
Even if partner has worked for 1 month  so it's like ($xxxx x 1)/1?,btohqsg
Do nt all 1st timer will get gd q number?,btohqsg
Launch is only 2x ayear am i right or wrong?,btohqsg
From the calculations seems like it but I think best to clarify with hdb,btohqsg

My sister 1st timer husband 3rd timer   she appeal many times with mp n hdb..she only get 35k due to 1st timer.hassle ting,btohqsg
Can la..nt fair ma...1st timer never buy b4 then suddenly must folow husband 2nd or 3rd timer... but she appeal like v long la almost 4 years.. but now get hse already.,btohqsg
i think u are lucky  in the end  your sister still can get 1st timer EHG 35k,btohqsg
given the fact that your sis husband alrdy took the HDB grants before,btohqsg
Ya..they just look at my sister only la.. like pity like that lor.. cos to tink back not fair right.. just bcos ur partner 2nd 3rd timer then the spouse must follow,btohqsg
Somemre she gt 2kids... so at the same time yeah..,btohqsg
But i still tink 35k quite low furthermore shes nt werking only husband werk..,btohqsg
understood  sureactually HDB EHG is for the whole family together‚Äî-> Husband + Wife together (family nucleus example without kids)EHG is not really separated into individuals . everyone is group together as a family unit,btohqsg
anyway  good to appeal to get the EHGno harm appealing,btohqsg
hey there  do you usually apply for the HFE letter first before applying bto?,btohqsg
anyone knows the rationale behind why EHG has a 12months work requirement to be eligible?,btohqsg
You can try writing into HDB to ask.,btohqsg
hello all  does anyone know what‚Äôs the waiting period from your 1st appointment (choosing unit + otp) to 2nd appointment (1st downpayment)?,btohqsg
Mine was 20 months due to ehg approval issues. But as per otp document it states 9 months.,btohqsg
Wah 20 months that‚Äôs super long. Okay thank you!,btohqsg
Can i check for 2nd timer wat grant can we still get? Alrdy hav grant on 1st timer for 2011 bto,btohqsg
certainly no more EHG grant  since u are now 2nd timermost of the grants like proximity grant  stay near parents grant only for 1st timer onlyi think limited grants for 2nd timermight want to check to HDB to double confirm 1st,btohqsg
Is so hard to reach a proper hdb officer‚Ä¶ i keep hearing diff ting frm diff ppl üò§,btohqsg
many people are not 100% sure about the grantsbest to check with HDB officials for reliable info,btohqsg
Both 2nd timer? No grants. And you have to pay resale levy. üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
And 5% chance for your ballotCan get a unit is the best grant already üòÇ,btohqsg

if youre asking about a SBF group chat:https://t.me/sghdbsbfIf youre asking if it has launched  no  it will launch together with BTO  seems like its 30 May as Straits Times confirmed that date,btohqsg
If I have a BTO queue number already and haven't chosen an unit yet  can I still ballot for the upcoming sales launch?,btohqsg
Oh I see. Means can have two queue number? Because my current queue number exceeds the total units. I am still waiting for the good news,btohqsg
Roughly how long do I need to wait to know that I can/cant choose an unit?,btohqsg
Depends on the queue number leh,btohqsg
My queue is 1600 out of 1422 total units,btohqsg
Idk lol I don't have a crystal ball. Cannot give you a definitive answer...,btohqsg
U better ballot again . Your Q is not within unit now,btohqsg
Closest estimation you can get is to see how many queue numbers (for your unit type) are called down for selection each day and calculate an estimation of when your selection date might be. But pls note there are caveats to this,btohqsg
Can I ask u guy   if my spouse is still foreigner waiting for pr . I only can apply 2room bto only yea ? Or can apply 3&4,btohqsg
Unfortunately ya. My spouse is LTVP when we apply for a BTO but we have a SC child On the way so we can apply for 4rm flat BTO.,btohqsg
But need a EDD (Estimate delivery date) Doctor letter so can apply for 3rm and above.If u don't have a SC child/PR spouse then your Only choice is a Resale flat or  2rm flexi.If ur spouse is a PR and U are SC  you can apply for 3rm snd above  but u all need pay additional $10K for the flat till another SC is in the application like a child or your spouse become SC one day from PR then this 10K will be return to ur your cpf etc...,btohqsg
I forgot already my application is very long ago . But i already got a Child so i can just apply any BTO type of my own choice because i need my child IC number to apply to form 2 SC in a flat application,btohqsg
Has the may launch open already?,btohqsg

Hi all what if I paid but there isn't any confirmation that I have apply for the flat what do I do?,btohqsg
Wah for Bedok plot  why issit their Estimated Completion date (ECD) is 41 months from today but then Delivery Possession Date (DPD) 31 Mar 2029?So which one is the supposed handover date to us?,btohqsg
ECD is the likely date that handover will happen. DPD is the date they need to handover  failing which they need to compensate. So the difference of years between ECD and DPD is so that HDB can cover their ass abit in terms of delays.,btohqsg
Ah so typically we should refer to the ECD  unless got some special cock up situation?,btohqsg
You should be able to check on HDB portal  under application status,btohqsg
I have paid but it doesn't show anything,btohqsg
I see in another bto chat that others are having the same trouble  someone suggested it could be due to HFE  in which case im not sure as im not familiar with the HFE processes. Perhaps you can check that the $10 transaction went through and/or wait a while and contact HDB if theres still no news. Anyway  you have a week to apply  so if it turns out it didnt go through yet  you still have time to apply üòÄ,btohqsg
The payment when through thanks for the help anyway,btohqsg
Hope you get the confirmation soon!,btohqsg

So Mar 2029 is the die die must handover to owner .Hdb Clever one if another covid or other issues come they already covered.,btohqsg
More than a year. Smart now. üòÇ,btohqsg
The 2027 is the Estimated  Completion date (ECD) already said is estimated,btohqsg
Hi  if I already have a ‚Äúlosy‚Äù Que number in the Nov-22 bto  but have yet to select a flatAnd say I managed to get a Que number in this May-23 btoDo I lose the chance to select a flat at the Nov-22 bto?Or I can choose a flat at either the Nov-22 or May-22 bto?Thanks!,btohqsg
Youre able to choose a flat at either theoretically  but realistically depends on when your selection appts are - the reason i say this is bc once you select for 1 project  all other queue numbers you have are forfeited,btohqsg
Guys..just asking... if lets say flat price is 360k... so when dwnpayment time..we must pay use oa.ard 36k combine correct? Solely use oa or can combine with grant?,btohqsg

Guys... i was looking tru sbf ... then i saw 688e woodlands... wen google how come looks like resale flat instead of bto?,btohqsg
Can anyone advise does sbf flats all izit new bto or some gt look like old flat?,btohqsg
no SBF can also include units that are not taken up by people / taken back by HDB from past projects that is already completed long ago too,btohqsg
‚ÄúSBF HDB scheme is essentially an exercise that pools unsold flats from past BTO launches  surplus flats fromSelective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS)projects  and any flats repurchased by HDB.‚Äù,btohqsg
Ya thats y i was looking tru woodlands area...then google i saw mostly is old type of flat... very weird..the lease is still ard 71years... 65years.. very confuse now,btohqsg
is anybody doing balloting now? i have done the preliminary hfe check but after i've been queueing for my turn to ballot  it keeps saying i have not done my preliminary check and to come back after doing even though it has already been completed. Anybody facing the same issue?,btohqsg
Isit better to take those olds ones? Will the lease be affected? So confusing üòï,btohqsg
up to your preference + if you‚Äôre okay with the flat‚Äôs location too,btohqsg
Ok talk abt the 688e...lease 99years..build 2002...now 2023...left 21years more... but it state there like 67 or 71years i forgot,btohqsg

Their IT will take time to resolve on their end,btohqsg
I wouldnt call it resolve la,btohqsg
U just happen to be out of the queue only,btohqsg
How it works is ..Simple explanation on why some people works and some will hang.Their system allow maybe 1 000 people to use it at 1 time.1 001th person to maybe 5 000th is the so called queue.5 001th onwards u probably just get the message that the website is currently unavailable.Then u just gotta wait lo wait at a later time to go in and try again :)No matter how u complain  they will not improve it.Cos probably thats how they set it.They control the traffic of users coming in. Thats all.,btohqsg
Any one no aft apply HFE Precheck and payment  how do u knw which BTO project is selected?

6.6 The allowable lease period will be based on the age of the youngest applicant/spouse at the date of flat application. The chosen lease must be able to last all applicants and their spouses until at least age 95. The selection of lease period will be made during the flat selection. However  if the applicant is married and the chosen lease is insufficient to cover the spouse till the age of 95  the application will be cancelled  and the applicant forfeits any deposit or fees as determined by HDB.https://resources.homes.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp13/files/Conditions%20for%20Purchase%20(Post%20HFE)%20290523.pdfHeyy all  wanted to check if anyone knew about this. Does this mean that if an applicant and his/her spouse is 30 years old then they can only apply for an SBF that has a lease of minimally 65 years?,btohqsg

Okay noted thanks   means still got chance to pick which one,btohqsg
So provided if the queue number is lower the better so that can apply asap,btohqsg
Yep if the queue number is too high theres a chance the more popular one will have limited supply,btohqsg

May I ask if I have done the HFE letter  will I be able to amend it in the future (before the appointment if I got the queue number successfully),btohqsg
