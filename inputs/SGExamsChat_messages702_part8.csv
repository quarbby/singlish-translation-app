for my class  nobody passed the sec 5 geog mid year,btohqsg
Oh and i fr wldve chosen poa over amath if my sch had poa,btohqsg
its combined humans not even pure,btohqsg
Like we must take pure humans,btohqsg
is n to o level jump,btohqsg
yea fr...alot of my juniors been asking me whether they should go sec 5,btohqsg
actually in hindsight i should have taken elective geog instead of elective hist haha. the only reason i managed to scrape thru combined humans is cause i spot history essay lol,btohqsg
i told them  if you are mentally able to block out stigma. go for it,btohqsg
They straight up tell U don't,btohqsg
Unless they r willing to study right after Ns,btohqsg
Lucky I took pure geog la,btohqsg
And not make the decision after getting Ns results,btohqsg
"my sec 5 form was also my sec 4 form..the first day back he literally told everyone ""dont waste my time""",btohqsg
All sec 5 teacher does that,btohqsg
I only ever met 1 guy like irl who did that,btohqsg
Except for one kind soul in my sch he is the best phy teacher and fr a mental support ok thats besides the point,btohqsg
yea..the govt thought they could cramp 4 years of periodical knowledge into 1 year,btohqsg
its was never going to work..unless you are already gifted or super on the ball,btohqsg
The length of the diff sources,btohqsg
humanities..usually follow the same format tho no? i know you dont AQF..instant level 1,btohqsg
Also sometimes some school dont teach o level coursework subjects,btohqsg
i remember looking at the n level papers and yea...,btohqsg
The sources texts R much longer and chim,btohqsg
even compared to o level it's very trivial,btohqsg
They wasted 2 years doing coursework subj,btohqsg
oh the english...please  that shit was like a 180 degree,btohqsg
"i rmb my history teacher in sec 4 was like..ok class just do Source A states ""blah blah blah"" when doing cross referencing",btohqsg
But those who sec 5 I think they may offer,btohqsg
"then come sec 5...the teacher was like  ok class ""go home and watch the movie""",btohqsg
if you got A for coursework in sec 4..and you promoted to sec 5. that means you already gotten A for one of your subjects,btohqsg
Huh that's how it works ah,btohqsg
my teacher did not teach  every other day just went to class and watched war related movies,btohqsg
