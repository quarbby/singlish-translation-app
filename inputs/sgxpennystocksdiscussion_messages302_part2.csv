Wow progen gonna break 58 soon?,btohqsg
Progen is getting interesting. Friday hit 58 stubborn resistance n yet again didn't able to breakout. If we looked again we noticed that July-Sept 2020 it tried to breakout 58 it failed. Failed so many times. Recently we saw it attempted to break 58 4 times including last Friday n failed again. But no worry. Lately saw increased in volume which tells us interest in this counter is back again. PA on Friday showed BBs show face. Friday closed with a bullish engulfing pattern with MACD histogram still moving up. I see this time the bull will be successful in knocking down the 58 wall. The counter cannot always don't break one after attempting so many times. You fight lose to someone few times you go mountain learn martial arts from your Shifu. Go few times come back sure become stronger right?.... 😂. This time must toh the 58.....😂😂😂,btohqsg
