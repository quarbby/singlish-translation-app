Nvidia probably would grow in the next few years even if there is a secular bear market  but once their dominance is challenged it wonâ€™t keep growing,btohqsg
For the next 5 years at least analysts donâ€™t think their position as leader would be challenged so youâ€™re safe holding,btohqsg
At least your ubs shares are up,btohqsg
So you think they shouldâ€™ve let saved credit suisse to allow more competition?,btohqsg
Fuck no but unrealised is unrealised,btohqsg
theres always the block and report function,btohqsg
It can go to the moon,btohqsg
Yeah. They should have taken a more free market approach and provide a larger loan.,btohqsg
Something like TARP would have been better.,btohqsg
After the 10-1 stock split Iâ€™m quite sure there would come a time later this year where NVDA would dip below 100 (which means less than 1000 before the stock split)  not like the massive rally would continue forever. While earnings growth is impressive for Q1 I donâ€™t think the growth rate would remain the same for the rest of this year so itâ€™s kind of overhyped  but over the next few years since the fundamentals of the company are strong  1255 is probably not the high yet,btohqsg
Sekali NVDA reaches 5T valuation by next year,btohqsg
NVDA rivals the GDP of the USA,btohqsg
NVDA is currently just below 3T valuation  to reach 3k the market cap would have to more than double which probably isnâ€™t anytime soon,btohqsg
Just invest what youâ€™re prepared to lose,btohqsg
U will learn what Regulation T means soon when that has been unlocked.,btohqsg
I just checked  itâ€™s 25T lol,btohqsg
I did Biotech before it's prepared to lose more than what u put in,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s ever happening,btohqsg
People have committed suicide after borrowing money to invest and then losing almost everything lol donâ€™t do it to urself,btohqsg
You want to borrow to invest invest in safe stuff,btohqsg
Ok knock my door if nvidia is collapsing,btohqsg
If it happens means NVDA price reaches 10k  or 1k after the stock split,btohqsg
Just set a stop loss above your purchase price lol,btohqsg
How many NVDA shares did you purchase,btohqsg
Yeah I mean it has to rise 8 times above the current price,btohqsg
So I really think itâ€™s almost impossible,btohqsg
Market Cap doesn't work by price,btohqsg
I mean to reach 25T market cap  the stock price would have to rise more than 8 times,btohqsg
I thought itâ€™s current price times this,btohqsg
Assuming the shares outstanding stays the same. Yes,btohqsg
Damn so youâ€™re up about 4000usd now,btohqsg
Yeah so I meant that after the stock split  if the market cap were to rise 8 times  stock price would roughly be 1k. Cos that accounts for the increase in no of shares,btohqsg
Shares outstanding will always increase one,btohqsg
It's just by how much and the rate.,btohqsg
I can make it 300k per share if I just reverse split GME like crazy but that would make no diff to the company,btohqsg
That's 8k in captial what's your portfolio diversity like siol,btohqsg
Unless u tell me u got a 100k portfolio.Why,btohqsg
Can afford to lose it all for the chance of 10x capital,btohqsg
Yolo  diamond hands  hodl  to the moon  never sell  etc.,btohqsg
No possible unless u leverage on options and sell strikes on a leveraged etf,btohqsg
Technically possible if you yolo all into 1 stock and hold,btohqsg
It's risky bit theres a chance you can 10x,btohqsg
Hold till 10x? Wdf u buying penny stocks arh,btohqsg
Like if you bought aapl 12 years ago  you would have 10x alr,btohqsg
Stubborn hodl does work sometimes  you know,btohqsg
If you donâ€™t losing it all continue holding else set a stop loss  say something like at 100usd per share after the stock split. That way youâ€™d make 2000usd. If you donâ€™t mind seeing your account going red  even if the share price dips below your average price you bought at hold and wait for it to rise so that you can sell at a price you want to cash out at  just make sure itâ€™s realistic and do your own research.,btohqsg
Ah yes cherry pick your data to just before the Great Recession,btohqsg
Now this is just dumb  there's a reason why TQQQ's chart looks horrible,btohqsg
Big recession is more than 12 years ago,btohqsg
Yeah so thatâ€™s why I took into account the stock split  since I assume it means shares outstanding would be multiplied by 10,btohqsg
Unless thereâ€™s something Iâ€™m not getting,btohqsg
Yeah but most investors wonâ€™t get that lucky lol,btohqsg
You could lose it all too,btohqsg
Might be better going mbs and putting it all on black,btohqsg
Oh so itâ€™s kind of like shares created once in a while for employees,btohqsg
Not once in a while  my friend,btohqsg
If can afford to lose all then can just buy many companies that are high risk but huge growth potential,btohqsg
Then might as well just spy liao,btohqsg
Fact: most investors dont beat the index in the long run,btohqsg
Buy SPY and bury your head in the sand,btohqsg
not u also cuz u got 90rp for A lvls,btohqsg
You know we also have access to this wonderful invention called Google rite?,btohqsg
Thanks for increasing my rp by 3.75,btohqsg
@Chaeyeonsanasays there is google  so i went there and apparently its some sort of ns claim,btohqsg
But it's one of the claim,btohqsg
Ok maybe that was a little mean,btohqsg
Bro u ITE dropout doing sweet FA u still wanna talk,btohqsg
@aforaceI hope your area not burning incense,btohqsg
Yes u are just different kind of FA... Fuck All,btohqsg
Bruh my area ppl burning for ancestor alr,btohqsg
So u talking about yourself isit?,btohqsg
I dun see burning in my area,btohqsg
But i think it is some religious festive,btohqsg
But you must be  you spend so much time posting in this chat,btohqsg
Japan withdrawal syndrome is v strong now:-(,btohqsg
Is it as crowded as ppl say it is?,btohqsg
I thought qingming then realise it's June,btohqsg
is like u gonna glorify sonny one way or another,btohqsg
I think nintendo world inside usj sia,btohqsg
Wow the banana emoji is wild,btohqsg
My friend went Japan kenna mlm scam out of $20 on the railway platform,btohqsg
No because i went to hokkaido  not as touristy as kansai area and tokyo,btohqsg
What product did they get at least.,btohqsg
People fall for mlm because they are too nice to reject the salesperson,btohqsg
Not a product  it was a train ticket,btohqsg
I recently saw online post that some japanese restaurant mark up prices on foreign languages menu so it is btr to use google translate the japanese menu,btohqsg
Train ticket for the same train they just so happen to be taking  kenna conned into thinking that a random stranger was giving them a train ticket with more perks,btohqsg
? And the train tix is fake?,btohqsg
If train tix is fake  its just a scam  not a mlm,btohqsg
But it is after my trip then i cane across that post on ig,btohqsg
to block view of Mt fuji,btohqsg
And we alr went japan thrice,btohqsg
It was real but it did not give them the perks they were conned to believe,btohqsg
Most of them are really nice,btohqsg
But there are some who rabidly hate chinese and korean people,btohqsg
"I've seen such signs as ""no chinese and koreans allowed"" outside places",btohqsg
I think singaporeans generally they ok lah,btohqsg
"They said that the person showed them what seem to be a identical ticket to them but there were differences and the mlm person told them these ""differences"" meant their ticket was $50 more expensive",btohqsg
I think it's fine if you can speak english,btohqsg
What did they even sell the perks on,btohqsg
Then told them that it's $20 just for you,btohqsg
But i heard japan is a good place for tourists but not locals,btohqsg
They were conned into believe that a diff letter on both tickets meant theirs was worse off,btohqsg
I hv never encountered bad things in japan,btohqsg
In the end they give them the ticket and gave them a extra one and told them to sell it to others,btohqsg
Except for bumping into a mad guy on the street (gd that i dun understand what he was shouting in japanese),btohqsg
But we quickly took out umbrella as a shield,btohqsg
For $40...they just took the ticket and got on the train ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Basically it was like some difference in lettering,btohqsg
Coz idk what he us gonna do man,btohqsg
The best part...they saw the same person take their train,btohqsg
And we were there waiting for a bus so we cant really zao to anywhere,btohqsg
And continue try to get customers on the other train platform they ended at,btohqsg
blud has not enough from Ww2,btohqsg
Not only friendly and tidy  their culture damn good  v patient etc,btohqsg
I mean it's basically what movies potray,btohqsg
Bro these kind of foreigner non-foreigner pricing is common in Alot of countries,btohqsg
Like  they specifically single out Filipinos of all people,btohqsg
Good that i hv not encountered these things in japan,btohqsg
Maybe coz I understand and can converse a bit of japanese,btohqsg
I'm very sure you will only encounter them in very rural areas prob,btohqsg
And im v sure i wun choose to visit them of all places in japanðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Places where they will sit you down on straw mats,btohqsg
I cant stop going to japan,btohqsg
Will it be my 4th in a row next yr hmm,btohqsg
And tell you to enjoy the tea for 15-20 mins before actually consuming..like smell the aroma,btohqsg
Chinese citizens  naturalized japanese citizens  people of chinese descent  not allowed  only pure blooded japanese men,btohqsg
I hv not encountered anywhere that deter foreigners fr entering,btohqsg
Japanese version of deep south  i guess,btohqsg
In fact only places that once u pop ur eye looking in the menu  someone comes n stand there  pressuring us to enter,btohqsg
yalor whole day only you busy looking at tthe menu,btohqsg
Looking for your name on it cuz u a snack,btohqsg
Foreigners not allowed in elevator together with Japanese,btohqsg
Yea I rmb seeing one in india,btohqsg
"The ""certain nationality"" ones are not as common as the price gouging ones",btohqsg
No  you got to fuck it until exploded,btohqsg
Wth are these two ppl gonna do,btohqsg
I had a dish called motherfucking spicy,btohqsg
When the road did not cause the accident,btohqsg
But i think japan racism has died down a lot,btohqsg
At least i hv never encountered those in my 36 days in japan,btohqsg
They can't afford to be  foreigners have the big bucks now with the weak yen,btohqsg
Anyway  those were limited to non-touristy areas anyway,btohqsg
Good for you! I suspect brown people have it a fair bit worse,btohqsg
In fact they all v patient  and offer google translate assistance if their english is really cmi,btohqsg
And also ANA has good English speaking CA,btohqsg
But tbh i did know what they were asking in japanese,btohqsg
You took Japanese as third lang?,btohqsg
No i took japanese language basic in uni,btohqsg
I like their style of providing customers behind w the menu while they serve ppl in front,btohqsg
At least hv time to think  not on the spot,btohqsg
Most airlines dun hv printed menu,btohqsg
SQ used to  until they cut costs in economy,btohqsg
But agreed  Japanese airlines know what they are doing,btohqsg
They hv printed menu for biz class?,btohqsg
One of the world class airlines,btohqsg
Apparently SQ was no 1 last yr,btohqsg
But not for economy (dk abt premium economy),btohqsg
They just upgraded the premium economy serviceware,btohqsg
Now its porcelain instead of plastic,btohqsg
premium economy is the same as economy except for more legroom,btohqsg
ANAâ€™s economy class is same size as SQâ€™s premium economy class,btohqsg
I was damn shiok by it,btohqsg
JAL has a very special 787 economy cabin,btohqsg
Other airlines use 3-3-3 in 787 economy,btohqsg
Therefore JAL has the widest seats of all airlines in 787 economy,btohqsg
I think 2-4-2 is only for premium,btohqsg
I think in japan ANA is still the biggest airline,btohqsg
JAL has 2-4-2 in economy on the 787 for long haul,btohqsg
787 has SQ's narrowest seat  just 17.5 inches wide,btohqsg
Whereas on a A380  SQ seats are 19 inches wide,btohqsg
Lost all my strength alr after slacking too long gg,btohqsg
But JAL really made a customer-centric decision with the 2-4-2 configuration,btohqsg
N it is the most exðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I think after the turbulence  maybe its ranking will drop,btohqsg
"Can't be helped  Singaporeans like to throw money at SQ cos ""premium""",btohqsg
Need book 5-6m in adv to get tickets cheap,btohqsg
But i have never planned a trip that early on,btohqsg
Nah  I flew JFK-SIN last month in business for SGD 1.5k,btohqsg
And bought only 10 days in advance,btohqsg
You just need to know the tricks,btohqsg
This is not bs by the way,btohqsg
But sorry  I can't tell you the tricks haha,btohqsg
how long it took you to apply for a US VISA?Definitely cheap. lol,btohqsg
I got jump scared by a gym staff,btohqsg
Guys I did it  I pulled a divine reel,btohqsg
im too poor to be in the US oof.,btohqsg
whatever lol i may have just doxxed myself,btohqsg
You can get it for 3.5k lol,btohqsg
Learn to use the gds to price out your own fares,btohqsg
Anyone been to hk can confirm?,btohqsg
you didn't bought from GDS tho?,btohqsg
you didn't bought from GDS tho?,btohqsg
ikea is their freedom from bird cage and coffin homes,btohqsg
No  you find a fare construction from the gds  and give it to a travel agent who tickets it for you,btohqsg
These provide data streams from the global distribution system which airlines use to provide information to travel agents,btohqsg
With the fare codes in these systems you can construct your own custom tickets for cheap cheap cheap,btohqsg
Google Flights will not give you a business class ticket on SQ from JFK to SIN for $1.5k sgd,btohqsg
Depends on how you query the GDS system.,btohqsg
Google Flights simply does not give you availability and inventory for individual fare buckets,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/1-m_Jjse-cs?si=4Tx5lAwirIr4S4B4Not bs and this has already been a covered topic.,btohqsg
How tf do you check inventory for C Z U J class  on SQ for example,btohqsg
Google Flights is not granular enough  my friend,btohqsg
No I just watch every Wendover video.,btohqsg
Well  they do make good videos.,btohqsg
But yeah  it is simply impossible to find certain fare combinations on Google Flights,btohqsg
You *must* manually construct it and get a travel agent to go along with it,btohqsg
As I said. Depends on how you query the GDS system to string an itinerary,btohqsg
Correct. But not on Google Flights  dammit,btohqsg
Google Flights is really basic and hides away a lot of stuff,btohqsg
Even with such tools it's useless as the data is not shown in the GDS especially for booking.,btohqsg
As someone who has flown 2 round trips to JFK on SQ biz and ended up with less than 5k PPS value,btohqsg
Try doing that in a snow storm with delayed or cancelled flights.,btohqsg
Now  that's just trolling. irrops can occur no matter how you book your ticket,btohqsg
U can't book southwest flights on the GDS,btohqsg
I'm not gonna reply to that  southwest is a budget airline,btohqsg
Unless got vehicle crash then I come in,btohqsg

#stpotd: For young people  is it worth sacrificing sleep for study? Constant late-night cramming can affect memory and cause cognitive impairment  says a doctor.https://str.sg/bBU6What is your study habit?,btohqsg
late night studying doesn't work.I have seen too many examples.You might be the odd one out but why risk it?,btohqsg
Most do it out of desperation,btohqsg
It ain't the late night studying its the fuel of dying on your exams if u don't,btohqsg
it's about consistency. Not late night studying.No one gets gold in 2.4km by cramming their running training.Why would anyone expect something different to studying?,btohqsg
The hardest to do is maintaining the discipline and motivation to achieving consistency.,btohqsg
Legit made revising easier for me,btohqsg
Note to self: dont drink beer with mala,btohqsg
doesn't just apply for studyingIt's something that extends to everything in life outside school.Applies super heavily to planning your financial,btohqsg
I would say conducive air conditioned environment + good lighting + a detail tutorial explanation session only will work out ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Holy fuck the biggest flying bug idfk what that was scared the shit out of me,btohqsg
I was just on my bed  ac on  windows everything closed,btohqsg
My bed faces the window and the suddenly one fat ass mf zooms out of the curtains and straight towards me,btohqsg
Ducked that shit like i was in professional dodgeball,btohqsg
Worse still  when i try to turn on the lights  somehow this blind sotong bumps into my chest and my soul leaves my body as i fooking lunge away straight into my wardrobe,btohqsg
iâ€™m an odd one out i think but i would advise anyone against it where possible,btohqsg
Hoi si yan shld i get the jarvfjallet,btohqsg
What's the edgiest MediaCorp drama idea you can think of?,btohqsg
"they alr did it  it was called ""The pot""",btohqsg
basically a giant pot of water that span a whole corridor was places between 4 families...the drama literally revolved around that pot of water,btohqsg
i mean itâ€™s a decent chair but you need to know what youâ€™re looking for in one,btohqsg
Ehh  doesn't sound too edgy.Here's my idea: Singaporean remake of 24 (it's a US drama series from the 2000s following Jack Bauer  a Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agent. Each season unfolds over 24 hours  1 episode covering 1 hour  depicting Jack's relentless pursuit of dangerous threats against the United States. As he races against the clock  Jack confronts personal betrayals  deadly conspiracies  and difficult moral choices. And he resorts to torture A LOT.)Singaporean version:Title: 24 HoursSynopsis: David Lim is a brilliant and hardened CTU agent under the ISD. When he receives intel of a potential terrorist attack in Yishun during an election rally within the next 24 hours  he has to stop it  but that's not going to be as simple as it looks. Meanwhile  a plane crashes near Singaporean airspace. Thus begins the longest 24 hours of his life...,btohqsg
Ye but not for very long,btohqsg
I like leaning back but the chair doesnt allow enuff for me,btohqsg
Also just learnt some f1 lore  goddam max stole daniils soul,btohqsg
dang you should have gone to harvard,btohqsg
Sry for a rant again but i think at this rate i cant share my struggles w my parents,btohqsg
Every time how they react / talk to me make me feel worst,btohqsg
I hv been breaking down more and more in the past few months,btohqsg
They complain I listen to friends more but do not reflect on themselves  the cause of it,btohqsg
They only know how to say what i need to do to solve the problem but dun realise it is easier said than done,btohqsg
When i say i really need help  like possibly therapy  they brush it aside and say it is expensive,btohqsg
I say this only coz i know at this point i cannot help myself and my parents dun seem to be bothered w helping me out of this,btohqsg
They only know how to say things like i cant be in their payroll forever,btohqsg
I mean i also want the $$ and i also dw to burden them coz they hv 4 kiddosâ€¦i told them i alr hv interview phobia and instead they tell me like â€˜i cant avoid itâ€™  like DHE I KNOW THAT,btohqsg
I recall u tried the University Counselling Centre before rite?,btohqsg
What was your experience with em,btohqsg
No i went to external one but for a different issue,btohqsg
It was basically targeting stress and anxiety sort of,btohqsg
That one was a once off session coz my lessons / exams were alr ending,btohqsg
You can tell then about your parents if you are comfortable sharing. The university counselling service I mostly treat it like a vent session,btohqsg
Actually this whole therapy idea i heard of fr a friend who kinda had this same social anxiety thing as me and said it really helped her after a few months,btohqsg
If the external one is working telling em so can help you negotiate maybe a lower rate,btohqsg
That one was free coz it is a npo,btohqsg
But im not sure about the extent of their services,btohqsg
But my friend told me psychotherapy charge $100-200 per 1h session and it likely takes a few months to come to fruition,btohqsg
Hmm when u go out to work u should be provided some form of healthcare insurance if it's a big company too and that can address the non-supportive parents.,btohqsg
But they are counsellors  not therapist so there is a limit to the extent they can do,btohqsg
I know IMH is cheaper but the therapy is hit or miss one.,btohqsg
I think it needs courage to be willing to go for therapy session,btohqsg
Courage and drive cuz it's a weekly thing or bi weekly,btohqsg
That u gotta drag yourself to even if it seems like no progress is made.,btohqsg
My parents are like ditching my own personal issues and even health issues,btohqsg
Like they are not even worried at all when i was feeling unwell for 3m ++ after i recovered fr covid,btohqsg
Ah long covid is the WORST,btohqsg
I had to tell them finally that im going to the docs,btohqsg
My mum be like â€˜what can the doctor doâ€™,btohqsg
For mental health or like the flu thing,btohqsg
It is not really the covid symptoms lingering  my body just feels v weak  and i cannot walk up more than 1 flight of steps,btohqsg
The mental health thing  it was my relative who stepped in to bring me to her friend who is a counsellor,btohqsg
That one is a physical issue idk why is that a problem ngl,btohqsg
Coz my parents said if find sth  then cannot buy insurance,btohqsg
Like wth??? My health or $ is more important,btohqsg
Bruh lmao then what just never find it and let it get worst,btohqsg
Then they just gonna lemme suffer + all the psychological stress it brings me,btohqsg
Yea my friend went for weekly sessions for 6m,btohqsg
And she said it really helped her,btohqsg
The difference is her parents are supportive of it,btohqsg
My aunt booked health screening for me secretly but things screwd up when the appt message went to my dadâ€™s number,btohqsg
Yeah but what extent do u think they are un supportive tho.,btohqsg
U can probably request to change it to your number,btohqsg
Just call up Singhealth if it's government,btohqsg
Every time i brought up the idea of going for therapy  they brush it aside,btohqsg
Yea but i did not know it was still my dadâ€™s number being registered,btohqsg
Yikes they even control your medical stuff ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
I think coz i seldom go to clinic  then never change,btohqsg
Coz omo i just turned 21 fairly recently,btohqsg
I only go clinic if i need a MC or sick for long coz my fam stocks up meds fr retail pharmacies,btohqsg
Yeah u medically emancipated liao. That's the first thing I did when I turn 18 tbh,btohqsg
Just change the contacts to me,btohqsg
I told them the problem but they never do anything,btohqsg
For major medical procedures yes 21,btohqsg
I told them that i hv interview phobia and dun want interviews anymore,btohqsg
Their reply be like saying the obvious,btohqsg
What don't attend interviews or just cope with it,btohqsg
â€˜U are like waiting for a miracle to dropâ€™â€˜Then what? Every job needs interview  even pull stringsâ€™,btohqsg
Isn't that the root of the your stress?,btohqsg
It seems that the reason for your anxiety is because of how pivotal the interview stage is.,btohqsg
They are basically saying it seems like im not putting in the effort  but they do not like see all the stress and blah that it has brought me,btohqsg
And i generally need warm up  the way i talk to someone i know for long vs someone i seen for the first time is vastly different,btohqsg
So my first impression is generally not v good,btohqsg
My first impression is horrible as well ngl,btohqsg
My friend went for psychotherapy for this,btohqsg
And she said it really helped,btohqsg
My parents only know how to say things like â€˜idk what u do in interviews that bring u to this stageâ€™,btohqsg
Your parents never experienced interviews meh?,btohqsg
They do but both my parents were psc scholars,btohqsg
So first job wasnâ€™t a problem,btohqsg
Then they hv the good acads + experience to help them on,btohqsg
And my parents hv been v lucky  most of their jobs were introduced by someone / pull strings,btohqsg
And omo if u are in the middle of ur career  u fail an interview not a problem  just continue w ur prev one lor,btohqsg
But middle of career switch is different cuz u got experience liao,btohqsg
In fact i think social anxiety is a running thing in my family,btohqsg
Just that my mum knows how to switch personality in the work place,btohqsg
And my mum was in her 2nd job for 20+yrs,btohqsg
So ofc easier to hv selling points,btohqsg
The fresh grad one u need to know what and how to yap,btohqsg
So she just has her professional side la basically,btohqsg
The thing is there are places w vacancies,btohqsg
So not really just abt differentiating urself,btohqsg
My dad be like if u cant talk  u need connections to bring u far,btohqsg
Where u get those connections from lmao u can't just pull em out your ass,btohqsg
Without an interview or assessment? U probably got filtered out by the algorithm,btohqsg
No it is i failed the interview,btohqsg
Hmm yeah I do think this rises to case whereby u would required some form to therapy to change the responses. Like this is not even mental health anymore it's affecting your job and thus economic opportunities,btohqsg
Maybe u can sell it to your parents as something like a skillsfuture course instead of just mental health,btohqsg
For now i desperately need to find sth coz the trg slated to start end of june (24th),btohqsg
Stay strong  it's a pretty bad market right now.,btohqsg
I know this sounds tone deaf  but there are worse places to be at your age...,btohqsg
Capitalize on your strengths and Singapore's advantages,btohqsg
Makes sense. Now when will they just bring back the old system where you build in anticipation of demand? Having vacant HDBs was a feature  not a bug.,btohqsg
But no  they have to introduce BTO so it looks like the Scholar-Minister Mah Bow Tan is doing something useful.,btohqsg
I still can't figure why LKY thought it was a good idea to brag about MBT's O level results in an election campaign.,btohqsg
so what do they diagnose ?,btohqsg
how much food do you buy? sometimes feel paiseh buying $1 fries and sitting there forever,btohqsg
Can't wait to get my serving of milk- and vanilla-flavored vegetable shortening for the cheap cheap price of 50 cents! ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Bought the 1$ fry too but now need to buy smth else oso,btohqsg
So i bought the new hershey ice cream +1.50  too sweet imo,btohqsg
can't afford to offer discount for this,btohqsg
croaker on sat is a pretty sweet deal though,btohqsg
Also got another noodle dish the soup is pink q nice,btohqsg
Tho my mom didnt rly like putien  she say too ex,btohqsg
But she like dian xiao er cus the fish maw nubbad,btohqsg
Everytime i open my book i instantly wanna sleepðŸ’€,btohqsg

Tho not like we go restaurants weekly or smth  only once a month if free,btohqsg
