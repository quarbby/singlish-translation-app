Her pretty face sustained her in the industry,btohqsg
i read on weibo a director once said she's quite pretty and ok at acting but she's afraid of making expressions and be ugly on camera,btohqsg
Sounds like shes not a highly skillful actress,btohqsg
Means she hasnt broken that shell lor,btohqsg
She has not let down her guards,btohqsg
Wow but this uptight can sustain her fame for so many years,btohqsg
her career has been smooth sailing actually  so they say that's one of the factors why she can't emote why because she doesn't know first hand what huge trauma feels like that kind,btohqsg
She happens to have that sort of luck,btohqsg
that kind lah and she got consistent shows also,btohqsg
but her shows/movies not rated high in china,btohqsg
I think she is in high demand alr,btohqsg
She has no chance for other kind of roles,btohqsg
Hmmm. Let me think about it,btohqsg
So she is highly sort after by small films?,btohqsg
certainly if i was a director i would choose maybe yangzi,btohqsg
the issue here is she is americanised and knows english 'fluently',btohqsg
they can't cast like yangmi and yangzi,btohqsg
Cos liu yifei is known to be pretty but truly not a famous actress,btohqsg
Her name is indeed quite å†·é—¨ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
she's known for her natural beauty and stuff in china,btohqsg
Thats all i know about her too ðŸ˜‚ that she is pretty,btohqsg
yangzi is known for her acting but gets bashed for her looks and weight haha,btohqsg
But nth much about her being a popular actress ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
yeah on weibo they always compare pretty actresses to yangzi because she's not the prettiest in their industry,btohqsg
I think yangzi is fine leiii,btohqsg
comparing yangmi  dilireba  liuyifei  zhao liying etc to yangzi,btohqsg
After awhile all looks so standard,btohqsg
Their faces may vary but the eyes n nose bridge all look similar to me,btohqsg
dilireba is damn pretty tho haha,btohqsg
They say she has never gone under the knife before,btohqsg
Y not show Casper the friendly ghost,btohqsg
One of the worst movies I have seen,btohqsg
Tbh not jus actress. Entire storyline wasnâ€™t good,btohqsg
