So good results‚Ä¶more than 400% but no dividend payout ???,btohqsg
Pre COVID they have been paying dividends consistently. This results is a media release. Looks preliminary ahead of the actual results. I think they might propose dividends. Not too sure.But having revenue growth like that would eat into the working capital too  so cash flow might be affected if they plan to give out dividends too.Let‚Äôs see. My Chasen lots are already bought up.Will probably match in some lots for some trading later too,btohqsg

Pika World Daily Update: 10 August 2021The equity market wobbles slightly on the backdrop of global growth worry. We see the Dow and S&P 500 marginally down for the session  with tech-rich Nasdaq rose somewhat. Russell 2000 fell in the broad market too.Bitcoin is Mooning with Infrastructure Bill on TrackSince May  the crypto is trading at its highest level when it tumbles sharply as inflation fear eases and multiple regulatory crises hit its price. However  with the bill's prospect passing getting higher  the inflation theme is back on track  and Bitcoin could regain its status as a hedging tool.Nonetheless  regulatory uncertainty may take a front seat when more visible rules are brought forward by governments worldwide.AMC: Setting a Stage for RecoveryThe company reduces its net loss to around $344 million for the June quarter. This is pleasant news for investors as the stock traded up in the after-hours. The net loss of 71 cents is much smaller than the anticipated 94 cents.The company raised a total of $1.25 billion  allowing them to have a stronger balance sheet. This means about $2 billion in cash and untouched lines of credit. As most of the theatres re-open  its revenue should see strong traction due to increased vaccination progress despite some persistent laggard regions and the growing spread of Delta variant.Pika World sees short term stability in the business given that AMC and Warner Bros had reached a consensus to show their movies for 2022 with a 45-day window before these movies will channel into streaming service. This is a piece of positive news from the previous announcement by WarnerMedia that it intends to release films simultaneously on HBO Max with theatres for 2021 calendar year  mainly due to the pandemic.Weakening Oil PricesWhat seems to be a mini flash crash of the gold prices as it sank briefly to around $1684 an ounce before sharply recovering to $1732.30. This is a fall of nearly 3% from last week prices. The concern is that the Delta variant may compromise and hit the global travel industry  and Brent Crude is also a victim as it dropped by more than 2% to reach $69.25 even after giving up 6% last week.It does not help as the United Nations panel continued to hammer down on the greenhouse gas level  which may cause climate crisis and disruptions for the decades.Economic Progress in China and EuropeGoldman Sachs also downgraded China's 3rd quarter growth forecast to 2.3% from a high of 5.8% as the country reduces economic activities to slow down the spread of newfound Covid cases.Pika World bright spots on European equities remain relatively stable given a traditional smaller trading activity due to the August summer holidays as both Stoxx Europe 600 rise while German and French stocks were marginally weaker. Italian market ticked up by around 0.5%. Nonetheless  if Covid cases worsen and pull back unlocked travel restrictions  no markets will be immune.Pika World expects to continue to stay slight overweight on European equities as we wait for more data in the weeks ahead.What's on the Menu Today?It is going to be a data-packed week.At 8.30 pm  the Nonfarm Productivity will be released  and we expect a growth of 3.5% compared to 5.4% in the prior period.It is 10 August  Tuesday  8.50 am in Singapore and 8.50 pm in New York. The start of the trading week has been rewarding  and we hope all friends navigate well into a rich data week ahead!If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
