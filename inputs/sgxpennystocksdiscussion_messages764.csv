🎉Pika World Daily Review – 21 Feb 2023🎉🧮Equity futures were flat🗽As investors look towards a data-heavy week  the equity market still feels the heat of interest rate hikes. In recent weeks  robust economic data and a relatively hawkish tone from Fed officials had paused the risk-on sentiment as traders re-assessed the terminal interest rate.📮What are our dishes today?📖At 10.45 pm  we will have the Manufacturing PMI  which we expect a modest improvement from 46.9 to 47.1. Service PMI should also see a climb from 46.8 to 47.1.The existing Home Sales figure for January will arrive at 11 pm and is expected to still see a slight tick up to 4.10M from 4.02M.It is Tuesday  21 Feb  at 9.02 am in Singapore and 8.02 pm in New York. So we can expect a swinging week again and hope for a splendid trading week!From your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Update- 22 Feb 2023🎉🧸Markets retracement in motion🧮Stocks dropped sharply on Tuesday as investors realized a higher probability of a 0.5% rate hike in the March FOMC meeting. In addition  the latest earnings from retailers such as Walmart and Home Depot added disappointment with worries on weakening earnings forecast on the horizon.This is sufficient to wipe out all gains for Dow and put the index into the red territory for the year. The 10-year Treasury yield hit nearly 4%  adding pressure to Nasdaq.💰Economic data showed resilience🍏The latest S&P 500 Global Flash Composite Output Index that helps to track the manufacturing and service sectors saw it hit a high of 50.2  underpinning the strong demand for services even as manufacturing still shows signs of weakness. It should not be surprising given that we also saw a solid retail sales of 3% rise in January last week  exceeding the 1.7% expectation.This points to the Fed having more groundwork for dampening economic demand; thus  robust data might be bad news for the equity market.📮What's on the menu today?📊The key highlight for today will be the FOMC minutes which will be released at 3 am. This will shed light on FOMC members' inclination on the pace of rate hikes and assessment of the general economy.It is 22 Feb  Wednesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. It has been a challenging trading day  and we hope all friends have a recharging week ahead!From your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Agree  attended their AGM before  most of the consumer products are sold outside SG / MY so they are not so visible to us.But then again  they got a long way to go before becoming the next Nestle.Being in many biz somehow makes Wilmar more vulnerable than strong.

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 23 Feb 2023🎉🎙FOMC Minutes in Focus🔭Most Fed officials are seeing a slowing inflation and a possible peak in the federal funds rate this year  according to the latest FOMC minutes. Without any surprise  they reinforce that incoming data will guide their future FOMC rate decisions Yet  the current FOMC minutes are due after the hot January jobs and the firm retail sales data. Hence  analysts are now pricing for a higher fed-fund rate this year. Most Fed officials welcome the move to moderate the interest rate hike to better assess the following economic data.Nonetheless  most are still uncomfortable with the sticky inflation scenario  emphasising the need to do more to help tame inflation. Hence  we shall seek confirmation on incoming data before making big moves.💰Nvidia: Earnings beat  and stocks rose🍏Earnings came in above estimates  and the management sees a rosy future from the prospects of AI services. The big news was the outlook above the midpoint of Wall Street’s estimate.Investors cheered on the guidance  which sent Nasdaq to rise sharply after an hour. In this episode  I suffered a loss on the prospect of possible options assignment due to some short call options. This is a painful lesson and a good reminder for all friends to close their options even if there is a forsee degree of safety net to account for possible large after-hour swings  especially during earnings season.Although it happens after after-hour  it is still possible for the assignment of options  and this will erode considerable gains. So learn from my mistake and hope you will gain more too!📖What are our dishes today?📮At 9.30 pm  we will have the data for GDP for Q4. We expect the growth to remain similar at 2.9%. The figure is vital for us to assess if a soft landing is possible. Also  if the figure is too strong  it may stir inflation fear again. So  do watch out for the data.Likewise  Initial Jobless Claims are expected to climb modestly to 200K. A strong labour market may hint at underlying solid inflation too.At 11.50 pm  we will have FOMC member Bostic speaking  and that could once again shake the market.It is 23 Feb  Thursday  9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. The after-hour market is rosy  and I will work to control my loss from the short positions due to possible option assignments. I will still be around for the data release.See you tonight!Pika Nat.,btohqsg
