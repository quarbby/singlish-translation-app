he's not confident he can go poly,btohqsg
he flunked studying for N levels,btohqsg
iirc it was his girlfriend usually pushing (motivating) him to study together at somewhere at like a library or their school,btohqsg
his prelim ELMAB3 was like 17-18 raw,btohqsg
i calculated for him based on his report slip and said it was 17 points and he said after calculating himself that it was 18,btohqsg
Omg a level is finally over,btohqsg
since it's over we shall temporarily close the A level chat  no further discussion required,btohqsg
9744 and 9749 should be H2 others no idea,btohqsg
I thoight h1 econs over alr,btohqsg
has anyone ever responded or went down to check for any of these alerts,btohqsg
yeah  don‚Äôt go unless you‚Äôre trained to do so tbh (and confident to deal w the emergency),btohqsg
the only reason i downloaded was for the casual police report feature they have on their app,btohqsg
I have 1 bitcoin who wants half,btohqsg
no way am i going to spf website or some video tell machine (VTM) at a neighborhood police office just to make a police report,btohqsg
how do u even 0.5 of one bitcoin,btohqsg
man this is where my love-hate relationship with industry specialisations come in,btohqsg
i know  im just trying to entertain myself,btohqsg
i hope my fever cooling patch doesn't end up solid frozen in the freezer because i want to get it into *cold temperature through express mode,btohqsg
Sell the bitcoin n split the money,btohqsg
if you only have a single $1 coin  how do you split half of it ( im being logically dumb cause memeline already clarified ),btohqsg

EH I TRIED THIS METHOD B4 (asking shops for a small money change)........they'll either1) shoo me away2) ask me to buy something first /3) ask for a bigger (or even more smaller) change money which i probably don't have4) call for their manager who will reject me ü§†üò≠‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
the only reason why I kena reject before is cause they dw big coins/notes,btohqsg
otherwise they've alw been v willing to change,btohqsg
i heard shops in different down town areas have drastic services from what ppl might have personally experienced,btohqsg
i asked for a small change from $10  some stall asked if i had $50 instead otherwise they won't change,btohqsg
West side been good to me,btohqsg
i even went to a cinema (but that's on me ngl) and those lelong shops to exchange small money changes and they always had some weird requirement or excuse to reject me??,btohqsg
ok to be fair.. i usually frequent the opposite side,btohqsg
west side has pretty good retail service but you'll need to dig deeper,btohqsg
i frequent a lot of northeast  east and central (downtown city) areaslike punggol  sengkang  buangkok  hougang  kovan  serangoon  ang mo kio  tampines  pasir ris  paya lebar  bugis  orchard  marina etc,btohqsg
it's always a hit-or-miss situation  even with repeated patronization,btohqsg
rlly ? they gave me the change even tho i didn‚Äôt buy smthg,btohqsg
different town area / shops got different retail service,btohqsg
some shops are p nice but others.. not so much,btohqsg
Have you used Google pus before,btohqsg
i rmbr that service ceased operations,btohqsg
responded to a few cardiac cases  never really got one for fire tbh,btohqsg
did you do any training to respond to alert cases near you? idk if an individual-- die die needs the qualification before they can help but im pretty confident with basic first aid learnt from classes and UG,btohqsg
i think a certification is good to have  rather than a must have for this types of things,btohqsg
ohh  that's pretty useful to know! thanks üôè,btohqsg
personally i have a standard first aid + cpraed cert from red cross but i don‚Äôt recall any instances where i had to show it while responding,btohqsg
with an interesting way to take a picture of questions,btohqsg
i would have never bothered to look carefully at profiles if no one says something AGGGHH,btohqsg
like who in the right minds puts sex related images (aside from memes and art) in their profiles,btohqsg
this snapshot exam paper of questions....,btohqsg
idk whether to laugh at the english formatting of the questions or cry at it,btohqsg
the horror of peeking into someone's profile because usually it's either thinking someone's profile is pretty rad with the aesthetics or that they're cool after talking with them-- so you wanna check them out right?flashed by a ( nehneh / t*t  kkj  cb or some weird fetish shit ) picture somewhere in their profile images that's set to public for some reason..,btohqsg
curse from the curiosity of the cat,btohqsg
