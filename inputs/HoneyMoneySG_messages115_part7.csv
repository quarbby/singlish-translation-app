Just to be clear amaze doesnt work with Uob krisflyer for the 3 mpd is it? Yikes I think I made big mistakes,btohqsg
Hi all  on tax matters  is there a rule for parent relief we cannot claim both side? I claim for mother in law cos we giving her allowances. For my mum who I giving allowance as well  I didn‚Äôt cos she has part time job. But for FY 25  the limit will increase to 8k which her annual pay is below. Thanks,btohqsg
It sounded like if we use amaze can‚Äôt get 1.8 mpd extra based on the thread earlier,btohqsg
I am happy if that is wrong,btohqsg
Sorry i missed out the earlier context. Uob kf 3mp for agoda is based on transaction description. Amaze with uob kf will change transaction to Amaze* so it wont give you additional 1.8mpd. For other cases of amaze + uob kf that uses mcc check  the combo should work.,btohqsg
You can use amaze + UOB KF for shopping  grab and dining overseas. In fact this is my default combination if my Citi reward is max out,btohqsg
That‚Äôs weird. So where would amaze and UOB KF won‚Äôt work? Just agoda?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  can further clarify whether the 3x stock bundle is to hold the 8 buy trade (e.g. 8x $1 Fullerton SGD Cadh Fund) or need to hold the $10k deposit for 90 days?,btohqsg
Hold 10k and Do not withdraw for 90 days,btohqsg
Can someone tell me if I can buy Singapore reits via moomoo platform?How will the dividends be paid to me? Into the account? Or to bank account?I never buy reits before,btohqsg
Just received my latest HSBC revo bill. There is one 5812 transaction that wasn't even given the normal 1 point. What could went wrong?,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs your first time buying REITs  are you sure you want to buy it yourself instead of going through robo advisors?,btohqsg
Can I check  therefore to optimise the $80k deposit  the steps are:1. Deposit $80k.2. Subscribe to say Fullerton SGD Liquidity Cash Fund (7 times of $1 and 1 time of $79993).3. Hold $80k for 30 days.4. On day 31  withdraw $70k5. Hold the remaining $10k for 90 days.6. On day 91  withdraw the remaining $10k.By completing the steps above  the total reward would be $20+$447+$70+$210=$747.,btohqsg
Into the account. You can then withdraw to your bank account  or sweep it into their SGD money market fund,btohqsg
Looks ok  but confirm with Moomoo CSO,btohqsg
Whichever is fine. Just thinking if it‚Äôs your first time  do you have the knowledge which to buy or sell.But it‚Äôs up to you,btohqsg
Watch the videos by our guys lor ..,btohqsg
No knowledge but watch video recommendations,btohqsg
for no 2  if he does not keep at least minimum balance (in this case 2k)  he will need to pay the Fall-Below Fees right?,btohqsg
I assumed he has 2k as base balance before he transfer in 2k monthly.,btohqsg
Payment method? Still under 1k limit? Or is it even 5812 not 5814?,btohqsg
wah  how u track to know that is the transaction with issue and also the mcc.,btohqsg
Contactless. Under 1k. 5812 according to heymax. There was a grab ride transaction that was not awarded any points also. Regardless  there should be at least 1 point right?,btohqsg
I only had 4 transactions for that month. So easy to count/match the transaction to the points given.,btohqsg
Videos are all for entertainment  not financial advice.,btohqsg
Use the app to check  now they tell u the base point for every transaction,btohqsg
Sounds like that 5812 trx not posted in that calendar month  else would have gotten base points.,btohqsg
If not posted won't be part of his statement Liao..,btohqsg
"Ah didn't know got this function. I checked and confirm no base points rewarded for 2 of my transactions. But now that I do backwards calculation  it seems correct.I see alot of ""point aging base adjustment"" and ""miscellaneous - bonus"" on the app.",btohqsg
Also strange that the available points reflected in my app is more than the total points available in my latest statement. üòÄ,btohqsg

If link amaze to KF will still earn 1.8mpd additional for fcy in white list?,btohqsg
Is it typo? 1.8mpd not %.,btohqsg
get bonus 1.8mpd if whitelist mcc and fulfil min $800 SIA related spend in same card membership year  no 1.8mpd if whitelist merchant,btohqsg
I have a similar situation. Heymax when searched indicated as 5812. But when I paid it was flagged as 5814. I checked with heymax and they mentioned that some merchants may be using both codes depending on payment method (ie if you charge using paywave it may be 5814 while if you pay using ShopBack link to cc it may be 5812). So what u search in heymax may have a small chance be different if it wasn‚Äôt the payment method heymax tracked.,btohqsg
How you see it being flagged as 5814? Need to check with CSO? Even 5814 shld have the base points ma.,btohqsg
For anyone interested to try self initiated self transfer for OCBC 360 - salary crediting requirement,btohqsg
This was confirmed quite a while agohttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/205582,btohqsg
Am using the ocbc infinity card to clock ocbc 360 account spending bonus qualification.¬† If I attach it into insta amaze  can it still qualify,btohqsg
Should qualify as part of your OCBC360 $500 min spend for 0.6% interest. MCC wont change when using Amaze  and OCBC Infinity's T&C does not exclude Amaze*.,btohqsg
any reason to use with Amaze? No benefit unless using for cross border/fcy spend,btohqsg
Maybe he feels good seeing the MCCs revealed in Amaze app (like me) ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Thanks a lot!  Thought there is some points system for amaze  or now no more and totally no motivation?,btohqsg
Seems Amaze can help add up the spending also easier to see total for the month,btohqsg
Points only for foreign currency spending iirc.,btohqsg
Oh got it... Forgot about that... Started amaze long ago but hardly use it. Will still keep Infinity linked to amaze  want to track the total card spent more convenient,btohqsg
for online fashion  since it's in MYR  does it count under fashion or MYR spend?,btohqsg
I linked my card into heymax which will show the transactions when charged. It was charged to 5814  but before when I searched it was showing 5812. My statement is not out yet though.,btohqsg
I should still expect base points. Then maybe my case was different from urs.,btohqsg
