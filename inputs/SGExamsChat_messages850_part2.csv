How long do Taobao refunds take to reach the payment accounts?,btohqsg
depends but usually quite fast within 2 weeks  excluding sat & sun (if u seek a refund while ur items are still stuck in transit  u might get both the refund* money & item LOL),btohqsg
u might also want to monitor how much u paid because u won't really notice when exactly does refunds get deposited back to u,btohqsg
