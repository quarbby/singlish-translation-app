But forgo recurring payment means more troublesome  hv to manually do every month...,btohqsg
Generally yes. Point to note is crmc excludes Travel mcc,btohqsg
Add card to netflix and they will deduct recurringly. Considered online.,btohqsg
you also needdbs wwmc for online travel and kris+choc card for <$5 and public transport,btohqsg
As long as u have data comms as 1 of your preferred category  it will be counted,btohqsg
Okay I realised this was a silly question 😂,btohqsg
Does buying furniture using Shop-BACK with CRMC qualifies for the 10x pts?,btohqsg
Helping a friend to ask. Anybody apply US Visa before? When you need to pay US Visa fee?1). At the time of form submission?2). After submitted visa application form and received the payment request email?3). Go to different website to fill up info and pay the US visa fee using credit card?,btohqsg
Just wanna double confirm  EGA interest Rate for March 3.90%?,btohqsg
0.05% prevailing interest rate2.85% bonus interest rate promo (Mar to May) on incremental funds (ref Feb)1% everyday+ rewards for Mar (ref Feb),btohqsg
Just curious why 3 months no good?,btohqsg
Because if you participate in the 3rd month  you cannot participate for the immediate month. And assuming subsequent promos are 3 months again  with the rewards only paid 2 months after promo period  your interest on the 1st month will be given to you 4 months later instead of 3 months.Mar 25 Promo:Mar - ClockApr - SkipMay - ClockCannot take Jun 25 promo because ref month is May.Jul 25 Promo:Jul - Clock (receive Mar 25 promo rewards)Aug - SkipSep - ClockCannot take Oct 25 promo because ref month is Sep.Nov - receive Jul 25 promo rewardsNoting that interest rates in Jul might be lower than in Jun.,btohqsg
Can I check will I be able to get 4mpd for booking scoot using uob visa signature? The amount is more than 1k,btohqsg
Hi guys I have uob one card and my cycle starts on 3 of every monthIs it safe to use today?,btohqsg
best to start use on 3,btohqsg
if in sgd then no 4mpd,btohqsg
Dp seems to suggest it's 5812 so UOB lady dining will work.,btohqsg
for local spend only get 4mpd for contactless or petrol  need min 1k local spend. scoot is online not contactless,btohqsg
Oh. Even I use apply pay to pay scoot also can’t uh,btohqsg
No touching the terminal  no contactless.,btohqsg
in-app applepay is online not contactless,btohqsg
Oh no. Then in the future what card should I use in uob,btohqsg
I’m trying to shortlist a general spend miles card for transactions less than $50 after the amaze nerf takes effect. I’ve narrowed down to dbs altitude and citi premiermiles since their miles don’t expire -has anyone used either/both of them and can share your experienceswith them  along with factors that could possibly compel someone to use one over the other? The only thing I can think of at the moment is if I book anything on Agoda  then dbs altitude being a Visa card will let me avoid the extra 1% charge,btohqsg
UOB KF waving at you 😁,btohqsg
What are other cards that you own?,btohqsg
Uob: one  lady’s  ppv  kf  prvimilesScb: simply cashAmex: tcb  kf blueTrust: cashbackThe cashback cards are mostly from before I switched to miles,btohqsg
Why don’t use you use PriviMiles for general spending so the pools can pool?,btohqsg
The small transactions that don’t fall nicely within $5 blocks will be tricky,btohqsg
I'd do UOB ppv for above 5$. Anything below 5$ that cannot be covered by UOB lady I'd use cashback card. Not worth using miles card for such expenses.,btohqsg
So visa signature is only good for foreign transactions ?,btohqsg
Contactless in terms of paywave only right ?,btohqsg
For <$5  can consider Chocolate Visa for now. 2mmpd and Max Miles have no expiry.Personally Citi not allowing pooling is a hassle to manage.And starting DBS collection doesn’t simplify things for you.,btohqsg
Yep. It's official definition from uob.,btohqsg
True  it would take a long time to earn the miles on those small transactions,btohqsg
Hi guys do you know how safe is chocolate finance?,btohqsg
Thanks for your input too  really helpful 👌🏼,btohqsg
Leave the UOB ppv card at home so you won’t accidentally use it,btohqsg
Got a letter from uob offering 0% retail interest for 6 months.. Any gurus can explain how it works ah?Isit I spend on anything  can delay payment for 6months at 0% interest?,btohqsg
It is an investment firm and not a bank. Form your own judgement,btohqsg
Nvr say anything abt processing fees,btohqsg
Then it is different from what I know,btohqsg
Anyone know if uob ladies card has any sign up bonus from any site as of now,btohqsg
