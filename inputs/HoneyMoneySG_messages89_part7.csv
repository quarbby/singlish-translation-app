You are not alone. üëΩTake note If you subscribed more than the exact amount   ie. $90k  do calculate the return yourself n compare to the cash coupon once they give u.Moomoo tends to include the return of your extra $10k into the 5.8% return calculation.,btohqsg
Sorry did I get myself correct.Currently usd 10k in the usd fundIf I put in another 10k in the sgd fundSo total usd10k and sgd10k will be 6.8%?Any cap?,btohqsg
The question is what you will be doing to the idle fund in the months ahead. If you not planning to do anything  you can consider trust bank account 3% with criteria met. If you planning to buy stocks later  put in MMF. I put in Poems MMF to standby to buy stocks and earn some interest which is quite good,btohqsg
Tried redeem KF from SIA websiteBut to Tokyo ANA only economy but no business classBusiness class only have SIA own self,btohqsg
What are you looking to redeem to Japan? SIA or ANA?,btohqsg
ANA availability from my experience you have to play around with the dates  sometimes it's only available couple months in advance  if search too far in advance may not be able to find as well,btohqsg
But if I were to choose between the business class product to Japan on SIA / ANA  SIA offers a slightly better product (if you can take the long haul 2013 biz class seat) would be more comfy,btohqsg
6.8% is only applicable to the first fund you choose,btohqsg
If large amounts  can consider UOB KF (selected MCCs only),btohqsg

To be clear. Citi prestige unlimited priority pass allows card member + one guest.So if I bring a guest in. That‚Äôs 2 visits for my own tally.,btohqsg
try milelion website. he wrote reviews on those cards... then you can decide if you'll utilize the benefits or not. there's a search bar on his website for ease.,btohqsg
In the case  I have 25 visits in 8 months.,btohqsg
I tried to do that but it is seem to be overseas transfer only which mean they be a fee.,btohqsg
