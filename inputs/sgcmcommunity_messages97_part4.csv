hahaha. well i hate to admit we are trolls cos we were trolled in the first place  but i guess we gave him a taste of his own medicine,btohqsg
I was wondering why no one appreciated the pun. thanks for the support as always brother! - J,btohqsg
i am quite sure 95% of the time if you ask a serious question or legit question over here  most of us will reply you with a proper and informative answer,btohqsg
otherwise we usually are a knowledgeable  enthusiastic bunch of car lovers. just start a porsche talk here,btohqsg
not saying that i know everything but the answers of the guys you are defending is actually retarded,btohqsg
Maybe rant about how the COE and vehicle tax structure sucks?,btohqsg
cmon man  look at this hypocrite,btohqsg
I'll admit I don't know all the details and backstory but it felt really aggressive to me when I see a reply that's just the 2 words kum gong and nothing else,btohqsg
It goes back down to whats the purpose of taxes and coe,btohqsg
I apologise on behalf of whoever said that to you@FireflyHM. Everyone here assumes a new person is pete for some reason - J,btohqsg
What's the purpose of ARF? To artificially inflate the cost of ownership?,btohqsg
General Knowledge  you should know how bad the jams are like in cities like Bangkok and Jakarta. If we do not put in taxes  we will end up like them,btohqsg
That's what COE is supposed to do. Not ARF,btohqsg
so we could throw away the arf  and make coe 200-300k?,btohqsg
isnt arf a type of progressive tax?,btohqsg
wont it be more fair to those who choose to drive vios and attrage and other basic cars?,btohqsg
COE doesn’t stop jams because it only stops purchase not usage. Fuel duty and ERP is what stops jams. COE only increases inflation,btohqsg
Okay so what happens if you take away coe? does ownership increase drastically?,btohqsg
There must still be some form of tax in place to reduce jam right?,btohqsg
So we are assuming people buy cars like attrage for 40k  and leave it at home?,btohqsg
ARF serves no purpose other than to artificially inflate the cost of ownership and for the gov to take money back from the people but I digress.COE is supposed to regulate the total number of vehicles on the road but it's inherently flawed which is causing the current COE sky high record bids. I'm not saying that the COE system is bad. I'm saying that how it's being executed now is bad.As for congestion  ERP and the proposed next gen GPS road tax is on the right track,btohqsg
For the sake of argument  If driving that 40k car costs $50 each time  people will only drive when they really have to,btohqsg
Have a look at this too,btohqsg
then what about those who needs to use the car everyday?also  we are land scarce country  if every household have 1-2 more cars on average  not sure where we are gonna park the cars,btohqsg
i totally agree with you on the last point. The GPS road tax / new gen ERP is much better,btohqsg
so how do you want to change the coe system?,btohqsg
E.g. for COE: The premise was that everyone submitted their own bids according to what they could afford. If you needed a car badly  you can up your bid for a better chance. People who can wait can just bid lower.But the reality of it is that nobody actually bids on their own. Everyone leaves it up to the car dealerships to bid on their behalf. The car dealerships have no impetus to drive down the COE prices. In fact it is beneficial to them to drive it up because you will have to take a bigger loan and their salespeople can earn more commission. I'm willing to bet that most people don't know that you can bid for COE by yourself.,btohqsg
Then you will say  I got no cash to pay for the COE I bid how? Here's a thought exercise. If everyone bid for COE themselves  how much do you think a COE would cost?,btohqsg
Car rental companies have ton of cash as they profit off the cars,btohqsg
dont you think the price will continue to increase again?,btohqsg
If people are willing to pay 100k for coe now  when you leave it to the free market  why would they not be willing to pay 100k too?,btohqsg
LTA is making car rental companies rich at the expense of Singaporeans with the current COE system,btohqsg
this is quite flawed too. in the event people continue to flood the roads with $50 a day  LTA will then raise the $50 to $75 and then to $80. Until there is less congestion  Singapore will always increase the price of ownership.,btohqsg
No  because you decouple the COE from purchase of the car already. Remember that you have up to 6 months to register a car with the COE that you successfully bid. So you could take your own sweet time to bid and after you get your COE then go to dealer to order/book car.,btohqsg
Batteries that have the exact code for them on the battery itself  take out from the remote you know already which one you need,btohqsg
so there will be leftover from the previous 6 months who failed to successfully bid and need to bid immediately right? so there will still be a large demand who needs/want their car immediately. So the demand will still be sustained.,btohqsg
I think luxury brand willing to bid high just to secure their customers because they have budget. My friend initially thought he wouldn't have gotten his after the car show w what the dealers agreed to bid for him upon signing. But they made a 11th minute bump and secure the coe for him.,btohqsg
Yes but the issue is  the man you are defending calls people kum gong for pumping petrol in Singapore...,btohqsg
the problem  singaporeans are too rich,btohqsg
Its cyclical. Last cheaper COEs were 2008 and 2018. I think price will continue to stay high until 2027-28 unless it's perverted by increasing interest rates (which might bring the cycle shorter say2024-2025?),btohqsg
I assume you know how the COE system works?,btohqsg
of course  its very much driven by the rich people sir… self bidding will not help,btohqsg
to the 600 lucky people every month  the can afford to pay 100k now  they can afford to pay 100k next time,btohqsg
there will also be 1000 people who are willing to pay 90k now  willing to pay 90k next time,btohqsg
Except that right now we have no control at all because the dealerships are doing the bidding  not individuals.,btohqsg
Just because there are people who can afford 100k COEs doesn't mean that they want to pay that much,btohqsg
There are rich people who don't bat an eye on coe but I'm sure there're still 80% of us who hawks the coe. But same time median salary YoY is growing. Car is still an aspiration to most and assuming everyone does financial planning  say factor 15%-20% of month salary to car  think 30y COE band will only continue to reach higher highs and higher lows like an ascending channel,btohqsg
i agree with you sir  but whats the solution? as alex has suggested  ownself bidding wont solve anything?,btohqsg
they are required to sir… thats how a bidding work,btohqsg
Self bidding might help (abit) because we bid w their own hard earned  w emotions. Dealers bid to secure you.,btohqsg
