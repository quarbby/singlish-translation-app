so long online and MCC not excluded as per the card's TnC,btohqsg
How does UOB lady work? So each transaction must be $5 to qualify for the 6mpd? Or do they look collectively at the whole bill statement? I.e $99.99 you will only get the 6mpd based on $95 instead of $100,btohqsg
Does DBS Amex still have compliment travel insurance when book flight ticket with it ?,btohqsg
0.4mpd (1x point) based on $5 blocks per transaction3.6mpd (9x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5Ã—9)2mpd (5x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5Ã—5),btohqsg
So essentially if I opt for transport category and assuming I only spend about $3 on SimplyGo daily. It will not be optimal to utilise this,btohqsg
I just tried to register now and it failed too. Have you solved your problem? ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£,btohqsg
For HSBC T1 lounge pass registration.. it failed. Anyone has same problem?,btohqsg
Mastercard simplygo transactions consolidate (5 days or $15 whichever earlier) before posting and 5.6mpd is based on sum in calendar month. So should still get close to 5.6mpd to 6mpd.,btohqsg
does ntuc fairprice transaction in store (paid by apple pay) allow me 10x point in both crmc and revo? if not  how about paying in store thru the Fairprice app?,btohqsg

Random lunch time chat lol  important knowledge,btohqsg
We need Chris to do a video test on this,btohqsg
Actually I got my card last month and realised today that I need to register online myself. Unfortunately  it failed. I called HSBC and they will get back to me with updates later.,btohqsg
Just follow the steps here on DBS or heymaxhttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Baik  I shall report the MCC for Onlyfans when I find it,btohqsg
Hi experts  may I consult you if after Iâ€™ve made a transaction (e.g. $3000 on my DBS WWMC)  if I then decide to pay off this transaction via instalment via DBS over 3 months  will my bonus spending limit also be split across the 3 months?,btohqsg
If I want to buy phone bill (giga or gomo)  can I link to HSBC or DBS WWMC to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Is it a good decision to use the amaze and citi rewards credit card combo while shopping in Malaysia? Will the benefits outweigh the fx spread?,btohqsg
Ok so according to heymax  Onlyfans is classified under 8999 professional services-not elsewhere classified  I don't see any kind of exclusion on dbs tnc  so I think I'm taking my $100 lunch bet,btohqsg
Not sure about HSBC  but dbs specifically exclude bill payments  you can probably try routing thru cardup to earn some miles thou,btohqsg
iâ€™ve asked the group before. looks like crmc will be eligible. tho not any of those cards,btohqsg
According to heymax DBS also has 4mpd,btohqsg
If linked amaze also okay right,btohqsg
yes but need to make sure the right card is linked to Amaze at the point of recurrent payment each month,btohqsg
so m1 and giga bill can pay using crmc without amaze to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
uh u were saying apparently no need link crmc to Amaze  now u asking?,btohqsg
i got confused because of this.. ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
When are you Able to WITHDRAW your CPF?https://youtu.be/sfgD53ODUd0,btohqsg
Okok  no worries! See you guys offline then ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Personal income tax different. They refund almost immediately. At least in my case within the same month.,btohqsg
If it those input credit card and pay via app should be okayCause I do that via StarHub app,btohqsg
Are you able to use your CPF money to buy SG fullerton fund?,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the best credit card to top up to YouTrip card?,btohqsg
If SA giving 4% interest.Why people and property agent advice to use some CASH to pay mortgage loan to lower the accrued interest?Should have just keep topping up SA until max 1st and dun use CASH to pay for mortgage since interest rate for HDB LOAN is 2.6%.,btohqsg
bcos many ppl dunno what is accrued interest.,btohqsg
So by right shouldn't pay housing loan as soon as possible?Should just pay the minimum requirement. Max loan from CPF and then top up excess OA funds to SA.,btohqsg
that's what i ask my wife to do (i would do this too if my SA has not reach FRS). but it really depends on ur situation  since anything u put into SA is not reversible. we are okay to do that bcos our job is stable  and even if anything happens to our job  we have enough savings to tile over the mortgage loan  so we are comfortable to drag out the loan and put our money in SA.,btohqsg
Different people different opportunity cost. If a house owner can use his cash on hands to invest in business  investment or trading that have 10% return per year  he/shall use CPF OA to pay mortgage loan. If a person opportunity cost is lower than 2.6%  then shall not use CPF OA to pay the mortgage.,btohqsg
you can clear use cash to clear OA used and then trf the funds to SA to fill up till FRS. It will work that way too,btohqsg
