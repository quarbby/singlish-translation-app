the only annoying ones are those courses that every grad student has to take,btohqsg
like there's one that by right must take within first 2 years but i never manage to get a slot and idk if it's they never open enough or they give later year students priority first,btohqsg

but surprised they made it a hard rule,btohqsg
Isn't there like a diff between PhD candidate and Student,btohqsg
Idk I heard from someone that it indicates their progress in the Qualifying criteria or smth,btohqsg
you are confirmed as a PhD candidate after passing qualifying exam that is about 1.5 years into the program,btohqsg
that's when i got a pay bump,btohqsg
in NTU there's like 2 phases ba,btohqsg
first 1.5 - 2 years  you do research but you also gotta clear grad mods  TA course etc,btohqsg
after that it's mainly research  publishing  conferences + TAing,btohqsg
