but i dunno their other subjects,btohqsg
I think during the take home mid terms 1 there was such a question,btohqsg
going out of the way to not take math  to take phy  i wont be surprised haha,btohqsg
But during mt2 and finals not at all,btohqsg
some people just want to avoid math,btohqsg
Shes so nice she included a 20% presentation component nobody asked for,btohqsg
but then isnt phy applied math,btohqsg
right but i guess the formula is not as complex as math,btohqsg
i remembered in sec 4  i was having problems rememberinf physics formula  then once exam start  i vomited out the electric formulas on the cover page,btohqsg
the math in jc physics is limited to algebra and simple differentiation,btohqsg
i’ve done that in uni before actually lol,btohqsg
Cuz none of the other admins is active,btohqsg
for math yes  for physics no,btohqsg
and it’s just to understand the significance of gradient of the graph and not really doing any differentiation haha,btohqsg
i only rmb it from like SHM?,btohqsg
Isnt it the one with the like,btohqsg
Eh we talking abt jc physics or o level,btohqsg
O level physics introduce radioactivity :D,btohqsg
Then had to use differentiation and integration LOL,btohqsg
or is it h1 dun hv,btohqsg
cause schs always like to overteach and test out of syllabus stuff,btohqsg
But its probably just an ej thing,btohqsg
For which one  i think sometimes the h1 phy got change syllabus,btohqsg
Idk ej papers always have this one,btohqsg
time to prescribe medication to yourself,btohqsg
ok im so not a pharmacist talking medical cock,btohqsg
Thrs once we had to calculate gradient for a graph,btohqsg
But they never give us gridlines,btohqsg
ya but he dw reply me,btohqsg
Apparanty they expected us to draw our own grid,btohqsg
Precisely because he has a thousand ccas,btohqsg
meanwhile i hv not started studying my econs exam,btohqsg
Yeah this is why I never got an A for ej physics,btohqsg
Har wait i where got dont reply you? :0,btohqsg
what mod is that. some intro to econs mod in nus?,btohqsg
All this random things in my paper that I'm too lazy to di,btohqsg
i was prioritising my pharm mod,btohqsg
Orh i think i miss this one,btohqsg
this is like not extra to help prep students better lmao this is extra for the sake of it,btohqsg
Wrote a report to the department,btohqsg
To point out every single thing in their paper that was not in syllabus,btohqsg
Or that went against cambridge examiner report,btohqsg
i’m like thinking how many physics teachers looked at that sort of question and is like,btohqsg
It was a 16 page document I think,btohqsg
ah yes this is what we should set,btohqsg
They didn't talk to Tay student ever agsin,btohqsg
Everytime he got concern and queries and consult,btohqsg
No they deleted my ejc email,btohqsg
I think the excuse was smth ljke,btohqsg
