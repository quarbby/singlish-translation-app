Shirotabi please forgive me for bringing you back to life! I know now that it could never work between us! It could never be! Not because you’re a rabbit  but because you’re black.,btohqsg
ok so dhs got two teachers called royston han and debbie tan then they are married and they adopted this cat called nappy,btohqsg
But nappy passed away cause of brain tumour or smth,btohqsg
"So i think nappy passed away on the day we had our dhs carnival then my ct had to rush home from sentosa cause she got a call that nappy was not doing good 😭😭 then she said that in the car she talked to nappy and say smth like ""blink if you can hear us"" then he blinked and then she say that even though they were sad they were grateful that they can be with nappy in the last moments",btohqsg

Who is this girl and what did she do,btohqsg
But I feel I'm alone in this,btohqsg
I just talked to her a few days ago,btohqsg
luckily tday 2hrs felt rather fast,btohqsg
or like the ones that support palastine coz its cool,btohqsg
idk how to explain but basically from the posts and info that i read is that she accused alot of stuff which doesnt happen to her and jus said it out coz she hated the guy?,btohqsg
like say she got SA or what and let the rumour spread coz she dun like that guy,btohqsg
bruh my dad brought home some fertiliser and it stinks 💀,btohqsg
I didn't know people still talk abt her tho,btohqsg
Cuz I thought the ntu thing was damn long ago,btohqsg
i have a very different like,btohqsg
like if we are talking abt ruot,btohqsg
the fact that she got voted to be the vice pres of council alr says smth,btohqsg
but i mean its the internet,btohqsg
i can make shit up and stir shit i guess,btohqsg
i wont be surprised if things abt her got twisted tbfjust as how she twists things that people say abt her,btohqsg
ngl i tot was u bruh,btohqsg
U see rite the source here is someone else from EJ council,btohqsg
EJ council will stir shit about anyone no matter what so i would see this as more shit stirring,btohqsg
i jus feel she reading off chatgpt,btohqsg
oh i wont be surprised if she does that,btohqsg
ukw idk what happened to her,btohqsg
more reasons why ej is a bad sch,btohqsg
As in her being liddat or that it happens,btohqsg
ive also been in similar situations like this in EJ,btohqsg
its like q common in EJ to like twist peoples words,btohqsg
the 3 IP schs use that as part of their culture,btohqsg
ten it became a discipline case,btohqsg
so u like that girl that sleep with ppl to get hw ans,btohqsg
q desensitised to things like that,btohqsg
but that one idk coz its from disc,btohqsg
just take a pinch of salt,btohqsg
people just need to focus on themselves,btohqsg
CHS SNGS and SCGS all have this issue,btohqsg
because SCGS is filled with like the rich people,btohqsg
Uk im from EJ but idk a single person from SCGS who doesnt stay in a HDB,btohqsg
my class had 10 scgs girls,btohqsg
and most of them stayed in landed,btohqsg
or they have one landed one condo,btohqsg
idk a single scgs person who stays in hdb,btohqsg
is it not a grass is greener on the other side situation?,btohqsg
tbf i think shes another like victim of the shitstirring thing but wtv idk the facts of the situation,btohqsg
this is why u dont go ejc,btohqsg
u either1. suffer from CHS men2. Suffer from SNGS cancel culture3. Suffer from being looked down on for being broke by SCGS girls,btohqsg
istg sngs cancel culture is fucking insane,btohqsg
SCGS is the 3rd IP sch,btohqsg
i only know nanyang is affliated with the wat chung cheng,btohqsg
i got a pri schoolmate thr,btohqsg
i didnt even know who she was until last yr,btohqsg
think he dsa thr with basketball,btohqsg
cmon what how tf is she nice,btohqsg
theres nth respectable abt my backstory,btohqsg
"unpopular opinion: most people who hate another gender  group or thing etc all the ""___cist"" dont realise any other gender  group or thing is just as capable of doing the very same thing they are hating a particular gender  group or thing for",btohqsg
abt what happened to me LOL,btohqsg
69 students from RJC got 8 distinctions,btohqsg
thats at least 69 other studnets who are on par with me,btohqsg
excluding the 3 9 distinction students,btohqsg
tone dead but ill forgive that,btohqsg
if i were that smart id be too,btohqsg
explain jow u think shes an ok person,btohqsg
i was called back to teach geog and gp,btohqsg
but thats cause ej also had no one,btohqsg
so they were literally scrapping the btm of the barrel,btohqsg
ayia u smart bro noneed humble,btohqsg
imagine someone from ejc sees this,btohqsg
like ive never really had bad interactions with her,btohqsg
then this whole SA thing and her whole cancel culture thingy,btohqsg
u can ask anyone from ejc from my batch,btohqsg
if it wasn't there wouldn't be so many terms being thrown about and created daily for hating a particular group  person or thing.,btohqsg
im jus glad that i went poly,btohqsg
although i cant go jc anyways,btohqsg
people cared about other people too much that they forget to care about themselves,btohqsg
and not cared abt what other people think abt them,btohqsg
or care abt other people in general,btohqsg
we would be in a better place,btohqsg
after the trump election and brexit people realise u can alter people's emotions with social media,btohqsg
and this is where we are now,btohqsg
some ppl can't even start thinking what you've said for themselves first,btohqsg
okay but fr fr what i think abt the whole ruot case,btohqsg
is she needs to go for therpay,btohqsg
Can like tldr or not worth my time,btohqsg
i wan to see her cook,btohqsg
legit curiosity kills the cat or wot,btohqsg
let her be and see how badly she can go,btohqsg
she just accused someone of pedophilia and prevented the guy from speaking back,btohqsg
i thought u were defending her,btohqsg
i think shes an okay person,btohqsg
idt she comes from a bad place,btohqsg
she just needs to go for therapy,btohqsg
well i made friends with a lot of insane sjws  did not know until i followed them for awhile,btohqsg
the recent 5SIR got ppl complain lmao,btohqsg
i think she shud go for therapy,btohqsg
ya but my 2sir ppl didnt complain as much eh 5sir now must be legit fucked fucked,btohqsg
lack of accountability and punishments also play a part,btohqsg
apparently its always the msc asa complaining,btohqsg
cuz right 2sir is mostly jc batch and BY RIGHT jc batch more complainsts cuz we r softer,btohqsg
idk man isit smth to do with them being too soft,btohqsg
huh?????? similan asa do nothing still complain,btohqsg
its xo fried rice with fried king oyster mushroom cutlet liddat ig,btohqsg
either that or just rifle coy ppl get fk,btohqsg
i mean if there was a law simillar to criticizing putin..but instead put on everybody..i dont think ppl gonna be bullying anybody,btohqsg
2 people who ooc from thr,btohqsg
usually jc batch q soft but i heard this from my other bn friends,btohqsg
bully that kid?..alright  off to the gulag you go,btohqsg
always the smart ppl downpes innit,btohqsg
i got a stroke in tekong,btohqsg
my theory is that people from rifle coy or combat unit in general wont complain on reddit coz they have bunkmates to rant with. whereas ppl like ASA only have regulars as their colleagues and cant rant to anyone else. the emotion get more and more negative and so they rant on reddit,btohqsg
tbh we getting more and more soft,btohqsg
i think i went cgh like 5 times,btohqsg
its like flatten the mushroom with some like mushroom paste lol,btohqsg
its my believe if everybody was forced into hard labour for bullying..as a law...the world will be a better place  not only you got scums in society not being part of society but while not being part. they are also contributing to society by helping to pave roads or build buildings,btohqsg
cuz apparantly i also have some ventricular heart issue,btohqsg
ok but from a logical standpoint if she didnt come from a place of malice  she should at least see it balanced and allow for discourse and not shut it down++ look at the way she says things it just screams misandry,btohqsg
fr if u compare our ns with junwei and si yan era its just a joke,btohqsg
im all for gender equality ofc dont get me wrong,btohqsg
No thats why she needs to go for therapy,btohqsg
cuz she literally doesnt know what she did wrong,btohqsg
Wait heat stroke or stroke stroke,btohqsg
which is why idt shes a bad person,btohqsg
but again im against unnecessary suffering,btohqsg
cuz shes not intentionally being a bitch,btohqsg
i mean singapore has something simillar..the cleaning offer,btohqsg
so its a never attribute to malice what can be attributed to idiocy thing?,btohqsg
if u can get things done and do it right  why need to get it done the harsh way,btohqsg
is anyone intentionally being a bitch,btohqsg
those idiots who throw soup at the mona lisa think theyre doing sth honorable,btohqsg
cause they want to stir shit,btohqsg
i had a friend who was like that,btohqsg
they dont think theyre being idiotic,btohqsg
and shes literally 33 years old this year,btohqsg
i mean if u look in the context of stirring shit for fun,btohqsg
that this people esit in the world,btohqsg
then arent we all complicit here,btohqsg
they just want to alert people..they dont care if its good pulbicity or bad publicity,btohqsg
i used to just bully people,btohqsg
like i knew i was bullying someone,btohqsg
but i just felt like it,btohqsg
then when it became a discpline case someone asked me why did i do it i just said idk i felt like it lol,btohqsg
an idiot whos delusional enough to believe shes fighting for whats right,btohqsg
which also means shes all in on the misandry front,btohqsg
which means shes a absolutely horrible person,btohqsg
"they want to let the general public know irregardless of your believe that if one day..shit does hit the fan. they will come back and be able to give the ""i told you so"" to feed their ego",btohqsg
im pretty sure hitler genuinely believed he was right too,btohqsg
so does that excempt him from anything,btohqsg
i think kurt tay also think eat shit is right,btohqsg
Don't gimme a length of projection of kuro's thoughts onto atarax's username,btohqsg
ok but explain to me how this doesnt directly correlate to her being a horrible person  SINCE misogynists are attributed to be horrible people too (her own words too),btohqsg
He was thought how to do vectors,btohqsg
hitler served his military and went to war in ww1..im pretty sure what he thought was right was to give germany a victory because they lost so badly in ww1,btohqsg
Whether he properly learnt it is a different question,btohqsg
qn is why did u voice out your opinions,btohqsg
What is the significance of it,btohqsg
i mean the very concept of misandry (not gender equality) is mostly motte bailey arguments also,btohqsg
HOW AM I GG OFF TANGENT AHHAHAHAHAHAHHA,btohqsg
"that was pretty much what he wanted...literally the playbook of putin...he was a spy when the soviet union fell...now putin wants to build back the soviet union to claim ""victory"" because he knows that is right in his eyes. It was unfair to him the soviet union separated",btohqsg
What does Atarax having a linger name gave di with anything,btohqsg
thats why until today  you realise putin has never recognised the former 15 countries in the soviet union as being independent,btohqsg
And why does kuro voviing out his opinions have to do with anything,btohqsg
Kuro  don't u call me out and just chicken out when I decided to give u the attention u need,btohqsg
I need that attention whore sticker,btohqsg
putin still believes like hitler he can rebuild the very country he served in,btohqsg
Dawg I didn't even realize u asked a qn,btohqsg
Thx for the ted talk rand,btohqsg
i think misandrists are intentionally evil,btohqsg
but when shes doubling down on her fucked up beliefs to the point of delusion,btohqsg
does that not correlate to insanity AND evil,btohqsg
well many people are agreeing with her no?,btohqsg
is okie kuro at this pt    bobian exp,btohqsg
And I APPRECIATE u for it,btohqsg
im glad I adopted a grandpa,btohqsg
no but yeah some ppl tend to push their assumptions on others but idt its exlcusive to ip,btohqsg
just bu yao guan ta men,btohqsg
oh nvm I asked a dumb qn,btohqsg
if u gonna take STEM degree den i guess its important to learn them,btohqsg
"like my prof always say ""MATHS IS FUN!""",btohqsg
Math and music caused me to have stockholm syndrome,btohqsg
that kid at the start has no self stress? that girl in the middle as well,btohqsg

Yeah same but I just gonna do it during summer ft,btohqsg

It's like FYP but for Y2 and Y3s,btohqsg
URECA is optional and completely up to the Prof lmao,btohqsg
Biz students I don't even think need to FYP,btohqsg
URECA is 4AUs over 2 sem la,btohqsg
I can imagine ian fighting for the idf,btohqsg

i needed to give her a hug 🥰,btohqsg
I found it  here's the full video,btohqsg
Why would u do that. No like legit why,btohqsg
no i am just curious only,btohqsg

it feel like she reading a script,btohqsg
Na goes against their terms and conditions of use,btohqsg
wait whats that bitches course in uni,btohqsg

Engaging in or promoting academic dishonestyd. Failing to ensure that automated systems (e.g.  chatbots) disclose to people that they are interacting with AI  unless it's obvious from the context.,btohqsg
I have more impt things to do,btohqsg
Oh I tot it was sociology,btohqsg
What r the courses in sch of social sci,btohqsg
Public policy and global affair ?,btohqsg
I think PPE should also be under them as well,btohqsg
I used to have interest in these courses tbh like polsci and ppga,btohqsg
But now i think im a little little bit interested in...,btohqsg
this is actl a reasonable take ???,btohqsg
i mean sg is somewhat alr practicing it,btohqsg
by community service for petty crimes,btohqsg
just that im not asking people to sweep grass for 3 days,btohqsg
but community service isnt hard labour 💀😭,btohqsg
picking up rubbish isnt hard labour at all,btohqsg
but asking people to spend time at a construction site for a week,btohqsg
true but you dont wanna become the next country that build a gulag tho,btohqsg
Now it looks like a food panda grab knockoff bruh,btohqsg
no its like hdb mall kinda?,btohqsg
Also CWO no longer works anymore lmao,btohqsg
that fish come from antartica ah,btohqsg
yea thats was what im about to say,btohqsg
public humilaition is one of the last punishments in sg that i think would be effective,btohqsg
getting individual dishes is usually btr,btohqsg
like 2 claypot dishes 9.90isb each for 2 ppl is not bad,btohqsg
it seems the only way for people to understand right from wrong in sg is inducing trauma,btohqsg
like if you want a speeder to stop speeding  just bombard them with videos and pictures of the results of crashing your car at 110km/h,btohqsg
Used to be effective when ppl knew each other la,btohqsg
the divine realm vege one is cheaper but still very good quality,btohqsg
Yea i get where you are coming from,btohqsg
But now the only sense of belonging is food,btohqsg
If i see some randoms in orange vest picking rubbish i wont even care,btohqsg
And im sure majority think the same way,btohqsg
i think now is getting trended on social media,btohqsg
So its not rly humiliating anymore,btohqsg
in the past  before singaporeans could get their driving license..they had to go through a road safety course. in that course  they will be shown scenes of metal vs humans.the idea was to incoporate drivers the sense of understanding that the vehicles they drive are not toys,btohqsg
in the past  before singaporeans could get their driving license..they had to go through a road safety course. in that course  they will be shown scenes of metal vs humans.the idea was to incoporate drivers the sense of understanding that the vehicles they drive are not toys,btohqsg
now singaporeans still go through a road safety course/programme..but they are no longer showed all these gruesome pictures or videos because the public in general felt it was too graphic,btohqsg
Especially with covid these days u can wear a mask and basically incognito mode it,btohqsg
my time they made me watch it... yeah im old enough,btohqsg
after i pass my driving course they let me sit down in front of computer and see road incident,btohqsg
nope..they dont show brain matter on the road...anymore  it was removed because of it being deemed too graphic. Its the same reason why nowadays you dont see any road traffic ads,btohqsg
sometimes boomer methods works the best,btohqsg
drunk driving ads..speeding ads all use to be shown constantly..one of the drunk driving crimewatch segments was eye opening as well,btohqsg
its the idea of forcing trauma into someone..that is usually the only way you can change mindsets,btohqsg
the best example i can think of is that poster near restricted areas. just a sign of one man trespassing and another man shooting him. enough said about the consequence of going into those areas,btohqsg
the new one is some man holding gun,btohqsg
"but in words ""forcing trauma"" does not sound right",btohqsg
Now a days if u litter most judges will just fine the shit out of you,btohqsg
bruh i see them right next to my mrt station..and sometimes i see workers in construction trucks just drive in and park to have a smoke 💀,btohqsg
yea thats effective to us i guess,btohqsg
for context this is the old one,btohqsg
i personally feel the old one looks more intimidating,btohqsg
Now they no point gun at ppl,btohqsg
severed limbs  brain matter on the road are how you get the idea that road safety is important,btohqsg
it sounds morally wrong to force people to watch gruesome sights like these..but its effective and stomach turning for a reason,btohqsg
All new ones will be the guy standing,btohqsg
in the US  they put crashed cars near public places to constantly tell people the importance of drivign safely,btohqsg
the point is to show the effects of bad driving...you put guns for what effect?,btohqsg
if not best put a human corspe with a bullet wound..that will get the idea across well,btohqsg
but parents will never allow it,btohqsg
"but usa is ""freedom of speech""",btohqsg
"the prob you dont understand abt the us is the cops are there to ""protect and serve"" not to ""Protect and save""..the difference is  they have no obligation to question a person in public if they are holding a knife",btohqsg
so in that instance..if that person with a knife charges at you..the only thing you can do is have a gun to shoot...because cops are not by your side 24/7,btohqsg
"infact ""Protect and Serve"" is in almost every country and the motto of most cops..but so many people fail to realise...this does not mean they will save you",btohqsg
random but fml every good carou deal is at the opposite of the island for me lmao,btohqsg

That's y I just do mailing when I can💀,btohqsg
ig got the cross island line,btohqsg
wait the cross island line cuts through bukit timah reserve?,btohqsg
I wanna switch my phone theme when i get a new case,btohqsg
uh cross island line will have to wait well into the 2030s,btohqsg
jrl is the next major project lta is undertaking  they are now rushing the dtl extension and circle line loop closing,btohqsg
JRL will be done in 2028,btohqsg
pasir ris gonna 3 have mrt stations,btohqsg
cant even imagine how packed its gonna be on weekdays tho,btohqsg
thn changi airport extension will merge into tel line,btohqsg
i cld have sworn i read an ss background info abt the cross island line lol,btohqsg
idt rly need anything else after cil lol,btohqsg
finally gonna have a mrt station walking distance frm my house,btohqsg
final form of best public transport in the world,btohqsg
and tamp gonna have a 4th mrt station,btohqsg
TAMPINES REPRESENT ( i live in pasir ris ),btohqsg
im gonna want to chop myself off,btohqsg
wait@chemceryou know the traffic jam is so bad  it takes me the same time for me to travel from marymount to tampines east and from tampines east to selarang,btohqsg
isit cuz of the road closure,btohqsg
the moment i reach tamp east after 7am,btohqsg
the bus ride for 10 stops becomes 40mins long,btohqsg
pasir ris central also got road closure now  the jam is like worst then b4  and traffic light at junction  OMG IT TAKES SO LONG TO TURN GREEN,btohqsg
it was alr vv slow b4,btohqsg
thn now the bus got to turn right cuz they diverted the bus stop,btohqsg
but shorter walking distance to mrt,btohqsg
then to gul circle in stage 3,btohqsg
gender essays are easily the worst for me to read,btohqsg
ur not telling me anyting new abt this issu,btohqsg
no cause i feel like this person just adding filler for the sake of it,btohqsg
"its like i read it and im like ""yes and""",btohqsg
i dont think i learnt anyt from it,btohqsg
Q obv somtimes the person is adding filler for the sake of it,btohqsg
gude doesnt know that the young of condors are chicks,btohqsg
Oh gude you sweet summer child.,btohqsg
What are y’all doing  forwarding each other’s messages,btohqsg
oh ya got that new snapdragon x elite soon,btohqsg
might consider it for a laptop after Os maybeeee,btohqsg
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfU948D27-U""babe wake up  a new gameshow has dropped""",btohqsg
our tfr drop below 1  still wanna talk about 12.6 mil lol,btohqsg
even 10 mil also cannot lor,btohqsg
I'll be over 80 by then. More people good  more tax collected  so govt can give me more money,btohqsg
likely  now like low birth rates,btohqsg
govt itself also alr say no plans for 10m,btohqsg
yeah but he not part of govt anymore mah,btohqsg
around 45% of singapore's population right now are foreigners,btohqsg
liu thai ker is the architect that spent the last 40 years being a city planner. his opinion of 10 million has to have come from his foresight of being a city planner.Its not without reason  he has travelled the world and built up a wealth of knowledge on any relevant information related to the human population in order to best aid singapore's own mission in housing the population,btohqsg
but what about the growing aging population tho,btohqsg
liu thai ker is my idol,btohqsg
"""Dr Liu  who on Tuesday reiterated that he was no longer in the Government and was speaking in his personal capacity""",btohqsg
Tbf Dr Liu is saying it is possible is just gov dont wnat,btohqsg
its two completely different people and 2 different perspectives,btohqsg
yeah  somemore dr liu left govt in 1992 sia lol,btohqsg
can such a large population be sustainable with a growing aging population,btohqsg
yes because we can just import more younger people from other countries,btohqsg
3k messages in less than 2 hours is considered nothing atp,btohqsg
yes other countries  birth rates are dropping/ becoming a older aging society but their change is not going to be felt way pass the day we die,btohqsg
actually more old people means need more young people,btohqsg
but makes sg even more competitive tho,btohqsg
but not enuff young ppl coming out,btohqsg
we have to be..if we aren't then..what can we offer to the world?,btohqsg
No but unironically hes probably like,btohqsg
we cant just be a country that constantly seeks donations from other more wealthy countries can we?,btohqsg
q valid enough to have this opinion,btohqsg
eh fair enuff but wldnt more competition for resources further raise the cost of living,btohqsg
like its q hard to doubt his professional expertise and skills in urban planning if he says its possible its like 70% chance possible,btohqsg
he just has no weight in influencing gov opinion,btohqsg
raising the cost of living is a byproduct of societal progression,btohqsg
you dont want to accept that reality...then you are living in delusion,btohqsg
yes it's possible to increase to 10m  but is that what the govt wants?,btohqsg
humans already progressed even more than we give humans credit for...we made self sustaining electricity...appliances that have a shelf life for 100 years 40-50 years ago,btohqsg
its sustainable alright..that goes without saying. its just who is going to be part of that sustainable bubble? the rich or everybody,btohqsg
omg very reliable news source the independent 👍,btohqsg
its the second most reliable news source,btohqsg
bruh the figure 40%- singapore- foreign is literally heavily quoted everywhere,btohqsg
the only other news source that is in competition with the independent,btohqsg
"""Singapore's most reliable satire news source: we uphold the highest standards of journalism""",btohqsg
idk if i should go pick on the difference between 40% and 45% but whatever,btohqsg
actually do yall plan on living the rest of ur life in sh,btohqsg
kuro how does it feel to be in the 40%,btohqsg
i honestly dk what point who's trying to make,btohqsg
my pr fren wants to live in us for sum reason,btohqsg
do you not know how math works?,btohqsg
Sir  economic and workforce restructuring is never painless. But  we have to do what is necessary.We are certainly in better shape today. In the past three years  manpower growth has slowed from an average of 4% to 1%  while productivity gain has grown from 0.4% previously to an average of 1.8% over the past three years.Having transformed from 4+0.4=4.4 in 2012 to 2014  to 1+1.8=2.8 in 2015 to 2017  we are now much closer to our future growth strategy of 1+2=3.Sir  1+2=3 is not a rigid formula for future growth. It is a framework to remind us of the need to become more manpower lean and more productive  if we want out future growth to be more sustainable.,btohqsg
he was from bangladesh then his dad had to either stay in sg or saudi for work n his dad choose sg,btohqsg
i need to figure out a computational implementation of my calculations,btohqsg
i never said we are not in better shape or anything regarding that matter,btohqsg
im an econs student and i approve of this 1+2=3 growth strategy 👍👍👍,btohqsg
I mean... our current foundations in modern day physics is based on mathematical analysis of empirical observational data,btohqsg
most of it flew over my head. i approve👍👍👍,btohqsg
i js realised none of my classmates have my insta except for one mf i blocked back in 2021,btohqsg
Bro this is a direct quote from Lim Swee Say's 2018 COP speech.,btohqsg
yea but i still have the acc,btohqsg
which is inactive since mar 2023,btohqsg
fyi  prs dont make up 6 million,btohqsg
so yea even with prs..its still not 40%,btohqsg
anyways all these politics is not my ally...i just wanted to share whatever info i have,btohqsg
wtf at first i thought this is some copypasta from some parliamentary debate or smth 😂,btohqsg
Just saying technically is a mix of maths too to ensure the validity of experimental data,btohqsg
"ah no shit..you think im going to migrate to a country that lies in my face that i have ""free healthcare""..then proceed to take that money or even more i would have spent on healthcare by way of taxes?",btohqsg
It is lmao just search up quick maths by Lim Swee Say,btohqsg
i was replying to another person caused they ask about what birth rates and its implications..and basically im telling them that..birth rates dont matter to singapore for the most part,btohqsg
i learn smth new today 😂,btohqsg
all the incentives for birthrates in sg is just small money talkto show ppl the govt is not fully ignoring the prob,btohqsg
Today  the Singapore workforce of 3.4 million is made up of 2.3 million locals (2/3 of total workforce) and 1.1 million foreigners (1/3 of total workforce). 2/3 local + 1/3 foreign = 1 Singapore Workforce.With slower manpower growth into the future we need to maximise the potential of our 2/3 local  1/3 foreign so that together  we can maximise the potential of our Total Singapore Workforce. We must strive for 2/3 + 1/3 not just = 1  but > 1.,btohqsg
cause some ppl still believe the govt actually cares that the birth rate could be a issue,btohqsg
yea and they gonna start increasing the retirement age?,btohqsg
U do know that the retirement age raise is beneficial to us rite?,btohqsg
is it? i rmb france riotted over increase in retirement age,btohqsg
Idk for France lmao but for us the raise is done and mainly beneficial to those with CPF,btohqsg
It allows for more interest gained from social security contributions into CPF.,btohqsg
Yea any policy that gives the people more option to earn money before they kick the bucket is bound to be good for the people. But It just looks good on he surface,btohqsg
doesnt it mean ppl have to work longer to retire tho?,btohqsg
Not if their CPF has the money. The raise means those who are broke can continue to work at higher contribution rates,btohqsg
I don't know much about policy making but increasing the retirement age indeed increases the amt people could earn but also give companies one more reason to stagnate their employees,btohqsg
For France it's literally a pension system which we don't do.,btohqsg
Ours is a mix of the freedom of a Roth IRA combined with the rigidity and guarantees of a Pension system.,btohqsg
Why would any same company want to increasing the pay of a older person in a company? Cognitively they are less capable,btohqsg
And also means they get higher matches for cpf contributions,btohqsg
They have that option but will they leave if they get mistreated? Especially cause they are old. That is my thought process,btohqsg
Oh boi this is about to get interesting,btohqsg
Aint the whole point of a age retirement increase is to give people the option to live longer with better conditions..unless I'm missing the point of a age retirement increase,btohqsg
Hello. I forgot who u are specifically but i rmb u somehow,btohqsg
