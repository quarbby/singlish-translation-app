Singapore Medical ($0.30/$0.305)- Price fell after deal call off but IMO  strong fundamentals this one and the dust have settled- also  CHA  a Korean healthcare co. became controlling shareholder in 2019 through purchase of vendor shares at $0.605- current valuation seems very reasonable.High chance it will break out downtrend line this or the next week. This counter if can HODL will be easier to play as I can tell some one is controlling the chips well. Powerful players who can flush out most or all contra retailers.This one longer term definitely a winner too.Let’s see.DYODD,btohqsg
Yesterday  the market finally showed signs of game  early games.This time round  I hope it is not a one day event. It certainly does not feel like one.Hoping for a good market in Feb22 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
Koh Eco yesterday $0.049 seems to have some hidden buyers.Yesterday some retailers still not in the buying frenzy as the bull took some aback.Last evening  those not ready have had the time to digest and today I expect continuation play for a first time in a long time.Seems like the right time to take some risk.Watch KOH ECO ($0.049/$0.050) closely  I think should have a little run.,btohqsg

✈️Pika World Update: 8 Feb 2022✈️The equity market had a mixed start for the week  as it reversed most of the early gains. Market participants were looking at the earnings season ahead  ending soon. Nasdaq finished off 0.6% lower.🧸Markets still reeling on tech weakness📉It does not help that investors were still concerned with mega tech counters  especially Meta Platforms  which offered a disappointing earnings report coupled with a poor outlook. This adds to the bleak outlook for tech stocks this year as bond yields rose as the Fed looks to hike interest rates and reduce its balance sheet.Nasdaq is roughly down by 13% from its all-time high seen in late Nov 2021.🗽There is some hope⛳While market sentiments have been soured  the sell-off has started to moderate in Feb. So although we see the S&P 500 is down 6% from its high in early January  it is slowly creeping back  giving the index some support.At the end of January  we saw the index bottom at around 4275  which is still higher than the previous days bottom of 4222. This hints that buyers are somewhat ready to buy at a higher level. The higher low is critical as a potentially bullish pattern.⏳Earnings season is coming to an end soon⏱While it is hoped that earning season could give the market support  it appears that the sell-off is here to stay. About 3 quarters of the S&P 500 companies had reported their earnings which beat estimates by 8%. However  investors are still concerned with the high valuations and demand an even more significant earnings beat to compensate for the risk premium in the market before buying more shares.It is 8 Feb  Tuesday  8.25 am in Singapore and 8.25 pm in New York.Pika World wishes everyone a good fresh start for the week!P.S. Pika Nat is still suffering from Covid  so may not provide daily updates unless is consciously well. Cheers  and stay healthy  friends.,btohqsg
