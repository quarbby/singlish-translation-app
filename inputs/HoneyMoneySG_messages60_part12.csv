Do take note that topping up via amaze results in a 2% fee by amaze. The alternative is to go Lazada Malaysia and buy a topup pin. The credit from a topup pin is non transferable. If using to pay business  probably no issue but if paying small time business that uses their personal TNG  it might be a problem,btohqsg
