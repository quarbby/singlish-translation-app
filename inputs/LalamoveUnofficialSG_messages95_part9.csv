Hi guys how long does it take to cash out? Its been one week now.. new here,btohqsg
Cash out anytime before Sunday 2359hrs & u will get the money on the next Wednesday itself.,btohqsg
The AD series have fixed boxes behind  which may not be big enough  and are non-detachable  so spilling something can be a big headache. FC-wise  it's a 2B/2A CVT  so should be in the ballpark  20-30 km/L.,btohqsg
You can consider the AR series (postman type)  two wheels behind  but can mount custom box.,btohqsg
ðŸ¤”....and more stable too I would guess,btohqsg
motor and car fares not much difference  but batch 4-6 the fare is super low  think its 4 dollar something per order now,btohqsg
from what i seen over the past 2 years  fares will only keep decreasing,btohqsg
thats why alot of ppl only do during their surge hours,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the pricing given compared to llm? Better?,btohqsg
Hourly rate is about the same  llm has higher per trip pay but longer distances.,btohqsg
Actually I have check a lot of deliveries app  end up I always use llm and ryde,btohqsg
Haha that's why LLM can afford so many stunts on us,btohqsg
