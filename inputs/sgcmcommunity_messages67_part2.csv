Must have p plate for first year,btohqsg
You donâ€™t have a choice to be a p-plater or not thoðŸ¤£-R,btohqsg
Everything is legal if you don't get caught,btohqsg
if they say too heavy need weight reduction also can,btohqsg
Eh  this one I send before,btohqsg
10.7L engine... NO REPLACEMENT FOR DISPLACMENT,btohqsg
Paiseiâ€¦ mixed up p plate and off peak plate,btohqsg
I display my p plate got 12 years already,btohqsg
Every year I buy a new p plate,btohqsg
ROAD HOGGER MENTALITY IS THE BEST,btohqsg
You buy the 888 one or 3M?,btohqsg
I notice 3 m 1 last 3 years easily,btohqsg
Can switch cars also no problem,btohqsg
i will be careful not matter what,btohqsg
but in my defense  that car was really totally pitch black. it was matt black colour,btohqsg
so i thought or assume no one was at the back,btohqsg
and i din see any headlights..that's the strangest thing,btohqsg
I hope you have a dashcam already,btohqsg
i can only guess he was driving fast and suddenly approached the roundabout,btohqsg
last few days was busy with work also,btohqsg
I would suggest iRoad as a good budget option,btohqsg
But the quality is still good,btohqsg
Haven't heard any reviews from anyone using it,btohqsg
Most people I know use blackvue  iRoad or thinkware,btohqsg
i wanna get a front and rear,btohqsg
Super budget then they go for 70mai,btohqsg
But I don't trust the app as much,btohqsg
But even if you buy at comex  install not included,btohqsg
Better buy from a dealer themselves and get the install,btohqsg
Make sure to get one with parking mode and a battery reserve,btohqsg
Can be useful to check for incidents when the car is parked,btohqsg
Blackvue and thinkware tend to be on the more expensive side,btohqsg
Based on which one you get,btohqsg
They have their own experience store at Vertex@Ubi if you would like to go check them out,btohqsg
And they'll direct you to their authorized workshops for an install,btohqsg
70mai does the job well enough for its money lolz,btohqsg
But prefer the Mercedes key for this era,btohqsg
Merc still need to plug in?,btohqsg
Just looks a bit nicer and it maintained the classic turn to start mechanism behind the start button,btohqsg
Even this design key had the start stop button,btohqsg
But there was a way to plug in behind the button,btohqsg
Now don't have the plugging in,btohqsg
In case battery dead or key cannot be recognized,btohqsg
So there's no hidden physical key,btohqsg
The USB thing is the key,btohqsg
Kind of like Porsches older key,btohqsg
There is one for the locks,btohqsg
"You mean battery dead still can use the ""USB"" to start car",btohqsg
As long as it turns that is,btohqsg
If battery really dead and the car can't start,btohqsg
