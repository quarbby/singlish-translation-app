Yesterday order Genki Sushi at waterway point..I called vendor said ready for collection as I accepted the order..when I arrived not even 5 mins they said someone already took the order..apps still running not indication of cancel order..Since I already called and arrived agent said the compensation will be indicated by end of the day which never happen..Today I just chatted with another agent he gave me I don't know whose order number not even in my history list.. now he say customer cancelled the order and need to check if can compensate or not,btohqsg
Live chat not in SG...fyi üòÖ,btohqsg
No CS attending to live chat two attempt to contact both waited 20-30min no one responds,btohqsg
Peak hour...drop them an email atinfo.sg@lalamove.comto state your issues you are facing. Replying the email won't be that fast too. At least you provide the details for them and move on from here.,btohqsg
Anyone knows what will happen if we cancel too much order ? Will we get ban?,btohqsg
Oh . Mine I think was with valid reasons. My wife got covid but I nvr get. But still I cancel all my pre order for 3 days Incase .,btohqsg
Than the bar on our profile page straight drop alot,btohqsg
Subjective on this topic. But safe then sorry. üëç,btohqsg
It takes a long time to recover back the bar üòÖ,btohqsg

You cancelled more than 6 jobs?,btohqsg
Yup. Cause self monitor in case of covid. That was last week. All talk to CS.  After that they got send me sms ask me give evidence. I jus update my chat with CS,btohqsg
No update from them since then. No mention of suspension or ban. Jus that the bar keep dropüòÇ,btohqsg
Try to call the merchant and ask them to reassign. No penalty.  If cannot then go to CS to cancel with a valid reason,btohqsg
Okay noted. But I think once the bar finishes than maybe get suspension,btohqsg
Not sure. But can try.. üòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
Hey guys  if I cash out on Sunday  I will receive my money on wed  which is tomorrow right?,btohqsg

So quick to charge me for compensation but so slow when it comes to dealing with double bookings,btohqsg
They‚Äôre a joke  all of em,btohqsg
Still no money come in eh,btohqsg
Wait till u enter their office. Its even more of a joke.,btohqsg

Good luck to those picking up from 126 race course road tomorrow,btohqsg
Had bad experience the last PH I took from there. And they rejected waiting time fee from LLM. Waited more than half hour and only get compensation from LLM.,btohqsg
Looks like a competitor of lalamove. However by giving phone number of clients' number is very dangerous though.... As lalamove may sue us for disclosure of clients' number if we are found out to earn incentives by bleaching the privacy of clients. Hmmm. I dont think this is legal.,btohqsg
Randall ng should approach lalamove instead. Not over here. To save your own ass.,btohqsg
Hey Serene  will clear some of your doubts here  our research project is not a competitor with Lalamove üòäOur submissions will require a restaurant‚Äôs business name and a phone number  both of which can be commonly found on Google  so we have ensured that there is no breaching of privacy and data.As mentioned  this is a research project to identify trends with Lalamove deliveries and we are thankful for the initial responses we received so far! ü•≥ü•≥Special mention to one rider that raked in $60 over the weekend btw! ü§©We still have a couple of slots left before we close our registration  please join our project if you are looking to earn additional incentives on every ride you make  feel free to send in your questions to -98060534Hope this helps Serene  and thank you everyone!,btohqsg
