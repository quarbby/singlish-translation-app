All dealers let you sit in the cars apart from exotic ones like Ferrari  Lambo or used car ones,btohqsg
Also part of the Porsche CI and global sales directives to let everyone experience the cars,btohqsg
Not saying they're not but the cars aren't as hard to come by as Italian or brit alternatives that tend to be more expensive and exotically specced,btohqsg
One of the reasons they still have paper brochures in all dealerships for kids and everyone to take home,btohqsg
