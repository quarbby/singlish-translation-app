Lolx...good for residential areas late at nite😂,btohqsg
I think got a few brands doing that,btohqsg
The silly part. This should be an allowable mod for exhaust but no LTA say “Bad”. I’ll more than happy to valve close in noise sensitive areas.,btohqsg
Lolx....well..to LTA...all modded cars are wrong...esp aftermarket parts😂😂😂,btohqsg
That why less n less modding choices nowadays,btohqsg

Ford Focus MK3 ST OEM Rims,btohqsg
5x120 difficult to get  my car also uses this bolt pattern  can't really find any decent rims unless i upgrade to 19 inch and above  atm im mostly limited to SSW rims  :-(,btohqsg
anyone know any good & affordable car rental company? or got any lobang for it?,btohqsg
Maybe just stick with it ba,btohqsg
GetGo seems decent? You can try out their mobile app to see roughly how much it cost,btohqsg
getgo is rent by hr. if rent full day not worth also cos they charge per km,btohqsg
I think it is decent for a daily driver  1.0 but compensated by a turbo charged engine  so pick up is still not that bad,btohqsg
I went test drive today. The steering wheel shake a lot lol,btohqsg
Shake a lot....used car from agent or showroom test drive,btohqsg
If it is used and steering shake  most commonly cuz of bad tyre alignment or/and balancing  could also be a suspension issue,btohqsg
Argent car. I start the engine already shake. Must be aircon or only 3 cylinder,btohqsg
I only love the outlook haha,btohqsg
Bro i recommend test driving it with another agent. Not a good sign if your steering shakes a lot,btohqsg
I also think is 3 cylinder,btohqsg
Since my friend getting another car,btohqsg
wcega is at bukit batok that area right?,btohqsg
any idea what’s the company name? maybe i can go online & check it out,btohqsg
