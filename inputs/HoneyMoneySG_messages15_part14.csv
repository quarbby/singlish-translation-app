How to use krispay miles? The only way to use it is to make another purchase using krispay and offset using my krispay balance?,btohqsg

Hi anyone holding dbs altitude amex. I am trying to add card to apple pay but stated not supported. Anyone face similar situation?,btohqsg
i think only AMEX cards by AMEX themselves can be added to Apple Pay. AMEX Cards issued by other banks cannot be added to Apple Pay unless explicitly stated,btohqsg
Put is simply non amex issued card is not real,btohqsg
Using credit card to spend overseas is it better for1.Citi rewards + instarem2. Citi premiermiles?,btohqsg
So depend if it is sufficient for your usage,btohqsg
Based on the reward then is citireward better,btohqsg
posb everyday card got minimun spend or no need also can,btohqsg
Thanks  should get the visa instead 😏,btohqsg
Get from amex if u want Amex or Else other lor,btohqsg
I used Instarem w CRMCI find the use case quite okay for me and Instarem so far no issue for me,btohqsg
Hi. If going on board cruise  which is a more value for money option for payment?1)using revolut card to pay for on board services or2) instarem + Citicashback MC to pay?,btohqsg
Currency used will be in USD,btohqsg
Cruise will be under the “All other retail spend” category?0.25%,btohqsg
Do u refer to uob>amex>revolut (1.7 percent)Ibstarem>citi cash cash back plus card (1.6 percent)If it is the above revolut foreign exchange rate is better then instarem,btohqsg
A quick question  not sure if I phrased it correctlyWhat would be a better daily choice?GPMC + AMEXINSTAREM + CRMCConsidering that I lean more towards Cashbacks,btohqsg
Instarem + CRMC is for mile chaser,btohqsg
Okay 👍🏼 but the points changing to rebate is not worth it for CRMC?,btohqsg
Usually it is not worth it  but u need to do your own calculation to be sure,btohqsg
I keep miles for flight. I am a cashback user  only go for miles when my good cashback card quota finish for the month,btohqsg
Sounds legit and reasonable seems like a possible use case,btohqsg
Miles is also only wonderful for biz class  not for economy in most case,btohqsg
I'm only holding  revolut  instarem & Citicashback MC (not the cashback plus MC). Don't hv the other cards,btohqsg
Any ideas when do revolut provide the Cashback for the 20% cashback? I am a new revolut user who signed up last month,btohqsg
Then u might want to consider going the uob amex>grab>revolut by applying uob amex and grab?,btohqsg
It is more worth it for cruise  however if u find it hassle just so the revolut route as instarem rate not as good as revolut and citi cashback dont give bonus cashback on cruise,btohqsg
Citi caskback based rate is 0.25 percent only,btohqsg
Start of the next month  you must deposit $300 to your account to be eligible for the transport cashback,btohqsg
Not sure why more worth it for cruise.,btohqsg
If u happen to go cruise then after that go us trip  you can charge 500 on room card at casino per pax from the room o think,btohqsg
I see. It's for spending on board cruise ship. What about paying cruise tickets?,btohqsg
Depend u buy from which platform,btohqsg
But not sure if more worth it or not,btohqsg
Have to do your own research,btohqsg
Nestia pay rebate 50 cents over awarded at hawker centre ? What about Coffeeshop ?,btohqsg
Does it matter to buy with amaze card + cbrc or just cbrc . Local spending for example Nike shop . Is it equally 4x mod same?,btohqsg
Any stall with QR code that accepts UnionPay,btohqsg
So can I use AMEX QR Pay for those merchant with paynow QR? I realised not all merchants' QR board include AMEX logo.,btohqsg
Only qR which show amex logo,btohqsg
