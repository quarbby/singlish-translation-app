Do jobs after 2am  this kinda monkeys sure come out to play. That‚Äôs why I try best not to do after 2-3am  because of this.,btohqsg
Then tell them put a note that it is a scam job etc  so don't penalise you. That's wat I do if n when I call in to request for cancellation. If the vendor no answer ur call few times  let the cs know also. Say vendor no reply call. Can't do anything. Pls put a remark on the cancellation saying its not driver fault. Don't penalise,btohqsg
