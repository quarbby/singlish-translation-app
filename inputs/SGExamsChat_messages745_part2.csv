Imagine being in a school where there is rules on what kind of school attire you can wear at certain timings,btohqsg

If you are in aircorn 80% of the time like rp  you can imagine why nobody wears a essential walk in the park fit to school,btohqsg

There was one school that had a controversial rule but they removed it after a while. They told students they can't wear hairties,btohqsg
