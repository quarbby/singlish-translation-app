Is liquid pay consider online payment??,btohqsg
So if use dbs wwmc also can get 4 miles p dollar?,btohqsg
Any fees for transferring HKD from Scb to Moomoo,btohqsg
Seems like it's hit and miss based on other users experiences  have to retry until it goes through.. But paiseh to make the hawker wait for you especially if there's a long queue behind üòÖ,btohqsg
liquid pay only work with mastercard credit card?,btohqsg
has anybody tried it with dbs live fresh? i think dbs live fresh excludes so many transaction. considering cancel this card and apply for citi rewards or cash back card,btohqsg
https://sethisfy.com/wallet-apps-for-hawkers-and-dining/amp/I recall LiquidPay take the MCC of the store you purchased from  under fast food MCC code as previously mentioned by Chris.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if spending at hotels is excluded for the UOB Visa Signature card from earning bonus UNI$?,btohqsg
Any Geneco user can recommend what credit card u use for cashback?,btohqsg
I'm currently looking at Maybank Platinum. Would love to know if there are any better cards for Geneco & dining cashback.,btohqsg
Just wanna be sure  TELCO bills like M1 SingTel Gomo are not excluded from CRMC 4mpd?I read the T&C  gas and electricity are excluded though.,btohqsg
like to know as well from GOMO,btohqsg
GOMO recurring is included for maybank family and friends (data category). Not sure about CRMC though,btohqsg
GOMO recurring should be considered online spend and can be counted for DBS WWMC 4mpd,btohqsg
Can use posb everyday card for Geneco 5% Cashback no min spend. But not recommended for dining cos dining need min $800 monthly spend for only 3% cashback.,btohqsg
Anyone know about this : I just sign up for Citi rewards card  the valid date for the card 12/25 which is until December 2025 only.. means my points will only last for 3 years instead of 5 years?? Thanks in advance..,btohqsg
SSB result is out. May the allocation be with you.,btohqsg
I guess as good as everyone who applied get it,btohqsg
They will renew your card when expire,btohqsg
I wonder who is that poor dude who bid for 200k,btohqsg
I doubt anyone bid 200k. Haha,btohqsg
Has there been any signup rewards for singsaver/money smart for HSBC revo before? If cash  may I know how much? Thanks a lot,btohqsg
i am wondering this as well  want to apply for this card  but i feel like loss if there is no sign-up gift,btohqsg
Think it was $200 cash with min $500 spend when I applied. That or some luggage,btohqsg
hi  guys. is it hard to waive the annual fee for amex true cashback credit card? i mean if amex has a min spend to waive annual fee.,btohqsg
YMMV  last year I spent nothing and got it waived  this year I spent nothing and they didn't want to waive. There's probably a min spend that's an unwritten rule,btohqsg
Just use at lunch time for sg qr without issue,btohqsg
thanks  but i will skip that as the t&c till jan5% cash rebates on utilities refers to 3% cash rebates and additional 2% cash rebates for a promotional period from 1 Sep 2022 to 31 Jan 2023,btohqsg
That's true  good catch  I didn't realise it was a limited time promo,btohqsg
Must be mobile contactless? If paywave with physical card is it counted?,btohqsg
Hi  just need to make sure the RHB account has 1 cent balance to receive the interest right?,btohqsg
can check points expiry on citi banking - rewards,btohqsg
How to use absolute for insurance? I try so many times didn't works. Only need to top up grab pay then can pay my insurance.,btohqsg
Dear all  does using of Amaze tag CRMC for purchase of application and subscription via apple App Store  earn you 10x points?,btohqsg
You should have gotten your result by now  seeing that the transaction was done on the 10th of Dec,btohqsg
So which date should I refer to on Citi Rewards Points Summary page?,btohqsg
I understand there is a transaction date and posted date.,btohqsg
not sure on this. Usually I will take note of the before and after for the points reflection at the top of the app.,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I will just wait for Citi bank officer to revert and confirm.,btohqsg
A quick check leads me to just clicking the drop down under your name and clicking on points summary.,btohqsg
The page will not tell you which line is what transaction. You will have to decipher it yourself.,btohqsg
