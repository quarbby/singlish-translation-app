"Dr Lily Neo: Sir  I want to check with the Minister again when he said on the strict criteria on the entitlement for PA recipients. May I ask him what is his definition of ""subsistence living""? Am I correct to say that  out of $260 per month for PA recipients  $100 goes to rental  power supply and S&C and leaving them with only $5 a day to live on? Am I correct to say that any basic meal in any hawker centre is already $2.50 to $3.00 per meal? Therefore is it too much to ask for just three meals a dayas an entitlement for the PA recipients?Dr Vivian Balakrishnan: How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre  food court or restaurant?https://whosaycannot.blogspot.com/2011/05/dr-lily-neo-vs-dr-vivian-balakrishnan.html",btohqsg

Actually I think Pritam makes mistakes this timeAdmit and move onFocus more important things,btohqsg
PAP digging deep into his open wound...,btohqsg
PAP probably will not remove him  but take this chance to tarnish his image... until just for show...,btohqsg
If I were him I will admit my mistakes that I didnâ€™t handle well and move on.The more he urges the more ugly will surface,btohqsg
you think PAP is always right?,btohqsg
The thing is... no matter what P does  PAP will dig and dig...,btohqsg
It doesnâ€™t matter quickly admit mistakes and stop hereAnd move on,btohqsg
the game is rigged... only 1 sided digging allowed,btohqsg
Donâ€™t waste taxpayers money to investigate,btohqsg
"All these ""special report releases"" are exactly how PAP is going to drag this matter... nothing WP can do now... Just have to kenna until the whipper stops",btohqsg
even kick at the earliest time... also will kenna...,btohqsg
If I were Pritam I will admit I didnâ€™t act correctly and I will look into future .Frankly the more Pritam argues but it didnâ€™t help,btohqsg
admit also kenna whack  silent also kenna whack  talk also kenna whack... all because someone lied,btohqsg
i think his 2 chances used up liao...,btohqsg
much depends on his health condition by 2024,btohqsg
not this time... his power used up liao...,btohqsg
Yalor Pritam should admit that he didnâ€™t handle well and learn from mistakes,btohqsg
the point is... media doesn't allow him to walk away...,btohqsg
then he will be whacked for being a 'weak leader' bla bla bla... still whack,btohqsg
I watch the video Pritam didnâ€™t act well and struggling,btohqsg
if he appears confident... also whacking,btohqsg
basically he is now a shooting duck...,btohqsg
This is just a theatre at this point,btohqsg
"like.. your subordinate did something wrong  and yourboss""friendly competitor"" called you into the room  together with the bosses(public)  for whacking... explain can resolve?",btohqsg
This is not a political chat,btohqsg
