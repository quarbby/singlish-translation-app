"Yeah  another reason why I'm still on ""tbc""",btohqsg
10 mins is actually enough. üòÖ,btohqsg
hahaha  but when driving there 10mins feels v short,btohqsg
if u think abt it  10 min and 1 lap is sub 1 min. shd be fun enough,btohqsg
for me 10mins not enough de  i go kranji one at least 2-4 sessions,btohqsg
I guess I'll just go for 10 mins one then if I had free time I enjoy myself karting etc. I wanna go for the drifting one but it was close down,btohqsg
Trust me u few laps u will shag alr. Unless u stamina high like@meekiaganHAHA,btohqsg
It's just a fun bonding sess.,btohqsg

in 30 to 40 min stints,btohqsg
16 turns at Expo  eh. What's the fastest lap time there?,btohqsg
Cfm roi can do 24hr Le Mans,btohqsg
I need try my standard see how first. Then ik whr I stand.,btohqsg
too bad the sg rules too strict  else i‚Äôm sure those w/o license can get to play 30 n above de,btohqsg
okay so per race is 10 car isit,btohqsg
shd be ba  unless they got extra kart can fit in i guess,btohqsg
Probably the one who set 52s lap time have a good entry and exit at the corners.,btohqsg
Pretty sure they also have good racing lines,btohqsg
but their karts is also by manual adjustment one  so some karts is faster some slower,btohqsg
just go in and enjoy and have fun can le,btohqsg
dont think of fatest lap or what and endanger yourself and other driverthe course can be quite narrow,btohqsg
that time i went to kranji one  no license can play 30 only  i see the group of ppl they exit pit they block the exit cus they waiting for their friends behind ü•≤,btohqsg
Yeah. I got no intention to set a fastest lap. Some more it's my first time to try karting and gain an experience.,btohqsg
