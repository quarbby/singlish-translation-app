I am a y1 in RP at Information technology. I stay at tampines and my travel time is 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 min. Personally I would advise u to do the IT diploma as in the future u will be able to enter different fields like business with this diploma. Personally the stress levels are not too high for me but I hope u can follow ur heart and make a nice choice!,btohqsg
because of people saying its ITE,btohqsg
It was started as one  it has always been and it will always continue to be,btohqsg

Rp has the cream of the crop lecturers in terms of knowledge and skillsThat is how they build their reputation for 2 decades,btohqsg
They have the cream of the crop lecturers but very few can actually teach,btohqsg

rp to go common sci is it difficult? like i saw sch web say l1r4 12-19(if i‚Äôm not wrong) so if i get 19 l1r4 does it mean can enter or no,btohqsg
cannot guarantee bc depends on your batch,btohqsg
the cut off points that u see are from previous batch,btohqsg
depends on how many ppl jae to the course,btohqsg
wait so if i go sp FM then first year i dropout to RP IT thats a thing?,btohqsg
can try but other choices put those that you meet,btohqsg
sp has a criteria to promote to y2  you dont fullfill  if im not wrong. you will be kicked out alr,btohqsg
no im not talking about retake the year,btohqsg
referring to changing schools as a whole,btohqsg
sorry for asking so much but how to apply if i change i mind in sp?,btohqsg
depends on the sch. for np  u don‚Äôt pass the mod  u retake next sem. if u dont pass 2 mod or more  stay back one sem,btohqsg
also if i change school doesnt that mean im joining in the middle of the year so thats the first time i heard about this and it sounds really shocking,btohqsg
u need to seek a ecg session w a counsellor then they advise u on what to do,btohqsg
when you rejoin another school  you basically join the incoming school year,btohqsg

HI for the past DAE students is there a high chance of getting in a course of 18 points if i have 20 points but i state my super strong passion and beg for it through DAE?,btohqsg
