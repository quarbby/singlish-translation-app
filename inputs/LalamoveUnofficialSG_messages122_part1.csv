US Authorities Shut Down Two Banks In One Week  Combined Assets Amounted To S$428 Billion🏦🏦🚫The closures of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank mark the second and third largest bank failures in US history.👉https://tsl.to/usbanksshutdown@mustsharenews,btohqsg
Maybe a template he forgot to change,btohqsg
Anyway that day I went to Sentosa and there was a $10 charge at the entrance I don’t get it… but luckily the client was nice and paid for it.,btohqsg
Also I got a few times swiped and the app said “don’t give up try again” or “order is no longer available” but then I actually got the job…. Yest I got one  which I thought I didn’t get the job and was heading home until the client called me. The job was at Mandai and I already reached Eunos when I received his call 😭,btohqsg
Show them yr app u got delivery inside,btohqsg
I drive a van but I refuse to do such orders that are obviously not mpv/car load,btohqsg
Most clients are ok to change one,btohqsg
U expect customer to pay you the fee and move for you meh. If you not willingly to do den don't do lor. Move on,btohqsg
That’s what I did right? I didn’t do it and am just sharing with the group.Car and MPV base price does not include door to door service  van does. Hence they’re so cheap.Most of the time I will do it for them but if it’s not so bulky and inconvenient  and I believe most of us do. But there’s a limit to what we can tolerate. For me  9 big boxes is too much.,btohqsg
And also if we try talking to clients  most of them are willing to change the order. Doesn’t that benefit the drivers here?Ok moving on Hengg….,btohqsg
I think show app can already   last time i have any job there also just show invoice can go in free,btohqsg
Thank you for the tips now I know :),btohqsg
MPV weight limit is 50kg. 1 item cannot be more than 25kg. So if 9 box not more than 50kg and not over the size limit. Not wrong for customer to book as MPV.,btohqsg
It’s not the size. It’s the door to door service part.,btohqsg
Which we are not paid for in MPV Order,btohqsg
So we have the right to tell them to top up if they wish for us to do so  I’ve checked with LLM before and we can do that.,btohqsg
Plus this order are big boxes… clearly more than 50kg,btohqsg
My point here is that we can voice out and reasonable clients will oblige,btohqsg
How much can u earn as a walker?,btohqsg
And can I switch from driver to walker?,btohqsg
Wait..so only van is door to door ah. Car  walker not door to door service ah. Car order i take from where and put at where?,btohqsg
How do you determine if the all the box is more than 50kg. By the look or you actually weight it. Big box doesn't mean heavy.,btohqsg
I drive 2.4 oso kena frm them few times. Order 1.7 n items cnfrm cannot fit 1.7. So i told them nicely n xplain to them. Majority willing to top up n only encounter 2 YAYAPAPAYA cust say cancel laaa....Try to talk nicely proffesionaly....i guess most cust will listen. Bt if no choice its up to u to take de job or nt.....,btohqsg
If u read the rates on the website car and MPV does not include door to door  llm told me that too. Like i said and I understand why most of us just do it  but we all have our limit to how much people take advantage of us when they already pay so little.,btohqsg
This is for van. car and MPV don’t have that,btohqsg
Yeah agree. Most clients are ok and will change. Good to share :),btohqsg
The main point is because customer don't want to help you with the boxes . Not with the base fare .You are driving a van   since you know MPV doesn't have base fare why would you accept MPV job?If today the item is only 2 boxes and is mpv you won't be cancelling the job.,btohqsg
We all have our own limits. And whatever you have or someone else have  we respect that. I also wish I can just take van jobs and sustain  but van drivers would know we cannot sustain if we do that.,btohqsg
And yes ure right if it’s just two boxes  I would just do it. That’s what I feel is not unreasonable. The 9 boxes that I saw  and which you did not see  were stacked taller than me. And in fact I spoke to the dispatchers there (not the client) they said a number of drivers came and declined to take the job. I guess the client was waiting for someone like you  who would very kindly do it.,btohqsg
He would do it for free I think. With his motorcycle.,btohqsg
People already making use of us drivers and riders then you kind of people come and spoil the market.  If today you agree to pickuk the 9 boxes then that will be the next norm. Get that in your thick skull. Want work to be done pay for it. Nothing  comes free. Ask you climb stairs also you will agree isit?,btohqsg
He want to comment let him be. We just move on.,btohqsg
Got time go accept and chit chat w customer service lor,btohqsg

Is the order free?not paid? Ppl like you always think ppl spoil the market. Ppl will take the job cus they have family to feed. Bills to pay so as long as their veh can fit the items   they will take the job. Anyway the main issue is because customer doesnt want to help to carry the stuff for kai.,btohqsg
