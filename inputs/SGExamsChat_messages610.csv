"Okay wait he said ""catch up"" but he actually wanted to get his like",btohqsg
wait u can come back to the camp after ord meh,btohqsg
the lowest education you should put on LinkedIn is Sec school/jc,btohqsg
i pity his future employers. they read his cv so long until vomit blood,btohqsg
depends la if u sec sch grad den ofc put down pri sch is fine,btohqsg
Our superior let him in 😭😭,btohqsg
as in based off what he write,btohqsg
sounds like an mlm thing lol,btohqsg
caleb soh have better results than him tf,btohqsg
if what he say is true ah 100% distinction rate,btohqsg
Eh bedok wy gonna do with my violin tho,btohqsg
i mean he’s a current uni student so this is understandable,btohqsg
Oh I see liuqin players like clean their strings somehow,btohqsg
My gp teacher back in ej,btohqsg
Like they wipe the string with idk what,btohqsg
He used psychology and metacognition to teach gp,btohqsg
End up getting 90% distinction rate for my class,btohqsg
He sounds like he's just applying,btohqsg
PTSD cause of sg education system,btohqsg
the more i read the more i feel bad about his employer,btohqsg
Educational theories to get people to learn btr,btohqsg
or lesser coz pri sch kids,btohqsg
his cv…10 pages just on ns exp 🤮,btohqsg
Cause rn I'm in the same branch he was in,btohqsg
So im also involved in some of these,btohqsg
He just makes it sound overly complicated,btohqsg
His section in our branch was the most useless also,btohqsg
lol back in ns i also supported many events. maybe i should learn from him 🤣,btohqsg
I think he is either trolling or actually genuinely believes his NS experience stuff is important,btohqsg
its bad bcs i wanted kayaking so badly,btohqsg
No he does believe his ns experience is impt,btohqsg
Apparantly he wouldn't shut up abt it from what I heard from my upperstudy,btohqsg
i mean... if he uses excel or wtv he should focus more abt it in his cv,btohqsg
i mean if u got no work exp…ns exp is somewhat important…but u dont write 10 pages on it lol wtf,btohqsg
There's like kayaking activities out there,btohqsg
yes I can put my experience as a server as ‘food transportation engineer’,btohqsg
I think minimum need a pair,btohqsg
His job last time required very basic excel,btohqsg
Especially cause it's a technical skill it's very easy to evaluate,btohqsg
pair who pair what ?😞 my frens all busy,btohqsg
Aiya just play kayaking simulator in the meantime,btohqsg
"Basically as long as u say ""I can't sleep in camp.""",btohqsg
and become PA for div sm,btohqsg
He volunteered to be dsm runner?,btohqsg
I thought he was in my branch all the time,btohqsg
Okay wait so apparantly he was posted to become DSM runner and asked to leave because DSM was too anal and too strict on him,btohqsg
CAREFULLY SELECTED FOR PRESTIGIOUS APPOINTMENTTO BECOME A RUNNER WITHIN COMMANDER OFFICE U1. Don't have soft skills or hard skills2. Can only do saikang,btohqsg
Oh he volunteered to be CIO runner (guessing cause CIO runner orded),btohqsg
"""I did alot of saikang for the commanders""",btohqsg
"""It is noteworthy that this accolade is typically reserved for Regular Servicemen holding the appointment of Platoon Sergeant or higher.""",btohqsg
i tot be PA means better coz no one will fk w u,btohqsg
much higher so need harness plus it’s more of an endurance thing to me. bouldering is more puzzle solving and involves bursts of strengths + technique,btohqsg
The PA means u just do anything that the CIO/COS/DSM don't wanna do,btohqsg
Can u train until u get gorilla grip for both,btohqsg
c9 need to write so long ah,btohqsg
yea at high levels for both you def need it,btohqsg
he wayang coz he got nothing to write,btohqsg
Did wayang from ah boys to men go to ocs,btohqsg
at least wayangs go to ocs,btohqsg
he cfc write until like carry whole army like that,btohqsg
being ocs u need have good grades thats all,btohqsg
for now ah back in those days is legit ups,btohqsg
thought they also see ippt plus sit test or smth,btohqsg
i heard they value more abt high rp,btohqsg
but idk ah coz my the guy that got sent to ocs in my platoon is legit ups,btohqsg
no one disagree with him going ocs,btohqsg
iirc ippt need at least pass to go command sch,btohqsg
Don't most people pass ippt tho by the end of bmt,btohqsg
i mean the higher the score  the better,btohqsg
that is what people usually write btw,btohqsg
just brief summary will do not like a full essay,btohqsg
lol imagine when he finish uni,btohqsg
if i employer i see his cv i immediate reject,btohqsg
he talk about all the challenges he faced for every single module,btohqsg
in week 1  i diligently prepared notes based on my lecturer’s lessonsin week 2  i led a team of 3 peers to consolidate assignment answers for a final submission. i obtained an A for this assignment,btohqsg
usually those legit upz one wont flex tho,btohqsg
they low key one unless u ask them abt it,btohqsg
the siao prob gonna be pissed and wanna beat his ass up,btohqsg
Random qn   is dark ass brown very visible from black colour,btohqsg
dont stand under the sun should be fine,btohqsg
Cuz uk I bleached my hair three times just for it to turn golden brown instead of fking white but since school's starting on Mon I had to dye back to my og colour,btohqsg
It looked more black than dark brown but as long as you don't stare or squint at it  you can't rlly tell,btohqsg
Also there's like  still a few visible strands of golden brown ish,btohqsg
What time do JC ppl normally end sch,btohqsg
My ex principal was like uk be glad y'all end at this timing cause JC ppl end later,btohqsg
not so late la…no ccas usually should be like 3+,btohqsg
Last yr every Tues from Jan- Nov   my class end at 5.30,btohqsg
So those who have CCA on that day attend CCA for 15mins ish only,btohqsg
My sch damn weird alot of 30mins break in between,btohqsg
End up we could've end like a good 30mins - HR earlier,btohqsg
They using FKING pomodoro method on us,btohqsg
maybe cos my class is all chinese. so fridays can be longer,btohqsg
It's OVER now Tues and Thurs fucking gangbang me sia,btohqsg
Now is 5pm good but on two days,btohqsg
why the break so long sia,btohqsg
now i look at the other classes timetable  yeah true,btohqsg
Would u prefer dismissal  5.30pm on one day or released earlier at 5pm but on two days,btohqsg
Uk this yr they testing on oral script? Or smth then y'all have to memorize,btohqsg
Yea I mean at the start of every pe lesson they'll normally take,btohqsg
If not ltr Kenna slip or smth,btohqsg
oh yeah another reason why some classes end later is if your class has any fucked up combis lol,btohqsg
How fun is y1 JC compared to sec 4,btohqsg
i mean RI can afford to have early release bc all their lectures are online,btohqsg
EJ ALSO DOES ONLINE LECTURES BUT FOR SOME DUMB FK RRASON WE STILL RELEASED LATE,btohqsg
I heard RI enrivonment is toxic,btohqsg
ok then just EJ take an L,btohqsg
We congregate on a room to watch a video,btohqsg
i mean like every sch it depends on who you associate with,btohqsg
The new campus is not good,btohqsg
Whynot u go to the open houses,btohqsg
Luckily I told my sister not to pick ip for scgs,btohqsg
yeah…the jae-ip divide is pretty apparent. like ip students making fun of jae students in front of them,btohqsg
Thrs literally nth wrong with going EJ btw,btohqsg
It's a perfectly middle of the road JC,btohqsg
my mentee was JAE and never kena anything like this before,btohqsg
I've heard hci culture is better than ri,btohqsg
any IP sch will have this problem but see your luck,btohqsg
