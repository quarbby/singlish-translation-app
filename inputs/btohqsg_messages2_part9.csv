Hi  can I check for northshore edge  is it delayed due to Covid?,btohqsg
covid has affected every BTO and condo,btohqsg
How do i count how many first & second timer applicants are there?  üòÖ idk how to count with how the hdb described,btohqsg
i am not sure if this answers your question.,btohqsg
if based on this..best is to tackle 3 room flat?,btohqsg
i got this from HDB website for Nov2020 BTOi think it basically shares the allocation of the units.from what you are saying yeseg:2nd timer units allocation for 3room non-mature is higher as compared to other locations (30% of all available units),btohqsg
I think he meant the application rate,btohqsg
102 units/214applicants of which first timer rate is 1.0 while second timer is 23.4 overall 2.1,btohqsg
if you're first timer  you have a very high chance of getting an unit,btohqsg
^ I built a calculator for my overly anxious husband hahahaha,btohqsg
single can get sbf? thought the criteria same as BTO,btohqsg
In email only say i can apply for up to 3 room non mature estates. Didnt specifically state bto or sbf only so i try my luckü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
the eligibility for applying BTO/SBF should be the same,btohqsg
This was the email i received,btohqsg
So means eligible for sbf too?,btohqsg
Anyone here experience with HLE? If my husband is the purchaser and I'm listed as the occupier - does HDB consider our household income or only my husband's income to decide the loan offer?Asking because we're planning to get a 5-room and financially more than well to afford it but our HLE came back with <$200k loan amount only. I'm a foreigner so I wonder if that's what make this more complicated ü§î appreciate some advice  thank you!,btohqsg
did you work 3 months consecutively? and I assumed you're a PR?,btohqsg
They will only use the owner's income to calculate  in this case  only your husband.Occupier will be excluded.,btohqsg
Yeap worked for years. PR results is still pending,btohqsg
Even with a family cluster? We have a SC son so we thought they factor in household income as the eligibility test result says so üòî,btohqsg
Yes  for loans  all borrowers must be mortgagor.,btohqsg
That's what we thought but you mentioned that HDB only consider my husband's income and not our household income?,btohqsg
Yes  so because owner is your husband  thus he is the mortgagor.Occupier can be added and removed anytime  so not considered,btohqsg
Heh... I read about essential occupier and I'm certainly one.,btohqsg
Okay then in this case  how can we go about appealing for a higher loan estimates? Some advice would be super appreciated,btohqsg
Since I'm yet to be a PR  I reckon I can't be listed as co-owner right,btohqsg
The loan quantum will depend on your husband's income and age,btohqsg
If he takes with banks or financial institution  he can show cash to increase loan amount,btohqsg
This is super helpful!! Really appreciate that you spend the time chatting on this matter üôåüèª,btohqsg
Just trying to help out üòä,btohqsg
your HLE will be reassessed again upon getting keys in years time,btohqsg
unless they reject your application to be a PR  don't think you have problem getting higher loan,btohqsg
We're looking a SBF so key collection is about 1y from now. Not sure if I can have my PR by then leh :(,btohqsg
then in this case  the only way to get higher loan is to wait for the approval to convert PR  then reapply for SBF again,btohqsg
And  can change from occupier to co-owner before key collection is if?,btohqsg
As far I knew once marry mean both are co-owner.,btohqsg
Sien re PR timeline - We're wanting to move out ASAP haha,btohqsg
As foreigner can? If yes then problem solved easily üòÖ,btohqsg
We have a SC son la so that's why we could apply for SBF,btohqsg
Not yet. But the area I picked is not over-subscribed so that's like a unit guaranteed,btohqsg
Need at least one Singaporean to apply HDB,btohqsg
When u submit your HLE it will ask for both income if not wrong.,btohqsg
U can go HLE to read it. Should have some criteria to apply.,btohqsg
Ya we submitted household income but the results came back with only <$200k so we think it's not factored in my income (my husband is SC  I'm foreigner),btohqsg
U can always call up HDB to ask them,btohqsg
No harm to seek opinion from banks  maybe they can assist,btohqsg
Alright! Probably should try to have my PR obtained before key collection then,btohqsg
can BTO/SBF using your husband and your SC son's name,btohqsg
No worry the HLE is just a guideline. Everything still depend when collection of key.,btohqsg
non citizen spouse scheme can only apply resale or 2rm flexi,btohqsg
