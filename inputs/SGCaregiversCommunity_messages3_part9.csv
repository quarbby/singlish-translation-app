Are there any hospitals or places that accept donations of unused medication,btohqsg
hiLee GL In Singapore  donating unused medications is generally discouraged due to strict regulations and safety concerns. The Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore recommends returning unused medications to the pharmacies where they were prescribed for proper disposal.However  certain organizations accept donations of unused  unopened medical supplies and equipment for local redistribution.To minimise the environmental impact of wasted drugs and unintended drug exposure to children and animals  the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore recommends the following:1.Remove any personal information such as your name from the medicine package  container  or bag.2. Place the medication in a bag and secure it properly.3. Return the mediation to a nearby pharmacy.Alternatively  there are also caregivers that offers these unused medication supplies in our chat group here and some caregiver groups in fb etc and occasionally some caregivers will arrange privately to collect them if they are ok with it.,btohqsg
While we do not actively discourage such actions  we strongly recommend that all members exercise caution and undertake due diligence. Please be aware of the following:1.Safety Risks:Sharing or using medications that were not prescribed specifically for the intended user may result in adverse effects  interactions  or incorrect usage. Medications should ideally only be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.2.Legal Implications: The exchange or redistribution of medications may be subject to legal and regulatory restrictions in Singapore. (i.e Controlled/Restricted Drugs) Participants should ensure compliance with relevant laws.3.Personal Responsibility:Any arrangements made between individuals are strictly private  and the group/organisation does not endorse  facilitate  or take responsibility for the outcome of such exchanges. Participants engage in these exchanges at their own risk.4.Medical Supplies: For unopened  non-prescription medical supplies  we recommend ensuring that items are sanitised (if appropriate)  unexpired  and in safe  usable condition before sharing.Note:If you are unsure about the safety or legality of any item  please consult a healthcare professional or relevant authority. For safe disposal of unused medications  we encourage returning them to local pharmacies where they can be handled appropriately.,btohqsg
