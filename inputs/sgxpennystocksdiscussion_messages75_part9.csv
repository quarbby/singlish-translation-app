"Just to be clear...I am a supporter n longist of MT...u can see my previous post..What I am saying is  don't keep whipping the donkey and complain it's not moving fast enough..Has anyone ever stopped to think that we ourselves are to blame for this week's ""crash""?MT was very bad in Sep...down to $1...we pushed the management for actions...so they said will release something in Oct...finally Oct the price seems to stabilise at 110 120 range....last Fri close 122 I believed...then in anticipation of good Q3 results  the price got fried up on Mon and Tue to 159...before finally correcting to 120s....this might be BB telling us don't play punk on the shares...don't fry it up so quickly...let it slowly raise...Yesterday closing of 132 to me  I see it as a win vs last Fri 122...If this week Fri can close above 140  it is definitely a good sign...every week up 0.1 still not good enough?U want the share to suddenly spike up to $3 and then crash back to $1?? How many ppl will die if that happen?Just treat all these corrections as mandatory SL imposed to us by the market....hold on to your shares if u can n ride the wave..If u want to contra  also fine...but be prepared to earn n lose...I only see people complain when they contra lost...I don't see ppl openly celebrate when they win on contra...",btohqsg
you will see that sometimes people like trump is right (while other leader whom we think will not lie or what like sg leaders on mask wearing are dead wrong),btohqsg
i dont visit SJ often nowadays.they are not wrong to fearbut we can only see it when announcements are out.totally nothing you can do now,btohqsg
as mentioned these people now say halt no news bad news,btohqsg
if JT says privatisation at 11 cents,btohqsg
you think where all these jokers run to,btohqsg
there were also some typing about rights etc,btohqsg
if cannot afford rights dont average down?,btohqsg
Well said sirIndeed a true longist!,btohqsg
The truth is both longist and contra longist both want price increase  but the latter prefer shoot up max for obvious reasons,btohqsg
Rights n placements are possibilities to get stronger financially when sentiment good,btohqsg
... half agreewhen you making supernormal profits why need rights and placements,btohqsg
for example MT making profits beyond assets on company now say i want rights,btohqsg
They know supernormal profit will not last. Maybe for another half year. So now it is good window to shore up the finance.All just my view only,btohqsg
then you will be the bigger sucker,btohqsg
and the counter party to the bigger sucker is management,btohqsg
they cannot manage the finances when in good times,btohqsg
I am not saying market is giving a correct valuation for medtecs.I’m just considering what could be possible factors to explain the consistent underperformance compared to some other medical counters. In this instance u refer to gloves.Only time will tell if mt or gloves valuation are right. I just would like to be proven wrong by finding what could be factors causing the low pricing. Whining the market doesn’t seem to help all the time. Potentially market could be wrong or ownself. Better to be prepared for both scenarios.I did not say my comments aren’t demeaning. You could even call them insulting and I think probably you are right. No finger pointing here  even the players will feel they are long term investors and I’m not referring to them. Self consolationActually nothing wrong with players or investors. A volatile stocks attract players  I punt on them from time to time as well.The worst type are players concealing as investors and constantly whining. Because they feel justified to whine loudly because they are ‘investors’.If you really need a confirmation  and yes I’m certainly not referring to u. I would like to think you are investing in medtecs and see the need to explain why it’s good. I think it’s a robust and useful discussion for benefit of all here.,btohqsg
everyone is puntercause everyone got a price they want to sell at,btohqsg
Lucky I never conceal myself as investor but people disguise me as one,btohqsg
See the self proclaimed investors of medtecsGo 1.98 how many will sell outOr go to their cost price a lot will be glad to dump out,btohqsg
hi gem can you use back your old nick,btohqsg
Great thanks. To be honest I do read all your posts and your post on Vicplas should have been a life saver for many.,btohqsg
Many loh dig up my old posts to say I prompt a buy at high prices,btohqsg
I think by the fact that we are willing to put our hard-earned money onto a counter...we are essentially buying on HOPE....that it will rise....of course dyodd included la.Some call it punting...some call it investing - a rose by any name will smell as sweet,btohqsg
very awkward to not see it,btohqsg
Appreciate both bro furion and buddylee sharing,btohqsg
My motto lehBuy high sell higherBuy low sell highest,btohqsg
Can't cut loss don't blame wor,btohqsg
