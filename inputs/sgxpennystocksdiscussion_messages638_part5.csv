What Elon Musk did with Twitter was a masterful stroke of deal. He secretly bought 9% of Twitter shares becoming the largest shareholder  offer to buy all of Twitter shares which is great news for Twitter share price but because Twitter is a political tools for the leftist wing  most likely they would not want it to fall under a liberal or conservative hands thus would most likely counter offer to buy Musk shares.
