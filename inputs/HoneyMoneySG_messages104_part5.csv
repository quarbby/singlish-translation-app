Beside spc petrol using physical card will post immediate  any other purchase for same day posting for the UOB One?.,btohqsg
For your use card ocbc titanium or uob ppv is better,btohqsg
ppv = privmiles? i have this card already. im trying to see if my habit. does lady card 4mpd give me any benefit.. i dun mind the 1k :),btohqsg
the card only give bonus points if the MCC is under ur selected category. Doesn't matter online or not. As MCC of lazada/shopee varies  it is not the best card to use.,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
no ppv is preferred platinum visa,btohqsg
If you read a few post earlier  their office also closed. Doesn't sounds encouraging..,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for those calculating the UOB One account daily average balance  any excel gurus has worked out the excel formula? Do share here or if inconvenient  can pm me please.I‚Äôm currently at $100k and would take some time before I accumulate to $150k. The EIR for my DAB would likely be 3.xx% for the current account balance. Checking if alternative investments are better in the mean time. Thanks!,btohqsg
Formula is simple  I know you can work it out  Little champ!,btohqsg
The best excel formula is to maintain the daily account balance the same throughout the whole month. Any transaction credited in shall be transferred out within same day before 6pm.1).No Giro  no Paynow link   no other petty amount transaction.2). Salary n interest credited in shall be transferred out within same day before 6pm.Hassle free ‚Äúexcel formula‚Äù. Enjoy.,btohqsg

Hi Guys.. My Syfe Cash+ Guarantee is maturing. reduced to 3.75%pa for next investment. are there better options or should i continue with it?,btohqsg
If you want guaranteed fd-like returns you probably can‚Äôt do much better than 3.75% at the momentI assume you‚Äôve already maxed out possible high yield savings accounts,btohqsg

Does anyone know how long it takes for UOBAM to approve the account? Mine is still pending,btohqsg
Hi I want to ask about SRS account .The fund in SRS is use cash or can transfer OA into SRS ?,btohqsg
Why will you want to transfer OA to SRS even if it is allowed? Interest rate for SRS is so low compared to OA.,btohqsg
Okay because I want to try Saving bond which only accept Cash or SRS. So wonder if can use OA to SRS.,btohqsg
nobody keep funds in SRS  must go invest at least,btohqsg
SRS is mainly use for tax deduction at least for me. And I use the SRS to buy SSB or T bills,btohqsg
Lol CPF is CPF.. SRS is SRS..,btohqsg
Any idea if Webull will have moneybull promo for existing clients in may ?,btohqsg

My Citi CC got compromised again. But they proactively blocked the transaction. Sliver lining?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know whether Can I use my uob lady card to buy hotel in agoda/etc.. for someone else? Im not gg to travel with them,btohqsg
I think can book and notify hotel the person that is staying,btohqsg
Report fraud  replace card  rinse and repeat...,btohqsg
They sent me an SMS to verify a transaction. When they didn't receive a reply  they automatically decline the transaction and suspend my card. All these happened at around 4am. So not bad...expect for the fact that somehow their cards are particularly vulnerable to scams?,btohqsg
You can use 100k for Maribank and 100k for GXS bank,btohqsg
Touch wood but my Citi cc didn't kenna,btohqsg
Hopefully...this is my 2nd time. The 1st merchant requires a OTP/verification so it did not go through and the CSO just told me ignore it and that they will report it to their relevant department.,btohqsg
I replace alot of time liao till i lost count,btohqsg
If people do search first they would have found the answer before they asked,btohqsg
üëçBut I see repeated questions :)So am thinking save ur time,btohqsg
ü§î So where is the source of the leak? Citi themselves?,btohqsg
Yeah if they searched first there wouldn't be repeated questions,btohqsg
