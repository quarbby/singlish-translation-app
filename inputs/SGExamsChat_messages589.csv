uh do you know what are qubits,btohqsg
The mental image of u staring into space at a whiteboard,btohqsg
And it somehow made me even more confused,btohqsg
then there’s diff types of qubits. so i’m focusing on a specific kind called donor spin qubits,btohqsg
tldr is that the information is stored in their nuclear spin,btohqsg
but to build a quantum computer we need to have multiple qubits interacting with each other,btohqsg
Spin? Like the atom spin ah,btohqsg
issue is nuclear spin interactions are short range so they gotta be close tgt which leads to more charge noise from the gates that control them electrically,btohqsg
so i’m seeing if i can make them interact by using photons as a medium,btohqsg
i’m not saying we can def do it,btohqsg
Are why I'm never touching engineering W a 10000m pole,btohqsg
i’m looking into what happens when we try to,btohqsg
do it and what can we use the results for,btohqsg
Do UK how uni chem labs r like,btohqsg
U spin me right round baby right round,btohqsg
if your pole is 10000m you're probably not touching anything js 😂,btohqsg
HAHA u see me rolling   they hating,btohqsg
i only know that chem majors here have 8 hour lab sessions bc their experiments must complete in a day,btohqsg
like physics you can do part of it come back and finish the data,btohqsg
chem you can’t just tell the reaction to stop,btohqsg
Think I saw 1 tiktok w like ppl w 5 hr lab session then their eye area all got marks,btohqsg
Inertia alrd overcome (am I using the term right),btohqsg
inertia is a measure of mass,btohqsg
woo hoo  let me introduce u to another physics term called centripetal acceleration,btohqsg
Go read up on o level physics stuff,btohqsg
I tried looking thru some A level physics guidebook once,btohqsg
Hm so one lab session can take up to 8 hrs?,btohqsg
yea like morning  go get a v quick lunch then come back,btohqsg
I did try some org chem synthesis once,btohqsg
Bro I was so mad that day for no real reason,btohqsg
Then some dude got into my flame list,btohqsg
Cuz blud basically judged me cuz,btohqsg
the e in stem means econs clearly,btohqsg
Why U assume iw to persue chem at uni,btohqsg
Just cuz I go for a mf chem workshop 💀,btohqsg
I rmb attending some A*star workshop  and we had to use this syringe thing I forgot what it's called but q a no. Of my classmates broke it and it's pretty ex. It looks smth liddat,btohqsg
i did a digital marketing internship,btohqsg
look at what i’m doing rn,btohqsg
The yellow part is the needle? And there's like diff thickness to it depending on which syringe u use to ig get the exact amt??,btohqsg
i interned at the pan pacific hotels corporate office,btohqsg
It didn't look like those normal injection syringe,btohqsg
Like for those research lab tests one,btohqsg
is it you press the button at the top ?,btohqsg
but then uni one of my experiments used it too,btohqsg
And each is colour coded too so it's easy to tell,btohqsg
Underneath the button there was a crack  a faint vertical line LOL,btohqsg
it was at that moment when I knew me and the rest fked up,btohqsg
uk it's even funnier when the oic of the workshop told us not to apply too much strength and be extra careful with it cause it's just that fragile,btohqsg
reminded me of those scientists who did that in the past for research and won Nobel prizes,btohqsg
or is it sulfur dioxide  sorry cant chem anymore,btohqsg
SO2 is banned from labs now right,btohqsg
And this indicator called phenolphthalein too,btohqsg
Apparently exposure to it is carcinogenic,btohqsg
i used it so much in sec sch,btohqsg
spelling it was so annoying too,btohqsg
I accidentally smelled the blue crystals before,btohqsg
Sex Ed is useless if u sex before sex Ed was taught,btohqsg
The chs case damn funny ng,btohqsg
There were more than 15 incidents afaik,btohqsg
But they only considered 15 in court,btohqsg
"Then the defendent lawyer said smth smth ""severe lapse of personal judgement""",btohqsg
Sex ed in singapore is pretty shit considering the more conservative values of the country,btohqsg
"Half of the sex ed is about ""healthy communication"" but it only touches surface level and the other half is about abstaining from sex",btohqsg
In fact im pretty sure the science syllabus in sec 2 has a better depth of birth control than the sex ed syllabus itself,btohqsg
What bank can i apply for,btohqsg
They shld teach more on making friends app and dating app. No one use sms or facebook as often as last time,btohqsg
But at the age i think u can apply frank card,btohqsg
imagine how parents wld react if ur sch taught u that its ok to do the nasty,btohqsg
I dont even have tht much,btohqsg
I js realised the convo before was abt sex ed,btohqsg
Dont use wink yubo leomatch dont hit ppl up on tiktok v dangerous,btohqsg
They shld teach ppl not to be desperate and downbad,btohqsg
the only reason ik is because i explored it before and i wish i never even touched it both guys and girls there are rabak,btohqsg
i could not talk to one sane girl or guy,btohqsg
I only know yubo cause its like ads,btohqsg
Gen z is becoming the era of online dating and no more disney love,btohqsg
Dating iz a waste of time,btohqsg
that sounds like someone speaking from personal exp,btohqsg
"^^ if youre gna js tell a teen ""dont have sex"" then obv that teen is gna do it",btohqsg
This place is saner than the discord,btohqsg
"at least teach them abt how to control their urges instead of js spamming ""dont beat ur dong"" ""dont fuck ur boyfriend"" etc etc",btohqsg
The discord have a lot of people talking about nsfw stuff,btohqsg
sex ed was j netflix time,btohqsg
I knew tht was coming tho,btohqsg
Like what u said but my last time friends they used to tell me: this girl that girl that guy from tiktok i text on ig,btohqsg
tbh i feel critical thinking should be taught earlier instead of poly level,btohqsg
alot people nowadays just see and believe what they see is true,btohqsg
Ya I think is cuz underage,btohqsg
My dad wanna murder me at the state of my savings tho,btohqsg
Nah now he can still see everything 💀💀,btohqsg
If he find out I spend $12 on a mf,btohqsg
jus saying the frank card got expiry date one,btohqsg
but after it expire they will send u new card,btohqsg
the newer banks u can just use singpass to sign up  don't even need visit them,btohqsg
yea this one quite sick im getting 3.8%,btohqsg
Its v troublesome cos i cannot personally check ny balance through phone,btohqsg
Or paynow w phone since its my mum's account,btohqsg
Huh is that tinder or smth,btohqsg
its like teens making friends app,btohqsg
is that what sec sch ppl do,btohqsg
But I can use my own just fine,btohqsg
eh i thought i said jn,btohqsg
i was js seeig whats the hype abt it,btohqsg
then i was q shocked when there were ppl asking for fwb there,btohqsg
NOOOO ig that's the other side u don't see,btohqsg
I didnt know what fwb was,btohqsg
are u very much traumatized lol,btohqsg
HELP i thought its a new term,btohqsg
So it has been a term since long time ago,btohqsg
Idk how those ppl have the time to do that when at that age   I was worrying and drowning in my studies LOL,btohqsg
I thought u v guai one   how come uk so much,btohqsg
Okay ykw nvm lets drop this topic,btohqsg
i actually agreed the first time i hear friends w benefits cos i was like eh idm making 1 friend,btohqsg
Cause ig sg v conservative and when u hear these kind of things  it piques ppl interests LOL,btohqsg
Then bro asked me if my hse free,btohqsg
That actually happened to another guy friend of mine,btohqsg
Then i was like why need go my hse we dont even know each other,btohqsg
Then i thought he got kicked out or sth,btohqsg
Then he say oh my hse nt free,btohqsg
the thing is it wasn't Fwb but from what I heard  bro was abt to have a gd time whilst not knowing what he was getting himself into and they agreed to meet at a place and go to the girl's house but but but the girl ghosted him,btohqsg
And made him wait like 3-4hrs,btohqsg
and when it's rabak  it's damn rabak kind?,btohqsg
Is it cause of raging hormones or wot,btohqsg
are u a guy or girl,btohqsg
Oh ya is Fwb/hookup with no strings attached,btohqsg
Oh so it doesn't necessarily work that way for fwb,btohqsg
Oh I thought u meant Chinese guo lai,btohqsg
why not change the 4.5 to 5.0,btohqsg
Do testimonials help in uni applications?,btohqsg
even if its a bad testimonial?,btohqsg
ya but they wun say anything rite,btohqsg
"the thing will just say ""xxx was a student here from 2020 - 2023. thank you.""",btohqsg
anw my point is like  ig u hv to consider if the cher will write a good testimonial or nor,btohqsg
and i think sometimes they wun let u read it before they send,btohqsg
My teacher wrote that I was too smart but I wouldn't put it to good use,btohqsg
Cuz I got into 36 discipline cases in 2 terms,btohqsg
??? Wym? Won't they normally do that,btohqsg
Is it cause ppl have beef with u,btohqsg
I just did fked up shit,btohqsg
https://www.thoughtco.com/is-requesting-signed-sealed-envelopes-too-much-1685934Signed  sealed envelopes are pretty much required in order to ensure that the contents of such letters remain private.,btohqsg
Tbf i was akso from the sch where not listening to the cher can constitute a major discipline case,btohqsg
Internal settle means no criminal record right?,btohqsg
I almost called a shiba chiba LOL,btohqsg
I think I know why    it's cause of ur grp projects,btohqsg
I wasn't a good student too,btohqsg
must fill MDAC 3 days before tripexcept: if u are from sgexcept except: if u are from cn/in  then must fill 1 day before trip,btohqsg
It's true. I only sort of woke up in J2just in time,btohqsg
it was a series of luck,btohqsg
it all started during J1 when not enough people wanted to join the physics olympiad selection testand I gave face to my teacher and went for it,btohqsg
So what that means is.. if u don't get   u don't get alr?,btohqsg
sg too small to have fwb le,btohqsg
like cfm your friend know this guy who know this guy and u know that guy,btohqsg
pick up new hobbies like crochet/dance/cooking/learn an instrument,btohqsg
so many things u can do,btohqsg
Even my living room got a stack of my wip,btohqsg

I figured I would prolly start just more abt,btohqsg
Hm but for u to be saying that abt urself  aren't u considered a biased source,btohqsg
what kind of job would require u to not talk to anyone lol,btohqsg
Uhhh HM I mean if u do banquet/waiter/waitress  you'll talk at most a bit oni  thats like discussing stuff with ur colleagues uk/responding to customers' requests,btohqsg
it's not like u have to talk to impress or anything  just keep it professional can alr  like when u reply/talk  keep it short and simple,btohqsg
u can text in this gc but cannot help me w my math,btohqsg
@juicecogenswhat kind of fs is this missy,btohqsg

Also made me wonder was I even supp to serve alc even tho I'm 16 at that time but wtv,btohqsg
Needless to say   It was my first and last day,btohqsg

Can be considered as a heavy brunch,btohqsg
OKAY I MADE MY DECISION ALR,btohqsg
if u got skillset like piano or smth can go quite high iirc,btohqsg
Tuition also can  a lvl can go $40/hr,btohqsg
It’s 2023  order a 85 lbs to make a new reel,btohqsg

i doing retail ard $10/hr now q chill still ok,btohqsg
What's the min wage now per hr,btohqsg
No such thing as min wage in sg,btohqsg
However the lowest prob is macd  $6.5/hr,btohqsg
I heard it rised abit? Now drop again?,btohqsg
like to $8/hr and I hear some still complain,btohqsg
Used to be $5.5/hr but if u wan can climb to up to $13.5 or smth,btohqsg

Hi guys! I'm a Social Studies tutor here  providing tuition for secondary school students. If you happen to know anyone who needs Social Studies tuition and refer them to me  I'll paynow you 50% commission of 1 lesson 👍 can be further discussed by dropping me a message!,btohqsg
Alternatively  I run a Tiktok account called socialstudies_hackers 😊 so if any students here who may need help with Social Studies  can check out my account :),btohqsg
Nah HAHA tay is not wrong but I'm Keith!,btohqsg
orchard area usually pay high fr pt,btohqsg
clothes retail also hv to handle karen no/,btohqsg
ma'am the size is correct  maybe u shud try 1 size larger?,btohqsg
there are economic reasons for not having a min wage,btohqsg
I think I read it in one of my eoy exams' case study,btohqsg
there are a lot of unintended consequences of min wage,btohqsg
Time to brush up on my econs,btohqsg
min wage also like kuro said gets absorbed into prices,btohqsg
ever increasing skillsets needed.Those who want to remain in comfort zone  don't want to upskill and work more  will be marginalised,btohqsg
not to mention most of people that would benefit from min wage are foreign workers on temp work passes,btohqsg
like the kind of jobs you’re thinking pay too little isn’t even close to the bottom,btohqsg
minimum wage increases costs of low value jobs so there's incentive to push for productivity and automation,btohqsg
i mean some foreign workers don’t even make 1k a month,btohqsg
imagine all of those simultaneously shooting up to wtv min wage,btohqsg
The feeling when pt earn more than full timer,btohqsg
I was working at this warehse and got full timer tell me they earning $1k++,btohqsg
How would u feel if you as a full timer getting paid lesser than a 16 yr old just finished n/o lvls,btohqsg
Sure is just for less than a month but definitely sucks,btohqsg
Coz that time i work during sch holidays only,btohqsg
But still… i two weeks equals to their monthly pay,btohqsg
part time means no cpf no leave no medical no nothing,btohqsg
I seeing now ex moe teacher can go as high as $80/hr,btohqsg
Yeahh but if u went to legit agencies they will give u,btohqsg
u want stable then of cos u get less,btohqsg
I work before one that gave me cpf even though its a day job,btohqsg
I specifically asked to give me full amount but no,btohqsg
Coz the one i went  they gave me cheque only,btohqsg
And they take quite big cut iirc,btohqsg
Ya so protip is find the big daddy,btohqsg
Or work directly for the part time job,btohqsg
But this one legit need find,btohqsg
High chance is they willing to pay u than agency,btohqsg
I think out of the worst i went was the lan job one sia,btohqsg
Same but I've got to pay cpf now lol,btohqsg
Is like u one person jagar the whole lan,btohqsg
If I rmb correctly like 17% of my salary went to employer then 10% goes to cpf,btohqsg
jagar the lan? is it like cybersecurity job?,btohqsg
