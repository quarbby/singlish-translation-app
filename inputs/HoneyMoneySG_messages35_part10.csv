Hi  not sure if anyone ask this before. I am currently using Revolut mc for taking the MRT but when I load onto the app  there was no deduction made to the card.. only -10c,btohqsg
They will charge the proper amount in one go later on. I think after 1 week they will charge all the mrt/bus spending for that week.,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. So will it be taken as 1 transaction since it‚Äôs gonna be charged once a week?,btohqsg

"I want to address this issue of private vs public sharing of card strategies.Some of the critics will ask  ""why so secretive keep to paid private group only?""Let's be clear here that I have been sharing transparently the past two years with free content on YouTube Channel. And you see the consequences of nerfs after nerfs from oversharing.ACCM is literally the safe space to protect from oversharing. You may disagree on how it is operating and not purchase it (I told you all not to buy in my first sentence). But do not undermine the work that I have did in the past  current and future for credit card content  which will still continue in public space.Thanks.",btohqsg
