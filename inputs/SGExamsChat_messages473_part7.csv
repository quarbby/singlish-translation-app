like after experiencing a lvls myself,btohqsg
for people like me who rly struggled with econs  finding out that the higher band teachers made more sense that my band teachers was abit sad,btohqsg
as scary as ppl make it sound like,btohqsg
i mean i do get the banding system,btohqsg
thats reality lo its always like that man ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
19 000 enrolled for engineering science,btohqsg
dk whatever the system is anymore its so confusing,btohqsg
but i do feel that theres pros and cons ? for whichever we want to go to,btohqsg
wld u rather be the stupid one put into a class with clever ppl,btohqsg
like its damn hard to catch up man,btohqsg
i felt like shit trying to catch up with students who were literally taking h3 econs,btohqsg
i mean i went into jc just to find out i was doing badly in everything but computing so now im acing in a CS degree,btohqsg
then they there talk chicken while i speak dog,btohqsg
eat banana  fling poo  bang wife  life good.,btohqsg
It good for someone like me,btohqsg
but others who do feel that once youre in JC you have to do the best  then its def stressful la,btohqsg
wldnt u say that that wld be the same for anything else,btohqsg
im glad my fam was respectful for how my results turned out and allowed me to go into priv u instead of trying to retake when i knew what i wanted to do,btohqsg
like theres always competition to be the best even in pri sch,btohqsg
ironically iâ€™d consider that i was most stressed in pri sch than in mi,btohqsg
prob the least stressed i ever felt in mi actually,btohqsg
trust me bruv literally 5 years down the road no one give a shit about what uni you pop out from,btohqsg
no one ask for what uni and stuff,btohqsg
in pri sch i was fighting for my life trying to top classes and shit,btohqsg
they legit only ask about work experience,btohqsg
and thats highkey where the stress comes about,btohqsg
why go social science/law dip when u can do degree,btohqsg
i mean everything is to each their own,btohqsg
like taking a law dip dont rlly make sense right,btohqsg
not like u can go for bar with a dip,btohqsg
some people arenâ€™t mature about it but you canâ€™t compare your own experiences with others,btohqsg
cnfm the big number is cuz of the whole chs system,btohqsg
so idk why life is a thing ah,btohqsg
but i somehow am still a human,btohqsg
guess ppl dont like poking mouths,btohqsg
Does this show a improving economy?,btohqsg
THE DIFF BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE FOR SCIENCE ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
forgive me but idk whatâ€™s the point youâ€™re trying to make,btohqsg
Do u think the Eco is improving?,btohqsg
Why would there be a correlation between our economic performance and expenditure per capita for student sorry?,btohqsg
Exactly. I heard abt looming bank collapses,btohqsg
There â€˜s more. U.S has one of the worst track records on loans & interest rates. Bound to have more,btohqsg
the law here qualify for paralegal iirc,btohqsg
idk...my thinking is like more money spent on edcuation means we got more money in general? because as far as i can tell  there has not been some significant change in terms of how we spread out funds for education,btohqsg
Look at the intake and the graduates,btohqsg
I mean if you wanted to know how the economy was doing donâ€™t need infer from education spending lol,btohqsg
dw  i know there are better ways,btohqsg
Like trying to measure distance with bananas  can be done but why go such a roundabout way to do it and infer,btohqsg
measure the entire circumference of the world by foot,btohqsg
so someone technically walked around the earth,btohqsg
