lol i thought sgexams renamed or sth when i saw the group,btohqsg
All the cool fishes are doing it,btohqsg
We can‚Äôt really do much but remind everyone to set their privacy settings so that they can‚Äôt be added to random groups,btohqsg
How about we book those grp names ahead of him,btohqsg
He already got those group names,btohqsg
Also  we don‚Äôt have to do that,btohqsg
that's stooping to their level lmao,btohqsg
We will do what we have always done,btohqsg
So we won‚Äôt do anything unethical,btohqsg
But he clearly started it to kind of challenge sgexams,btohqsg
And to monetise it in the long run,btohqsg
If his group turns out to be more useful then all the better for students,btohqsg
Otherwise  it will just die by itself,btohqsg
Let's be real  the profits he will obtain will be small compared to the amount of work he has to invest,btohqsg
Theres some NUS/NTU undergrad doing somethin like this  and he earms quite a fair bit  appeared recently online,btohqsg
U need to reach a specific number of users to achieve that though,btohqsg
Is just like instagramInfluencers get paid to advertise and the renumeration is dependent on number of followers,btohqsg
But I doubt this is what he‚Äôs going for,btohqsg
Cause this niche is already taken,btohqsg
And they are funded  not profiting off their members,btohqsg
He can do advertisments in other domains,btohqsg
Ye but they admitted in an article they also profit from food ads posted from ppl who want them to advertise in the channel,btohqsg
Well I'd suppose he count charge like 30 dollars for a message about some random tuition centre,btohqsg
But the very idea of it sounds ridiculous,btohqsg
I wont be surprised if he does it,btohqsg
Ah yes monetisation of education  ranks alongside child abuse in terms of level of exploitation,btohqsg
That‚Äôs great! If any company decides advertising there is good use of marketing Budget  let them die there. üôÉ,btohqsg
Tuition Centres that do adverts are unethical themselves anyway. Let the unethicals cannibalise each other. See who win.,btohqsg
I hate the tuition business =(,btohqsg
You are in very good company,btohqsg
poor thing sia kenna misunderstood :‚Äù(,btohqsg
actually why ah what happen to him,btohqsg
why he buy so many eggs,btohqsg
I think he just delivery man,btohqsg
wah shit then he drop the eggs,btohqsg
u nvr watch wat happen at KFC ystd,btohqsg
But my supervisors recommend me to open one,btohqsg
Lmao theres more beef abt the guy above in another grp,btohqsg
Nor was i added to any grp,btohqsg
Aite i just read first three screenshots,btohqsg
And suddenly burpees seem more interesting,btohqsg
Anyways this is a dox technically,btohqsg
u finish ur hbl alr isitt,btohqsg
U need to see the full convo,btohqsg
I didnt take what happened thereafterIts still ongoing,btohqsg
You mind deleting those pictures though?,btohqsg
His real name is john smith,btohqsg
but my dch literally no live lessons at all,btohqsg
they say is to give chance to those who only have one com must give to the siblings use,btohqsg
as in we do have live lessons but its discouraged,btohqsg
