more of a constitutional democracy  since monarch had more power,btohqsg
but then again the third reich was a democracy too,btohqsg
Yeah  so almost all countries are democracies then?,btohqsg
I think you pay too.much focus on what is on paper,btohqsg
So to say that Taiwan was never communist is true,btohqsg
To say that taiwan was always democratic is kinda true,btohqsg
But there were no elections before the 90s,btohqsg
How can you say it is a democracy without elections?,btohqsg
Well there were elections before the civil war  so the ROC regime can be considered a democracy,btohqsg
This same government took over and administered taiwan from 1945 onwards,btohqsg
and between then and the 90s  it was a period of national emergency plus the cold war,btohqsg
so yeahhhhhhh having elections was kinda hard when korea is getting bombed and the strait crises were happening,btohqsg
plus nationalism did come before democracy,btohqsg
As far as I am aware the general public cannot vote  is that correct?,btohqsg
Plus a full democracy may not be the best system anyways  you could argue it both ways,btohqsg
Adult males over the age of 21  who were educated or owned property and paid taxes  and who could prove two-year residency in a particular county could vote.[1] An estimated 40 million  4-6% of China's population were registered for the election.[2] This is an increase from the size of the electorate in the 1909 Chinese provincial elections  when less than 1% of the population was enfranchised.,btohqsg
But this was under Yuan Shikai's goverent,btohqsg
Correct  but the regime did have elections  so it is fundamentally  a democracy,btohqsg
This is far from a full democracy,btohqsg
So would you consider the DPRK to be a democracy?,btohqsg
Bear in mind adults can vote in the DPRK,btohqsg
they literally only have that ONE candidate,btohqsg
Yeah  you either vote for  or you cross out the name to vote against,btohqsg
Nope  it is Marshall Kim Jong Un,btohqsg
Both way pretty much fucks you over,btohqsg
Well  I think he used to be,btohqsg
Well  this was when all the warring states were united post qing collapsed. How else are you gonna define who gets to vote and who doesn't?Besides a citizen can be defined as someone who pays taxes. And an educated citizen who is familiar with the democratic process gets to vote. I think this is a fair criteria,btohqsg
"and there were real opposition parties  not like the DPRK where ""opposition"" have to be governmentally approved",btohqsg
This is the south sudanese ballot paper,btohqsg
It is meant for people that are illiterate,btohqsg
So claiming that people who have little education cannot vote is fair  is not really right,btohqsg
Yeah but people living in a dictatorship or monarchy for a long time might not have the knowledge to vote wisely  unless he is educated to some extent. Think how many soviet states revoted communist post ussr,btohqsg
China needed a transitional democracy and this was about the best way to do it,btohqsg
Is the USSR bad? Not necessarily,btohqsg
Plus the USSR had already de-Stalinised,btohqsg
of course  this was exploited to no end by the CCP who gathered support from the bottom rungs of society who had not had the chance to vote,btohqsg
USSR is still bad after de stalinisation because the other leaders still made questionable moves,btohqsg
Like Brezhnev and how he almost started a full out war with China,btohqsg
So because of communist ideology ?,btohqsg
That is if you look at the big picture. But to an ordinary Soviet citizen  it may not be,btohqsg
Yes their ideology forces them to somewhat be more protective,btohqsg
No it isnt  but it highlights the fact that that even with a 100% literacy rate  lack political awareness and education still sways the public to vote for a certain party,btohqsg
I think there’s a reason why communist ideology is there,btohqsg
When we Say about communist ideology is one party rule,btohqsg
Well  if you are poor and you don't have the ruling government to support you  what can you do? Support whoever is supporting you,btohqsg
True because after Gorbachev decided to let them have a whiff of western life everyone revolted,btohqsg
So maybe everyone wants one party to just control the whole year,btohqsg
technically  Mao almost started a full out war against the USSR. The USSR de stalinised  but china resisted progress,btohqsg
Because democracy has something to do with refinining the policy every year,btohqsg
Before the Sino-Soviet split the USSR was China's 大哥,btohqsg
