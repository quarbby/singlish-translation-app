Amos group  everyone can keep this in watchlist view. after rights issue done  i believe a play coming up. Many long time stuckist in this counter which used to be called Gaylin. Rights issue at $0.0135. Prior to rights issue  there was a pump up to $0.019. That should be prior accumulation. Also  i believe most or all of the earlier stuckists are at over $0.20  they will be subscribing to the rights at $0.0135  giving it liquidity at this 1 series price range. $0.013 and below definitely a safe price if you can collect. If can get should be an easy win. The controlling shareholders (Private Equity firm Shawkwei partners average price after this rights issue exercise  should be at 3 to 4 series. Lets see  DYODD.https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/shawkwei-eyes-returns-from-gaylin-in-5-years,btohqsg
