Yeah but don‚Äôt you have o levels??,btohqsg
yea is like those kind with kids,btohqsg
Why does volunteering need qualifications actually?,btohqsg

cause some is like tutoring so i think they want someone who have the min qualifications?,btohqsg
and i see some jobs also is min qualification o/nlevel,btohqsg

8-year-old girl in Hong Kong taken off life support after botched operation left her in vegetative stateMy little princess Tin-yu  we are all deeply heartbroken and reluctant to leave you. You are the happiest and sweetest memory in your father‚Äôs life  but also the most heartfelt and painful experience.A surgery to remove her tumour in May 2020 went wrong when a blood transfusion was delayed by 48 minutes.Little Tin-yu's heart stopped beating for 52 minutes  leaving her in a vegetative state up until her passing.üëâhttps://tsl.to/tinyulifesupport@mustsharenews,btohqsg
another accomplishment tday  caught the fat fooking lizard thats been in my house for a few yrs,btohqsg

shits probly a senior  tough meat probs,btohqsg
times like these when my neck is sore as shit and cant bend it is when i miss my flexibility,btohqsg
I hope you didn‚Äôt cut the tail off üòÅ,btohqsg
it i wanted to kill it wld just stomp it immediately,btohqsg
thats the normal reaction but i feel like cleaning it up wld be even more gross lol,btohqsg
got stray cat arnd ur area?,btohqsg
oso my parents are buddhist so they dw kill this kinda thing  but we still eat meat lol,btohqsg
not all buddhist are totally vegetarian ig,btohqsg
we still do on some days,btohqsg
i nearly gave myself a heart attack,btohqsg
cuz i tot i lost ny wallet,btohqsg
also ChatGPT may be inaccurate for some topics,btohqsg
As in  aren‚Äôt companies already using ChatGPT for this work?,btohqsg
I honestly doubt there‚Äôs a job you could do entirely from home,btohqsg
I've never seen a fat lizard wth that's kinda cool,btohqsg
What I said was quite reductive  obviously there‚Äôs stuff like YouTube and content creation but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs immediate or stable,btohqsg
what constitutes as a job tho,btohqsg
labour and time in exchange for $,btohqsg
it's more of turning a 10-20 people job to 2-3 people,btohqsg
the artists are more in danger imo,btohqsg
have. you just need the skillset for it  but fully remote jobs do exist,btohqsg
the thing about chatgpt is that some of its input is very recognisable,btohqsg
actually have  I can think of a few off the top of my head,btohqsg
"like if you see the word ""tapestry"" randomly pop up a lot-prob gpt",btohqsg
Yeah I know  but I‚Äôm guessing the person who asked the question earlier probably doesn‚Äôt have professional certifications lol  especially if you‚Äôre still a student,btohqsg
remote jobs still kinda need certs,btohqsg
you can only do freelance stuff at that stage,btohqsg
Freelance is very competitive since there are tons of people from countries like India who are willing to do the job for much cheaper,btohqsg
small business owner: eg. knit or crochet stuff from home  only do deliveries and no meetupspiano/other instrument teacher: get kids to go to your house to learn the piano. This was (is?) popular amongst ladies where the husband was the main breadwinner and the lady would teach kids piano to supplement the family income.ghostwriter: write things published under other people's name for a fee,btohqsg
Even then you‚Äôll need a solid portfolio for freelance or you‚Äôre out of luck,btohqsg
i know i'm just saying it's the only option,btohqsg
like for my example of the piano lady  usually it would be a lady with a reputation in her circle,btohqsg
and the piano lady isn't a really stable job,btohqsg
it's more of a side thing for her to do when her husband is at work,btohqsg
Yea exactly I wouldn‚Äôt learn the piano just to be able to teach  unless ofc it was already a hobby of mine prior,btohqsg
tbh I'm considering being something like a piano lady in the future except that i teach chinese calligraphy instead of piano,btohqsg
"yea  usually the piano ladies would be those where the parents ask the girl to learn all those ""feminine"" arts like playing piano  ballet  cooking  sewing etc. so she has skills of her own instead of depending on her husband entirely",btohqsg
this was more prevalent in the last time when is more male dominated society,btohqsg
i mean no one is claiming you can do freelancing out of nowhere. you need to have something under your belt for it,btohqsg
probably not full-time ba. maybe after i retire,btohqsg
i've done freelance art for a few years now and it's still just a little bit of extra money,btohqsg
or like teach kids on the side while i'm in uni smth like that,btohqsg
but it'd be a side job not a main career,btohqsg
Iw to just grandma hobby make bags all day,btohqsg
old grandma crochet outside mrt station,btohqsg
Cheebai I just crochet on bus jn,btohqsg
I'm gonna ask fcp to whack you for bullying jiejie,btohqsg
I think that‚Äôs just a rich people thing tbh,btohqsg
more prevalent in the families with money to spare,btohqsg
No parent would ask their daughter to learn piano or ballet or to cook or to sew just so she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have to depend on her husband‚Äù,btohqsg
yea i do kinda agree with what you said,btohqsg
cause the poorer ones would have to do labour,btohqsg
"then those are like the ones where they are expected to be wives but the family has a decently rich backgroundand yea those were also important for a woman that is more ""upper class"" to be doing",btohqsg
Yeah I doubt they‚Äôd have to time to spare for such fancy hobbies lol,btohqsg
but towards like the time where women had a bit more rights then they could start using those stuff to earn money la,btohqsg
but then ofc that's provided that your husband is okay with it + your house finances is alr good enough  and its like a cherry on top,btohqsg
yea poorer girls would have to work in farm  clean the house and cook  so those piano lady is really upper middle class kind of person alr  and she def wont be doing it so that her family wont starve,btohqsg
If your house finances is alr good why the need for a side income? The increase is only marginal,btohqsg
"not really ""need"" la  is like ÁßÅÊàøÈí± for her",btohqsg
cause like women also have to have their only private money  in case the husband run away  she is not broke,btohqsg
are you really gonna sign on,btohqsg
This is a good idea for an insurance scheme,btohqsg
everything and anything can be a good marketing idea as long as you are creative enough,btohqsg
My cousin complain they get $2k+ but nsf only $900+ when they doing the same thing actually,btohqsg
