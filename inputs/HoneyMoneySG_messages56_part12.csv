Hi friends! Can I check if Paynow - SALA to UOB One Account still works?- changing job and salary credit will come next month. So this month I have to do self transferSo I have already transferred but don't seem to work,btohqsg
As of now I‚Äôm still doing that. I pay via AXA with the policy number (even though now is HSBC life). My agent confirmed with me it works.,btohqsg
This DP is for Citi payall,btohqsg
Which credit card considers Travel insurance as eligible transaction?,btohqsg
The billing cycle is dependent on when you get your card  its different for each person. You can call them to change the statement date if you want another day.Note that the bonus points cap is based on Calendar Month,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know if citi smrt gives 5% to SP bills and hawker QR aka XNAP?,btohqsg
How sc simply cash cash back work,btohqsg
You can pay as much as u want  up to your credit limit and limit for the category set by Citi  about 30k,btohqsg
you mean you just signed up via moneysmart or you asking him to sign up via moneysmart?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt get what u mean sorry,btohqsg
Yes I max my credit limit  but now need to pay more,btohqsg
Yea but now I hit my max limit and now it‚Äôs in unbilled  can I do payment for this unbilled so that I can have my max limit again?,btohqsg
cannot. limited to your fixed credit limit by Citibank. You can only increase it if you request for permanent credit limit. Paying your credit card bill early doesnt help.E.g. If my limit is 10k  I used 9k for payall. I cannot pay my Citibank credit card bill early to use another 9k for a new payall.I can request for permanent credit limit increase to 20k. Then i can use whatever extra limit i have for payall.,btohqsg
Qns: if I spend $400 on uob one for normal purchase  but then another 300 on shopee  I understand that now my total spend hits 500 for the 3.33 cb  but for the shopee trx  does the extra 5% count towards the whole 300$ or only the first $100,btohqsg
There is a cap to the cashback on UOB One CC? Didn't see it ... Thanks for the info,btohqsg
Only good for up to $500  $1000  $2000 tiersCannot be in between tiers,btohqsg
Ahhh right well I definitely hit the $2000 spent tier,btohqsg
I first time tried to redeem voucher for Citibank rewards point and applied for lendlease. It came in the form of letter. It has the date  voucher number then rewards mentioning;Lendlease $50 voucherRedeem @ Parkway Parade/313@Somerset Concierge. Valid at participating stores.How do I use the voucher? Or do I need to bring this letter to redeem actual voucher? Or I can use the letter as voucher but only can use at Parkway Parade/313@Somerset? I thought all lendlease retail can use. ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
bring to those places' conceirge to change into voucher.. i think they might give you e voucher,btohqsg
"no but you mentioned ""Redeem at concierge""?",btohqsg
Hi all  would like to check for the moomoo promo  does sg stocks work to fulfill the 3 trades for the free SEA stock? If i were to buy those super low value trades,btohqsg

hi  when we say we use amaze x crmc  do we physically tap the amaze card? or we add the amaze card into gpay and make payment? which way can we get 10x pts? Thanks!,btohqsg
Once u link amaze to crmc  as long as mcc qualify u get 10x point up to 1k spend in month,btohqsg
Hi  for dbs woman's card cap of 2k  when will it reset back to 0? By end of month or end of statement month? Thanks,btohqsg
then i am not sure why i am not given 10x... i used it at Goldheart Jewelry. the citi cso told me it is not eligible for 10x bcoz i used amaze card.... ?,btohqsg
i think u answered to the wrong person?,btohqsg
I have been using it at clinic  no issue or whatso ever  u only get the 10x point when transaction posted. Did u check after it was posted or before,btohqsg
1st day of the month is new cycle,btohqsg
points awarded 1-2 day after posted. Have u maxed out $1k spend in statement month for bonus points?,btohqsg
the txn was actually posted in june.... maybe i call again  not sure why also,btohqsg
u are using Amaze card linked with crmc  not topped up Amaze wallet yah?,btohqsg
Why do we need to create pockets on gxs and main wallet can't earn interest?,btohqsg
You'll have to ask GxS on this üòÇ Their system their rules.,btohqsg
cos bonus interest only awarded to pockets not main,btohqsg
That's so inconvenient to use tho,btohqsg
If all else fails  just ask for transaction MCC  and whether it's online,btohqsg
yea  no choice lor. Need to live with the hassle to get bonus interest.,btohqsg
"Maybe the idea is to use it as a ""stash"" account",btohqsg
Like its meant to be used as a money parking tool  not one where u deposit and withdraw often,btohqsg
Ya I used gpay when I made payment. Not using wallet.,btohqsg
Hello guys  does anyone know what mcc code does amazon ads fall under?,btohqsg
