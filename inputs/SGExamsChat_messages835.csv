and the group ur assigned to in day 1 of orientation,btohqsg
I heard the class change every week,btohqsg
Like u don't always see the same faces,btohqsg
and different classes for general mods,btohqsg
I haven't met anybody in masscomm yet,btohqsg

dw and good luck for ur Os,btohqsg
I need to get used to the commute,btohqsg
most people are chill yeah dont worry about it too much,btohqsg
Do classes start at 8 everyday?,btohqsg
8 30 but i heard that they are changing the schedule,btohqsg
so it might be different from next year,btohqsg
I have to take 161 everyday to school,btohqsg
hey sorry to butt in but,btohqsg
i am not sure-? but pfp students in my class are adjusting well,btohqsg
they participate in more events tbh,btohqsg
and have fixed subjects from what i hear,btohqsg
on the opposite side of the country,btohqsg
i live at tampines so same,btohqsg
but with the way things are going it might be the most realistic option üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
How do you get to sch on time,btohqsg
i leave at 6 40 to avoid rush hours,btohqsg
food is affordable for me- can get huge milo for 1.6 and snacks around 2,btohqsg
I wanna try the salad bowl thing,btohqsg
I heard the food is yummay,btohqsg
yeah some schools are changing names,btohqsg
I hope I don't meet any of my current classmates in rp tho,btohqsg
I kinda want a new environment,btohqsg
i met 3 of my current classmates in same course in rp,btohqsg
i mean u might see them,btohqsg
for you- it would be in april next year,btohqsg
I heard orientation got like a rave or smthin,btohqsg
err there is a dance performance showcase at day 3,btohqsg
rave or no rave not rlly a problem for me,btohqsg
jus happy to be in poly fr,btohqsg
orientation is only 3 days also so-,btohqsg
Idk if I'll meet min. req,btohqsg
21 days b4 my o's actlly start,btohqsg
Should be enough to salvage it,btohqsg
12 days until second half of my n‚Äôs ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
good luck to this year o's and n's!,btohqsg
I'm like 50% done with my subjects,btohqsg
Nfs js gotta take the ppr,btohqsg
o level era was hell lmao,btohqsg
It's gonna be so relieving after,btohqsg
Yeah like food safety during cooking,btohqsg
Some say it's the easiest to get a1,btohqsg
I'm a bit sad I'm graduating,btohqsg
I didn't sign up for promnight üò≠,btohqsg
bro our school didnt even have prom,btohqsg
I was like after o's  I just want to forget abt everyone,btohqsg
we are still fighting for prom yk,btohqsg
Secsch is so traumatic especially all the subjects,btohqsg
nahh u will end up talking to them more than ur poly friends,btohqsg
only gna miss the students n teachers,btohqsg
The school be getting an upgrade tho,btohqsg
u may or may not see them btw,btohqsg
One of them got into tp,btohqsg
it is the o-level season what u expect sia,btohqsg
The other got into events management,btohqsg
events management can still see during break,btohqsg
The O is not an O  the O is a number that represents my sanity,btohqsg
And right now it is at O level of sanity,btohqsg
So much trauma can't give up now,btohqsg
In 2 day i can get sm done,btohqsg
Welp thank god I am done w O levels,btohqsg
I just gotta meet min requirements,btohqsg
It feels like a mountain in front of me ngl,btohqsg
Idw end up last minute study,btohqsg
So I should probably start using the very little time I hv,btohqsg
I'm so lucky that I got eae tho.. definitely a lot of relief..,btohqsg
u still have to work hard for it yk,btohqsg
my friend lost eae by one point,btohqsg
Honestly  I've been so lazy lately. I'm not sure how to start.. it all feels overwhelming,btohqsg
I'm not really like an academically incline kind of person.,btohqsg
But I feel like this is the last lap so I should prolly give it my all,btohqsg
hmm start with the thing u avoided u most,btohqsg
the subjects u avoided the most,btohqsg
I've been avoiding studying the whole year,btohqsg
I had like spurs of motivation but it all died down within 2 weeks,btohqsg
look at ur EAE offer and u will think again,btohqsg
look at ur exam papers and ur weak subjects,btohqsg
I always start the semester with a lot of motivation but once the pressure & hw gets too much,btohqsg
I just like don't feel like studying,btohqsg
I'd like be super hardworking for 2 weeks,btohqsg
Then I'll just be super unmotivated for the rest,btohqsg
but u need a lot more than that,btohqsg
its already pretty late so u better start now,btohqsg
I should plan my days wisely,btohqsg
u dont want to cry at ur result collection right?,btohqsg
Instead of blindly going at it,btohqsg
I just wanna go poly üò≠,btohqsg
not much days to plan but u can try a simple planner,btohqsg
So I need to start doing stuff,btohqsg
To salvage what can be salvaved,btohqsg
What should I do to start?,btohqsg
and do some practices  write notes and ask help,btohqsg
1 in 3 young people in Singapore has experienced very poor mental health  including depression  anxiety and stress  found an IMH survey.https://str.sg/rhs8,btohqsg
spam tys and other sch exam paper. use ypt app to keep track of how much you r spending each day to study. when reading ur notes  try to understand the content ( easier to memorise ). use active recalling.,btohqsg

i can't tell if those are videos or songs,btohqsg
patient  good listener and follower; a little struggle with leading and communication issues may arise here and theresometimes you may end up being a pushover or a blockhead(??) idk im just yapping,btohqsg
im part of that 2/3 i guess,btohqsg
You have a lot of time,btohqsg
that's not how studying should be.Ideally over the year  you should be semi hardworking  semi lazy.Instead of 100% effort over 2 weeks  it's better to be 50% over 4 weeks  and likely to last longer.It's like running 2.4km  do you start by sprinting at maximum speed because you are hyper motivated  or do you pace yourself slowly?,btohqsg
Majority of humans cannot stay at peak performance all the way.,btohqsg
some people can make other ways work  but i wouldn't strive to emulate them,btohqsg
yes don't message your teachers and affect their rest outside of schoolFocus and study well during school hours instead,btohqsg
what kind of teachers are the appearances of teachers in the podcast?like early childhood  primary  secondary or post education teachers?? (ite  poly  jc & uni teachers work drastically imo but it usually depends on who the students encounter for their advisors and lecturers),btohqsg
curious coz i don't listen to podcasts,btohqsg
i can't remember if there's an article on this said podcast,btohqsg
but there were a few articles on this without Minister Chan Chun Sing directly commenting,btohqsg
I heard speed coming? Maybe tmr,btohqsg
i‚Äôm nt sure bt give that guy some privacy and space.,btohqsg
yall this is so fucked up,btohqsg

I doubt sls wld have btr deal then like newegg or amazon if u can wait,btohqsg
He say must get someone to build,btohqsg

I might look at sls when i want to upgrade,btohqsg

but I want a x3d CPU,btohqsg
Doesnt have that mich diff unless u play fps games?,btohqsg
AMD Ryzen vs Intelnowadays which one better ah?,btohqsg
I never follow for some time,btohqsg
flight sim benefit from x3d alot,btohqsg
depends on what u wna do ig,btohqsg
Intel 13th and 14th gen have been breaking lol,btohqsg
i load microsoft powerpoint on my 4090,btohqsg
I load 20 Excel sheets on my 4090,btohqsg
altho hor tbh unless you need ray tracing,btohqsg
I wld prefer an AMD GPU,btohqsg
I mean the higher end ones can alrdy do ray tracing mostly thr,btohqsg
Unless u want play cp2077 or smth which is just nvidia marketing lol,btohqsg
honestly I feel ray tracing damn fluff,btohqsg
nvidia works better for my purposes but it‚Äôs p niche,btohqsg
otherwise i‚Äôd always say amd rn,btohqsg
that‚Äôs one part of it yea,btohqsg
but other stuff of my research lor,btohqsg
navigating it with AMD is a pain,btohqsg
U know what is also a pain,btohqsg
man needed his TA to escort him to the pickup area,btohqsg

huh Ubisoft Singapore planning another Triple A (AAA) game??,btohqsg
their Skulls and Bones one had so much publicity and promotion before the game's release but there was barely on socmed(social media) compared to other games that aren't even AAA,btohqsg
lol i rmb my friend showed me...i was like  they actually did that,btohqsg
the question setter must be strongly influenced by Gyatt,btohqsg
Ubisoft even dare say skulls and bones is the first ‚ÄúAAAA‚Äù game. Literally a slap to SG gov.,btohqsg
Can I ask  for Olevel social studies  is it a compulsory requirement to take? Is it part of the optional humanities when u choose that or geography or history ?,btohqsg
You can drop everything but the main 4,btohqsg
You can't drop English Maths Science or mother tongue.Everything else you can don't turn up for examsElectives and Humanities,btohqsg
you can drop subjects choosing not to take during O/N levels i think,btohqsg
Then ite need how many subjects?,btohqsg
"Drop also goes two ways ""Don't turn up for class test/exams/lessons  turn up only for O levels""Or go through the official route of informing the school",btohqsg
EMB3 and L1R4 come from the same concept rightcalculating the aggregate points of a student's Os or Ns exam scores from 5 subjects,btohqsg
if you're an Os & N(A)s  student  you still need the bare minimum aka 5 subjects to scoreif you're an N(T) student  4 minimum subjects can alr,btohqsg
All you need is 5 subjects that you can use to go ite or poly,btohqsg
Out of these 5  4 of it must be eng  maths  science and mt,btohqsg
Yep  the difference is the relevant and Best subjects,btohqsg
Ye the relevant subj might need humans,btohqsg
finally you answered right with the focus shifted back to the question,btohqsg
if ur sec 4 this year  j don't think you can drop subjects anymore,btohqsg
sec 3 still have some time to think about it,btohqsg
You can drop by just not attending lessons or go by the official way of informing the school,btohqsg
yeah except L1R4 you don‚Äôt rlly need to compute math (but your math still matters because E8 math cannot go poly),btohqsg
same with N‚Äôs  your english cannot hit at least B3 also cannot go poly,btohqsg
based on grade conversion B3 in n levels is like D7 in o levels,btohqsg
i got tele open on my monitor,btohqsg
tele is also open on my laptop bro,btohqsg
report the bullies if u r beaten right away to the police,btohqsg
normally sch teachers dont take action / let the bullies off leniently.,btohqsg
I have seen teachers BE bullies before...,btohqsg
That is the worst case scenario,btohqsg
no indication on OP's case but mentioned in post repeatedly it's a Boys' (Secondary) School,btohqsg

Is Red Alpha Cybersecurity worth it to get some industry training?,btohqsg
It's run by some of the more prominent cybersecurity peeps in SG. But I wouldn't recommend if you are just starting out in cybersecurity  only if you already have some experience and want to dive further,btohqsg
Would it be good as a pseudo-honors/internship after a private university cybersec degree?,btohqsg
You honestly would need to look into the qualifications they provide you  and see if it adds value to your current set of skills. I've had a friend who graduated from a private uni and working full-time now in one of the Big 4 (with no other certification),btohqsg
I would say if you are still pursuing your degree  go for your internship first. If you like the company  see if you can talk to your supervisor or manager to see if you could transition to a full-time role when you graduate. Check the salary  employment benefits too before accepting the offer,btohqsg
Tl;Dr See if the training programmes Red Alpha gives you  would really benefit you,btohqsg
not here. irl he's busy and got fucked by poly grading,btohqsg

I wld like to say that my knee made me lag behind by many wks,btohqsg
Evidence 1: QM 2 midterm üòÇ,btohqsg
i dont even need a broken knee to make me lag behind by many weeks,btohqsg
can't be lag behind by many weeks when you messed your knee up a week ago,btohqsg
I cld have spent more time to do cmp hw but nooooo i de ided to injure my knee,btohqsg
Yea....all of us were focused on app of qm....,btohqsg
Mostly cus app of qm midterm was a day before qm 2 midtermmmm,btohqsg
Fortunately for me  I had an mc uh...,btohqsg
The funny part is i did predict tut 1 q1 coming out,btohqsg
But a lot of yall say is damn hard,btohqsg
Esp cus the mcq reduce from 15 to 10,btohqsg
P.s. qm 2 shld also not have removed mcq,btohqsg
i was shitting on that mod after the qm 2 midterm,btohqsg
they showed me some of the notes,btohqsg
dude the MCQs were crazy hard,btohqsg
Wait what mcq did they test?,btohqsg
If they repeat good for you,btohqsg
If not good luck have fun,btohqsg
im lazy to take qn 10 because qn10 is a very obv qns that everyone should get,btohqsg
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FIRST INDIAN QN? üòÇ,btohqsg

I WAS SO READY TO PUT DOWN RAMEN SPECTROSCOPY,btohqsg
lol look at QM2 lecture 5's topics,btohqsg
i aint even at qm lect 2,btohqsg
but yeah you showed me a glimpse the other day,btohqsg
well my point is it's all about angular momentum and hydrogen atom,btohqsg
yeah i think the seniors are complaining this mod should be taken after learning qm2 or something,btohqsg
tbh idk why they don't make a mod that focuses on integrating stat mech and CMP since those two are alr v related,btohqsg
I have to be honest right,btohqsg
App of qm is literally waste of time,btohqsg
I would have more time to study qm 2,btohqsg
And here is the shit part,btohqsg
They basically removed all the crystal parts,btohqsg
wasnt there some stat mech in thermal as well,btohqsg
It is literally prof nelly mod 2.0,btohqsg
just that none of it was tested (thank god),btohqsg
Cmp is more than just that,btohqsg
Cmp is about like crystalline structure,btohqsg
cmp focuses more on crystal structure  then band theory,btohqsg
condensed matter really just means the study of crystalline structures,btohqsg
Also pinaki say he going overseas,btohqsg
Is app of qm prof going overseas also?,btohqsg
(i dont even know how our app of qm prof looks like),btohqsg
Well I know they are all guys uh,btohqsg

Hey everyone!What do you do when there is a train service disruption during your national examinations?In the event of a train service disruption during your examinations  it is essential to be well-prepared. You may refer to instructions for PSLE and GCE-Level Examination candidates affected by a train service disruption from SEAB‚Äôs website.Alternatively  you may refer to this link:https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/train-disruption-advice.,btohqsg
EWL services will continue to be disrupted tmr,btohqsg
There are so many cops at Buona vista,btohqsg
I think there are more cops than SMRT people,btohqsg
good that they announced early tbh,btohqsg
sounds like another grab day to pulau ntu,btohqsg
but i'm conducting midterm lol fuck,btohqsg
where's iestin. should've asked to crash his room today,btohqsg
#PSAüö® No train service between Jurong East and Buona Vista stations tomorrow  26 Sept 2024.As there was extensive damage to the tracks  more time is required to do the necessary repairs and replacements. We will also check all first-generation Kawasaki Heavy Industries trains overnight  before they are put into service.‚û°Ô∏è Check out this visual for info on the alternative travel options tomorrow. Thank you for your understanding.,btohqsg
Very unfortunate for those taking PSLE.,btohqsg
5 teens have been arrested after footage of a Qihua Primary School student being assaulted by an older boy emerged online earlier this week.https://cna.asia/3MZS9jQ,btohqsg
#PSAüö® There will be no rail service between Jurong East and Buona Vista stations tomorrow  27 Sep.We explored running a shuttle service between these stations to restore partial service. However  as this would slow down track repairs  we will prioritise repairing and restoring full service earlier.SMRT is aiming to resume normal operations on Monday  30 Sept 2024.‚û°Ô∏è Check out this visual for more info on the travel options available during this period.Thank you for your understanding. üôèüèº,btohqsg
Around 17 000 youth in Singapore were not in school  work or training last year  representing 4.1% of youth in the country.Mr Fabian Ang was once a troubled youth who dropped out of secondary school. Read about how he found support:https://str.sg/Cvke,btohqsg
whoever this is  i feel both pity and admiration for you,btohqsg
plus r u honestly that free wtf,btohqsg
How was yall guys grad for the sec 4/5s,btohqsg
$50 for a grab is no joke. anyway ntu students don't have class next week so if he was alr done with tests then yea he's that free,btohqsg
but the shuttle bus at buona vista  it's efficient even if it's not fast,btohqsg
on my way back (buona to jurong direction) today around 1900 hrs  people taking the shuttle to jurong east were made to queue in 2 lines to enter the bus,btohqsg
and by the time my shuttle departed  there were 3 ewl shuttles behind also queueing and waiting for boarding,btohqsg
even if the journey itself is slowed overall  I think the response was quite good,btohqsg
I mean  the sustainable response is fixing the derailed train,btohqsg
just now otw back on grab past clementi,btohqsg
fr? it was quite packed when I was going back,btohqsg
shuttle/bridging buses more consistent now i tbink,btohqsg
ya i think it was like 7.40pm,btohqsg
if you look back on the day or the day after the incident of the EWL disruption itself  it was probably more hellish,btohqsg
it's been 2 days at least now,btohqsg
ya I was quite shocked when I couldn't go back to the ewl,btohqsg
at the time they bridged between buona vista and boon lay I think,btohqsg
i am fortunate enough to be able to avoid disruptions lol,btohqsg
but tbh the bridging service is confusing,btohqsg
so is thr a boon lay queenstown direct,btohqsg
but it was damn packed  at buona it's empty  then at dover you can't even get on,btohqsg
now no  only buona to JE,btohqsg
oh then the shuttle thing ah,btohqsg
but two days ago it was bridged over a longer distance,btohqsg
but i hate to say that should be normalized in the event of such disrupt and that a backup plan that gets put into action last minute,btohqsg
now the MRT shuttle train bridges boon lay and jurong east,btohqsg
not a big problem  except it 3-4x the usual waiting time,btohqsg
east side losers such as me be like,btohqsg
at least those near to EWL's east side,btohqsg
then there's me travelling paya lebar to boon lay,btohqsg
LOL today I did bugis to lakeside,btohqsg
bugis -> outram park bc fsr train service ended outram park,btohqsg
then buona -> JE shuttle bus,btohqsg
i just grabhitched ahead of time,btohqsg
mind you it's all the same green line,btohqsg
bc i scared got any delays,btohqsg
i think how smrt handled it,btohqsg
tbf it's baffling that they kept a 1st gen train around,btohqsg
Th only reason why this derailment was such a prob was because the detailed train damaged tracks,btohqsg
afaik trains if maintained properly can last v long,btohqsg
There were 2 seperate cases of derailment before  one was a controller error  the other was faulty train,btohqsg
1997 a Maintenance train derailed in the tunnel along toa payoh and in 2014  two carriages under testing derailed at Bishan Depot to be specifc,btohqsg
i hate that shit like this happens in sg and thrs like no transparency as to how they're gna improve or anything like that,btohqsg
If you look at the SMRT CEO comments from the 1997 incident  you can see the stark contrast in difference of how derailments are handled,btohqsg
"The most potent example is how they used ""derailment"" in the newspapers",btohqsg
The shift from being transparent to the public has definitely been shifted,btohqsg
that wasn't really the main issue(the way the gov department LTA & SMRT) handling the aftermath incident in such a way that people found major issues when seeing this matter on a deeper level (detailed)to which you've answered me time to type out what's the more major concern,btohqsg
Guys n lvl is elmab3 right?,btohqsg
actually its fixing the tracks  specifically the third rail in order to restore power to trains between Jurong East and Bouna vistathe train is not on a active line which could hinder services there is still a depot in tuas where trains can be sent if servicing is needed since the current train derailment has blocked the ulu pandan depot from being usable,btohqsg
so it's mainly the rail that's the problem?,btohqsg
is it just that part of the track  or across the whole map?,btohqsg
part of the track  thats why they only shut off the portion of track after bouna vista and resume operations after jurong east station,btohqsg
it's EMAB2 (EL + MA + best 2),btohqsg
But my prelim results show emb3 aggregate,btohqsg
The main thing they have to do now is to fix the parts of tracks broken along the route from Bouna vista to Jurong east.Then after  fix and restore the power of the third rail.,btohqsg
EMBA3 N(A) version which works on the same level as L1R4,btohqsg
