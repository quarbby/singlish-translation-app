rosberg win his first trophy he fly off alr,btohqsg
I'm not ready for another RB dominance tho hahaha,btohqsg
their one year enough for us to retire,btohqsg
It's as boring as Hamilton's 2019 season,btohqsg
every race ownself play ownself song,btohqsg
the way that feller drive is go big or go home,btohqsg
best part the team don't want to tell him it was stroll that hit him,btohqsg
As part of its recruitment drive since rebranding  Aston Martin has hired a number of high-profile staff members through the paddock  including Red Bull's former head of aerodynamics Dan Fallows.,btohqsg
Hahaha funny sia that part üòÇ,btohqsg
he carry ball all the way one,btohqsg
yes he is a hero at fucking me,btohqsg
Alonso knows how to ankat one leh,btohqsg
thats one of the things i don't like about him,btohqsg
his teammate is the small boss ma,btohqsg
No talent  there because his father owns the team,btohqsg
he finish top 10 yst for what,btohqsg
remove the S and he's just a Troll,btohqsg
if fast they winning championships alr,btohqsg
but he battle the mercs yst,btohqsg
he finish podium w williams in 2017 and 2018,btohqsg
he‚Äôs not likeable but u can‚Äôt deny he has talent,btohqsg
He couldn't beat the mercs ma  but he got injury  so give him that lor,btohqsg
according to alonso  he is championship material,btohqsg
His podiums are after the top 6 all gone,btohqsg
he finished with bottas in 2nd‚Ä¶,btohqsg
All redbull  ferrari and merc crashed,btohqsg
lucky he never curse at who ever hit him,btohqsg
2017 baku gp ricciardo finished first and bottas second,btohqsg
what did you say about top 6 all crashing? üòÇ,btohqsg
With a faster car  he should be la. Alonso beat both merc and ferrari,btohqsg
i expected ferrari to do better,btohqsg
alonso is a double world champion,btohqsg
stroll has a rich dad and split the mercs,btohqsg
if that is talentless then idk ah,btohqsg
Stroll's 3 podiums  2 of them shared with no one in top 3 teams,btohqsg
only his first podium in azerbaijan  yes he's there with daniel ricc,btohqsg
he took pole in a wet turkey,btohqsg
but i rather see stroll win then max,btohqsg
You wanna argue he has talent  nvm i'll give it to you that he has some talent,btohqsg
lets see first 3 race how first,btohqsg
the frustrating part about him is,btohqsg
haha bro i‚Äôm not arguing i‚Äôm just putting out pointers,btohqsg
he constantly lose to his teammates,btohqsg
if one has no talent how they make f1 and stay there for so many years,btohqsg
and his teammates are often the ones without a seat,btohqsg
cos his father owns the fucking team,btohqsg
his team mates world champions leh,btohqsg
Perez was in limbo for awhile before RB signed him,btohqsg
what did stroll do to u sia,btohqsg
Ocon was seatless for 1 year,btohqsg
it's a good thing Lawrence bought over the team and made it better than it was,btohqsg
I would say  lawrance is a business man,btohqsg
He invest  he will make it work,btohqsg
imo Stroll did perform pretty well this season opener even though he just came back from an injury and missed testing,btohqsg
but he did make things work,btohqsg
since photocopy didn't work  better to pay the guy who made it,btohqsg
money doesnt make things work bro. but it keeps you alive for longer. lol,btohqsg
Which is what he's doing what,btohqsg
He outlasted his teammates who are clearly better than him,btohqsg
best driver of all time will still be Yuji Ide üëç,btohqsg
definitely being the boss' son has its privilege but i think Stroll has proven himself to stay. he's not the worst driver on the grid. and if he really was  i think his father would definitely remove him. like you said  he's a businessman.,btohqsg
money buys me a triple cheese burger,btohqsg
i tot the patty will be thick like the commercial... end up thin thin only,btohqsg
i dont like their beef de... but the improved version is nice,btohqsg
i love double cheese burger  but its too small  need to eat two.  Now 1 can already,btohqsg
First season he raced 2018  Lost to sirotkin whole season. Kept his seat and sirotkin lost his.2019 he went into racing point  kicking ocon out of his seat and ocon was seatless for the year. lost to perez whole season2020 Lost to perez whole season  perez lost his seat.2021 and 2022 he lost both season to vettel  but you'd say Vettel is a 4 time world champion. Fair,btohqsg
tat one 3 bites finish liao,btohqsg
who ask them don't have a rich daddy,btohqsg
He didn't have to prove that he has talent to beat anyone. He just needed to keep up,btohqsg
He didn't lose to all his teammates by 1 or 2 points. It's significant. Many times team mates finished in top 10 in standings  he's not.,btohqsg
Rookies coming in year after year doing better than him sia,btohqsg
there are drivers that teams pay to win  and there are drivers that teams get paid to keep,btohqsg
he is still a rookie to me,btohqsg
And his jr career also not that special. He didn't even race in F2,btohqsg
It baffles me that people actually supports him  but nah  other than daddy's money. He's quite trash tbh. There are better racers out there more deserving of a seat.,btohqsg
so who do you pick mazaspin or stroll,btohqsg
at least makeaspin is fun to watch,btohqsg
So maybe i'll pick that one,btohqsg
If we faster we wont be sitting here kaopei them alr,btohqsg
i don't understand how while driving you adjust brake bias and stuff,btohqsg
I can do it in sims la.,btohqsg
well  we nv get in the car before... u nv know,btohqsg
They do have specific dials just for braking  so can just roll on the fly,btohqsg
But i think it's crazy to nail it corner after corner,btohqsg
while driving perfectly to the lines,btohqsg
ya need alot of focus... i play f1 game  halfway cannot focus liao... sometimes just drive straight and miss turn,btohqsg
and they don't have green line on the floor that turns red,btohqsg
2018 he scored 6/7 points for williams,btohqsg
maybe i should put some effort into doing up a sim rig,btohqsg
Sirotkin out-qualified Stroll at twelve of the twenty-one races.,btohqsg
Maybe 2018 doesnt say much cos sirotkin also quite bad. He crashed so much he cannot convert positions to points,btohqsg
but he didn‚Äôt finish ahead of him lolol,btohqsg
i feel if u don‚Äôt like a driver,btohqsg
very hard to see eye to eye,btohqsg
There's nothing to like about him,btohqsg
there is ah but that‚Äôs just you haha,btohqsg
rest of us think he has talent and can drive soooooo,btohqsg
i think he has some talent... but can't drive,btohqsg
lolol ya that was q funny,btohqsg
I am sure i am not the only one bro,btohqsg
why the hate sia he never do anyth to u also ü§£,btohqsg
talentless i think he won‚Äôt make f1 no matter how rich,btohqsg
okay there‚Äôs rich drivers in f2 like gelael his father owns all of kfc in indonesia or smth,btohqsg
but no f1 cos talent not there,btohqsg
Cos his father havent reacht he point of buying a team for him,btohqsg
He almost joined F1 when KFC sponsored Toro Rosso,btohqsg
But the deal didn't make it,btohqsg
if i remember correctly you need to be within a certain amount of time from the fastest guy in quali to race,btohqsg
so if you too slow  can't race also,btohqsg
I've nothing against him  I just think without his father  he wont be in F1 alr,btohqsg
cos many faster drivers lost their seats cos of him,btohqsg
Ocon and Perez are 2 very big examples,btohqsg
If you wanna believe Vettel's retirement is real  then you can don't count.,btohqsg
I personally believe he left AM cos of the stroll family too,btohqsg
you look at Vettel... with the beard and all.  It was time la,btohqsg
the feller doesn't even clean himself up,btohqsg
i used to not like Stroll too. but times and opinions change. can see the improvement la. cant discount that.,btohqsg
after he left i think he shaved and became like the old him again,btohqsg
he honestly looked more like a tennis player then a F1 driver last year,btohqsg
i think he did improve also,btohqsg
But i still think he's wasting a seat in F1. LOL,btohqsg
there are definitely faster drivers out there. They just lack exposure  funding  opportunity etc.,btohqsg
can give to charles Leclerc younger brother,btohqsg
And stroll have the benefit of everything cos of his father,btohqsg
lost faith in Leclerc when last year he was almost begging the team to ask sainz let him pass,btohqsg
cos big teams wont sign him,btohqsg
He's stuck with his dad to build a championship car,btohqsg
But he have to beat his own teammates first,btohqsg
which he hasn't done so yet,btohqsg
he knows where he's at. he won't be looking outside too. so lucky they got a good car this season too,btohqsg
I'd say  alonso got lucky he got a good car,btohqsg
We shall see this season la,btohqsg
See if stroll can change my opinion  or your opinions,btohqsg
He have a proper car now  can he consistently beat the better drivers in the big teams,btohqsg
he know de... he rather not be in f1 den to get a horrible car,btohqsg
i just hope Ferrari picks up. lol,btohqsg
But you want to see real talents in F1  there are rookies that came and proved themselves  like lando  russel and charles.,btohqsg
"Stroll has never done anything so far that made people think  ""wow he's good  but in a shitty car""",btohqsg
russell will be top sooner or later,btohqsg
lando use F1 game to practice hahaha,btohqsg
I think he alr is. I think he's better than bottas  and he's almost as good as hamilton  or maybe better,btohqsg
He just needs a car that can perform,btohqsg
ya he in 2nd car so might not get upgrades,btohqsg
downshift problem but still flying away üòÇ,btohqsg
