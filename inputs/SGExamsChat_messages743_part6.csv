Some measure related to sus growth,btohqsg
this is based on what ive seen,btohqsg
Many of my EJ friends jumped from S/U in prelims to C/B for A Levels by just memorising answer keys,btohqsg
my friend still doesnt understand the difference between demand and quantity demanded,btohqsg
I rmbr you said sth like your schmates just memorise answer key after prelims then they got a for a levels,btohqsg
yeah this is the rarer few,btohqsg
A i would say still need to like,btohqsg
I just tell all those who ask me to think of it as demand as the whole curve whereas Qdd refers to a specifc price level,btohqsg
I wish NSFs can get time off for retaking As,btohqsg
If I actually retake Econs I rly donâ€™t wanna use my vacation leave,btohqsg
Also pls manage your time well. For essays  2 mins per mark. For csq (full 30 mark qn assuming you h2)  allocate about 10-15 mins for reading the extract  2-2.2 mins per mark for answering qns,btohqsg
itâ€™s only out of 16 :(,btohqsg
Are you a h2 Econs student?,btohqsg
yeah itâ€™s just bc itâ€™s wa,btohqsg
H1 has a little less time,btohqsg
Ah ok  so should only be csq,btohqsg
If itâ€™s your first then donâ€™t need to fret so much  the scope is usually very small,btohqsg
Idk go eat or maybe go for a walk,btohqsg
better stay home and sleep in,btohqsg
Actually eggs despite the high cholesterol,btohqsg
Got some study that shows ppl who eat them have a slightly longer life expectancy,btohqsg
I wanna eat tamago sushi now,btohqsg
So itâ€™s still every odd Thursday hbl?,btohqsg
Good thing ac didnâ€™t remove hbl,btohqsg
Some schs like sajc after covid they removed hbl day,btohqsg
I can finish up with my work after a hectic day of cca on wed,btohqsg
Nice so you got long weekend thanks to hbl and Good Friday,btohqsg
i found out someone from my cohort is in this gc,btohqsg
he got a B for a level econs,btohqsg
and he did the DD/SS microqn,btohqsg
maybe cause he smoked it v well?,btohqsg
cuz normally he gets 16/25 for the macro essay,btohqsg
Do u think it's borderline B,btohqsg
Anyway if the boy joins this gc and i suddenly go inactive,btohqsg
He never got more than a S back in EJ tho,btohqsg
Damn but a B despite not knowing that,btohqsg
he was so happy he got more than 20,btohqsg
yeah  I can finally get my beauty sleep,btohqsg
my soon-to-be overdue maths assignments and bio tutorials: nuh uh womp womp skill issue,btohqsg
Do u eat it hot or cold,btohqsg
the custard egg in caipng is the best,btohqsg
sprinkle a bit of salt rite,btohqsg
ok if there's pork inside then it sucks,btohqsg
i like it without the meat,btohqsg
as some vendors say its meat price,btohqsg
I feel like thereâ€™s no difference besides the size,btohqsg
I want to see how an ostrich egg tastes like,btohqsg
"FR getting scammed "" eh auntie I thought I oni buy 2 veggie 1 meat ? Why so ex """,btohqsg
BRO IF THERE'S PORK IN THE EGGS then is it considered meat alr ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
the vendors gonna start adding meat into the veggies alr,btohqsg
