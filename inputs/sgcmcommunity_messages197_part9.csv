Would say its more heng suay and depending on what model you r buying. Big authorized reseller such as republic auto  sime darby etc might sound authetic but their checks are also kinda poor. Higher in price and lesser goodies such as free servicing and warranty given,btohqsg
If u r buying the traditional honda toyota bmw mercs all those ok to go. But if ur brand is nt the common ones then go to other dealers that focus on selling those,btohqsg
oh thanks all! i planning to get either toyota or honda bah hahah probably an suv for baby seat,btohqsg
if its me i take skoda tho,btohqsg
At least rav4 drivers not so c b,btohqsg

Harrier overpriced. Vezel need pick carefully to avoid phv. Newer FL vezel interior more spacious. Chr don bother. Interior space cmi. Unless u wanna ur LO get clastrophic,btohqsg
CHR is the dumb sporty crossover experiment that was way more popular than it deserved,btohqsg
Imagine sitting at the back of the hybrid when the phv driver doing his 0-100 pedal pump. 🤢,btohqsg
Huh even this also 16k depre,btohqsg
Im a sucker for VW so I say GTI,btohqsg
oh what other cars would you recommend other than suv?,btohqsg
Technically all 4 door cars fit your bill.,btohqsg
Honda why dont want fit? Or jazz,btohqsg
Good for first time cause small  cheap to buy and to maintain,btohqsg
Essentially it depends on ur budget. Suv is good but the rear space r smaller than mpv. But mpv is risky coz toyota and honda mpv = commonly used for PHV,btohqsg
Bro same vezel n chr also risky,btohqsg
