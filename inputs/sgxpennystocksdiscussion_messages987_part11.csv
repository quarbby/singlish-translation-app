The advantage Chinese have is that most of anything is made here. With little inflation and lower costs without export costs  they've been enjoying most stuff cheap. With so much local produce and economy slowdown  even produce remains super affordable. Only the imported stuff may cost more but I get alot of imported stuff like cheese  dark chocolate etc and I can tell you keto diet in China is way cheaper than in SG. I eat walnuts daily and use imported Avocado/Olive oil for daily cooking too. But my maid does cost 2-3x as much. A full time live in maid can cost $1500-1800. That's the main downside.,btohqsg

But speculation drives prices up. No speculation means prices come down. Who benefits? People who need a home. Who doesn't? Those who own more than one probably. I thought it was a stupid move but it did stop the ridiculous prices.,btohqsg
