"JUST IN - Hamas threatens to execute civilian hostages and air each execution via live television.Abu Ubaideh  military spokesman for Hamas‚Äô Al-Qassam brigades: ""Every targeting of our people without warning will be met with the execution of a civilian hostage. Each execution will be aired on live television for the world to see.""@disclosetv",btohqsg
They took and killed american hostages...Gaza is going to end up like syria,btohqsg
Actually it runs deeper  because Iran is involved as well,btohqsg
At least a dozen countries have blood on their hands in this conflict,btohqsg
Turkey and Qatar both contribute funding to Hamas,btohqsg
From Malaysia (The cherry on top)https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-malaysia-became-a-training-ground-for-hamas,btohqsg
this channel ‚Äòs commentators are toxic af,btohqsg
This war will be complicated..the most shocking part is Qatar is leading hostage swap with Hamas,btohqsg
The Us did it to Syria and nobody really bothered,btohqsg
cuz the Hamas leader prefers to stay in Qatar which is more conducive,btohqsg
Qatar is talking on behalf of Hamas to swap hostages with Israel,btohqsg
ik but they are residing in Qatar too,btohqsg
"Yea..thats why you realise the US want to control both Iran and Turkey so badly. Because they are both ""transactional"" countries that supply firearms to america",btohqsg
the one that is happy with the war is living in qatar while the citizens suffer. what an ‚Äúamazing‚Äù leader,btohqsg
hamas shld rot in hell for killing thai(s). wtf did the thai(s) do to them even,btohqsg
southeast asia is alr being split apart Malaysia and Indonesia are on the Hamas side Phillipines  Singapore and Thailand are on the israel side,btohqsg
ya  so the ASEAN agreement is bs?,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs why sg is sort of neutral rather than heavily backing,btohqsg
pretty much  i mean..our neighbours been training hamas soldiers literally,btohqsg
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/world/asia/hamas-mossad-malaysia.htmlYou cant tell me malaysia is not enabling hamas,btohqsg
well malaysia wants the war to stop too,btohqsg
Hamas and Malaysia literally had a agreement to let this Senior hamas member learn from malaysia about weapon technology that would later be used in Hamas own attacks,btohqsg
yea  so malaysia is indirectly responsible for this,btohqsg
investing in gaza is a waste of money especially for qatari(s). there ‚Äòs no roi at all. rather  the infrastructures built will be destroyed & they will have to build it again,btohqsg
They say neutrality to end conflict..but instantly choose side,btohqsg
Hamas doesn‚Äôt represent Palestine & the religion that they think they act upon. they make both look like shit,btohqsg
I think they will get repercussions not just from Israel,btohqsg
they deserve it cuz they are done for  no need to hear them giving Muslims a bad name,btohqsg
it is supporting now..but after knowing that malaysia has been sheilding hamas..you cant be sure if they do support hamas,btohqsg
i dont think they think its a bad decision to shield hamas,btohqsg
their economy says otherwise. KL have v cheap hotel rates & ringgit keeps dropping,btohqsg
they literally invited hamas to their capital,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs what they deserve i guess. karma at play. now leaning on China for more support,btohqsg
malaysia have nth much to offer anyways  other than being a cheap hotel supplier for those finding sg too expensive as well,btohqsg
this is what corruption does to a govt..everybody is too money minded and care too little for its people,btohqsg
their Putrajaya city is a waste of money. extremely empty place to live,btohqsg
model city for who to see,btohqsg
its so i can shout to u,btohqsg
I wonder how chaotic the parliament is,btohqsg
More like they don‚Äôt have the funds to support more months,btohqsg
üíÄ 51K sgd as minister each year üòÇ,btohqsg
how to go to war if ns only 45 days?,btohqsg
Can you imagine becoming the minister of your country and earning 50k a yr,btohqsg
They prob gonna do testing on this batch first,btohqsg
If all goes well  they likely gonna extend,btohqsg
I wonder they are planning to fight with who,btohqsg
Bro looks happy for his work,btohqsg
pretty sure its a hell to memorise,btohqsg
they haven release timetable for us sia,btohqsg

imagine texting random ppl askibg random questions,btohqsg
I saw squidward so I text bruh,btohqsg
is weird to sudd text ppl like that,btohqsg
Anyways guys yesterday I did some big brain maths,btohqsg
Have to crank inflation to a max,btohqsg
This is just your entry job  so it‚Äôs actually possible to earn enough for a house,btohqsg
Yea it does  I did not account for bank interest,btohqsg
I crank the food spending to $20 a day,btohqsg
But yea so guys it‚Äôs not doom and gloom here it will just take at least 20 years to get to a point you can buy a apt,btohqsg
1.7k is a entry level job that don‚Äôt require much in terms of education  so obviously earn more you will acquire your house faster,btohqsg
no leh i got a lot of ppl txting me also,btohqsg
that‚Äôs how i make frens with a lot of them üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
ok my telegram is being retarded wtf!,btohqsg
to me is kinda weird unless i talked to u b4,btohqsg
why is it sending as third person pov,btohqsg
do u mean the other msg,btohqsg
oh u retarded yes ofc üòªüòªüòª,btohqsg
it seems to be a bug,btohqsg
Have had it for s days alr,btohqsg
Oh ya domino's pizza 5 dollar only,btohqsg
bro theres smth called bank loan,btohqsg
Yea I know but it you want to fully pay off,btohqsg
I made a pond in sch,btohqsg
nah i know its not ok  but as many say 1.7k is like bottom of the barrel type of salary,btohqsg
like kuro is alr so depressed,btohqsg
Thats why the income is 20.4k but bank only has 16.32k..Because of cpf,btohqsg
The expenditure i choose was $20 a day for food and $50 a month for medical,btohqsg
this is just the stats of a single,btohqsg
Yeah Ryan u only live half the age of 45 eh,btohqsg
Now u might not be tired,btohqsg
But once u go out there,btohqsg
But at 45 years old its the price to buy a 5 roomIf you want a 3 room  its possible 10 years before at 35 with HDB loan which just so happens fit directly into the govt plans,btohqsg
at least im somewhat planning for a future,btohqsg
but yea this will def be better,btohqsg
i accounted that for the fact you have 1.7k a salary for 20 years,btohqsg
others have told me to start with 2k as a starting salary..even,btohqsg
im ready to yeet myself of earth,btohqsg
@SagenanamichinesBruh my calculation had a fatal error lmao,btohqsg
I overestimated my income by 8x and underestimated my expenses by 8x,btohqsg
I saw 720K on food i was like,btohqsg
yep did the maths  after 20 years..you will have around 200K in your Bank and 160K in your CPF,btohqsg
u forgot to account for inflation,btohqsg
Fixed it  inflation was accounted for by 1.7K a month for 20 years,btohqsg
I don't see the price of the hdb,btohqsg
they have money..tf im giving them money  i mean if i dont rent i got a extra 200K im saving..if they need some i can give them,btohqsg
i mean yea but like i said..if i decide to stay 20 years with my parents..i got enough money to spend on them,btohqsg
the idea is solely off CPF you can get enough money to get a 2 room at 35 with grants,btohqsg
Maybe it is slightly faster with a raise,btohqsg
housing price inflation isnt regular inflation,btohqsg
ur hdb is gonna cost 1mil+ in 2040 lol,btohqsg
singles can only buy a 2 room from the govt...they dont need a 4/5 room,btohqsg
im talking abt 2 room hdbs,btohqsg
unless you talking resale..which make no sense,btohqsg
cos saf is filled w skivers like@chemcer,btohqsg
1 mil for a 2 room...inflation struck harder than hong kong,btohqsg
they shld pay nsfs more üëø,btohqsg
20 years ago the 4 room HDB im in now was at 250K+,btohqsg
The same type of apartment fully furnish cost about 700K-800k now,btohqsg
So a 3 room in 20 years..prob would be like the cost of a 4 room now on resale,btohqsg
red flags study/teach/cleanse themselves in physics everyday,btohqsg
just reduce that by 25% and you‚Äôve got green flag,btohqsg
but its gonna rise back up,btohqsg
@chemcerCan you make a NS version of this copypasta,btohqsg
How to avoid telling people my major?When people ask me what my major and school is  I'm hesitant to say. It's probably rare for them to be graced with the presence of a student at the top cs/ engineering school (NUS) in singapore  the no.1 in Asia. Especially a cs major  the major with the highest cutoff and the most prestigious program at said school. I feel a bit guilty  as meeting someone so much more accomplished  yet their same age  probably crushes their self image.How do you guys go about avoiding the question  or what other major do you usually say?,btohqsg
1000pax get into nus cs every year and this guy wants to flex,btohqsg
How to avoid telling people my rank?When people ask me what my rank and formation is  I'm hesitant to say. It's probably rare for them to be graced with the presence of a graduate from the top most elite Officer Cadet School in singapore  the no.1 in Asia. Especially a commando officer (Lieutenant)  the appointment with the highest cutoff and the most prestigious program at said school. I feel a bit guilty  as meeting someone so much more accomplished  yet their same age  probably crushes their self image.How do you guys go about avoiding the question  or what other ranks do you usually say?,btohqsg
by the time we reach 45,btohqsg
wait kenna medical stuff then how,btohqsg
then if you want to start a hobby,btohqsg
it‚Äôs not feasible to live like this,btohqsg
8.6K a year$700 a month to spend on whatever you want after accounting for expensesFood is counted at $20 a day  $600 a monthMedical is at $50 a month,btohqsg
@immaslothWith Rent  your Bank balance is like 5k after 20 yearsIncluding Insurance  it will cost $24K...Means you are in the negativesWithout Rent and living with parents is like 86k after 20 years,btohqsg
ngl i alr finding it hard currently can‚Äôt imagine 1.7 i will jump,btohqsg
if salary 1.7K for 20 years...Pap wont rule anymore  trust on that,btohqsg
I gave a allowance of $20 in my calculations a day for food,btohqsg
how worth 1.7K will be 20 years frm now.,btohqsg
Give or Take after 40 years...you have 40k in your bank to do whatever you want,btohqsg
true if it‚Äôs me i will just jump sua say no more,btohqsg
i took 1.7K for 20 years...salary will increase but i took this constant because i wanted to account for periods of unemployment and inflation,btohqsg
ya rent is crazy now üò≠,btohqsg
Honestly this is the best method,btohqsg
just work 10 years while staying with them for 10 years,btohqsg
at 35  you will be able to own your own 2 room,btohqsg
1.7 i think u whack grab food also earn more than that,btohqsg
lets jst say  what if our parents wants us to move out as quick as possible,btohqsg
how r we supposed to survive on 1.7k,btohqsg
the point im making with these calculations is that you wont be homeless,btohqsg
yea sg quite bad for this kind of scenario because they fall into the crack,btohqsg
i literally gave a scenario of someone that is as lazy as it gets,btohqsg
that's like my monthly dividend amt now üòÖ,btohqsg
keep in mind 1.7K/month is just 200 above the requirement to rent from the govt,btohqsg
I SAY WHY HE DIE NOT DID HE DIE,btohqsg
i used to survive with $900/mth when staying with parents before having kids üò≠,btohqsg
now  mainly reits. Last time I dunno how to buy,btohqsg
but now my biggest is Keppel Corp I think,btohqsg
oki i guess i go sleep now  not knowing what i opened my phone for initially,btohqsg
If i did the calculations for 3k..you can own a 2 room at 35,btohqsg
just as how the govt wants you to,btohqsg
ah no wonder got 2 dead bodies at keppel bay üôÑ,btohqsg
last time I also like to do a lot of calculations,btohqsg
I would rather live a comfortable life,btohqsg
I calculate save 50k a year. Very idealistic situation,btohqsg
i wonder how my sch gave permission for the news on how my classmate died when i was in sec 2,btohqsg
then constantly stress on paying the bills,btohqsg
I find the excel file ah,btohqsg
bruh it was like the 3rd day of sch,btohqsg
I alr know 3 ppl who aren‚Äôt even here anymore,btohqsg
my 15 years ago calculations  that if can save 50k a year for 7 years  can retire slowly,btohqsg
oops meant to say I love stemi adore it,btohqsg
cldnt even bring myself to read the news after the incident,btohqsg
the brain cells require doesn‚Äôt equal to pay tho,btohqsg
that time I worked like 80 hrs a week on 2 job,btohqsg
is just become a science teacher,btohqsg
steady income and decent career progression,btohqsg
now i dont even know whether i shld still continue to be in stem,btohqsg
my students were like: Cher I think you spend more time a day working than us studying,btohqsg
then got passion and also steady income,btohqsg
but im only intrested in life/applied sci,btohqsg
find a hobby that can profit from,btohqsg
the first few years of work and saving will form the bedrock of your financial foundation,btohqsg
I bring in 300-400 monthly ish,btohqsg
i think u continue wif ur fish can alr,btohqsg
I literally just let them breed and feed them,btohqsg
note sustainable to sell fish unless as a side hustle/out of my house,btohqsg
hey better than my rp ant collector,btohqsg
bro catches  buys and sells ants,btohqsg
nah you dont need to  i was just thinking about the fact so many people said that i will have to work till i die and cant retire before i can get a apartment,btohqsg
The main point was to tell people that you can own a house before you retire...because a bunch of people been claiming with the rise of everything they cant,btohqsg
3am thoughts compounded by pass reddit views made me create it,btohqsg
agree  first of all  a person with an income of 1.7k shud be looking at a 2 rm flat,btohqsg
you cant buy anything except a 2 room...if you dont consider resale,btohqsg
thats why i was puzzled when you say i did not account for inflation,btohqsg
i did..and that was how i accounted for inflation,btohqsg
fella now 1.7k after cpf alr hard to survive bro,btohqsg
1.7k in 2045 gg bro hahaha,btohqsg
1.7k in 2045? u work kfc 5/h ah,btohqsg
doesnt matter  cuz 1.7k cannot afford anything more lol,btohqsg
that was the average in 1990s  20-30 years ago,btohqsg
u can pay over 25 years if u really cannot afford to pay high mthly installments,btohqsg
1990s hdb is how much  now hdb how much u tell me,btohqsg
I legit dont understand what yall points are..cause my point is literally simple. You can afford a apt before you retire,btohqsg
its that simple  idk why yall been expanding and exploding all the points,btohqsg
theres always and will be a way to afford a home,btohqsg
This person basically sums up very well the point of the conversation,btohqsg
that was literally what one of the commenters said,btohqsg
depends on the type of post  some post will attract the less civil people,btohqsg
X_X science practical tomorrow and can't sleep  only got 1 hour  taking another melatonin,btohqsg
Good luck! Remember to wake up,btohqsg

He prob got in after o‚Äôs,btohqsg
u can be advanced (with some condition) or promoted btw,btohqsg
Anybody know what exactly does the commando vocational assessment entail,btohqsg
Why does it take a whole day,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt fat people get accepted into commando too,btohqsg
I plan on just flunking the fitness assessment,btohqsg
if u don‚Äôt want to go just tell the interviewer ur totally not interested  as long as u show abit of interest they want to take u liao. if not u can also flag yourself for medical review by MO and tell him u don‚Äôt want commando then he will say ur not fit for commando and send u on ur way home,btohqsg
yea when they start right they give u like 30 mins to fill out a personality questionnaire and then u must declare all ur medical conditions,btohqsg
then the commando commander come down and give a talk about how the commandos are about and etc,btohqsg
then after that for those with medical stuff u need to go see the MO who will ask u like how long ur injury and are u interested etc,btohqsg
Luckily it was easy  I should've secured it,btohqsg
CaCl and CuSO4  it was blue at the start lmao,btohqsg
And physics was just some simple forces,btohqsg
Guys how was d combined sci prac,btohqsg
guys the first qn for the chem,btohqsg
turn white to light yellow and when left to cool it turns back to white,btohqsg
Just look at the person infront or Bessie you,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt put turn white back,btohqsg
some guy melted his solid A,btohqsg
i just said turned pale yellow,btohqsg
The Physics the graph curved up right,btohqsg
HOW DID U GET A CURVED GRAPH,btohqsg
i know my gradient is 0.65,btohqsg
guys the gravity what yall put,btohqsg
i fucking nutted when i saw it,btohqsg
the physics one was fun though,btohqsg
A least not electricity  lamina or the optical pins,btohqsg
so what y‚Äôall do for physics,btohqsg
boring = i feel like fucking dying,btohqsg
I get 26 points I damn happy alr,btohqsg
what the rod measurement for y‚Äôall,btohqsg
The L/M and F/N both must be constant?,btohqsg
mine were in intervals of 0.7 and 0.6,btohqsg
how rhe hell did you even manage a curve,btohqsg
L/M     F/N0.100 0.300.200 0.360.300 0.430.400 0.500.500 0.560.600 0.63,btohqsg
The error thing i also fked up,btohqsg
Is it micrometer or vernier caliper,btohqsg
Probably getting less than 10 for both papers,btohqsg
When I took my physics o levels‚Ä¶I forgot how a vernier works,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the comb sci bell curve ah,btohqsg
I rmb not knowing any of formulas for physics and just multiplying a bunch of numbers,btohqsg
Got a C6 still tho by sheer miracle,btohqsg
They clarified it earlier this year,btohqsg
So I need fall in 5% to get A2-1,btohqsg
The solution B & C I just copy tge table,btohqsg
Wait they say need write ‚Äúno observable change‚Äù right,btohqsg
Half of it is me cancelling,btohqsg
I would be the happiest man alive if I get c6 & c5,btohqsg
But I never see then I go and write no visible change or reaction observed,btohqsg
Imagine taking a combined sci paper with no removal of common last topic  can‚Äôt be me,btohqsg

hi uh is it okay if i kinda advertise myself here?as in  i make music and I need more listeners so if you guys could try my music out it would mean a lot to me,btohqsg
Do you stand to make a profit out of it is the real question lol,btohqsg
well  not really but ig if i screw up Os it'd come as a backup plan for earning income or smth like that,btohqsg
but currently i make my music for fun,btohqsg
i just released a new track today and it's kinda my experimentation of trying to make a LoFi track  so i just need some reviews on how it is so i can continue from there,btohqsg
used to make lofi when i started now i (unfortunately) make dubstep,btohqsg
i actually make electronic but im trying out lofi that's why,btohqsg
i meant like direct message me but ok,btohqsg
i never had a song called that,btohqsg
thats like my email from lower sec,btohqsg
if you have to ask  the answer is yes,btohqsg
rly thought this day wld never come,btohqsg
wait so like h1 vs h2 for like chem and bio,btohqsg
h2 u have prac and more topics isit,btohqsg
Alexandra Hospital (we no longer send patients there),btohqsg
yea but it‚Äôs not like if you take h3 then you don‚Äôt take h2. you do well in h2 in j1 then you can add on to also take h3,btohqsg
the content leans more to uni stuff but some subjects like physics or econs can take as a short course under ntu/nus instead of a moe syllabus,btohqsg
i take h3 then i drop my h2 to h1,btohqsg
so i take only h1 and h3,btohqsg
I‚Äôm curious do y‚Äôall send patients to IMH instantly,btohqsg
my area is too far from IMH but idts,btohqsg

Don't do what I did tho,btohqsg
don't take georg in JC la,btohqsg
Coming from someone who took Econs in JC 22 years ago  I can safely say that basic Econs knowledge is really super useful in life. Basic Econs + basic accounting knowledge from taking a module in Uni... bestBut ok  not a fair comparison as I stop Georg after S2.,btohqsg
Geog rly isn't as bad as ppl say it is,btohqsg
scoring for it  and real world application of it  is different,btohqsg
Study for Georg  study for Econs  have very big difference in being able to score?,btohqsg
All I know about georg is S1 and S2  study about rocks üôàüòÇ,btohqsg
