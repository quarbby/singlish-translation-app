Each year has their own grade boundaries,btohqsg
Iâ€™m thinking that there will be separate bellcurves for 9757 and 9570,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m doing 9570 next year,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not sure if theyâ€™re pre determined before a paper or after theyâ€™ve marked and can tell the students performance since thereâ€™s many conflicting sources but they do use grade boundaries that are adjustable each year for each subject,btohqsg
Basically grade threshold for each year and subject is different regardless if thereâ€™s a syllabus change,btohqsg
So it could be 68% A for econs this year and 71% for 2023 H2 econs etc,btohqsg
New syllabus also added new stuff like cognitive bias and a slight change in the way of marking if Iâ€™m not wrong and removed some stuff like 1st and 2nd degree price discrimination,btohqsg
Ohh cool  I just started learning about cost of production,btohqsg
So you at market structure now?,btohqsg
Is it MI start macro first,btohqsg
Like Hc ny vj they all do some macro before doing market structure,btohqsg
Then complete rest of macro later,btohqsg
Yup  SCOC -> Dd Ss/Elasticities -> Govt Intervention/Market Failure -> SOL etc  macroeconomic goals -> policies,btohqsg
How did they change the marking?,btohqsg
