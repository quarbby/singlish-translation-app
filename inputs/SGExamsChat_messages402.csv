Or does a lawyer merely needs to communicate,btohqsg
no need differentiate the clients chances of going jail,btohqsg
there is sure some sort of analytical skills involved in law  but that is also included humanities subjects,btohqsg
Competitiveness will definitely increase  not because of within SG  but because our neighbours are progressing at a very fast rate,btohqsg
hate to break it to you but not really,btohqsg
That's because you are only considering the learning of subjects at their surface level.That isn't the purpose of education.,btohqsg
I feel that Singaporeans are generally good in math because it's a step by step basis  like  you see this qn  what method do I apply. whereas in gp/humanities subj  you really have to think it thru and apply analytical skills,btohqsg
Wait pocoyo random but everytime I look at your pfp I will think that it has a short flat hair,btohqsg
u need to fix my hair now,btohqsg
yeah this is true i kinda got tired of math cos the way it was taught to me is like memorize how to answer this kind of qn,btohqsg
so i ended up sucking at math then now i doing social sciences,btohqsg
How do you want me to fix it,btohqsg
I memorised for GP to achieve a 2 grade jump between A level and retaking at 2nd NS.,btohqsg
guys thanks for debating with me  I love killing time by using my brain,btohqsg
how does one memorise for GP,btohqsg
memorization can get you the grades but not really improve ur writing/analytical skills overall,btohqsg
like our of all the possible topics ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
First  I systemised it to step by step as well. For essays,btohqsg
But my method may not work for others,btohqsg
see exactly  you're the taking the math approach again,btohqsg
yes  and I can get A for it. So it works,btohqsg
what did you get second time,btohqsg
that works for a level stuff but i dont think it'll work for uni and beyond,btohqsg
2nd time  scored A. English proficiency = NS languages,btohqsg
i have 3 mods this sem that require 3 different kinds of essay writing,btohqsg
as much as people say dont study for gp,btohqsg
it doesn't work for high level maths too,btohqsg
the question i did came out 3 times,btohqsg
gp method definitely wont work when u have to go write research papers in uni,btohqsg
cos its no longer memorize example go then write explanation,btohqsg
But fr leh your.pfp is like an illusion to me bruhhhhhh,btohqsg
I bought this guys notes on carrousell,btohqsg
what are your opinions of me memorising 0 examples for geography,btohqsg
so many better things to spend time on than studying for gp,btohqsg
Eh first of all ours is no bidding  just first come first serve (for non electives). Yea last time a lot of times when you try to register  the server will overload lol then must keep trying until the end of your time slot. But last year they finally forked some of the functions to their own server so it‚Äôs way better now. Not perfect but better,btohqsg
to be honest  once I got the system  I only really went for 4 private 1 on 1 lessons for GP,btohqsg
i did that for my econs for my ib exams but tbh i walked out not learning anything like i memorized most of the textbook for the exams but then after the exams i just throw away and forget everything alr,btohqsg
I got someone to mark my essay,btohqsg
And for GP  only really focused on 2 things at that time. One of it was terrorism.,btohqsg
fuck I accidentally applied for a full time job HELP üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Odds are you won‚Äôt get it anyway,btohqsg
And if you do get it just reject lol,btohqsg
OH YA WAIT I SEND U SMT,btohqsg
GP comprehension  I reverted to primary school comprehension method  with some paraphrasing here and there.That was another difference between my first and 2nd papers,btohqsg
Eh simple enough. Just change the hue only,btohqsg
i feel replicating is what causes students to fail,btohqsg
ksbull is fine it's just that most students aren't even close to the skill level required to balance word flow and logical flow,btohqsg
It is the same reason when students look at worked solutions.It is never the solution that helps. It is the thinking process behind getting the solutions.,btohqsg
also checks and balances along the way,btohqsg
On the surface level  it is follow this and that method.That shouldn't be the case,btohqsg
I want be necklace maker. tbh. 48k sound like good pay.,btohqsg
i feel smart ppl dont always do well,btohqsg
Replication works  but not by copying the answers.Need to replicate the thinking process.It applies for any subject. Or any job.,btohqsg
The idea is that you need to be able to get from step 1 to the ans on your own in the future even if the question changes,btohqsg
Even in my current research we apply that idea,btohqsg
at least can survive by myself.,btohqsg
i learnt more from answer sheets than from school notes,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I always made my own notes in uni,btohqsg
Notes are there to introduce you to the topic and the basic applications. Not really possible to go in depth too much.That's not the objective.,btohqsg
where I noted down my own interpretations  etc,btohqsg
That's why textbooks are good for introducing a new subject/topic/concept.But to do well  it's another approach.,btohqsg
or how I go about understanding smth,btohqsg
the power of active revision üëç,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs not like I just copy stuff from the textbook and expect it to stick. I go through concept by concept  think through it  make sure I get it and then write it down in a way that makes sense to me,btohqsg
yeah your brain cant remember HAYDFQWIEFHBVWALF,btohqsg
i just want to retire and smell the air,btohqsg
if you wanna learn physics then learn lor,btohqsg
But really learning physics involves learning lots of math,btohqsg
but when you imagine for every 10 years  there are 3650 days  and if you eat 3 meals a day  it is 10950 meals.Each meal average $10 with drinks and inflation factored in  one needs $109500 for every 10 years just for meals.,btohqsg
I would love for you to teach me that but now seems a little too late HAHA as sem 1 is ending :'),btohqsg
unless you aim to eat white bread everyday,btohqsg
its pointless that economies are so focused on productivity,btohqsg
like in pursuit of productivity they just go higher and higher,btohqsg
Sometimes CNY spend more per meal. Sometimes celebrations.So give and take average $10 per meal I think is fair,btohqsg
what if in the name of economic growth they use dead bodies and keep them alive to increase productivity,btohqsg
i spent a lot of ns money on food,btohqsg
scarier if you think of it this way:From age 25 to 85  there's 60 years. If prices stay the same as now  you would need ~$660k just for food.And a sufficiently big HDB for 2 adults 2 kids is at least $400k now.So for 2 adults and a HDB and 2 kids (assuming feed for 20 years)  the couple would need to earn about $2.16 million over their working lifetimes.,btohqsg
3k a month x 30 years = $1mil,btohqsg
it should be double that over 60 years,btohqsg
1.03^60 = 5.89 actually. So more than double.,btohqsg
It is interesting if you try that amount into CPF.Most people will actually hit the retirement sum by age 55 if they work all the way.,btohqsg
3k a month is about my stipend lol,btohqsg
replace the 'children expense' with your bills and insurance expense,btohqsg
you know as I look out of my window  I see different type of houses  condo  landed hdb.. just imagine the different type of stories and backgrounds that we have that makes this little community,btohqsg
ok ray we get it you don't want kids but u get no bitches to begin with,btohqsg
In fact  skip the HDB too. Just leech parents can liao mah.,btohqsg
only forever single people can understand other people who will remain single for life. so,btohqsg
I mean it depends cos if it‚Äôs BTO there‚Äôs like HDB loan  but for condo you‚Äôre usually limited to bank loans,btohqsg
then how do you pay back to loan,btohqsg
saw a property agent video on youtube on Malaysia bungalow. Going for $660k ringgit,btohqsg
dunno leh  i only see a bit  skip liao,btohqsg
my grandfather bought his house for 90k ringgit,btohqsg
would you sacrifice benefits in sg and retire in malaysia if have nice house nice food nice car can go vacation and see children just drive to sg,btohqsg
But I know my ex colleague  recently went back Malaysia bought a terrace and a car.And I know by now  his salary and position won't exceed $6k monthly because he still young.,btohqsg
why not bring your sg car there,btohqsg
why not take car to johor then bus in sg,btohqsg
also my mom also says it does take forever,btohqsg
considering how mahatir wants a one msia policy  yea....,btohqsg
you know the countries are developing which means in the far furture they would surpass us by very large margins,btohqsg
like malaysias potential is larger than that of sg,btohqsg
but just they are hella dumb,btohqsg
politically correct statement:SG depends on you young people.,btohqsg
they are a disgrace to muslims around the world,btohqsg
Hey guys do u have any resources for esterification IA?,btohqsg

My mood when I see tis,btohqsg
I remember my dog in my grandfathers place made the neighhbours cat pregnant,btohqsg
What is a good Gift to buy maid,btohqsg
cross pollination of the pussy egg and the dog sperm,btohqsg
something from where they're from is always nice,btohqsg
and really depends la  cos my helper likes dressing up on off days so my mum used to get some nice (not too ex) clothes,btohqsg
My maid doesn't like to go out on off days tho,btohqsg
She just stay in the house and play games with us ( me n my brotherssss),btohqsg
eh just smth that reminds her of home would be not bad then,btohqsg
like if she hardly goes out then she likely don't usually get those,btohqsg
And my parents thinks I'm being vvvvvc generous,btohqsg
I just felt like she deserve btr,btohqsg
i mean yea this is very generous,btohqsg
like if they've been with you for super long etc,btohqsg
cos people more impt than money,btohqsg
ahhh yea just get smth good then,btohqsg
I think as a parting gift hor,btohqsg
Like my parents gave my helper of 10 yrs ard 2 or 3k,btohqsg
As her angpao for getting married,btohqsg
But she kind did raise my sister ah,btohqsg
I mean like 10 years yea,btohqsg
my helper of like 2 years,btohqsg
Like at that point of time she was more or less part of the fam,btohqsg
she sent me a voice message and called us like how she used to call us then  but now we're like teenagers and all and my sister also not a tiny whiny baby anymore so it's q funny,btohqsg
it feels like they raised us la,btohqsg
I think that helps them out more than anyth,btohqsg
yea tbh just giving ang pao is probably better than anything you can think of,btohqsg
you give smth big also they must lug back,btohqsg
i mean that's generous but if my helper worked for 15 years with me,btohqsg
nowadays also hard to find helper that will stay that long,btohqsg
you can adjust however much you think is appropriate la,btohqsg
I wanted buy laptop for ger,btohqsg
Then she can discord call us,btohqsg
personally i wouldn't buy those bulky electronics cos she also need to lug back,btohqsg
and you will not be there if she has issues with it,btohqsg
Imma party in your house too,btohqsg
Then came out with a brand new ipad phone and laptop,btohqsg
My life is a neverending party,btohqsg

The Cat Museum and Kitten Sanctuary are under the same owner.,btohqsg
I am just curious which jc do most minorities go,btohqsg
Like hwa chong and ny dont have alot,btohqsg
So do they go raffles or ?,btohqsg
cos my brother thinking of a jc which is not all chinese,btohqsg
then shouldn't the first barrier be his O's score,btohqsg
I saw a reddit post jn,btohqsg
how important is this factor to him,btohqsg
but the cons seem like shit happens,btohqsg
not sure for jc but there's a fair distribution of Malays in ri and rgs based on my knowledge,btohqsg
Seems disproportionately skewed to ri and vj,btohqsg
i don't hear shit from ejc,btohqsg
Since feeder school is chij and cat high,btohqsg
idk anytg that we don't know,btohqsg
so they don't even have a life now ok,btohqsg
At least 10 percent minority ah,btohqsg
eh u j what I forgot,btohqsg
she's actually gone hee recent was 1 month ago,btohqsg
Only hv 1 or 2 indians here and there,btohqsg
Hvnt went bck in a while ah,btohqsg
just hci and ny dont have i think,btohqsg
The only malay who ik went ny is that cs uncle,btohqsg
I heard they tryna get but no one want come,btohqsg
as a Malay   as much as I study chinese  I'd be too scared to go hci,btohqsg
the school that doesnt care if you retain,btohqsg
i see a guy beside me also and he makes my heart go bedok bedok,btohqsg
Lol what is non Chinese in dhs,btohqsg
My sis last time tjc say got decent proportion of non Chinese,btohqsg
Would yall ever migrate out of singapore,btohqsg
work in MNC in sg > us,btohqsg
My cousins say americans were more acomodating than sgprns idk,btohqsg
he got a gf there also,btohqsg
i Finna get shot if I were there,btohqsg
I feel sg very boring ehh,btohqsg
i just wan play real life gta there,btohqsg
if I were to go there for a month or so idm,btohqsg
they have a different societal culture,btohqsg
i have a ton of american friends,btohqsg
and many of them can't wait to get out,btohqsg
They have a car for 20th birthday,btohqsg
owning a house is a pipe dream in some states,btohqsg
cars can be cheap there because they need it to get around,btohqsg
they also have the land to accommodate it,btohqsg
look at Singapore; u walk 10 mins reach mrt,btohqsg
part of why ours is so expensive is to minimise the number,btohqsg
u go there u walk 3 hours mrt also dk go where,btohqsg
I see their life also so mice,btohqsg
ofc they show u the brighter side of life,btohqsg
grass always greener on the other side lol,btohqsg
Like they go road trip all,btohqsg
OHHH I TOT U MEAN MIGRATE WAH BV SO MUCH MONEY SUDD AH,btohqsg
but if I were given the opportunity,btohqsg
i might migrate but it'd be to europe,btohqsg
If I migrate  with the fam,btohqsg
OUH SHIT NUS NTU NO LONGER 10,btohqsg
lol it's based on multiple sources. we were never top 10,btohqsg
I think I don't study also can,btohqsg
you're talking about the high potential visa right,btohqsg
I shall not say any further,btohqsg
I dont think nus ntu is top 50 in terms of students though,btohqsg
it's global top 50 non-UK unis then,btohqsg
Like its just facilities for sure,btohqsg
NTU is currently ranked 19th on QS  NUS 11th i think,btohqsg
but rankings are always skewed on research,btohqsg
We def not like top unis of other countires,btohqsg
but u don't follow me- I think I go cry,btohqsg
i mean the requirements of us entering local uni are wayyyy lower,btohqsg
Like the standard of these students are like those foreigners in nus ntu,btohqsg
but partly it's cos US has many universities to accommodate weaker people  and the top unis have the ability to be more selective,btohqsg
nus and ntu go there work pretty much,btohqsg
but singapore is  either u go priv or u don't go at all,btohqsg
They should have this in sg,btohqsg
many US universities only exist because they were built before regulations were there,btohqsg
we also don't have the land and capacity for it,btohqsg
I think the average person is capable,btohqsg
there will always be a need for arbitrary cutoffs,btohqsg
bro relax it's only 10+ floor,btohqsg
but how much more expensive is it,btohqsg
cant be 100k more ex right,btohqsg
oh stfu plz don't expose plz don't expose plz don't expose,btohqsg
I wish we had a coutryside,btohqsg
cheapest i've managed to find regarding penthouse in sg is like 1.2 million,btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ my mother say when you go uni  me and papa go buy house at sixth ave what's this,btohqsg
only heard of masionette idk how to spell omg,btohqsg
they go sixth ave while I stay in,btohqsg
i mean HDB ones aren't even proper penthouses,btohqsg
and maisonettes still cost up to a million,btohqsg
actual penthouses gonna run you at least like 1600 per square foot,btohqsg
entire sgexam chat group buys 10 sq in Malaysia,btohqsg
NTU takes up land that no one else wants,btohqsg
Can buy the house outside nus,btohqsg
Q boring only 3 major uni,btohqsg
i stay paya lebar and will be travelling to NTU for 8 years,btohqsg
when are the rest gonna become reputable like smu,btohqsg
I heard sutd becoming reputable now,btohqsg
You want to rent a room in my house? I live in front of NTU  Lol,btohqsg
do you really? one of my friends live at city harvest church there lol,btohqsg
come entire sgexam go rent ur house,btohqsg
While I on the other hand will be travelling to Pasir Ris Camp and Hendon for the next 1 year and 10 months  from in front of NTU,btohqsg
that friend of mine had to pick between NTU and SUTD for his PhD,btohqsg
Me begging to get to OCS so I can have some time to SAFTI instead,btohqsg
imagine travelling to SUTD every day,btohqsg
nah in the end he chose NTU again,btohqsg
Well  my Mom actually is renting lower than the market rate - $800 for 2 person,btohqsg
and at least sutd is quite near to bedok area tamp so at least got...city vibe,btohqsg
yea NTU must take one of two buses,btohqsg
but they building MRT there now,btohqsg
I like how I live furthest in the  West and NTU is just a link bridge away,btohqsg
Wait we can walk into campus,btohqsg
As well as SAFTI  Jurong Camp and Pasir Laba camp,btohqsg
we set 2042 h2 chem paper,btohqsg
Go there for Masters instead  First Class Honours  let's go!,btohqsg
the JW side on the left,btohqsg
yeah this guy on reddit say math A range is 67 to 73,btohqsg
they say start opening in phases 2026,btohqsg
eh where's Jurong point ah which mrt,btohqsg
by then i finish my phd alr,btohqsg
Why do these kind of questions exist?,btohqsg
nabei why iw work also so difficult,btohqsg
like i said  ntu takes the land on the west no one wants LOL,btohqsg
