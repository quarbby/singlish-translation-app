Guys is it me or...this volume is still soft for me,btohqsg
"Pes E still can claim that you ""served"" the nation...even if you really did not ""serve"" per say",btohqsg
No im in grave as we speaking,btohqsg
that a bc can end up on the wrong side of the road,btohqsg
I find it out at 1 alr,btohqsg
i think my ear got problem,btohqsg
yea that is the volume in my ear,btohqsg
cause i just realised  my volume is at 70,btohqsg
just checking whether its too loud,btohqsg
cause my friends and family always have it around 20-40 and they said it loud alr,btohqsg
im at 70 and barely hear anything,btohqsg
anyone wanna try inviting taylor to perform at school for free,btohqsg
honestly...if ronaldo can visit a JC. Idk why ppl be out here thinking that taylor is unlikely to visit a MOE school,btohqsg
They shud have a twist to it,btohqsg
no i want to hear the boom boom pow,btohqsg
or go concert n hold up banner saying perform at (insert school),btohqsg
I read this as my sec cher name,btohqsg
Wasnt there a poll that wanted to send Taylor swift to go perform at a school for the blind and deaf a few years back,btohqsg
sound like a make a wish thing,btohqsg
imagine paying $37 for a piece of cardboard,btohqsg
or you just end up like this guy,btohqsg
that is him in the pfp when he was younger💀but he is like sec 2-3,btohqsg
I rem I had a crush in sec 4 and during the English olevel paper she was like a seat on the front right of mine,btohqsg
Lol why are we surprised when singaporeans are willing to pay $118k for a piece of paper,btohqsg
all the occasional drivers using the car sharing services all noobs one lol. always see them on mothership roads.sg  sg road vigilante  etc. getting into all kinds of accidents,btohqsg
i got see once. the driver just move out of parking lot alr mount the lot’s kerb lol,btohqsg
Tbhfam aft I got my p-plate I realised why saf has compulsory vehicle cmdr,btohqsg
yeah. drivers are generally stupid tbh. even i experienced several near misses myself thanks to other drivers,btohqsg
why ppl buy car? like if it’s a rare car sure. but normal cars? why cannot lease ?,btohqsg
some stupid person idk how  i was driving on the main road so close to the side road alr and some p-plate driver insist on merging onto the main road and i have to ebrake and swerve my car to avoid crashing into him,btohqsg
u can actually buy COEs w 2 years left,btohqsg
only downside is  canot get leased for first car if uw drive asap after u get license,btohqsg
I think mostly its either for kids or elderly parents who cant get arnd by themselves then they need longer than 1-2 yrs,btohqsg
bc my parents 2 years iirc,btohqsg
idk fam the only reason ppl gave me to own a car was fam,btohqsg
I’m aware that’s why i wondering why ppl buy cars,btohqsg
Ye i just ended p-plate year tdy  I also so far only drive at hrs when ik the traffic is lighter,btohqsg
I mean thats why I hv the p-plate right,btohqsg
Literally its to warn everyone else I got skill issue lol,btohqsg
i just drive during peak hour,btohqsg
yeah but some drivers idk how they got the p-plate in the first place. how did they even pass tp test and drive like that on the roads lol,btohqsg
Oh some tp testers only mark a mistake once,btohqsg
Then others will mark repeat mistakes again for each repeated,btohqsg
like…i think all drivers  even p-plate ones  should know that if there is a car on the main road very close to you  you should not be merging from the side road onto the main road. basic common sense leh,btohqsg
im on carmart..ppl selling a merc the same price as a toyota cause of coe,btohqsg
might as well just keep changing cars,btohqsg
lol risk dying to save 2 seconds,btohqsg
I mean literally all sort of cars...simillar pricing,btohqsg
If coe left <1yr why bother liquidating,btohqsg
can still use as grab vehicle,btohqsg
Ik some ppl strapped for cash but the demand is so ridiculously low,btohqsg
lol tp test alr so lenient. “never check blind spots” free penalty for 2 times. imagine you never check blind spots 10 times but since tp tester only mark once it’s still free and that’s how when the driver eventually get onto the roads  stupid accidents happen lor  caused by bodohs not checking blind spots when merging onto main roads,btohqsg
Tbh my dad keeps telling me to rely on side mirror otherwise I risk swerving,btohqsg
Idt the car swerves that much but he says that,btohqsg
depends on the angle that the side road merges onto the main road i guess  i use either side mirrors  blind spots or both,btohqsg
I check blindspot if side mirror reads inconclusive,btohqsg
let’s say for this road  which i had a near miss caused by a driver from the side road  very hard to rely on blind spots alone  you need to turn your head like 180 degrees lol,btohqsg
I look q far which is why my dad scared I accidentally swerve,btohqsg
so you have to use your side mirrors to see also,btohqsg
oh i hate these type of roads,btohqsg
especially when you got high af barriers on that island,btohqsg
Wait we're taught to check mirrors be4 blindspot wat,btohqsg
I cant see in the pic,btohqsg
Imagine driving at night...you cant even see if there is any car merging into your lane,btohqsg
Shag bro guess I'll stay away frm Eunos roads,btohqsg
So end up all the cars that leave the expressway have to poke their vehicles... pass that zebra crossing,btohqsg
They legit not supposed to stop horh,btohqsg
2 lane merge...into active lanes that they cant see for shit,btohqsg
the outer lane is suppose to merge to the 2nd lane...but then here come the rumbling bus,btohqsg
and block both lanes from even moving,btohqsg
imagine this scenario...what you gonna do,btohqsg
depends lor…if perpendicular your mirrors tell you nothing lol,btohqsg
When u take the test  your assessor is king,btohqsg
If the assessor lenient then liddat lorh,btohqsg
no..but you see the kind of roads i passed by for nearly 11 years,btohqsg
i can judge if a road is good for drivers or not,btohqsg
eunos..has some of the complicated roads  you will ever drive on,btohqsg
i a bit confused…u r saying the vehicles need to stop before the zebra crossing to see if there are vehicles on the main rd ah,btohqsg
These two vehicles are stopped at the correct place,btohqsg
that motorcycle is doing something dangerous,btohqsg
you can see  the blue motor is about to cut infront of the sienta when the coast is clear,btohqsg
Worse intersection in Eunos  all the diff coloured lines show where each driver could potentially go...all have traffic lights,btohqsg
Its so bad  when you see this picture...you have no idea who has the greenlight,btohqsg
This picture will speak for itself  Guess which direction you cant go from this intersection,btohqsg
yup because if a car was here...you have no idea where its going. It also crosses the intersection when its clear,btohqsg
either direction it moves...you basically cant move anywhere except turning left,btohqsg
Then i thought the traffic lights should be programmed in a way that at any one time no paths should intersect,btohqsg
the purple car has no traffic lights to follow,btohqsg
haha then if it’s green light with no arrows you can either go straight or turn right if it is safe,btohqsg
The blue light..maybe?  the yellow light is useless,btohqsg
cause the traffic lights are too close together?,btohqsg
i mean  just look at the delusional lights you are seeing,btohqsg
GG  tdy my friend learnt he has a Hidden Mod,btohqsg
hellooooo anyone received ts code n  going to ts concertt? i need help buying tix 🙏 🤲,btohqsg

Not even surprised if thats a real bus in malaysia,btohqsg
If I get any tickets i wld probs scalp them so its better if I dont get my grubby hands on em,btohqsg
Tbh  ts tickets not worth esp the vip ones . Its just to let the singer and her crew earn the money only .,btohqsg
I need them on WhatsApp pls,btohqsg
Scalping is the worst type of investment I've ever seen,btohqsg
Even if you can get high returns,btohqsg
No one going to buy 10k,btohqsg
The diff is that the items have abundant availability even if you bulk purchase,btohqsg
Scalping takes away things that are in high demand,btohqsg
A legal form is called flipping,btohqsg
You buy a damage product fix it to look presentable then sell it as a new product,btohqsg
Manufactured it cheap from china sell to US,btohqsg
can't wait for C151 themed busses,btohqsg

For some reason when I do like a crazy smile the migrane isn't that painful,btohqsg
ohh dengue ah. i experienced bef. usually within 1-2 days the fever will quickly drop to around 38 but only after it drops will be the worst phase,btohqsg
How painful is the critical phase,btohqsg

Dk. Dengue symptoms vary very widely,btohqsg
But you will usually feel like shit,btohqsg

It’s a joke. Anyways my friends in the queue. No. 12.,btohqsg

You thought that was bad  wait till you see the prices of the merchandise,btohqsg
One shawn Mendes shirt was $75,btohqsg

Anyone heard of ZBSchools? Is it useful for improving my Chinese?,btohqsg

here we hv 2 notorious patients whom i heard never failed to go hospital 2-3 times a month,btohqsg

SGH barred one of them iirc,btohqsg
Bruh I heard from one of my army friends that someone cycled through hospitals to stack mc’s,btohqsg

To the point the hospitals were notified to not give this  guy any more mc,btohqsg
ngl it is abit disturbing to me,btohqsg
like why tf wld u talk abt life and death in a lc passage dawg calm down,btohqsg
Ryan’s deep thoughts:National Service’s intention is not to instill a sense of pride for Singapore  not to instill a sense of purpose formales.The intent was to act as early intervention to help sway the mindset of young males away from their most vulnerable time to fall into a life of crime.,btohqsg
dei u go serve NS then you'll know the true purpose,btohqsg
this chat has basically become NS talks..so why not contribute one more,btohqsg
u havent enlist u talk sm for fuck,btohqsg
"cause for me  going through experiences people said was ""bad"" sucks..etc did not change my perception so what makes you think i will change when i do enlist?",btohqsg
as much as something can sound illogical to you  don’t have to be rude.,btohqsg
how does one say so much genuinely thinking hes an intellectual yet manage to sound like theres nothing inside his head,btohqsg
but doesn’t mean you can throw offensive words like that,btohqsg
u say stupid or what sure,btohqsg
its like a sec 2 kid writing an essay anout nietzsche and his relation to nihilism,btohqsg
oh ure That kind of person,btohqsg
u must b fun at parties bro,btohqsg
I know more about the effects of discipline  not really anything bout NS. hence why its a deep thought,btohqsg
nvmm no point arguing about what words to use and what not to  this isnt the us,btohqsg
i swear i need some self peservation in my life...but dang its tough when you are in a poly that nobody wants to be in,btohqsg
ryan when will u learn to defend yourself seriously that’s one thing i will never understand about you,btohqsg
there’s certain things you should and shouldn’t say as a decent human being,btohqsg
doesn’t matter if this is US or singapore,btohqsg
there’s also no reason to call somewhat that when the whole point is to insult and ridicule,btohqsg
like what are you trying to achieve?,btohqsg
"this is one reason why i dont ""defend"" myself",btohqsg
i know the hard r is abit tough,btohqsg
no the thing is he doesn’t even see that people are calling him stuff and continue talking.. ryan open ur eyes and defend yourself.. if u do i will buy u $500 worth of hotwheels 🙏,btohqsg
receiving flak isn’t the same as being insulted personally,btohqsg
i don’t even have $500 btw,btohqsg
ive received criticism from my classmate that i did not have proper form  i shall restart 😍,btohqsg
who has 500 after the taylor swift shinnenigans,btohqsg
like bro i’m lost by half the shit you say but the most i’ll do is say you’ve lost e,btohqsg
uh not me  i didn’t buy the tix brother john actually instead i earn $$,btohqsg
if you discipline someone  the chances of that person starting to conjure some sort of ill towards you is very high,btohqsg
i actually sold my account bc it was approved 🎉,btohqsg
$0 loss but maximise profit 📈📈,btohqsg
nvm forget it  i cant find the words to articulate correctly,btohqsg
i will use siyan’s phrase ‘uve lost me ryan’,btohqsg
somehow redditors know what im saying tho,btohqsg
ns killed my discipline and drive but ok…,btohqsg
i mean this in the nicest way possible but i’m not friends w you ryan so it just means i’m not in a position to try and push you to be better. and yet i’d still appreciate being told if i fucked up in saying smth,btohqsg
oop ns.. will slowly leave the chat once again,btohqsg
How do i know if my dad's account is gg through fraudulent charge,btohqsg
