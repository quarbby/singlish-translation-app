rp wise is okay for my coirses,btohqsg
My friend didnt get considered at all for these with 87.75,btohqsg
So i assume u gotta get at least 88,btohqsg
Make sense uh it seems like the cop of 88.75 min. For nus merit/ny scholarship,btohqsg
So if she/he gets at least 88.75 then dont need worry,btohqsg
Now covid19 maybe it delayed maybe coz they need everyone do travel declaration before they go  and need match which interviewee to which interviewer (if its a physical interview)  or if not  change needs time,btohqsg
i think all interviews are online now,btohqsg
Maybe they need time uh coz the profs need to cope with all these sudden changes to their exams/assessments these few weeks,btohqsg
They keep changing so its not easy for the profs too,btohqsg
Same to you all brothers and sisses,btohqsg
If my FI can be awake so can u,btohqsg
How nice of u to say that !,btohqsg
What if we merge them like zoids in power rangers,btohqsg

Due to lack of other things happening,btohqsg
I have no life outside telegram and NS thanks to cobid,btohqsg
Me when a command to double up is given,btohqsg
U r technically talking about NS,btohqsg
We need to redefine NS as being Neil Sxxxxx,btohqsg
The same way we cannot tolerate intolerance even though that would be a contradiction,btohqsg
But No NS would mean No neil,btohqsg
Which wasnt part of my deal,btohqsg
It sounds good until u realise that would mean ure jobless,btohqsg
Children need to sleep 9h a day for healthy development,btohqsg
@ferrelcelli am sorry your parents didnt allow u to sleep longer,btohqsg
No wonder u have brain dmg as u were growing up,btohqsg

I uh oh the poll results,btohqsg
Arise! Ye who don‚Äôt want to be slaves!,btohqsg
Can't believe capitalism is defeated by a virus,btohqsg
Where am I going to find a great mind then?,btohqsg
uh oh operation coldstore 2.0 coming,btohqsg
everyone in this group are now associates,btohqsg
A dead mind that no longer exist,btohqsg
Brain for sale! Brain for sale! Auntie Uncle ah your Son eat this pig brain PSLE score cfm 300 ah!,btohqsg
If u can find a brain that is,btohqsg
Imagine those 1500 members who don't talk here at all get stopped on the streets and arrested for being part of a communist conspiracy,btohqsg
trying to apply for temporary relief cause all my students dont want lesson,btohqsg
Hahaha it wasn‚Äôt your decision to make in the end lawl,btohqsg
find sugar daddy/mommy then no need work,btohqsg
U working full time already har,btohqsg
That would be considered work I think,btohqsg
is it just me or does LHL look cuter the older he gets,btohqsg
i cannot work all my student stop lesson until end of circuit breaker,btohqsg
Barter trade also can  body for money,btohqsg
now i have problem finding other means to earn money,btohqsg
Imagine walking to MSF and telling them that you applying cuz you can't be a sugar baby anymore,btohqsg
Haiz... next week onwards gym closed,btohqsg
Workout at home can never compensate for strength training  it's only for maintenance,btohqsg
Just maintain until gyms open again,btohqsg
To make sure you don't lose muscle mass,btohqsg
pretty sure calisthenics can get u jacked,btohqsg
i train my core muscles by sitting all day,btohqsg
I train my mental by looking st jay tan explain stuff,btohqsg
U need to be self-employed or employee bounded by a contract affected by COVID,btohqsg
Its not cannot  but lets say if u got sacked by ur boss cos of last friday news  you can try.If you lost business as a self-employed individual running a registered business/company that pays tax to the government  u are also eligible.Freelancers are not applicable  since they dont fall under in any of the above 2 technical categories,btohqsg
But im quite sure they are eligible for another grant too  maybe thats why the above doesnt apply,btohqsg
Property rental rebate technically also a form of relief,btohqsg
my parents propetry rental nvr relief,btohqsg
cuz their landlord took it on behalf of them,btohqsg
Its legislated to pass on rental rebates now,btohqsg
So in other words if they still dont  u can sue them,btohqsg
When u put Bingo on your instagram stories do people fucking care?,btohqsg
My stories average 200 views but not one fella replies :( even when tagged,btohqsg
I particularly watch out for squares that I dont expect the person to tick  but that person ticked  to talk more abt it haha,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs see the privilege to underprivileged ratio in SGExams here. Bingo = privileged. I didn‚Äôt bingo. In other words  me plebeian.,btohqsg
to clarify  I don't support PAP but I don't support anyone else either,btohqsg
You dont have to share your card if you dont want to  just say whether you bingo-ed,btohqsg
coz some of the sq quite sensitive,btohqsg
how is having a pet privileged,btohqsg
thats like saying some homeless people with pets are privileged,btohqsg
and its not a boomer telling me that its a zoomer,btohqsg
the only actual sensitive one is the top right box and middle bottom box,btohqsg
wait left middle box is sensitive too,btohqsg
what is middle to upper class,btohqsg
how is being an adult a privilege,btohqsg
oops I forgot to circle the healthcare,btohqsg
some places life expectancy is low dude,btohqsg
you'd be surprised at how much NS culture perpetuates sexism and misogyny,btohqsg
if anything being a child is a privilege  who the fk wants to be an adult,btohqsg
paying bills and taxes is not a privilege,btohqsg
It's a privilege to STILL BE ALIVE,btohqsg
my sergeant taught us how to carry an injured soldier in a certain way  and he jokingly added that this is also how you carry a drunk woman from the bar home to ****,btohqsg
being alive is a RIGHT not a privilege,btohqsg
lol fun fact drunk sex is not sex its rape,btohqsg
have fun dealing w the law if u fuck a drunk woman,btohqsg
"I think ""can afford healthcare"" box a bit grey",btohqsg
words that get u locked up for years and caned and fined,btohqsg
i wish i can say that in court...,btohqsg
I think those grey area box is based on your own perception,btohqsg
i would like to think that 'can afford healthcare' means you have enough savings lying around to pay for a sudden and major health situation,btohqsg
I just realised why is a tick,btohqsg
11B bornes almost all healthcare expenses,btohqsg
i am guessing nuclear family means both parents still around,btohqsg
Reminds me of how someone used his 11B to go for a surgery to remove his mole,btohqsg
nuclear family just means heterosexual parents,btohqsg
The SAF pays for your medical expenses while you are an NSF,btohqsg
It‚Äôs better to not get those medical issues in the first place,btohqsg
so being in SAF is a PRIVILEGE,btohqsg
Which the SAF can cause to happen to you,btohqsg
feeling privileged to serve my nation ü•∞,btohqsg
I'm honestly disgusted that men have the privilege of serving NS,btohqsg
I wish women had the same privilege,btohqsg
why would they use the same thing for 2 boxes  I interpret it as it is a privilege to stay in a nuclear family  if stay with extended family means poor need to squeeze in 1 residence  or stay alone  no dividing of chores at home  also sad,btohqsg
Regardless of race  language  religionand gender,btohqsg
add that to the pledge please,btohqsg
but then its a privilege until you get a permanent injury that affects you for the rest of your life,btohqsg
I am a feminist so I must speak out to include them in our national burden,btohqsg
Women should be given the privilege of paying alimony in a divorce situation,btohqsg
It's disgusting that only men have that privilege,btohqsg
then men should be given the privilege of having hold a baby in their tummy for 9 months and bond with it,btohqsg
i googled it says two parenrs with their kids?,btohqsg
It's not a burden  it's a privilege,btohqsg
Ah  but this is a choice  not a privilege,btohqsg
btw are you joking or are you serious,btohqsg
men should be given the privilege of having a ‚Äúmen-only‚Äù train carriage to ensure our safety,btohqsg
well tbh it is a privilege to experience such pure love towards a baby but im saying reason men pa y alimony is cuz of this,btohqsg
I was joking  women pay alimony as well nowadays if they're the breadwinner,btohqsg
But in the past  it wasn't the case,btohqsg
so it was a step in the right direction,btohqsg
Because women get to take responsibility?,btohqsg
pets should also pay the rent,btohqsg
I think we're still a very conservative society if we discriminate against house husbands,btohqsg
Yup  a nuclear family must have 2 parents and kids but any more than that  grandparent  uncle aunty  will void the nuclear family. Meaning no parent = no nuclear but have parents not necessarily nuclear  my interpretation.,btohqsg
because u guys dont have to carry a baby in u for 9 months and be vulnerable to illnesses cuz ur immune system is weak and ur body is not as mobile etc,btohqsg
Carry field pack for 22 months,btohqsg
i think then my family is not nuclear family then,btohqsg
i will carry and be house hubby,btohqsg
i'd rather pay alimony than carry a baby in me for 9 months,btohqsg
That means also must have menstruation?,btohqsg
Well  you can‚Äôt get pregnant without menstruation,btohqsg
i will bleed for my nation,btohqsg
Do you want be to be technical there HAHAHA,btohqsg
I think you already know what I would've said in true debater fashion  so I shall not type it HAHA,btohqsg
I'm curious about everyone's thoughts on childbearing,btohqsg
i‚Äôll volunteer to do it if its possible,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt bring new people into the world to suffer,btohqsg
In the sense that I despise and look down on parents who have children impulsively and recklessly,btohqsg
"""omg i want a baby they're so cute""",btohqsg
i think in true equality fashion i‚Äôm down to share the pain and difficulty in child bearing,btohqsg
childbearing scare the shit out of me,btohqsg
I‚Äôd rather pay someone else to have the child,btohqsg
Maybe watch a natural birth video first before u decide,btohqsg
Also  I am dissatisfied with the current attitude towards the upbringing of childrenWe need a car license to drive because the consequence of failing to drive a car properly is very severe so why do we not need a license (or to be more specific  formal training and education) to bring up a child  when the consequence of doing it wrongly is arguably more severe?,btohqsg
Driving a car is a ‚Äòprivilege‚ÄôGiving birth is a ‚Äòright‚Äô,btohqsg
I'm not saying we make parents abort the child unless they have training,btohqsg
I'm saying we institutionalise training for couples who get pregnant,btohqsg
comes down to sex education honestly,btohqsg
I'm just agreeing with this for the sake of this discussion  don't think some people should have children for the benefit of the child him/herself and for society,btohqsg
i think it is important a couple should be emotionally and financially stable before they have a kid,btohqsg
if not things like abuse and neglect happen,btohqsg
sex education isnt just about abstinence  its about how to do it safely and how to prepare for all outcomes including pregnanct,btohqsg
For financial stability  it's a little sensitive because people might think we're gating low SES individuals from having children,btohqsg
How much training would you give,btohqsg
Why is it legal for someone who is deemed too young to be driving  to make a baby?,btohqsg
just sounds like lky to me,btohqsg
His proposal is not to stop people from procreating,btohqsg
then if they get preggers too young what r u gonna do? make them abort?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs to train them after they‚Äôve procreated,btohqsg
Why can a 18 year old get pregnant  but not smoke,btohqsg
anti abortionists will kill u lmao,btohqsg
That‚Äôs literally what he said he did NOT want,btohqsg
so that the baby inside won't get affected by cigarette!!,btohqsg
honestly smart kids do the same too,btohqsg
by dumb kids i mean those w an indeveloped pre frontal cortex,btohqsg
but fetal alcohol syndrome is fine?,btohqsg
sex isnt bad  you just need to do it safely,btohqsg
it depends on what we mean by bullshit,btohqsg
abstinence can be bullshit if someone puts *** in your shampoo,btohqsg
then the only real thing that works is severing your thingy in your womb,btohqsg
people think pulling out is a form of protection,btohqsg
but most of the time its too late to pull out man,btohqsg
It's a crime and it's horrible,btohqsg
hahahaha i think y‚Äôall should be more afraid of STDs than pregnancy,btohqsg
You can get rid of a pregnancy,btohqsg
But can‚Äôt get rid of STD,btohqsg
pull out can la just track ur ovulation,btohqsg
You never know where some people put their shampoo I suppose,btohqsg
use protection to protect from STIs not pregnancy,btohqsg
thats if you know your partner well HAHAHA,btohqsg
STI can die leh of course,btohqsg
I dont think it would be viable mixed with shampoo tho,btohqsg
I take back my words  sorry  realised it was a meme after a quick Google search,btohqsg
The thought was surely hilarious though lol,btohqsg
Hahahaha ya if you‚Äôre sexually active with people you don‚Äôt know then STD or pregnancy they will run anyway,btohqsg
ya as in pull out doesnt work because you dont track ovulation of the other partner if you dont know them well,btohqsg
if *** mixed with shampoo is viable for conception  getting your girlfriend pregnant in the jacuzzi would not be ridiculous (this is a reference to a particular show  does anybody get it? LOL),btohqsg
@Hamsomy3As a debater  what are your thoughts on whether abortion is morally acceptable (putting aside legal ramifications of banning abortion),btohqsg
Abstinence is the only 100% protection.,btohqsg
u dont have to be religious to turn to abstinence,btohqsg
I guess we can segment it into the different stages of pregnancy if a blanket answer isn't possible,btohqsg
May the Holy Spirit be with you  now and always,btohqsg
Alternatively  incels are in a permanent state of abstinence,btohqsg
I don't learn morality from debate  I learn argumentative skills. < LMAO this response over here can arguably be credited to my training in debate. I learn how to argue for my beliefs in debate  not learn what to believe.,btohqsg
The true heroes of modern sexuality,btohqsg
Ok so what are your beliefs,btohqsg
Don't you change your mind when you hear something that is logically valid that contradicts your existing beliefs,btohqsg
But then again  I find it hilarious that I'm discussing and talking about morality when I don't have an internally consistent view of morality in the first place,btohqsg
I do. but I argue that this is my inherent trait  not something I picked up in debate. If being a debater is pre-requisite for your views to be able to be changed  we're doomed HAHA.,btohqsg
Same answer. I dont know where I stand tbh.,btohqsg
Rather than being a fence sitter  I really want to find a side to sit in,btohqsg
I‚Äôll take a stand when it is required,btohqsg
Until then I‚Äôll just play with arguments,btohqsg
I don't mean to be offensive  but I can definitely can see why following religious moral values are so tempting for the masses,btohqsg
I used to be pro life  except for medical emergencies of course. but now  ok actually through my experience in debate  im confused,btohqsg
Asking questions into the void and getting no answer is not a good feeling,btohqsg
Religion is a beacon of truth and light in the darkness,btohqsg
Anyway hi who want to sell me nintendo switch games,btohqsg
I require you to take a stand on abortion. Go!,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a walking case study lol,btohqsg
dont need to know  but ok,btohqsg
If u have ill promote it,btohqsg
How come no one sent me dudes,btohqsg
Dudes are not valued in society,btohqsg
Yes laughs in came in before they decide to increase fee each year,btohqsg
the worst is dining hall lol,btohqsg
I'm undecided. I'm going to pack and decide on the final day. Coz Govt might force NUS hand even if we want to stay  so even if I stay  I'm keeping my things packed,btohqsg
Th**** will go for anything that‚Äôs breathing,btohqsg
Are you XY and identify as male',btohqsg
Cis face trans face of golgi apparatus,btohqsg
It is what makes you biologically male,btohqsg
i failed chem  what's the diff between cis and trans isomers,btohqsg
damn im ngonna learn all this eventually,btohqsg
Be an educated member of society,btohqsg
It's a miracle you're still alive!,btohqsg
The more the better - Chromosome,btohqsg
Well  I keep the spare ones,btohqsg
I use them to leap between realms,btohqsg
Its okay some people cant be helped,btohqsg
if you use your phone after lights out  just late bookout oni,btohqsg
This is a question we‚Äôve been asking since 2 years ago,btohqsg
No one knows who used the sticker first here,btohqsg
All ik is i got it from here,btohqsg
I swear we should create a prophetic story around Yam,btohqsg
He‚Äôs that guy who has a sticker pack of himself,btohqsg
Shes older than all of us,btohqsg
Ur records are only on paper,btohqsg
A very conveniently small room huh?,btohqsg
Jail is just temporary quarantine from the evils of the world,btohqsg
All ur expenses are paid for by the gov,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt believe we use firing squads,btohqsg
Every bullet u fire during live firing,btohqsg
I like older women so I'll be taking that 'get out of jail' card,btohqsg
I'm just trying to reference the pay for your own bullet phenomenon,btohqsg
For my day shoot  I got 15/16... one bullet got dented and they die die don't want give me a new one,btohqsg
reminder to cog your rifles properly guys...,btohqsg
Marks man x4 fails 5th coz injured misses marksman on 6th by 1 bullet coz wound reopens mid firing,btohqsg
Glad I won‚Äôt hold another rifle again,btohqsg
It's hilarious that I was at the range from 7am till 12am and I shoot for like 5 minutes in total,btohqsg
this is why i hate accountability ü§°,btohqsg
I see we are slipping into NS talk again,btohqsg
U know when u have seccs with a guy,btohqsg
It nullifies whatever bad deed uve done by talking bout NS,btohqsg
Uk when u do a sin,btohqsg
But u go to a confession,btohqsg
And say u did sin and ur sins go poof,btohqsg
It makes ur NS talks go Poof,btohqsg
wtf then what is religion for sia,btohqsg
u kill someone then u confess,btohqsg
looking forward to ORD-ing so i can talk about uni life instead,btohqsg
The split second before I die  I will simultaneously repent for all 3000++ gods in existence,btohqsg
my RP is 64.125  standing on thin ice,btohqsg
but can go bare minimum engineering course,btohqsg
My section mate got 70 and is retaking,btohqsg
it's now called Ash's wager  Pascal's wager only say 'believe in one god better than believe in none',btohqsg
Ash's wager say simultaneously believe in all the second before you die,btohqsg
he want to go atas course?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a corollary of pascal‚Äôs wager then,btohqsg
1 god > 0 means 2 > 1,btohqsg
Blocked Coronary artery of pascals minuscule wages,btohqsg
I think he thinks he can do better,btohqsg
I almost used kuehs real name and tagged him,btohqsg
I mean I'd like to think I can do better than 64.125  I was playing Soul Worker the week before As,btohqsg
but since I can kinda make it to a course  idw to drag things out,btohqsg
Welp  was playing overwatch the morning before math p2,btohqsg
As long as you get what you want,btohqsg
and i heard there's a special system in NUS where if you do exceedingly well in your first year  you can change course/take double degreethat's one potential way to prove myself,btohqsg
dont need to know  but ok,btohqsg
but whether i can do it is another issue kekw,btohqsg
Imagine what i couldve done if i had extra fingers,btohqsg
Wat major are you trying to change to,btohqsg
U can actually still do it,btohqsg
idk  i wanna dabble in something that's more intellectually interesting,btohqsg
but then there's the practical concerns,btohqsg
oh that's double major not double degree?,btohqsg
It was a joke btw  women already have that privilege,btohqsg
Intellectuals do not concern themselves with little things like semantics,btohqsg
Meanwhile some pes C managed to bingo twice,btohqsg
The things on the list are pretty typical,btohqsg
Therefore the conclusion is he is atypical,btohqsg
They should create a NxxL bingo,btohqsg
To check if u have any congruency,btohqsg
That means you don‚Äôt have a pet  you don‚Äôt support PAP  your height is not above average,btohqsg
Only the pap one would make me bingo LOL,btohqsg
SGExams Privileged:Underprivileged RatioCurrent count 5 Privileged : 2 Underprivileged,btohqsg
Random question: Why is there a minority requirement for Members of Parliament  but no gender requirement?If the rationale for having sufficient racial minority representation in the Parliament to ensure that the problems and issues faced by the minority aren't being unintentionally glossed over by the majority race  doesn't the same rationale apply to gender  and that we should have enough women in Parliament to ensure that their problems aren't glossed over?,btohqsg
Also  how about age requirements? Why aren't we putting youths in the Parliament to ensure that problems faced by the youths aren't being glossed over by the 50-60 year old MPs?And shouldn't the cycle continue until every facet of society is sufficiently accounted for?,btohqsg
That's a practical consideration  it's still not logically consistent,btohqsg
Gender riots won't happen but that doesn't solve the problem,btohqsg
that women are potentially disadvantaged in the Parliament,btohqsg
Do you stay with your parents? YesDoes your grandparent/aunty/uncle/cousin/nephew stay with you? NoIf you answered my questions like how I answered you tick nuclear family,btohqsg
When you hold onto a position of power,btohqsg
You don't intentionally do things which don't help you,btohqsg
Don't direct too much resources their way,btohqsg
In Singapore  the definition of youths hit up to 30 I believe,btohqsg
Theres a definition of youth in sg?,btohqsg
And I think it's a very politically driven thing to say that we should only help voters  children are Singaporeans.,btohqsg
I think it was further extended to 35 lmao,btohqsg
Meanwhile I had 16 ticks and still no bingo,btohqsg
Getting bingo = dick measurement competition,btohqsg
I wonder if somebody here will blackout (tick everything) on the bingo card lmao,btohqsg
have to go find your age group,btohqsg
You're talking about politics aren't you? In politics  you do things that benefit you politically.,btohqsg
I am well above average then,btohqsg
im pretty sure avg height for guys is more than that,btohqsg
Well yes  but in the grand scheme of things  a government that pass policies with a mindset that it's going to help them maintain power  is not a good government,btohqsg
Average height for cis males in Singapore is like,btohqsg
Haiz didnt expect to see the day when i had to add/sfor mr nine o,btohqsg
btw I'm not complaining about PAP because they're clearly been passing a lot of unpopular policies that are arguably beneficial in the long term,btohqsg
Uh not sure about how being a good government is relevant to why sg doesn't have more youth representatives in Parliament,btohqsg
Should the government have more diverse representation,btohqsg
But some girl girls say they only date above 1.8... sed.,btohqsg
So ‚ÄòIs diverse representation in parliament a characteristic of a perfect government‚Äô,btohqsg
I was making the devil's advocate line of reasoning then if we have mandatory requirements of having a minority MP in every GRC  then it opens the question as to why they're not ensuring that equally important communities are being accounted for,btohqsg
Race is important  so is gender.,btohqsg
dont need to know  but ok,btohqsg
Then think about it this way,btohqsg
Why else would a government introduce a GRC system?,btohqsg
If we say that a disproportionately male Parliament can ensure that women problems are being accounted for  then so can a disproportionately Chinese Parliament ensure that Malay/Indian/other races' problems are accounted for.,btohqsg
If so  the racial minority requirement does not hold any validity anymore,btohqsg
Imo it's not about ensuring minority representative,btohqsg
yeah go on  I'm all ears,btohqsg
SGExams Privileged: Underprivileged Ratio9 Privileged : 2 Underprivileged,btohqsg
But if I start to say anymore saf might send someone to bring me to Gedong,btohqsg
Opposition would naturally have a tougher time fulfilling the requirements for GRC,btohqsg
They need to scramble to find people  assembling a weaker team,btohqsg
That's the underlying reason of course,btohqsg
Incumbent on the other hand would be able to insert unknown MPs into a team  lead by a popular candidate,btohqsg
No need 90 good incumbent candidates to fight for 90 single seats,btohqsg
