4% +1k for coming promo ( if there's one). Read somewhere. I no money never bother.,btohqsg
Too good to be true? Anyone know what‚Äôs the catch?,btohqsg
0 foreign transaction fee but bad rates? ü§£,btohqsg
True  probably the spread already accounts for the lack of transaction fee. Knew it was too good to be trueü•≤,btohqsg
The 0% foreign transaction fee part,btohqsg
even trust card doesnt have fx fee,btohqsg
Hi all anybody done calculation of FX fee for using amaze + CRMC overseas? Can share?,btohqsg
Every currency is different  got other mention between 1.5 to 2.5 percent,btohqsg
Ok thanks  just needed rough figure,btohqsg
2% on top of master card rate,btohqsg
True  I haven‚Äôt applied for it yet.,btohqsg
Will definitely be better then bank 3.25 to 3.5 fee as that is their selling point haha,btohqsg
5.99% actually. But need to have $0 for 31 days before promo month to work and 150k. But that's based on Apr promo which may not return or return in a worse version.,btohqsg
6 leh melvyn based on 1000 earmark bonus for 150k for 4 month. 1k bonus is 2 percent.,btohqsg
"Oh wait I missed out the last ""half"" month.",btohqsg
U usually put whole month de mah to get the full 4 percent interest after earmark release ah haha,btohqsg
5.99% if you use the correct number of days,btohqsg
Is GXS banking still worth it as a student in 2024?,btohqsg
Its like tbill-ish haha. Get interest upfront.,btohqsg
the savings account or the card?,btohqsg
Mastercard exchange rate + 0% fees,btohqsg
"savings account is decent for a student but maribank has slightly higher interest rate now. Card is meh  there should be better cards out thereotherwise you can open a ocbc 360 and self transfer the ""salary""",btohqsg
Hey Cyril  this is Khaled from Dobin  if you are referring to Best Card for Next Purchase  you can see all cards if you click on ‚ÄúShow More Cards‚Äù. If you are referring to Explore Cards  for now you can only compare 2 but we can add to our roadmap to see more,btohqsg
Question about EGA - possible for me to deposit non SGD Currency into the account assume I use a HSBC Machine and card overseas?,btohqsg
5.71% p.a.  (sorry 5.78% p.a.)We had worked it out.But you need an idle account (not even transferred out on 1st June),btohqsg
Taking part in the Plunging Chicken for $1000 gift for $150k  and locked for 4.5 months($1000 / 4.5 * 12) / 150 000 = 1.78% p.a.$150k MAB = 4% p.a.Total = 1.78 + 4 = 5.78% p.a.,btohqsg
i don't see why not.. because need to deposit on 1st July and locked till 15th November,btohqsg
U can always deposit on 31 jul to cut the duration lol,btohqsg

Reset month is the month u need to empty the acct as ocbc 360 required incremental 500 thus will reach a point where by the extra inside only get base interest,btohqsg
My apologies Melvyn but I am bad at calculations. Do you mean we should clear the account when we hit 103000 MAB please? I am not sure but I thought it is still worthwhile to continue to maintain rather than restart. Thank you.,btohqsg
I mean if first 100k gets like 300 plus interest  I thought losing interest on say 5k or not sure 10k is worth it,btohqsg
I probably need to calculate tomorrow,btohqsg
Im confused. So if link card to amaze. And use it as contactless payment via samsung pay for example. Do i still get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
what does stock cash coupon S$80 mean? we need to trade any Sg stock even for $1 then can claim that $80? or can use $80 to buy the stock? Thanks,btohqsg
use Amaze card (linked to citi rewards mastercard) for any form of payment will get 4mpd so long mcc is not excluded. Note the Amaze card can only add to google pay  not samsung pay nor apple pay.,btohqsg
So link to google pay is fine. Still 4 mpd,btohqsg
Means have to use it to buy stocks and will offset up to $10 per order x8 vouchers,btohqsg
HSBC Revo like Cb siaI spend on places that clearly give 10x points but the statement only give 1x pointsFor example  food places like seizeria  is 5812 but wasn‚Äôt given 10x points,btohqsg
I know  5812 not affected Ma,btohqsg
Rarely use after the nerrf bet get alternative cards,btohqsg
It‚Äôs too many sia  like previous month I spend almost 900 but only get 4k points‚Ä¶ abit sus lei,btohqsg
Go for citi. Abuse it til nerf,btohqsg
