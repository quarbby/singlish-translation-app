Okay so. One time go can up to 10 pax per group. That'll be cheaper. That's for the normal one  below 50$/paxIf wan do private booking  it's gonna be 3000$/hrcause peak period. If wan do private booking I suggest we get up to 30ppl and above. If not cfm exp. And then for those with no license  they only can play the 30km one. But if have pdl like kikou  can chamxiong,btohqsg
