mini screaming in Quantum Mech finals prep,btohqsg
shits ugly but hopefully it works lol,btohqsg
I have not even finish learning complex syllabus,btohqsg
I am overly focused on QM  I did not study complex at all üò≠,btohqsg
Im bout to take a nap because im tired of reading 12 tut in a row,btohqsg
Tut 12 killed me so bad i couldnt understand anything for a good hour,btohqsg
pen and paper  my handwriting gets ugly if i write on a screen,btohqsg
but my school material is mostly all online now so,btohqsg
if yall find the right hdb corridor. you can get good views of sg,btohqsg
need to get wire cutter oso,btohqsg
gg alot of things to do,btohqsg
Tbh i write very slowly on ipad also (more of coz i cannot write nice then keep erasing),btohqsg
Me sometimes too when i just need 2 devices,btohqsg
Siyan: ‚ÄòAt least it is still progress‚Äô,btohqsg
No my last paper is tmr,btohqsg
If AM exam i would be more in a panic,btohqsg
My friday one was 230pm and i was so grateful,btohqsg
I wasnt grateful for the finals tho fk that paper but it is what it is,btohqsg
Lucky I hall but still damn shag,btohqsg
Meanwhile i dun understand how ppl finish their paper so early,btohqsg
JC/Secondary: Finish fast is smartUni: Finish fast is fucked,btohqsg
The guy beside me finished the entire paper in 1 hour,btohqsg
And he actually did it because i was observing him writing all sorts of shit,btohqsg
Engineering I hear for some can legit just do 1 question as long as all correct can liao,btohqsg
The entire 2 hours exam i only counted 3 people leaving early,btohqsg
He came in with pt shorts and only one pen and a calculator  i knew this man would be cooking alr,btohqsg
Wa that one guarantee u he has been burning midnight oil and only open the material 1 day before.,btohqsg
idk leh it seems to be working for him,btohqsg
because from what i saw he actually legit finished the paper properly,btohqsg
It does lmao somehow manage to pass one walao,btohqsg
DSA i saw a whole row empty lmao,btohqsg
need to watch sum yt vids lol,btohqsg
Im really surprised prof allowed someone beside me to be talking to his friends in the exam hall when the 2h has not been up,btohqsg
sounds like a prof that could not be bothered with paperwork,btohqsg
Even if they have already submitted their work  bruh the exam is still ongoing,btohqsg
I read yt as bedok at first lmao,btohqsg
Maybe he prepared well and is confident abt the paper,btohqsg
Man crushed a paper that nobody else left early for,btohqsg
Usually finals there would always be a handful that leaves early,btohqsg
But for this exam mostly nobody left,btohqsg
I always finish right on the dot (if i actually finish),btohqsg
Use this meme as a classic rule of thumb üëç,btohqsg
oh i didnt know they would apply an adjustment if it doesnt meet their requirement,btohqsg
Gude if u liked eggs shouldn't it be ü•öor üê£ instead of ü•ë.,btohqsg
yeah not something i would put all my eggs in the basket for,btohqsg
I know for large cohort they will use it because they can. CLT and moderation in general requires a large enough sample size,btohqsg
too bad physics has a cohort of <100,btohqsg
typical h2 math question would be like  how large should n be,btohqsg
Usually oni if n more than 100 than can,btohqsg
okay la ps2 has bio chem and math + all the other double degree spms peeps so still can moderate,btohqsg
