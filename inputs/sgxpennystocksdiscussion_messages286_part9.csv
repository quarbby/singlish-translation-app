Congrats to Rex and other oil counter holders,btohqsg
Expecting strong play for oil counters today  led by REX.Market should be good today.Let‚Äôs go,btohqsg
As mentioned recently CPH used to have hidden sellers at 6 & 7 previously. To have buyers at 8 on last Wednesday is amazing. Last Wednesday traded was big which tells us this time 6 & 7 sellers was well absorbed. Thursday saw still have buyers absorbed sellers at 7. On the chart you can see the last time it closed above 7 was March 2020. This time I see power in this counter especially it close at 8 for 2 consecutive sessions n traded volume 2 sessions ago was amazingly much bigger compared to the past many months. I will expect more upward move soon to hit at least 10. Let's see...,btohqsg
Another potential counter to watch this coming week is Rex. Rex had been trapped in range for the past 2-3 months. Last week it finally broke out of the range. To be able to breakout of range showed power. Last Wednesday closed with an ugly inverted hammer but price didn't drop further on Thursday but instead closed with a reversal candle. Thursday PA showed have buyers supported at 170. MACD histogram still moving up. I will expect more upside in the short term with a potential target of 195.,btohqsg
CSF  today expecting some further follow through over the last few strong sessions?,btohqsg
