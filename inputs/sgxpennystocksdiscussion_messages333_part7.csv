Pika World Update (10 March 2021)Equity markets saw a sharp rebound with Nas and S&P500 rose sharply. 10 years bond yield fall sharply as the market pauses for a reprieve. Essentially  the bond markets remain heavily oversold; thus  bond yield while on an upward trajectory should moderate its climb. The financial market is heartened from a successful sales of 3 years Treasury bonds with some short term notes. While the rate closed is much higher than the previous auction  it reflects a more robust economy.What's next?We have come to the critical period of the week. Today we will have the data of CPI  which will give an insight into the inflation fear. At midnight  we will have the week's highlight  which is the 10 years treasury auction which will shed light on the market appetite. The worry stems from the Feb bond rout when the 7 years treasury auction cause spike in the yield. Likewise  Japan is ending its fiscal period end-March  which may reduce its appetite for more US treasury which is yet another concern.Are we out of the woods yet?Pika World thinks that we are on the fine line. Future CPI is likely to see a very high future due to the base effect. In the prior period where shut down happened  prices were falling or low  and this may scare retail investors to assume that inflation is rising sharply.Will the Fed control the yield?Pika World thinks this is increasingly a possibility if the financial situation is tightening. While we have not seen it yet  it has impacted the financial market. For example  mortgage loans moderate with the higher rate as 10 years treasury rate influences major loan markets such as real estate. Hence  we should closely watch this data for more insights on the impact of rate on consumers‚Äô spending behavior.With that  Pika World wishes all a safe and fulfilling trading week ahead!,btohqsg

Added more Oceanus $0.026. This support level should hold out. I reckon to break a support like that price need to hover closer to this region then it can break. But  it dropped from 0.07x fast. This set up should not break so easily.,btohqsg
