That is only if they are willing to pay   and sure it will deter ppl,btohqsg
Then charge the prev user for hogging,btohqsg
but they still in the lot ma hahahha,btohqsg
Park infront of them liao. Hahaha,btohqsg
Later another RR case say no space cannot pass,btohqsg
That's why I say I'll only consider ev if charging points readily available.Or when their charger upgrade 0-100% in 5 mins.,btohqsg
Go in the lot  batt swop  out within 5mins and carry on with life,btohqsg
then all the companies need to make batt swap stn,btohqsg
Mus be a std battery tt all ev use. Den if theirs is higher capacity then need use more,btohqsg
U wait another 2-3yrs to see if value still hold then say lor.. battery life span cut  a lot more ev car owners still fighting for lots to charge.,btohqsg
Current I believe most ev owner are enjoying the ride and drive   it just adopting earlier as ice is gonna be obselute soon .,btohqsg
ICE won't die. It will just become the very minority. I believe hybrid and Electric will co-exist.,btohqsg
2030 no more coe for ice car liao,btohqsg
During this period value for ice car will be dropping as more and more ppll won‚Äôt look back to ice after driving ev,btohqsg
No new registrations for ICE car. But they will still roam the roads in much smaller population.,btohqsg
For the same reason I doubt petrol stations will completely go away too.,btohqsg
They will change to ev charging port already for the petrol station,btohqsg
unless we got ev lorries and buses  petrol stations still needed,btohqsg
Just my thought as u can see all carmakers are moving away from ice already and heavily investing on ev   goverment set law to and time to phase out ev   buying new ice in the next few years is just now worth it   as resale value might plunge a lot as buyer might avoid ice,btohqsg
Just hope EV can be really affordable lah and should have Seperate COE categ for this,btohqsg
