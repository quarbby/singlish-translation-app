Good! So far if u think your kid is doing well after all those treatments..u got to think well it‚Äôs been hard on him and yet he is doing well‚Ä¶.maybe he will do much better if I treat him with love. Hmm‚Ä¶simple switch of mind. If there is no switch in what u look outside‚Ä¶then u cannot see the one truly inside. Well‚Ä¶.to me the only question is which is better side and u just simply choose the easiest choice and switch to the one inside u. Just my positive thoughts..just sharing. I‚Äôm not telling u and u just listen. We chit chat and move on. Cheers!,btohqsg
So whatever we do today‚Ä¶.be wise in your option‚Ä¶there is no such things as sub-option‚Ä¶cos if there r then it will just multiple hahahaha silly thing to do in my view. Don‚Äôt just look at picture appreciate the art. SEE the artist‚Äôs work and when u really it‚Äôs true beauty..the meaning y he paint this way‚Ä¶u r him yourself. Just be creative.,btohqsg
