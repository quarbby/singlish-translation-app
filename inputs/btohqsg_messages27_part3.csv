Divorce never apply bto before  77 yrs old  choose bto near married son,btohqsg
Thanks. But do you know usually like what kind of docs they require?,btohqsg
Went to dig out mine from 2022. It was1. Income documents from past 3 months & 12 months2. IC3.  EHG form4. Undertaking to not withdraw essential members of the flat formSince 2022 was still under HLE (where loan and grant are not done before application)  I believe 1 and 3 will no longer be applicable  since they would have been covered by HFE.So I think best if someone else who has an updated (after HFE started) invitation package can share the documents required,btohqsg
77yrs old shld apply flexi 2rm,btohqsg
I knowI mean the chances how to read the above table?,btohqsg

So 19.5 rate means that 19.5people are fighting for 1 flatOr 195ppl are fighting for 10flats,btohqsg
Pasir ris is hot spot for flippers!,btohqsg

More application rate is a reflection  the location is good for some,btohqsg
If never get a queue number or queue number out of supply can apply Feb BTO,btohqsg

Price excluding grants and including grants is referring to first timers and second timersÔºåright?Cos I realised the grants difference is 80k for 2 to 4rmAnd 55k difference for 5rm,btohqsg
The difference between including and excluding grants is the (max) 120k EHG grant that's for 1st timers  yup,btohqsg
For everyone (1st timers) it's safer to look at excluding grants  as including grants price assumes you get a max of 120k  whereas most wont get that,btohqsg
120k is for couples earning less than 1.5k/mth,btohqsg
the grant amount should be indicated in the HFE.,btohqsg
For singles the income ceiling is $4500 üò¢,btohqsg
