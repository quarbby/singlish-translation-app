agree with this good point mr arnav!,btohqsg
I think you buy wrx you don‚Äôt calculate fuel consumption one,btohqsg
One who wants to road hog will continue to do so at 110  one who wants to drive fast in lane 1 will continue to do so,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt  drive long enough. But it‚Äôs good enough to leave me positive impression. He says it‚Äôs damn good on the wet,btohqsg
ah yes all subarus good in wet regardless of engine cos of the symmetrical awd,btohqsg
Driving etiquette is hard   most of the taxi and coe cars drive like gangster road hogger,btohqsg
Yes absolutely. We got to have education.,btohqsg
handling really miles ahead of other cars,btohqsg
yep  calculate number of head gaskets needed,btohqsg
Education don‚Äôt work for every 1,btohqsg
Yupp  and that's what needs to be improved. Speed limit increase for everyone  same issue will stick around,btohqsg
precisely  if singaporeans got no driving etiquette  increasing speed limit will be dangerous,btohqsg
Maybe we can use such chat to promote day to day education to new drivers entering as well ?,btohqsg
Just need to inculcate the right driving rules from the start  road etiquette more than hill climbs,btohqsg
I was driving a 156 Alfa and I chased him to 180 plus. And that‚Äôs where he pulls away easily when I am running out of steam at 220 plus,btohqsg
The salesman tell me the rear view mirror don‚Äôt need too big too. Coz your handling so good plus speed you will be leaving everyone behind,btohqsg
Need to have driving etiquette course on how to use signal light...,btohqsg
they say no need big rear view mirror cos workshop got nothing to see too,btohqsg
There is never a blanket solution for all  different people  different mood  different skills  different cars,btohqsg
Why u drive so fast lol,btohqsg
That's why  need to deal with the issues  all paying road tax,btohqsg
all jokes and banter  i do love a good subie too btw when its road ready,btohqsg
And not change Lane dangerously without signaling. Only when can't cut  then signal light on...,btohqsg
Ya some time just too mad with road hogger I got a video of how a car block me !,btohqsg
180 plus not that fast ok north south highways.,btohqsg
I use Mazda to do this often too,btohqsg
I give way to faster car,btohqsg
Yeahh  just need to flash them and try to move forward! No choice,btohqsg
my friend ignatius managed to hit 240 on nshw in 2010  he drive tat gtr with v6,btohqsg
You are a good man sir. üëç,btohqsg
need more drivers like you on the road!,btohqsg
maybe his leg feeling extra heavy haha,btohqsg
I always do. Even in m3 I give way to myvy. I think he‚Äôs in a hurry,btohqsg
wow! m3 driver! cool solid car,btohqsg
U flash them they hog more come I show you,btohqsg
Got to have good tires when driving fast  Clear and open roads,btohqsg
e92 m3? heard the NA V8 very powerful,btohqsg
But I dare not do 300. Many YouTubers do 320 330. My top speed I ever tried is 255,btohqsg
Yes. That‚Äôs the one. Yeah glorious sound.,btohqsg
you really winner own my dream car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a touring machine. Or do 250 in 6th so that engine revv stays high,btohqsg
Then overtake from left very politely and safely,btohqsg
More and more junctions doing away with discretionary right turn. Taking longer time for both road users and pedestrians,btohqsg
I've been trying the new tourador tyres and it's performing well.,btohqsg
I recently like Yokohama. Sidewalls very strong and stable.,btohqsg
Less than 6 km a liter. Ouch,btohqsg
Can share picture of your beautiful ride Mr Win?,btohqsg
wrx average 7 sometimes haha with boxer 4,btohqsg
my friend jing xun drives a e63 i heard how is the driving experience like sir?@Jingxunn,btohqsg
I've been reading and many people are saying tyres are all the same. That is why many new brand can perform better than branded ones hence I've chosen tourador.  Maybe one day you can try.,btohqsg
