Go back see records and u will know which one rated u,btohqsg
Apparently for lateness as long as it is complete within the hour  llm will remove the bad rating. Bad attitude or other reasons I won't know.,btohqsg
Someone said oddle platform they can't rate u rite,btohqsg
Prefer oddle though... The customer won't monitor you like someüòÖ,btohqsg
Im late On oddle   once I reach they cancel . I quite just move On lol,btohqsg

U just take lah. Then go to destination call cs say Ur job gone... They still have to pay u. Or pay u with foodüòú,btohqsg
Just now swipe a job  just 3 mins away. Reach there  walk in  then saw job was cancelledüôÅ,btohqsg
They usually give us 1 hr window to complete the order  ditto for customer side  there is a 1hr time frame. It manages expectations and there is usually no drama on either end becos restaurant is just a vendor and customer can't track your route.,btohqsg
Exactly I Kena twice monitor gps all non oddle,btohqsg
I find that home based food cooks are more anal overall. Restaurant if boss made the booking. If just staff  usually chill so have to access and evaluate when you go for pick up.,btohqsg
Usually if i stack i will always call the last PU and tell them i have your food  i am doing another DO first  my estimated time to u is XXXXhrs. Most all ok. Unless restro is already late then have drama.,btohqsg
They add the $2 waiting time and reassign again,btohqsg
Eh no..they did not cancel the previous order..,btohqsg
This is why many of us kena double booking,btohqsg
The late orders got thrown into the open,btohqsg
From a macro pov  restaurants dont like customer call and chase them. So by calling customer  u acted preemptively oredi.,btohqsg
So basically 2 x order close from the same place..,btohqsg
Waiting for them to claw back $16.03,btohqsg
Quite rare for oddle to cancel without CS or them calling u.,btohqsg
I went thru a few oddle jobs cancel..,btohqsg
Today 530pm job cancelTmr 530pm job cancel,btohqsg
Cancel ard 2pm..pick up 530pm today,btohqsg
Prolly customer cancelled or something bah  no reason for oddle to cancel on u.,btohqsg
Just keep calling themMake until they complain to llm,btohqsg

Usual stores that uses oddle become ad hoc pick up..,btohqsg
