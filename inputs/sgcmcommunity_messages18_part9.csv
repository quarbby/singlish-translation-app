Like how I‚Äôm the most handsome man in my bedroom.,btohqsg
Actually this is the most important upgrade hahah,btohqsg
But to me just get a good tyre will do and maintain the tyre well,btohqsg
yeah not all. but hearsay Bentley n Porsche share parts tooüòÇ,btohqsg
Most important upgrade regardless of the car?ü§î,btohqsg
Must have combo lah.. like Street Fighter. Tyre plus decent brakes mah,btohqsg
I have no idea what brand is that‚Ä¶üòÖ,btohqsg
The design seems to be a bbs replica,btohqsg
now trend is to buy replica from china,btohqsg
You got Regen also to help  ice cars engine braking not so much for all of them,btohqsg
Might not only be about that I feel.,btohqsg
Driving pattern and habit also ba   for my Driving pattern just a good tyre will do as I don‚Äôt tail gate,btohqsg
Honestly very dangerous  a few potholes at higher speed and boom  rim bent or cracked,btohqsg
Which.. starts to beg the question.. what else could be a replica..,btohqsg
A lot of ppl just like the looks   u also know those sticker   replica and painted brakes caliber,btohqsg
I prefer to look at the tyre   if I see it like use ps4s I know he is serious guy,btohqsg
And that‚Äôs all good. As long as one doesn‚Äôt start to get into his head that he is now driving a performance ride and‚Ä¶,btohqsg
True! PS4 tyres no replicas right?üòÇ,btohqsg
Yup actually is always is the driving method not about the car,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen China cf kits on 488s before. Or reps rims on RR  or K tyres on Bentleys,btohqsg
Tires hard to get replicas in Singapore  just need to keep in mind old tires with super old date of manufacture,btohqsg
Tyre got replica one meh? Wth,btohqsg
Replica this is really professional poser liao,btohqsg
ya tyre very exp meh need buy replicaü§î,btohqsg
Got. Not really a replica but a copied design.The latest victim we are know is Russia when they used China copy of Michelin military tyres. It did not end well for the Russians.,btohqsg
Ya at most 175 per tyre.,btohqsg
Used to la before all the inflation nonsense.,btohqsg
i ask mine is around 600 plus for 1,btohqsg
Now I think is what  230?,btohqsg
Erm yes leh.. it‚Äôs all relative dude. Try making enquiry for a ps4s 23‚Äù on a Lux SUV,btohqsg
No la. Per tyre leh. 17‚Äù,btohqsg
I actually like Malaysian made Continental tyres,btohqsg
ya the price jump is so scary lol,btohqsg
You‚Äôre welcome. Do we get extra lucky draw chances for education efforts?,btohqsg
Thanks Soon Ng! Shall read it later,btohqsg
Yellow Sea YS20  copy of Michelin XZL tyres haha,btohqsg
can afford a luxury SUV or sedan. tyre price should be the last thing on their mindüòÇ,btohqsg
Depends on the size you are looking for actually,btohqsg
i trying to find this tyre  any 1 got any tips?https://press.pirelli.com/new-pirelli-p-zero-elect-tyres-for-the-all-electric-bmw-ix-bavarian-flagship/,btohqsg
Also depends on profile and the cross section you are looking for not just the rim size,btohqsg
Not very easily available yet  even outside Singapore very hard to find as they're very new on the market. Maybe wait a few months  can contact a few tire suppliers and check if they will bring them over in the near future,btohqsg
WA piang 600 per tyre is really super expensive.,btohqsg
Yup I ask a few liao all said don‚Äôt have   currently I am on these tyre   but one tyre shop tell me that it might cost over 800 for each tyre,btohqsg
I think the chopper is big this time,btohqsg
Yeah supply very low cause new tire that's why  PS5s also super expensive right now because demand is high,btohqsg
Plus for this tire  the initial supply all the manufacturers buy already so direct consumer really gets to pick from a much smaller lot,btohqsg
17 inches relatively cheaper across the board because smaller plus much higher demand so production is scaled accordingly as 17 to 18 inches are the most common stock wheel dimensions,btohqsg
Anyone here uses the tourador thingy tyres. I still wouldn't want to trust MIC tyres for now.,btohqsg
Now there's a few more like them  rydanz and one more I've seen recently,btohqsg
i am looking at this p zero tyre  i see the price i am like woo hoohttps://www.monotaro.sg/p/18636723.html?utm_id=google_pla_sg&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQJqF1013QuO_ovRPrOCN44KQxeU6L8XmQBcG0Fh8EyckpmtPoWi0UEaAtnhEALw_wcB:G:s&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1ZeUBhDyARIsAOzAqQJqF1013QuO_ovRPrOCN44KQxeU6L8XmQBcG0Fh8EyckpmtPoWi0UEaAtnhEALw_wcB,btohqsg
