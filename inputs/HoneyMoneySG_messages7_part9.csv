Since webull is reaching. Maybe test it out. I also switching one of my trading platform if it meet my need. Need more info before commit.,btohqsg
Thanks @wilflare JJ01my USD already in FTX already!,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/kUK7EHd2c6E@ChrisHMSGI try to follow your step to send FTX > Hodlnaut for free. However in hodlnaut I didn‚Äôt see any ETH or USDT via SOL network already. Can help advice?,btohqsg
FTX to Hodlnaut is via ERC20,btohqsg
Make sure it's the FTX Blockfolio app  not Ftx Pro,btohqsg
Ok checking I may skip a step,btohqsg
Yeap I‚Äôm using Blockfolio not the pro,btohqsg
Wanted to transfer from Pro to Blockfolio. Currently inside is USD.,btohqsg
Is it the transfer much be either ETH or USDT from pro to blockfolio?,btohqsg
What is the final crypto you want at Hodlnaut?,btohqsg
You can just deposit USD into FTX(Blockfolio)  then withdraw as USDC to Hodlnaut,btohqsg
no need so many steps per that video,btohqsg
Ok understand didn‚Äôt know that initially as I follow the video step,btohqsg
I try to check how much is FTX to Hodlnaut via ETH,btohqsg
It will be 2.5 USDC from FTX pro (USDC) to Hodlnaut,btohqsg
I believe it should be higher as FTX mentioned: ‚ÄúFTX covers about half of blockchain fees on average‚Äù,btohqsg
Yeah 2.5 is quite low already  skip all the inconvenience and time,btohqsg
Yes and now every second counts in Hodlnaut and the 30 + 20 USDC rewards which I am planning to get 30 days later,btohqsg
2.5 USDC is considered low.or you can buy and stake 25 FTT as another optionelse the BlockFolio one which has been covered aplenty,btohqsg
hmm the countdown timer shouldn‚Äôt have started unless you‚Äôve already done the first deposit,btohqsg
again  I‚Äôll say don‚Äôt be too obsessed with fees - going for a 100% no-fee is sometimes not an efficient use of time.consider your personal optimum amount of hassle and whether the money you saved is worth the time you spent.perhaps  do it once for the science  to understand the flow.,btohqsg
I get where you‚Äôre coming from üôÇ,btohqsg
Please help to elaborate more on how to make payment without the physical card arrived yet? there is a scan for QR code but this only for Paynow?,btohqsg
Just wait for the card and spend later,btohqsg

Hi  question relating to Amaze.Paired with my citi rewards. Wana know if I will still continue to earn the 10x rewards for recurring payment for SP Bills  starhub or any transaction for tht matter,btohqsg
I just made a 1 time online payment for my starhub bill thru app via CRMC direct  got the 10x bonus point. Not sure abt recurring or if thru Amaze. Gonna experience that next monthüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
If i am already holding the true cashback card am i still eligible?,btohqsg
so its by ballot or first come first get ? never had SSB before,btohqsg
It is stated in the MAS website,btohqsg
This Savings Bond was allotted using the Quantity Ceiling format. Applicants who applied for S$15 000 or lower were fully allotted  subject to the individual allotment limits.Applicants who applied for S$15 500 or higher were allotted either S$15 000 or S$15 500.Approximately 39.09% of these applicants were selected at random and allotted the additional S$500.,btohqsg
hope they increase the SSB amount next tranche,btohqsg
For credit card churning  after get the gift how long can cancel the card?,btohqsg
vaguely remember is 6 months.then it's another 12 months upon cancellation if you wanna be eligible for NTB bonus again.but best to read the T&Cs of each card you apply.,btohqsg
not really  I would suggest you should read T&Cs about their sign-up programs  which might state that you need to keep that card for at least 12 months  or they might claw back the gift,btohqsg
