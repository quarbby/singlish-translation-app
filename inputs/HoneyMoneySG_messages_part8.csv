Revolut public transport cashback is in!,btohqsg
Hi all  want to ask if it makes sense to transfer my parent’s CPF OA to RA if they have finished paying the house and don’t intend to purchase house in the future? Since OA is only 2.5% and RA is 4%,btohqsg
How long for the transport cash back to be credited ah?I one month le still no sign of it,btohqsg
Yes if no use for OA anymore,btohqsg
Am I right that  there is no way they can make any withdrawal from OA if BRS is not met after 55?,btohqsg
The payment can be for anything right?,btohqsg
Done  hopefully all have been well captured.,btohqsg

Hello everyone! Nice to be in this group :),btohqsg
Just wanna if anyone can help out. Im currently considering to have an “all-in-one” card and narrowed down to UOB one card and OCBC 365. UOB one card speaks on its own and is quite highly reviewed but the 365 have no much recommendations though. Anyone have any views or opinions? Thanks in advance🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,btohqsg
Depending on your spending. Fixed amount per month vs variable spending per month.,btohqsg
My spendings would be ard 1-1.5k monthly,btohqsg
However i do know that 365 have a $80 cashback cap. Maybe thats the drawback of that card?,btohqsg
My suggestion (not financial advisor) is ocbc for your case.,btohqsg
Yeah for uob one great if you have fix amount and youre able to keep track of spending. Cash back is good there.,btohqsg
Omg thank you much for this!☺️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,btohqsg
Most welcome! Got to give it to chris! Hahah who started this sharing community!,btohqsg
Yea. Thanks to him as well i got into this community :),btohqsg
Whack cpf investing  insurance  credit card usage(if you know how to handle it)  personal finance,btohqsg
Been cracking my head alot tryna find that 1 card where i can put most of my spendings in. Like i know no 1 card is perfect but finding the best card for me personally can be quite tricky 😅🙏🏽,btohqsg
On surface level  Ocbc365 seems better for the higher cashback % in 6% dining and food deliveryBut uob one also has additional cashback +5% merchants like shopee  grab   giant.Ocbc is also not friendly to fee waivers.So depends on what your spending merchants are?,btohqsg
Or you could do the DBS live fresh  uob evol  ocbc frank  each min spend $600/mth,btohqsg
Been long standing order of no credit card and not believing into insurance but recently heavily in research and get myself into it. Having to take control of finance will be added advantage to financial freedom! (Not insurance agent or financial advisor here lol!),btohqsg
