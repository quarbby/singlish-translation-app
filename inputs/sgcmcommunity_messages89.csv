I think we both know a good app to search for brake pads,btohqsg
Then from there you can reccee,btohqsg
For bread and butter cars great upgrade over stock,btohqsg
If you want ceramic  red stuff,btohqsg
Brembo has many replica one 😅,btohqsg
Change to yellow stuff at max can already,btohqsg
You don't need insane stopping power,btohqsg
Unless you want it for aesthetics or you track your car a lot,btohqsg
That 2k can go somewhere else,btohqsg
Sometime change big caliper  pump also must change.Example If the pump is 14mm stock.Even if change to 4 pot. Not much different.If change pump to bigger diameter  more fluid  better braking power too on stock caliper.,btohqsg
Pads rotors and hose line good enough for day to day use,btohqsg
Bbk doesn't add stopping power as such,btohqsg
It's more to reduce brake fade,btohqsg
Then just spray your caliper for ✨aesthetics✨,btohqsg
Maybe pump never change😅For motorbike big difference.4pot320mm rotor19mm brembo pump1 finger braking.,btohqsg
Just changing master cylinder makes a world of a difference,btohqsg
So if just change brake pads + ssbh  braking efficiency will also be improved?,btohqsg
brake fluid and brake pad will help to restore ur braking perfomance,btohqsg
They want you to post fake items on harouhell,btohqsg
Lol. Must be vigilant and don't fall for such nonsense - J,btohqsg
Honda City very light..  Brake pads and +SSBH will help but you must check your brake fluids as well. They need replacement too.,btohqsg
So even if the rotors are not changed  changing the above mentioned still can improve braking efficiency?,btohqsg
Don’t forget proper tyres can help too,btohqsg
That's why change a starter motor cost so much nowadays   smart engine designer😜😜😜,btohqsg
Lol while engine come out suntan ?,btohqsg
Best stopping power is a tree,btohqsg
These days is use other cars to brake,btohqsg

What if the incident involves multiple drivers? Should we name them Driver 1  Driver 2  etc? Wouldn't that just be confusing? - E,btohqsg
Ultimately  the biasness comes from yourself. It is not our intention to create any unhappiness for owners of any specific car brands 🤗 - E,btohqsg
In that case sure  use identifying factors,btohqsg
But in this case there's a traffic light  a driver and a rider,btohqsg
And we did address this issue in the entry as well.,btohqsg
What the fudge to that guy,btohqsg
Sauce also come out… I’m really struggling to keep up guys,btohqsg
Exactly my point - which is why i chose to single out this comment to address the branding issue ~ We are not biased towards or against any car brands. Fair for all - we only tekan the drivers hehe - E,btohqsg
Thus why “Driver 1 in the BM  Driver 2 in the Merc  Rider 1 on the Yamaha” should be used at the start the rest of the article is calls them by Driver 1 and 2. Pretty much like all court document.,btohqsg
I think they should revamp the punishment for traffic related offences,btohqsg
If they can up the summon for illegal exhaust,btohqsg
Why not for the rest of the offences,btohqsg
If it was really not biased towards or against any car brands. The drivers should be what they are called. Without the brands,btohqsg
Few years in jail for taking away innocent life is like a slap on the wrist. - E,btohqsg
All those small small offences only,btohqsg
They haven’t change the big ones,btohqsg
I support and thank you for that!,btohqsg
Our point being that the intention might not be to create a bias however it ends up creating one anyway as can be seen in the comment. And for cases where driver at fault is easily identifiable  the make of the car might just be creating a stereotype hurting other drivers around,btohqsg
Which was an expected and true enough.. such an outcome!,btohqsg
This kind of thing only like what,btohqsg
At worst is few months jail,btohqsg
What do you all think about banning from driving for life as a punishment for certain offences,btohqsg
Actually it depends on severity and the sentencing is done on a case to case basis,btohqsg
There is a minimum and maximum sentence but our btt rule books usually only mention the minimum for bigger violations like this,btohqsg
The guy is alive and if the driver is clean and say sorry in court,btohqsg
hehe loser merc and bmw drivers,btohqsg
Huh? What if the victim become disabled or what? - E,btohqsg
mazda and volvo wont crash into people👹👹👹👹👹,btohqsg
I think up to 3 years in jail?,btohqsg
That's like nothing compared to the victim sia - E,btohqsg
All of this is taken into account during proceedings,btohqsg
That's why they take longer to get sentenced,btohqsg
Because victim's condition cannot be judged immediately,btohqsg
so if  coma for 5 years then die  revise the driver's penalty?,btohqsg
They’ll be judging from the coma,btohqsg
The family also can bring it up again in court,btohqsg
Since there is a statute of limitations to how long they can wait,btohqsg
In that case they usually sign away their right to bring it up again,btohqsg
can always count on our friendly telegram  lawyers ☺️,btohqsg
And if I’m not wrong  it’s super expensive right,btohqsg
There's legal clinics that one can go through,btohqsg
Unless can find someone to do it pro bono,btohqsg
Then legal fees can be expensive,btohqsg
That’s why you make friends with lawyers,btohqsg
And you don't know if you'll get paid during the ruling as part of compensation or not,btohqsg
So it can be a gamble,btohqsg
But in appeal cases and in more complex cases  it's not advisable,btohqsg
Albeit for the first case  it will likely be a public prosecutor fighting the case on your behalf,btohqsg
For an appeal it's upto you,btohqsg
No amount of compensation can restore the life or the quality of life of the victim. Its really just plain “sibei suey”. Lets all hope the victim will make a full and speedy recovery 🤗🤗,btohqsg
no la! the accident really...no words to describe,btohqsg
if got good returns...i dun mind,btohqsg
I hope your returns SLAAAPPPPPPP   slayyyyy big time and are stonks!!!!!,btohqsg
ya  thank you very much ah,btohqsg
the driver should be alert at all times leh,btohqsg

Hi all. I m driving a white colour Suzuki Swift. I was at BLK 210 Hougang Street 21 carpark (behind Kovan Hawker Centre) today (26/10) afternoon. At approximately 12.15pm ~ 12.20pm  I on my hazard light  stationed my car and let my colleague alight. There was no car at the surrounding. After one of my colleague alighted  a Volkswagen white colour Van GBL8321J came from behind and collided into my bumper. The van driver then shifted the van forward in front of my car. Initially he agreed to pay for the repair / report insurance. But now he turns against his own words that he is not paying and not reporting insurance.Trying my luck here and sincerely appreciate if any one has video footage of this incident and share with me. Many thanks. 🙏🙏,btohqsg
if you have video submit to insurance company  pay for your own repair  first,btohqsg
it will take months for insurance company to resolve but if you have video simple case,btohqsg
Unfortunately  when I try to download my car cam video  the file was corrupted:(,btohqsg
Not sure. Maybe I can try to revisit. Thanks!,btohqsg
This car is monitored by security camera … u go and check if u are in the view.,btohqsg
I think the key here is  did you file a report with your own insurer?,btohqsg
Even if you agree to pte settlement  also need to file a report with your own insurer.,btohqsg
Yes  my car workshop helped me to filed an insurance report. However they shared that if the other party do not file any police report  the other party insurer will not send a surveyor to survey the damages.Lesson learned to check in car camera periodically:(,btohqsg
Just to check with you guys   STA inspection grade reliable or do I need to send for further inspection after purchasing second hand car?,btohqsg
Erm. Try to send for further inspection before the purchase better,btohqsg
So STA inspection is not enough arh ?,btohqsg
Any recommendation on where should I send it to,btohqsg
Because STA grade came back an A,btohqsg
Then I read online   there’s people saying STA grade cannot be believe,btohqsg
Send to your workshop that u trust ask them do a prepurchase inspection.,btohqsg
I always believe in having double confirmation  esp for 2nd hand cars.. never know what the prev owner do.. or sometimes accident car prev owner workshop never fix properly.,btohqsg
i suggest u bring to a ws which specializes in the brand,btohqsg
just curious  what car is it?,btohqsg
Replace the sd card or camera if necessary,btohqsg
hybrid pls check. Replace the battery not cheap wor,btohqsg
Not that cannot believe   but just not sufficient,btohqsg
Such issues sta won't detect.@Sgcarmarthas lobang for ppi rite?,btohqsg
Do a battery integrity check (or something like that)  where each cell is checked,btohqsg
Not sure if I got it right though 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Yes  going to replace the car camera to idrive12,btohqsg
I think not in sta's sop lol but you should get it checked  usually it's those ws that has hybrid expertise,btohqsg
Grade A means less than 20k km or something also... Practically new,btohqsg
I think they mainly check for no accident and general road worthiness,btohqsg
Registered for 2 yrs plus but covered only 15k km? That's about under 7k km a year...possible?,btohqsg
but the odo could be tampered also,btohqsg
if bmw best cos can check one,btohqsg
A family car for 2 yrs plus drive only 15k km? Wu ya bo? 😂😂,btohqsg
my swift 40 000km after 14 years… really not tampered with haha,btohqsg

PPI will show you more of wear and tear and look for usual issues if any with that specific model,btohqsg
Hey she is just saying hello leh!!,btohqsg

Wait.It’s not just to me ah,btohqsg
