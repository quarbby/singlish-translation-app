🇿🇦 *South Africa jubilant as Omicron wave subsides rapidly with minimal Covid hospital admissions and Delta killed off: ‘Expect the same in other countries’*27 Dec 2021Optimism is growing rapidly in South Africa as the wave of Covid infections caused by the Omicron variant seems to subside as quickly as it came.Infections are down and multiple Covid experts have confirmed the Omicron wave is subsiding quickly.Ridhwaan Suliman  a senior researcher at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)  said the country has *“surpassed the peak of the Omicron wave now*  driven by the significant decline in the populous province and epicentre: Gauteng ” the province that is home to Johannesburg  the country’s largest city.Although test positivity remains “still high at 29.8 per cent ” the fact the figure is decreasing confirms *“the decline in infections is real* and not a testing artifact.”Other Covid researchers are saying the same. Michelle Groome  of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD)  told reporters that *“we have surpassed the peak of infections.”*Figures from the NCID showed that new cases dropped by 23 per cent over the past seven days  following a 14 per cent decrease a week earlier.Moreover  the *death figure is “substantially lower”* than that experienced with the Delta variant  South African vaccinologist Shabir Mahdi told CNN.Hospitalizations and deaths from this wave have proven to be “significantly lower relative to that experienced in previous waves ” Suliman agreedSuliman stressed that this wave as a *“steeper but significantly shorter wave ”* as it took “about half the number of days to reach the peak compared with previous waves in South Africa.”It also seems the much more *deadly Delta mutation has largely been replaced by Omicron*  which – according to multiple studies – seems to be *the mildest variant so far.**‘Other countries can expect same decline’*The Covid expert who has been leading the country’s pandemic response  Salim Abdool Karim – South Afrcia’s most important infectious-diseases scientist – said the peak of the Omicron wave has passed and he is convinced “every other country  or almost every other  will follow the same trajectory.”*https://www.cityam.com/south-africa-jubilant-as-omicron-wave-subsides-as-quickly-as-it-came-with-minimal-hospital-admissions-and-deadly-delta-killed-off/*,btohqsg
