Interesting topic ive popped myself into,btohqsg
People born on or after 2000,btohqsg
What does the SIA staff say when he needs to pass?,btohqsg
Usually they will open up the thing automatically  except immigration,btohqsg
But the first 2 numbers r not the date of birth,btohqsg
But the president apparently doesn't need an NRIC,btohqsg
She didn't even sing the anthem in the national day celebrations.,btohqsg
Looks like an auctioned car plate number,btohqsg
Hahaha. But difficult for the secretary sometimes as they have to count 6 zeros after the S,btohqsg
Yeah like counting the number of rooftops in the insignia of warrant officers,btohqsg
At least the Singapore PM and the diplomats uses this  not an ordinary passport,btohqsg
I don't even know what that represents  apart from some rank,btohqsg
All the rank insignia have informal names,btohqsg
Like junior officers' ranks are called kit kats,btohqsg
So to be an officer you need a PES A? Does the PES status have anything to do with promotion (or whatever it's called)?,btohqsg
A or B1  if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Those in NCC? White Kit Kat,btohqsg
Ur PES does affect your career,btohqsg
Do you think I'm male or female?,btohqsg
You’re asking about NS so probably female,btohqsg
Otherwise why would a female be so interested in NS?,btohqsg
Quite a few women are interested in a career in SAF,btohqsg
U wanna have some triple arrow volley,btohqsg
How do I make my pw group bonded,btohqsg
It's a joke  the navy sent me something asking me to consider joining them after I get PES F,btohqsg
I accidentally delay the bonding session by 9 months,btohqsg
I call for meeting and force them to attend and listen,btohqsg
Why go for SG diplo passport when you can go for UN Red Document,btohqsg
I think at this point u just try to finish ur pw stuff,btohqsg
Still too watered down for a 4-year course,btohqsg
No need to do bonding or wadever,btohqsg
And then I just do all the work for them,btohqsg
The red laissez-passer haha. I've seen the blue one in pyongyang,btohqsg
Held by a vietnamese. And the wife spoke very good french,btohqsg
If you've seen the red one then >_________>,btohqsg
They sent my batch that too,btohqsg
It was really cool how they got an alumnus of your school to write a letter to u,btohqsg
Not sure how exclusive the red ones are  but I assume heads of UN offices/programmes will have them,btohqsg
Have you been assigned a PES status?,btohqsg
If you have been through everything is there a point knowing?,btohqsg
No I haven't been through everything,btohqsg
MINDEF doesn't release an official reason  right? So I wouldn't know what they considered,btohqsg
You can see the medical report,btohqsg
But they said I need to request it,btohqsg
Maybe things changed since ur time,btohqsg
They said do you want it for court case etc,btohqsg
Although i have the official exemption letter without any reason given,btohqsg
But even if u don’t have an official reason  most people have a pretty good idea of y they have their PES I believe,btohqsg
Like if u declared a medical condition then that’s probably why you got PES this PES that,btohqsg
They don't  but obviously it's a function of what you told them,btohqsg
You can access parts of your ehealth.If you have existing and still-valid excuses they are all shown there.,btohqsg
Unlike the colour of your IC,btohqsg
Exemption from Exit permit is quite good for living overseas. Then I don't have to care about applying to live overseas,btohqsg
Sort of an idea. Not a very good idea,btohqsg
Most official answer is via PULHEEMS failure,btohqsg
What colour is the ORD letter?,btohqsg
It should come together with the service transcript,btohqsg
The transcript is words words words  rank  performance level/conduct  grades if any  signed COMMANDING OFFICER,btohqsg
"The certificate of service is ""HELLO THIS GUY COMPLETED NS SIGNED OFFICER A SIGNED OFFICER B"" (IIRC  Manpower officers or NS officers of some kind)",btohqsg
Oh  so this is the other part,btohqsg
Try to filter out personal info when u post stuff here,btohqsg
We like to stay on the safe side here,btohqsg
Okay okay. But you could google it  so...,btohqsg
Doesnt mean u can spread it dilly dally,btohqsg
Hey  stop trying to make fun of me.,btohqsg
I think in general uni physics is different,btohqsg
Seems like a sample leh  it has SAMPLE pasted all over it,btohqsg
Can check if it matches the NRIC checksum,btohqsg
If it doesn't it's 9999% fake NRIC fake person fake transcript,btohqsg
I probably should’ve read it better then,btohqsg
if it matches the NRIC checksum tho,btohqsg
Then....it's actually just a fake transcript but NRIC COULD belong to someone LMAO,btohqsg
And who would have an IC number with S9765432Y,btohqsg
I’ve a friend with a stupid easy IC number,btohqsg
More like PR IC numbers. PRs usually get Sxx7/8xxxx,btohqsg
Correct  the checksum must be H,btohqsg
Time to borrow from loan shark with ur IC,btohqsg

I think it was easier this year but still prob get PARTICIPATION,btohqsg
Or maybe its becus I'm sec 4 this year,btohqsg
Idk I forgot I had it until they emailed me,btohqsg
It was compulsory so I had to go :(,btohqsg
A lot of people halfway then enter the exam lol,btohqsg
It’s only really compulsory if there are consequences,btohqsg
I mean they paid already so I'll prob get a scolding,btohqsg
But if I were to choose I'd rather not get scolded,btohqsg
Why bother with SMO questions when they are generally not inherently interesting? Better to learn more serious stuff,btohqsg
Everytime I talk to a mathematician involved with olympiads  they go  we know that this is not 'real' mathematics  but this is just for fun and to try to get people interested in mathematics.  To them if they give 'real' mathematics to younger students they might be disinterested.,btohqsg
I would draw the parallel to competitive programming and never really needing to ever use those algorithms ever in day to day use,btohqsg
But it's a good brain teaser kind of thing,btohqsg
I just went for it becus it was free and would give me cca points idk lol,btohqsg
U will never use cauchy schwarz in ur national exams,btohqsg
Its not in syllabus theres no ordered points in syllabus,btohqsg
but the way you think and approach the question  i think that's a valuable skill that people will look at,btohqsg
Yeah but olympaids don't help increase your grades for your O/A level subjects,btohqsg
Most people won’t touch that though,btohqsg
One of them was my Cambridge interviewer. Told me he knows it's not real mathematics but just to get people interested. When he mentioned olympiads and the expression on my face he knew I didn't like it. He seems to hate olympiads himself,btohqsg
Not quite the mathematician way though,btohqsg
I think most people do it for the points,btohqsg
We like to think if things work in a more general case,btohqsg
It's not like olympiads which is very computational heavy,btohqsg
Did u sit for last year paper?,btohqsg
Rigour? It's not even rigourous when you just give answers and not the full proof,btohqsg
Yeah it's not really that rigorous to be honest,btohqsg
From my experience with A levels and SMO  I think A levels can be more rigourous in certain aspects  as in proving things for some general case,btohqsg
SMO questions u dont need working  so you can use unconventional methods  like drawing the thing to scale,btohqsg
I mean I suck so I cant go for paper 2,btohqsg
No. That means SMO is nonsense,btohqsg
But SMO they dont really teach u problem solving they teach u tricks,btohqsg
Exactly. So why bother and claim you suck when you are comparing yourself to some nonsense?,btohqsg
I mean I suck at the paper,btohqsg
Some teachers at school have this false illusion that mathematics olympiads really test your skills,btohqsg
That's what I'm trying to say,btohqsg
Well  if you like then you do it  don't really see a concrete reason to downplay olympiad.I honestly don't get the purpose of this argument.,btohqsg
It doesn't test math as per se  but more like logic,btohqsg
As someone who does both Olympiad Math and higher-level math  I think they somewhat complement each other,btohqsg
For SMO R1  yeah most of the time its tricks that'll get you the answer and you're at a disadvantage if you try to do every question legit,btohqsg
thats just a consequence of R1 format,btohqsg
But R2 questions and IMO shortlist questions and whatnot generally require more than just tricks to do.,btohqsg
Thats my take on it at least,btohqsg
"Hotels are now offering work-from-hotel packages which allow you to work and hopefully enjoy a mini staycaytion on the side.We tried one of these ""workation"" experiences at lyf Funan and here's what we think of it.➡️https://bit.ly/3i9vel2Work-from-home or Work-from-hotel?",btohqsg
my father's boss paid for the hotel stay for all workers from malaysia lol,btohqsg
Us Trade war w china and Covid19 affecting economy everywhere,btohqsg
Can i go JC if I'm taking combined science and no Additional math,btohqsg
Huh but i thought is very hard,btohqsg
Yep  I have a friend with combine science but no A math  also went to JC,btohqsg
Took H2 sciences but H1 math,btohqsg
I doubt you’ll be allowed to take H2 maths however,btohqsg
my friend is in a jc  w no amath and took comb sci,btohqsg
Entry to JC is based only on your L1R5  not your subjects,btohqsg
yes it is hard  but not impossible,btohqsg
Some school allow if u take some selection test,btohqsg
if u wna take h2 math i believe there is briding aft a selection test or smth like that,btohqsg
My Recommendation is don't take H2 math hahah,btohqsg
But the gap from Emath to H2 math is too big,btohqsg
Yes i was told this too,btohqsg
my friend took h2 math w no amath,btohqsg
Unless u study A math during ur holiday,btohqsg
shes not doing v well w math,btohqsg
u have to rly be invested in practising,btohqsg
H2 Mathematics is not that hard  I always try to look up to people. I try not to judge someone by their background,btohqsg
It is leh  I'm still struggling hahaha,btohqsg
And I took amath and emath,btohqsg
Many people learn it the wrong way that's why,btohqsg
I trust that you will do well,btohqsg
You are a genius. You can do it!How? Don't rely so much on the JC notes and graphing calculator. Rely on definitions and theorems,btohqsg
I'm not a senpai. I'm stupid and worthless,btohqsg
Jeanbut speaking from personal experience. Even for students with A1 emath and amath can get U grade for H2 math,btohqsg
If a stupid and worthless person can do it  why can't a genius do it?,btohqsg
if you still die die cannot just rote learn ezpz,btohqsg
Even a student with F9 in E and A maths can get A in H2 Mathematics,btohqsg
Ya la  it works either way hahaha,btohqsg
U take 3 art 1 science,btohqsg
Arts is like history  literature  geography,btohqsg
Science is physics  bio math   further math  chem etc,btohqsg
got chinese studies in chinese too,btohqsg
got a lot of china stuff,btohqsg
my school like china a lot,btohqsg
My sch don't even offer hahaha,btohqsg
How much harder is A levels than O's,btohqsg
still can but your grades will be a bit,btohqsg
There are People with straight A go into JC become Straight U,btohqsg
A levels isn't hard... If it is so hard why do so many people do well?,btohqsg
They are just out to scare you,btohqsg
Cos it's easier to go uni 😂,btohqsg
Ok la  100 times was a joke  but it's definitely much much harder,btohqsg
Wrong. Because it is either luck or they know how to study.,btohqsg
Are u the spokesperson for JC gagagah,btohqsg
Like if you hate money and finances you should stay away from economics,btohqsg
You can’t really pt a number on how hard A is compared to O,btohqsg
I'm already in university. JC is long gone,btohqsg
How much harder is uni than A levels,btohqsg
Poly is hard in its own way too anyway,btohqsg
You don't mature for no reason,btohqsg
Yeah  until you see university stuff,btohqsg
Yea  Alot people think poly easy,btohqsg
But actually it's just as rigourous as JC,btohqsg
i have wayy more projects to worry about as well,btohqsg
But if you like what you're doing you'll work harder and have more moti,btohqsg
not all will love wat they do aft studying it,btohqsg
Then maybe you don't actually like it?,btohqsg
Sometimes u think u like it,btohqsg
no i couldnnt go into the course i want to,btohqsg
they change their mind and dl it also aft a while,btohqsg
Idk bruh I'm taking O's this yr,btohqsg
I taking A level this year also,btohqsg
poly and jc both have its pro and cons,btohqsg
dont assume one is easier than the other !,btohqsg
both routes need to work hard,btohqsg
But at least poly don't have go wake up at like 6-7 rite,btohqsg
JC I wake at like 6 sia,btohqsg
Some have to wake at 5,btohqsg
i wake up at 6 to go sch at 8 :”),btohqsg
I wake up at 5.30 everyday,btohqsg
IM alr waking up at this time in sec sch,btohqsg
I reach on the dot one,btohqsg
i mean poly smtimes like u can go sch later,btohqsg
U go school later  but u also can stay later,btohqsg
I have friendd stay in punggol come to yiochukanh,btohqsg
My sec sch classmate at poly complain abt class at 11.30,btohqsg
but poly depends on ur schedule,btohqsg
like i can only one lesson,btohqsg
Honestly morning classes are the best,btohqsg
go sch 12 go home at 2,btohqsg
Once u finish them u have the rest of the day to do ur shit,btohqsg
but poly u have alot of projects as well,btohqsg
so u may have to stay in sch/ meet up to finish them,btohqsg
will there be the case where u have to come at like 7+ and then only leave at 5 or smth,btohqsg
Sometimes attending classes isn't very good use of time. Often studying by yourself is more effective,btohqsg
Imagine u stay in punggol but school at jurong,btohqsg
Or just go home and tank the whole thing urself,btohqsg
thats me la LOLOL only me :” send help,btohqsg
u may end at even 8,btohqsg
Like what do you even do on a computer,btohqsg
CCA is generally a waste of time in JC  unless you are applying for certain things then maybe,btohqsg
Why would you not want a CCA,btohqsg
we talking abt poly but ok,btohqsg
I was forced. In university I don't join any activities at all.,btohqsg
like writing proposals  reports   for me data sheets (science) and i spend lots of time going through slides and doing practice questions~,btohqsg
It’s rare that someone is paying for you to do fun things,btohqsg
assignments some may be graded some not,btohqsg
online quizzes r a thing as well,btohqsg
But diff courses are different or most courses are like this,btohqsg
theres also a mid-sem exam and end-sem exam,btohqsg
depends la  if mayb design they have 1 exams mostly just projects and artworks to hand up,btohqsg
for engineering p similar to sci as well id say,btohqsg
for business more focused on proposals  reports and presentations  and have exams as well,btohqsg
Isn't CCA and all the activities u join the fun part,btohqsg
Teachers in charge can ruin it,btohqsg
Sports CCA 3 times CCA  in a week hahaha,btohqsg
Some ppl also find this to be too time consuming,btohqsg
A waste of time. I might as well use the time to get higher marks or more importantly  read my mathematics books,btohqsg
Can spend time doing other stuff,btohqsg
That's the bare minimum liao  sports is like 3hour plus and at least twice a week,btohqsg
My CCA was v educational and fun,btohqsg
my cca was also v educational,btohqsg
Yea that's why they dont join,btohqsg
I would not be half the same person I am today without it,btohqsg
but i think cca is subjective,btohqsg
Perhaps because if this mindset  you find cca a waste of time,btohqsg
When I was in JC there was this 'learning experience'. Quite interesting to prove complex numbers using linear algebra,btohqsg
if ur humanities gd then can la,btohqsg
I took damn Alot of activities 😂My CCA science and tech  and I join all sorts of science competition and forumns,btohqsg
what is your combi for arts,btohqsg
Unless there is a mathematics club  but people will probably not indulge in real mathematics so I might as well not join,btohqsg
i working and i have external cca,btohqsg
If u like to hang out with people  ACJC is the place to go,btohqsg
People here tend to be more extroverted,btohqsg
Wow. Your JC is Hwa Chong or NJC?,btohqsg
Can be good can be bad,btohqsg
But like party sch wont ppl be more slack,btohqsg
Just hope u find the right friends,btohqsg
It’s up to u to keep ur grades good,btohqsg
How much sleep u get average,btohqsg
And I think you are a genius that can easily get to hwa chong and way beyond,btohqsg
for test I get about 4h sleep,btohqsg
the most 6 the least 3,btohqsg
7h sleep is possible in JC,btohqsg
i do alot of things la,btohqsg
12 hour during weekends and holidays,btohqsg
Heh i dont even sleep 7 hours in sec school,btohqsg
depends on how u manage ur time also,btohqsg
What if let's say i have no social life or whatever,btohqsg
U need to keep ur home and school separate,btohqsg
Like im usually free everyday aft school,btohqsg
謙虛。In life  geniuses may not always take the obvious path.,btohqsg
So u do ur work at school then u go home play game then sleep,btohqsg
How much sleep would i get,btohqsg
i draw alot  i also study  exercise ish and work,btohqsg
Cause honestly in school there’s a lot of time,btohqsg
In jc u have more break time,btohqsg
Yes theres the adequate ambience to study,btohqsg
There was this point in time  start of this year iirc i didnt do a single piece of hw at home,btohqsg
If not enough break time then u stay after school,btohqsg
Cos i did everyth during class,btohqsg
I rmb there was a time i didnt do hw at home,btohqsg
Anyway cos covid no more morning assembly,btohqsg
So i use morning to chiong hw,btohqsg
I don't even do hw tbh,btohqsg
I just either copy or act like I do hw,btohqsg
As in  people expect geniuses to go to HCJC or RJC. But in reality  many don't. Don't allow your current path and situation to define who you really  truly are,btohqsg
Ya last time damn stupid must read book,btohqsg
my class in sec sch was v hardworking so every spare time we had we used it to do work,btohqsg
At least my chers dont rlly care,btohqsg
Wait wait wait  first of all  I'm not a genius,btohqsg
so breaks we were in class clearing hwk,btohqsg
my class got 1 smart kid,btohqsg
Breaks as in recess? Or free periods,btohqsg
Free periods r another damn useful tool,btohqsg
we would bring packed food to class,btohqsg
Because the education system and teaching style suits him. Not for many others,btohqsg
I found it very difficult to understand the JC internal paper questions for mathematics,btohqsg
I don't understand the question  how to answer it,btohqsg
Yes  I’m being graded in NS,btohqsg
The style of writing is often  hard to understand,btohqsg
HAHA bedok viewian how do you get banned and still stay in here,btohqsg
How you get banned from discord,btohqsg
He kept going on about crustless strawberries,btohqsg
wat is that supp to mean,btohqsg
You all dunno about crustless strawberries?,btohqsg
oh is that supposed to be cursed?,btohqsg
are you thinking what I am thinking huh boi boi,btohqsg
I don’t think you are on the same page,btohqsg
You r on the wrong page,btohqsg
What if I'm tryna be a model,btohqsg
Everyone wants to be a role model,btohqsg
A levels and then super tutor. I heard in some places people do a lot of makeup and try to look nice to attract students for their tuitiont,btohqsg
Instagram is to build your portfolio,btohqsg
Instagram is a pretty bad place imo,btohqsg
Anyone who looks like a golden magikarp I pay 300/hr for tuition,btohqsg
WHO LOOKS LIKE A GOLDEN MAGIKARP,btohqsg
DU DUUU DU DU DUU DUN DUN DUUUUU,btohqsg
How on earth did this group’s link get spread to India and Africa??,btohqsg
Someone from Morocco posted asking for French people to help,btohqsg
Use this group for academic questions,btohqsg
What I really want to know is how fishes like me got into this group,btohqsg
How does fish see water and air,btohqsg
Do they see water the way we see air,btohqsg
With enough publicity we can spread to Mars  Pluto and beyond,btohqsg
Pretty sure they notice the refraction,btohqsg
So they see water the way we see water,btohqsg
We fishes notice a lot of things,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to fix wifi connection problems,btohqsg
I think both my laptop and iPad connection got killed by another device....,btohqsg
Even when I connect to other wifi network,btohqsg
It works most of the time,btohqsg
Have you tried turning it off and on again?,btohqsg
Resetting the wifi adapter to be precise,btohqsg
do you have direct line of sight with the access point?have you turned them off and on?,btohqsg
Anyway that device was modified before so whenever she turn on her laptop everyone's wifi network will stop working,btohqsg
can you physically see the access point,btohqsg
the place where you and your devices are at,btohqsg
and have you restarted your access point,btohqsg
Presumably she uses a router right,btohqsg
Your devices send beep boop to routers,btohqsg
If the path to beep beep is blocked they won't talk very well,btohqsg
Don't most routers have an access point inbuilt,btohqsg
yeah  but ultimately they're still separate devices,btohqsg
There is arts stream in jc where u can take more humanities subjects instead of maths/science,btohqsg
anyone know what score i should get for media&comms for Ns? ;-;,btohqsg
its not as competitive as applied sciences,btohqsg
@cauchycriterion@chemcer@SecrethahaAlthough the person already deleted the account,btohqsg
Idk cant relate but its good to be stressed,btohqsg
Anyone retaking o Level chinese during November?,btohqsg
Basically for me   it’s just English and humanities . One because of my language,btohqsg
Idk what the hod was thinking about.,btohqsg
think she went to ri or something they kept calling her ri,btohqsg
yes their black shirt so nice,btohqsg
I disagree from my experience of teachin some1,btohqsg
I feel that they just work harder than most of us do,btohqsg
but then again some of them are just born with 200iq and can start doing differentiation out of the womb.,btohqsg
They arent as good as they seem,btohqsg
They are just ordinary human beings like us,btohqsg
Albeit slightly smarter in diff ways,btohqsg
yes they have a life too I just feel they work harder,btohqsg
Lol i taught an RI IP student and i dont rly see that,btohqsg
wait is it the malay word,btohqsg
But RA only exist in RI,btohqsg
Thats my observationThe person was also in a rather high commitment cca,btohqsg
I mean they already settled for six years so they won't care,btohqsg
I'm still waiting for the time GEP students enter my sec school,btohqsg
