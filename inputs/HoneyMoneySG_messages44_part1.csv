How to get free CRO using the blue card?,btohqsg
If your spend more than $1k  you need both cards because revo n Citi rewards max $1k only  to earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
No more rebate on blue card,btohqsg
Hi guys  quick question.. my company just credited my salary via giro(pic below) may I know if I qualify for salary credit interest? what's the diff between the two? thanks,btohqsg
The top one is interbank giro so like bank to bank fund transfer while the bottom one is giro salary which will qualify for the salary credit part,btohqsg
To be sure  you can check whether the ticker moves via the web portal,btohqsg
Hi HMSG experts  I have UOB savings deposit account. Could & should I change my UOB one card billing period to follow calendar month?,btohqsg
probably good for easier tracking on the $500 card spend assuming u meant the uob one account,btohqsg
Missed UOB One spend amount by a bit... Any chance if call in?,btohqsg
Yes. Can try. Usually once a year they will allow appeals easily.,btohqsg
Boss. Which is the best card to pay tax using Cardup? üòÖ,btohqsg
Oh really ok thanks for the tip,btohqsg
Cashback: maybank platinum visaMiles: uob privi miles,btohqsg
Whats the most cost efficient way to send money to Indonesia?,btohqsg
I noticed that no one recommends 1.5/1.6mpd cards for cardup @.@Is it cause of the barrier to entry for those cards?,btohqsg
Yes  if you are talking about citi ultima and dbs vantage,btohqsg
ic. So DBS vantage is better?,btohqsg
Existing card member means existing DBS member? So max I will get 40000 miles if I pay the annual fee and the sign up gift.,btohqsg
Nice. But with UOB privi miles I can get up to 50000 miles with min. Spent of $1000 for 2 months.,btohqsg
The UOB auto system reject my Priv Miles fee waiver request  I checked the t&c need to spend $50k sia. I called in CSO wanted to transfer to the auto system  I tell her it ask me to contact customer service  then she put on hold and after long wait then waive for me‚Ä¶,btohqsg
btw cardup/ipaymy excluded from the $4k spend for sign up bonus,btohqsg
Ok thanks bro. Back to UOB Card.,btohqsg
Sorry guys a bit off topic. Anyone knows what is the name of the mobile phone convention in May?,btohqsg
Does atome count towards online spend for UOB EVOL card?,btohqsg
Either online or mobile transaction  depend on how you pay it. Pls also check mcc code 5399 or 5999 is not excluded (sure be not). Refer to its T&C. Gd to do some homework & learn the skills.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/uob-evol-terms-and-conditions.pdf?i_cid=pfs:sg:owned:int:site:na:li:na:na:na-evergreen:direct:na&vid=none,btohqsg
50k?! Thats like not maximizing ur spending for 3.25k per month,btohqsg
I have hold uob privi for very long  never ever spend 50k for all 3 (visa master amex) but got waiver always,btohqsg
Same. Nowhere close to 50k. Got waiver,btohqsg
Is it your only credit card with uob? If ‚Äúsolus card‚Äù meaning only cc with them  usually they will waive off,btohqsg
Morning everyone  is using amaze plus citi cashback+ a good choice for large overseas spending (above 10k)?,btohqsg
Morning everyone  I have monthly rental of $6 100 and is exploring which way is better to earn cash back via cardup or citi payall. Anyone has similar experiences to advise? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Yes sounds like a good combination to me,btohqsg
For cashback  first choice should be Amaze + SCB Manhattan.Then Amaze + Citi Cashback+.That was my combo for large spending overseas.,btohqsg
Hi ! Good Morning! I have linked my mastercard with instarem card. Who should I pay bill to? Thanks,btohqsg
I think cardup and citi payall work better for miles cards because most cashback cards offer less cashback than the processing fee. Especially for a large amount like 6.1k.,btohqsg
Thank you. I am new to credit card  and all this thing. I will go and read up. Thanks,btohqsg
Thanks. Which miles credit card and method would you recommend? I think cardup offer more options,btohqsg
Uob prvi miles is one of the better ones. You can read this article by cardup for other recommended cards to usehttps://blog.cardup.co/personal/best-air-miles-card-on-cardup/,btohqsg
Cardup also has a promo code for a discounted fee on rental payments,btohqsg
Thanks shifu for the recommendation. Didn‚Äôt know Cardup deal is so good. I have other bills to pay and hope to seek advice.Cardup PlanIncome tax: UOB PriviInsurance: ?Maintenance Fee: ?Any card to recommend for insurance and maintenance payment?Thanks in advance üôè,btohqsg
actually why not use citi payall for all of these? 2.2mpd  2.2% fee,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know Citi Payall can also pay maintenance fee  etc,btohqsg
Can pay anything u want  afterall you are paying a fee.,btohqsg
just need an account number to pay to.,btohqsg
Any idea how to withdraw money from webull? Intend to cash out The Tesla stock but with I went to withdraw  the amount is not reflected..,btohqsg
Have you sold the stock? There is also settlement period (I believe T+2) before the sale proceeds can be withdrawn.,btohqsg
Already pass the lock in period? If you withdraw before the lock-in period  you are risking your rewards.,btohqsg
