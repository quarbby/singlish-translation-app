Youtrip really has security issues. Caution to all to only keep balance inside when you plan to use soon. Don‚Äôt just park and forget. Looks like card lock feature is not guaranteed üòì,btohqsg
This should be the same for all mobile wallet,btohqsg
hi  does it count as online transaction if i pay for food via applepay through the food ordering website with CRMC?,btohqsg
Considered mobile wallet transaction with CRMC and will not earn 10X.,btohqsg
thanks and if i key in the card details then will be considered online right?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know why I couldn't register with Amex pay with my highflyer credit card?,btohqsg
Hi  may i know when u submitted the withdrawal?,btohqsg
"Hello I have question if I buy from Krisshop click via Kris+ app and the transaction states ""krispay*krisshoponline Singapore"" does this considered an SIA group transaction from the $800 spend for UOB krisflyer card",btohqsg
Hi  say if im dining and is those order and pay through the qr at the table  previously use crmc+amaze through apple pay is ok  now should use crmc but typed in details rather than apple pay. Is it right?,btohqsg
Ya type in your crmc details.,btohqsg
But for dining when you should tap your phone or card at the reader machine  that will not be considered as online. That why when Amaze got nerf  we will find a card that can replace for dining and shopping not online.,btohqsg
Received an email update from CF  but mine‚Äôs worded differently,btohqsg
Yes. They will use your USD first  and if it's not enough  will convert enough SGD to make the trade,btohqsg
wow interested added even during withdrawal period?,btohqsg
Not interest. Just some positive  capital appreciation due to ‚Äòmarket movements‚Äô from selling funds. It can be equally negative too,btohqsg
I suspect for this sensitive period  CF won‚Äôt want to further drive down consumer confidence by showing negative returns. Then confirm no more net new customers liao‚Ä¶,btohqsg
agreed. from a consumer‚Äôs pov  this is motivating and reinstates some confidence in CF (once they sort the mess out). If all turns out well their end after this fiasco  I will redeposit again.,btohqsg
do u all receive? i received the email  but my wife CF withdrawal no email yet  although both withdraw same time with few mins different,btohqsg
I got my fund back from CF,btohqsg
Withdrew 10th march 1030am   no email yet also.,btohqsg
According to CF statement  if your funds were deposited recently  it takes a longer time to withdraw as compared to the rest who had deposited their funds long time ago ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Had most of it in since September last year but did some withdraw top up here and there. Maybe they consider the last deposit date only.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok tho hopefully all good since people are getting theirs back.,btohqsg
which is shitty cos they ask you to deposit to confirm mode of withdrawal,btohqsg
also  if you look at transactions under profile  they will show when they sold your investments to send you money. mine shows sold on 11 Mar.,btohqsg
Received mine from CF! Gain $1 phew,btohqsg
Interesting. Mine has sells on 10th and 12th march but the amounts aren‚Äôt anywhere close to what I‚Äôd withdrawn,btohqsg
I deposit hundred on the day I withdraw. So i dont think this assumption valid?,btohqsg
lol no point guessing. Just trust the process and close this chapter üòÖ,btohqsg
Even if you deposit since day one but you recently received a referral reward  you will need to WAIT. that's the punishment you get for referring people,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask if using UOB lady card still can earn 3.6 miles for SPC petrol station?,btohqsg
For online spending  means any online spending  don't need to be the listed MCCs right?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone got use Ocbc infinity with atome before?Tried adding my card but keep saying try again later  but all my other cards no issue.,btohqsg
What do u mean? For HSBC Revo  only the MCCs listed TOGETHER WITH online payment will get the bonus (for e.g. it has to be a 5812 payment MADE ONLINE),btohqsg
Oh I see. Okok thanks. I thought any online spending.,btohqsg
Yea actually pretty trash card lol,btohqsg
I'm still finding an online spending  (not shopping category) card for both sgd and fcy that gives 4mpd. Alr exhausted my Citi rewardsMaybe DBS wcc but expiry 1 yr abit tight,btohqsg
UOB Visa Signature if u can hit the 1k min spend,btohqsg
Whoops mabad  yea online only for FCY at least it fulfills that part ü§£,btohqsg
yea provided can clock min 1k foreign spend,btohqsg
For the UOB Visa Signature  if I use AXS to pay my insurance via that credit card  will it be counted as spending to fufill the 1k min spend?,btohqsg
Mine is SGD but on foreign platform. Partially is foreign spend but just this alone cannot hit 1k. Total add up all online transactions monthly $4k averageBut all is online transactions. Not shopping category. Need a blacklist card  can't do whitelist,btohqsg
Oh  so it needs to be 1k worth of contactless payment in order to unlock the 4mpd,btohqsg
only blacklist 4mpd cards are citi rewards mastercard/visa and dbs wwmc  2mpd there are dbs wmc and chocolate card,btohqsg
1k worth of local spend that are not in exclusion list to get 4mpd for local contactless/petrol,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I know Chris made a video for payment of weddings using credit card for miles  but i believe there are alot changes to credit cards. Could I ask what is a good credit card to use for banquet now?,btohqsg
No problem for me lei. I added the ocbc infinity card after I gotten and activated the physical card.,btohqsg
More or less the same. Only thing changed was amaze + crmc having 1% fee now.,btohqsg
So still UOB Preferred Platinum+ UOB Visa Signature + UOB Lady (travel)?,btohqsg
Yes. Make use of signup bonus if you are new to any of the bank.,btohqsg
Okay what about Prvi Miles? Would it work too?,btohqsg
Yes. If you are new to UOB  get PRVI and pay 2k per month for 2 months. Remember to get Prvi approved first before getting other uob cards.,btohqsg
Icic  maybe my card still new. But able to purchase other things  v weird. Thanks tho!,btohqsg
You using the digital card? You can use it at most merchants except those that do not request for CVV check or something like that. You can read the TnC on OCBC website for the digital card.,btohqsg
Is there foreign currency transaction fee if use CIMB card in Malaysia?Their exchange rate good or not?Or better off just using Trust card,btohqsg
Any reason u choose CIMB card?,btohqsg
use maybank family and friends for 8% rebate,btohqsg
But also subject to foreign currency transaction fee? And the rate not as good ?,btohqsg
Move your spent to dbs wwmc first since citi rewards has longer span up to 5 years.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs very decent with the 8% cb. I use mbff for MYR transactions all the time,btohqsg
hello  can I check if double dipping in Maribank still works?,btohqsg
standard 3.25% fx fee and mastercard exchange rate,btohqsg
R u thinking 8% less 3.25% FX fee  still got 4.75% rebate ?,btohqsg
Yes. How much is your expected spend? MBFF 8% cb is cap at $313 spend. Even if exR is poor also wont move the needle much for smaller spends‚Ä¶ no need to be too particular with exR  the cashback would have more than offset,btohqsg
I just got this card and need to spend SGD 1300 to get sgd 200 cashback I'm gg ipoh over the weekend,btohqsg
wouldnt it be better to link to amaze to reduce the fx fees?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check for CIMB CC welcome promo  does buying fairprice vouchers count as qualifying spend?,btohqsg
I got my money from CF. Anyone else?,btohqsg
Wah ya now u mentioned  I notice the cvv I using is for digital haha. Now can le thanks!! üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya I withdraw on Monday. Just got it in my DBS. Heng ah. Lol. Still got like a tiny bit of interest sia,btohqsg
As they mentioned 8 days ?,btohqsg
Hi guys I'm checking UOB PPV or UOB lady card when linked to Disney app for Disney Premier Access at Tokyo Disneysea. Any transactions that goes through can get 4mpd ?,btohqsg
3-10 days. People withdrawing on Monday started to receive today,btohqsg
If mcc is right. Better test before making payment.,btohqsg
Hi can i check when using uob kf. Does paying for seats and airport taxes included in the min $800 spend?,btohqsg
yes if pay SQ or scoot,btohqsg
i have the UOB One card and just curious  if i miss the minimum spend for 1 of the months in my quarter  will that reset my quarters? eg. quarter is jan to mar  missed feb min spend  will my quarter change to mar to may instead? or is it the same? if it is the same will i get pro-rated cashback?will i still get cashback from the additional cashback? even for the month that didnt meet min spend?,btohqsg
No reset  statement quarter is fixed.If you spend below $500 for one statement month  then you have to wait for next statement quarter already.If you spend below $1000 for one statement momth  the remaining months in that statement quarter can just spend $500 to clock that tier cashback.Additional cashback is based on tier also  below $500 for any statement month then no more additional cashback.Exception is first statement quarter  they will pro-rate to the statement months that hit at least $500 if you have one statement month that did not hit $500.,btohqsg
so assuming i usually just spend $500 and in the quarter i miss 1 of the months. i will not get any cashback at all  including additional cashback?so if example my usual is jan to mar and if i miss feb  the quarter will not reset but i will not get any cashback for spending on mar too?is this understanding correct?,btohqsg
same gotten my money back from cf,btohqsg
Yes and you will also not get cashback for Jan.,btohqsg
so basically the whole quarter if i miss 1 month will not any cashback including additional cashback for the whole quarter uh?,btohqsg
damn thats quite punishing hope my transactions gets posted tmr  because i was overseas and didnt spend on this card for abt 2 weeks,btohqsg
Faster than my by 1 sec ü§£,btohqsg
When was your transaction made? And which merchant?,btohqsg
15th but my transactions over the past weekend up to today not posted yetüôÉ,btohqsg
I have not. Applied on 10 Mar.,btohqsg
Wait awhile bah. I just gonna keep using cf. Just as a spending acc instead of saving,btohqsg
from sunday till today still not posted  merchants are all eligible de i check alr. most of my spending on this card are eligible just have 1or 2 that i used wrong card,btohqsg
Are you in SG now  and do you have access to 7-11 or cold storage or giant nearby?,btohqsg
Not about eligible spend. What merchant?,btohqsg
if posted until ystd will be enough alr,btohqsg
yes now in SG i just spent $20 at 7-11 which if its posted by tmr will be enough alr,btohqsg
This is with or without the transactions from Sunday?,btohqsg
why specifically these 3 merchants? they get posted faster?,btohqsg
i am literally just abt $10 short after adding all the eligible spend that are alr posted,btohqsg
They usually post same day. Not all but some  especially those that are non 24/7  cuz they will do closing on that day.,btohqsg
Then you might be in time with the $20 spent at 7-11. Tomorrow you can check the app to see if posted.,btohqsg
oh icic  does it matter what time the transaction is made? or whenever they do their closing it will get posted alr?,btohqsg
Usually based on their closing time. Some dp states that some 24/7 outlet post next day. Nothing is black and white  just based on dps shared here.,btohqsg
icic thanks haha i just saw ystd that i am a little short and ystd was too busy. spent a little extra in case those that are not posted yet dont get posted but just did the calculations ok lah if those pending dont get posted the $20 still enough to cover,btohqsg
sory what is dp and dps?,btohqsg
Guys  I got this message trying to set up my amex pay. Any idea why ?,btohqsg
You just got your card? Need to wait for about 5 working days  I faced the same issue.Aft 5 working days then try again  if still like that then just delete and reinstall the app  then shd be able to go through alr,btohqsg
Hope you used card directly  not mobile wallet (eg Samsung pay),btohqsg
Card directly posts faster (I did that before on last day  worked),btohqsg
Got some dp that say it will post faster. But in my experience I never had to use physical cards  my Samsung pay transactions for same-day merchants (non-24/7 outlets) always post same-day.,btohqsg
oh damn didnt know  too used to just using mobile wallet to pay,btohqsg
I always use mobile contactless  so don't worry. You have 1 day buffer anyway.,btohqsg
Anyone knows when does the bonus 9x uni$ for the preferred rewards category for UOB lady be credited?,btohqsg
First working day of next month,btohqsg
Is this the section to monitor to see if I will get the SAVE bonus from OCBC 360?,btohqsg
"Yes. But you need to take note when it was ""last updated"" if you want to make adjustments.The safer option is to self track on excel.The safest option is to not touch the money after depositing $500 and transferring out salary.",btohqsg
has anyone tested mcc and didnt get charged 50 cents using amaze?,btohqsg
I tested on 10 Mar  no 50 cents charge.,btohqsg
note: i think UOB KF 1 8x miles multipler kicks in 1 year after ur sign up date i think,btohqsg
because its annually that they check whether u spent $800 on SQ or SCOOT,btohqsg
This was taken from UOB Prvi webpage. (https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/travel/prvi-miles-card.page)Is it true that UOB Prvi card can no longer earn ipaymy since Aug 2022?,btohqsg
Hi guys  with CF saga i intend to move my money somewhere. I already have UOB and OCBC and would like to have something similar like CF with flexibility and good interest rate. Can kindly advice? Thanks a lot,btohqsg
Sing investment and finance 2.5% GoSavers saving account...,btohqsg
ya one of the one that i m looking at  just curious if there is any other option,btohqsg
oh what is this? is it fixed or flexible saving?,btohqsg
Does OCBC usually give better sign up offers than this?,btohqsg
Ocbc is usually stingy so this is pretty good already,btohqsg
Ah understood  if currently am only a sub card holder. Still counts as new user right?,btohqsg
You already had saving accounts so what about SSB and tbills?,btohqsg
Yes still considered as new to ocbc credit card. Only principal card holder counts.,btohqsg
the reason is im trying to put the money in uob and ocbc unmoved in order to count the MAB easier  thus need a flexible one like CF for daily expense that have a lot of money movements with small amounts,btohqsg
same day returns if i rmb correctly.. returns only hi2% at the moment..,btohqsg
hi2% meaning 2%? isn't maribank slightly higher? or typo?,btohqsg
Ok for an account for daily expenses id suggest digital bank. Maribank saving account is decent. Don't treat cf like a bank please.,btohqsg
ic  ya 2.9% looks not bad  is it quite instant withdrawal? or need 24hours?,btohqsg
quite instant  same day as least,btohqsg
haha ya  been there done that  learnt my lesson... ya so far it seems maribank is more attractive to me for high movement in out savings account,btohqsg
hsbc has it as well but thats CASH fund not LIQUIDITY fund,btohqsg
only moomoo n webull got liquidity fund i think,btohqsg
got it  fund in moomoo is safe hor? like maribank has sdic is safe haha,btohqsg
Moomoo is not bank  I would say similar to CF.,btohqsg
ok got it  then i think i go for maribank for small fund <5000 a month and high in-out transactions... thank u all so much for the advice,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if there is 30% U.S. dividend withholding tax for the interest earned from treasury notes/bonds bought on platforms like tiger? How about buying TLT on IBKR?,btohqsg
Maribank dropping to 2.38% from 1 April onwards FYI. But probably still among the higher one for sdic insurred.,btohqsg
ya saw it from the website  that is also why im asking for advice here in case of any other option... i checked GXS also quite low,btohqsg
oh! let me check this up,btohqsg
At 5k  it's 4 dollars difference/month between 2.38% and 3.3%. Order 1 meat instead of 2 for 2 meals can already.,btohqsg
ya eat more vegetable healthier choice~,btohqsg
Is there a point to open up a uob one accountwhen I already have ocbc 360 account plus ocbc 365 ccAnd have a uob ladies card,btohqsg
how does it work? any site for reference?,btohqsg
Any good bond fund or mmf that is low risk  similar to Fullerton cash fund?Wanna park some money at a safer investment tool...,btohqsg
Its in the tnc so not sure what else you are looking for,btohqsg
Just open an account via their website and app. Wait for approval. Then deposit Ur money inside to grow interest loh,btohqsg
Hi there  take a look at this stock:United SGD Fund(SG9999001382)2.1322  Fall-0.02%Access real-time quotes on moomoo üëáüèªRide The Markethttps://www.moomoo.com/stock/18000837-MF?from=share&stockId=18000837,btohqsg

Anyone received their choc finance withdrawal since the saga? I withdraw on sunday night till now still no news..,btohqsg
Quite a lot got back about 5-6pm today.,btohqsg
I am looking for confirmation that ipaymy works for UOB Prvi miles card based on Seth post (https://sethisfy.com/guide-using-ipaymy-or-cardup-for-paying-bills-and-earning-card-rewards/amp/) despite the T&C state that it‚Äôs an exclusion,btohqsg
U want to trust a finfluencer over bank's t&c  up to u man. Bank is the one giving the miles ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èIn all seriousness  it's Seth's post u can ask him directly on his own telegram grp hahah,btohqsg
If the bank tnc state that is not possible then it is not possible. It is the bank prerogative and not Seth to decide on this. Now I can understand why many people panic over the Choco finance just based on a few videos üòâ,btohqsg
Hi  about paying Citi cc bill  does it count as paying on time if you made the payment before due date but it cant necessarily be posted on time (e.g. not processed over weekend) ?,btohqsg
Use fast to make sure your payment is immediate,btohqsg
The credit card company won‚Äôt know your payment is ‚Äúon the way‚Äù  you may be subject to late charges. My view,btohqsg
If I see my amount paid in the list of citi transaction  but it is still pending  is it ok?,btohqsg
Really depends on what Citi records as your payment date. What method did u use to pay?,btohqsg
Got get the message thank you for your payment?,btohqsg
Had a glimpse at his article and he didn't explicitly say prvi will earn from ipaymy.,btohqsg
I just used DBS‚Äô transfer to other bank‚Äôs card function  not sure if it‚Äôs under FAST,btohqsg
Yeah my bad for assuming that,btohqsg
I used uob priv visa with iPayMy. It works,btohqsg
If fast in. Will get thank you message immediately. But status seen in Citi app is pending. But can see immediately.,btohqsg
Seems like they circumvent it by changing its descriptors.,btohqsg
Ya so proceed with caution. You don't have any ground to appeal if you don't earn rewards later on,btohqsg
Hi  has anyone used Heymax to pay for Shopee? How long does it take for the max miles to appear in ur account? Does it show pending first? Or usually nth at all.,btohqsg
Yes. If you do correctly  it will take 1 full day to track. It will be pending for a while then change to confirmed later.,btohqsg
Hello  may I clarify if Card Up / iPayMy transactions are excluded from DBS Credit cards?And would you think these transactions could be used for the DBS welcome bonus as well?,btohqsg
get base points. welcome bonus depends on TnC,btohqsg
Not certain about this coz Kris+ transactions don‚Äôt count toward the SIA group spend. Your best guess might be to ask UOB but doubtful they will give u a clear answer.My take is it won‚Äôt count toward the. $800 spend,btohqsg
Hi  is eGiro link to bank account on GXS feature unavailable?,btohqsg
Seems that it‚Äôs not available. I previously tried a few times. Not able to set up,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best option to pay school fees  insurance premiums  tax etc and earn miles / rewards,btohqsg
chocolate card (linked to heymax) for 2 max miles per dollar for first $1k in the month  0.4 max miles per dollar thereafter,btohqsg
In more news  their custodian bank is not hsbc or state street which was what they said  but allfunds,btohqsg
Sure  any other options for over $1k?,btohqsg

Hi guys  regarding the Amaze nerf  if for low spending (<$50)  no minumum spend  and contactless  is chocolate card the next best option?,btohqsg
What would be the next option? üòÖ,btohqsg
PPV? But honestly <$50 spending a month not worth having a miles card for that option unless you have pooling  as you have high risk of orphan milesPersonally I would just go with a cashback card like DCS Platinum MC or Maribank CC,btohqsg
Oh i meant below 50 per transaction  but spending of below 1k a month,btohqsg
unless your transactions are all v small < $5 per transaction then not worth it,btohqsg
Anyone can summaries the chocolate saga?The previously unlimited miles is 2mpd as heymax miles?,btohqsg
Hi Guys  for UOB Visa Signature card u need to spend $1000 per month on FCY. If I didn't meet the FCY spending  will I still enjoy the 4 mpd for the $1000 local spend?,btohqsg
the cvv is 4 digit in front of card?,btohqsg
2mpd up to 1k per calendar month.,btohqsg
on CF app does anyone see 'sell transactions' once you have requested for withdrawal under SGD fund transactions?,btohqsg
Hi all  for UOB visa signature Local spending is capped at $1000 or $2000 for 4mpd?,btohqsg
local and foreign combined cap $2k,btohqsg
So if i spend $2000 local via contactless  i will get 8000miles (4mpd x $2000)?,btohqsg
This is a reply to this question.,btohqsg
Sorry   but is this something new for uob visa? How is it that i did not know. Lol. Coz i just got uob ppv,btohqsg
Nope  it‚Äôs similar to UOB Preferred plat card,btohqsg
You can watch Chris' video on this.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs a good one of those 1.x% cashback card you guys use to catch all these small transactions? MariBank rejected my application lol,btohqsg
You can use uob vs if total spend is above 1k or uob lady if mcc is right,btohqsg

Decent amount. That is good too. What do u use for public transport? Unless u're driving,btohqsg
Im using heymax + CF üòÅ. I have like 30$ inside.,btohqsg
Just wondering if anyone has encountered this issue before. I was trying to transfer miles from my Citibank credit card to my FFP program. Usually it takes around 2 working days to receive. It has now been more than 14 working days since I did that redemption and the miles are still not in,btohqsg
Contacted Citibank and they said they need another 3 to 5 working days to investigate,btohqsg
Contacted both citi and Eva both tell me to contact the other party  it's driving me nuts,btohqsg

I notice there still quite a numbers who use cc on wrong mcc. The other day I saw a lady use dbs woman Mastercard on contactless dining. Today I saw an elderly uncle use dbs live fresh on Koufu breakfast. Can‚Äôt blame them though. With so many nerds & changes happening so fast. There still a lot who just use it as no frill general spendings without caring for points..,btohqsg
Just received email from CFJust to let you know ‚Äì There was a slight negative change in your portfolio value from the point of withdrawal until you get your money. We value your trust  so while this isn‚Äôt standard practice  we‚Äôre covering the difference on just this occasion to ensure you have a seamless experience while our liquidity programme is paused.They said they will cover the difference wor.,btohqsg
hi guys.. question.. with the CF nerf meaning our tax can't be using CF card to pay off already right?,btohqsg
Even for below 20/50k also need to suffer negative change? Or only for the amount above the 3.3%/3% rates,btohqsg
I guess it all depends on the unit price√ónumber of units holding= total we receive.,btohqsg
The cashback usually is credited to your account in actual cash? After u tap out,btohqsg
rcvd same thing  but said the funds come in 5pm onwards today,btohqsg
Just received my funds. Out of goodwill they covering the differences,btohqsg
I have negative balancing item. I wonder can I withdraw this amount when I closed my account since this is clearly outperformed funds,btohqsg
That is how they earn money,btohqsg
I did received outperformed money previously. Only this time round they lock it,btohqsg
can I know you submitted withdraw request on 10th march?,btohqsg
Yup. I going to close the account see will I get remaining ‚Äúoutperformed‚Äù funds,btohqsg
I guess on outperformed funds they will charge fee as well  as per FAQ on CF,btohqsg
I just realised it‚Äôs for the whole year. Maybe I should wait until sept then close the account.,btohqsg

Hi  for Mari Credit Card  can I clarify if the foreign transaction fee is 3% but the cashback is 3%  does it simply mean that for foreign transactions it amounts to 0% foreign transaction fee? Thanks!,btohqsg
I know roughly how the funds work  redemption timeframe for mmf type funds are typically 3-5 days. I think the cause of concern is mismanagement and miscalculation at their end which is a worry. They did not keep their promise of instantaneous withdrawals due to huge amounts of withdrawals from investors.. i think is unexpected from CF. Am a late joiner of CF  after considering the credentials of the CEO and also the instantaneous withdrawals attraction. No doubt  there is alot of talk about the risk is not deserving. To me  is a smaller start up that works like any other fund house thus putting money in.I will wait abit longer  when CF is ready and has strengthened their management execution and not wobbly like now  then I will consider putting my funds back in.,btohqsg
yes but they have 4.5% rebate promo now,btohqsg

Stability matters. All firms start small. No one fund house comes in big  strong‚Ä¶ takes time to build trust  execution by the team  management  look at Aberdeen Group. The difference is the evolving ways of investments.. over the years where usage of apps are more prevalent  speed is a necessity to most  funds transfers etc and expectations of investors. No one knows Lehman will collapse.. is unexpected  and based on its repute  is shocking. Nothing comes free  higher interest rates come with a cost  but the question is whether you want to take the bait. Do the necessary due diligence and find the answer yourself.Interest rates are declining everywhere  is not slashes/ cuts of interests from one firm  CF. All banks do that abruptly.,btohqsg
CF did not manage this appropriately. Corporate Governance is the key.. and many times the failures led to collapse of FIs. So other than the credentials of the management  time will tell whether they manage their systems  process well,btohqsg

"But no banks have ever stopped the usage of their debit cards.To me the biggest issue is that they have no integrity.First they blamed AXS for ending that mode of payment (which they later quietly changed the reason)  and second blame the customers for being ""too smart"" instead of admitting that they didn't think through their program.The termination/suspension of instant withdrawal and then the use of debit card is also an example that they are not able to handle money management business.The boss should return to managing insurance and stay away from money management.You have your own views and requirements but they are different from mine.We just have to accept that they are different.",btohqsg
I don‚Äôt deny your stance.Let‚Äôs just see whether they improve holistically from a management point of view. Trust is built over time.,btohqsg

Yes cos annual limit is 104k. 20% of that is 20400(which is your own contribution NOT factoring in your employer). This is also assuming you only have one job paying you CPF,btohqsg
Then need to calculate carefully before hitting FRS and make full use of the $37740-$20400=$17 340 yearly to maximise the tax relief. Once hitting FRS  this tax relief door is closed.,btohqsg

In my layman view without providing any financial advice:I don‚Äôt like chocolate because they rugpull on their card being used at axs to earn rewards when they were the ones to openly advertise it.But in all fairness chocolate was never in any serious trouble which cannot be resolved if given enough time to sell their investment holdings in line with their policies.The instant withdrawal feature was actually clearly mentioned in their tnc to be a bonus feature which could removed anytime and customers will get back their money only during the usual funds settlement period.Remember when u put money into chocolate  your funds are invested into funds.Not investment advice just saltiness from granny.,btohqsg

both in-app apple pay and contactless apple pay are disqualified,btohqsg

Both have pros and cons. Dbs only valid one year but can use for travel. Citi can last 5 years but cannot use for travel.,btohqsg
yup  so hard to pick yet doesnt make sense to keep both haha,btohqsg
I find one year validity is too short and I don‚Äôt travel frequently so I prefer Citi. Atome works for Citi.,btohqsg
I would keep both  use for different purpose,btohqsg
i dont spend that much to keep both  need to strategise haha.. unless annual fee always waive successfully,btohqsg

Hi guys how to pay income tax with Citi pay all ya? Have anyone tried yet.? Currently still on giro,btohqsg
Wait for the promo to be out.Many tried before. Haha,btohqsg
Ah okay so mean whileJust continue giro first ?,btohqsg
Oh your giro already started?The current rates not that attractive,btohqsg
Previously I amOn giro so it‚Äôs like auto giro from April onwards too,btohqsg
I can half way stop giro and use Citibank ? Am stillNew to this,btohqsg
My understanding is if you pay earlier than the giro deduction date  they won‚Äôt deduct your giroI think is 5 days before the deduction date? But others can chime in.,btohqsg
Better do it 7 days before the deduction  which is 6th every month. Usually setup payment the month before. Keep giro as backup.,btohqsg
pay at least 1 week before giro deduction,btohqsg
hi all . citi smrt can pair with card up?,btohqsg
Guys  I have a question. Would u pay off your HDB loan way before it's due if u can afford to? I guess the reason to do this is because this removes the need to pay interest incurred. The downside to this is cash flow or cash on hand will be affected. I would like to hear the views from members here.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure u can get higher returns than 2.6% with your cash on hand right.Now put into bank savings accounts still more than 2.6%,btohqsg
Glad you had confirmation from them.just curious have you submitted request on 10th or 11th?,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong. Their plans only have 4G network?,btohqsg
Hello! Could I ask if the HSBC EGA 1% cashback program also applies to GIRO payments for income tax?,btohqsg
He literally said 5G in his original message,btohqsg
Unless is because you have too much cash on hand. And you are a super poor investor and also super cannot control spending. Then maybe it good. Otherwise. Make totally no sense to repay hdb loan.This is not financial advice,btohqsg
Is paying Tax on Cardup for next month onwards still 1.8%? I see their website is till 26 Mar 2025 onlyIn that case isnt ipaymy cheaper?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  a noob question please. For uob lady's miles calculation  is it based on posted or transaction date within the calendar month please?,btohqsg
CardUp is cheaper even at 1.85% fee unless you charge at least $1000 per payment  when compared to ipaymy at 1.75% fee.,btohqsg
But no more 1.8% after this month. I see Chris got 1.75% code for ipaymy tax via VISA,btohqsg
unless ipaymy got other fees not listed on their site,btohqsg
To reach $1 with 0.1% fee is $1000.,btohqsg
Their fees are stated clearly on the site  especially when you key into the system,btohqsg
Just checked. The $10.10 that is paying is a 4G network or 90 days 5G if port in from non Singtel. Wondering how he manage to get 5G forever by paying $10.10,btohqsg
When they upgrade the plan  they will also adjust the price based on the plan it's referencing to. So more benefits at cheaper rates.,btohqsg

Sorry gurus another dumb question. I have booked a hotel stay with agoda using the lady's card. Payment would be in April so am I right that it would not eat into my current month limit of $1000 please?The reason being i have hit almost 900 for my trip booking this month and I probably need to spend another 500 on accommodation.Is it advisable to charge the accommodation bookings to April if that is the case (I am thinking of changing my category to dining for next quarter originally as my trip booking is almost and I would not likely be spending on travelling in may and June.)I am holding the uob kf card as well. Would like to seek your views please. Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG I noticed there hasn‚Äôt been a review on the BOC SmartSaver account  even though it seems to offer better returns than UOB One.If I deposit $100 000  credit my salary (‚â•$2 000)  spend $500 on an eligible card  and make three GIRO payments  here‚Äôs how the interest rates compare:BOC SmartSaverBase interest: 0.40%Card spend bonus: 0.50%Salary crediting bonus: 2.50%Payment bonus: 0.90%Total interest: 4.30% p.a.Total earnings: $4 300/yearUOB OneFirst $75 000: 3.00%Next $25 000: 4.50%Total effective interest: 3.375% p.a.Total earnings: $3 375/yearIt seems BOC SmartSaver offers better returns  yet I haven‚Äôt seen a review on it. Did I miss any key points  or has this already been covered?Looking forward to your thoughts!,btohqsg
The bonus uni is capped by calendar month on your preferred category.,btohqsg
Exactly my thoughts! I have been using this for almost 2 years now,btohqsg
if march you almost hit the 1k  then yes it would be wise to have your travel payment to be in april.,btohqsg
Oh I am hoping to change my category for the next quarter as my only booking for my trip would only be like another 500 for the whole of the next quarter. Thus I would like to ask is it advisable for me to charge the 500 to my uob kf card instead. Though it seems like a senseless question.,btohqsg
I'd charge it to uob KF tbh as long as you can hit 800$ spend on SIA group,btohqsg

Yeap. To each its ownSome of us are risk takers n willing to take the spreadSome prefer to have peace of mindNot too long ago when interest rates are so low that a lot of people on HDB loan switched to bank loan.

The pricing not in public site?https://www.ipaymy.com/sg/en/pricing,btohqsg
From their FAQ. With the default 2.25% fee (no promo).,btohqsg

ipaymy 1.75% + $1 vs cardup 1.85%https://t.me/HMSGHive/2295,btohqsg
Keen to know if this is possible,btohqsg
The calculation of cpm is not accurate .Remember the fee pays to card up will also earn miles. So uob priv is actually 1.3 cent cpm for 1.85% fee,btohqsg

I think to maximise benefit if I have 150k  I would go for uob one unless boc offers the same interest rate with no limit.,btohqsg
Short term maybe. Long term no.Reason due to chance of missing gold. Don't think they have ÊìçËäÇat all. No surprise if gold at fort knox only left a bit.Same go to England as well.So this will result gold might have 2 pricing in the futures.Physical gold and financial instrument gold. One go up and the another one crash big time.Of course it might not happened at all. As no one will did the audit to burst the lies. Until black swan happened.

Well in that extreme situation u can always refinance the hdb loan with bank loan and increase thequantumtenor if u need cash urgently and don‚Äôt want sell.So the instalment per month may be lower if the loan tenor is increased.,btohqsg

Anybody heard any news about the HSBC Live+ extending its bonus 3% cash back?,btohqsg
i think someone mentioned in this chat or the others no more extension let me see.,btohqsg
The situation discussed earlier was the hdb owner needs cash urgently and forced to sell hdb as cannot increase loan.I‚Äôm saying in that situation the hdb owner can certainly switch to bank loan and increase the quantum.Anyway I‚Äôm pretty sure u can approach bank to extend a secured loan against a fully paid up hdb. I think it could be called equity loan or reverse mortgage. Whatever the official namingis.,btohqsg
Anyone here has managed to successfully appeal to buy a HDB less than 30 months after sale of private property ?,btohqsg
Yeah sure. Maybe you are more sure that there is a bank that can take an equity loan against a HDB property.Or even HDB allows an equity loan against the fully paid flat. (I am quite sure he wrote fully paid),btohqsg
Well the answer is no. You cannot cash out from the fully paid up HDB,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I thought too. It is a special asset class,btohqsg
If I am not wrong it cannot be touched by creditors when the owner(s) is(are) bankrupt. (Much like CPF monies,btohqsg
Possibly. Too many rules for HDB,btohqsg
Yeap that is correct  no equity loan permissible for hdb and creditors cannot seize hdb during bankruptcy,btohqsg
I just went to re read on hdb flat loan rules. And yes what was discussed further is correct.You cannot increase your hdb flat‚Äôs loan amount beyond the existing loan amount (even when switching from hdb to bank loan). You cannot get a loan against a fully paid up hdb flat too.TLDR: always take the maximum hdb loan and never repay it early even if u have extra cash. It‚Äôs the cheapest long term loan you can obtain in your life.Not bespoke financial advice. It‚Äôs common sense.,btohqsg
Probably case by case. I remember some newspaper article mentioned can appeal.,btohqsg

Have WeChat pay installed. Both apps have multiple credit card. And just bring some spare RMB.  So far only one time  my app cannot work in metro station in Shenzhen but strangely can use in department store and dinning. Had to use cash to buy ticket.,btohqsg
went in Jan  prefer to use baidu > gaode though  just type in english usually they auto translate for u if its a tourist hotspot.i prefer alipay over wechat but theres 3% fees for over 200rmb for both so can ask to split bill.dianping app for vouchers at those hotpot or drinking spotsmeituan for food delivery (have their first time order promo n vouchers too)xiaohongshu to look for places to go ü§£,btohqsg
Hi all  for setting up cardup to pay for insurance like prudential  how to prevent double charge as I need to have existing recurring payment method?Is it set up the cardup to pay at least 1 day earlier than my current arrangement with the same credit card?,btohqsg
Those food delivery apps provided you have China numbers to use. I use roaming data over there.,btohqsg
Ahh sounds good! Thanks for the tip to bring cash,btohqsg
oh mine no issue tho  i just log in with wechat  but hit or miss,btohqsg
Ohh WeChat doesn‚Äôt have 3% fees?,btohqsg
oh both have 3% fees but i just feel alipay more strsightforward cuz the pay logo right at the home page,btohqsg
Some vouchers will require to sent notifications to a number and it must be a China number. There is one time I wanted to use Luckin coffee voucher but they need a China number to receive notification. Give up and bought the more expensive Starbucks coffee.,btohqsg
Agreed Alipay is better. WeChat pay is for standby only.,btohqsg
ah yes  i had the luckin staff help me to buy on her phone and i wechat her the money ü§£ and they get more discounts too with chinese number,btohqsg
but rlly convenient compared to paynow/paylah  rather have alipay in sg üòÖ,btohqsg
If in Shanghai  buy the 3 day pass at the metro station at the airport itself.  For Shenzhen  we flew to Hong Kong and took ferry there,btohqsg
standby wechat pay if u wan to pay street vendors as they will usually whip out their phone for you to pay direct to their wechat acc  didnt try if it works using alipay though,btohqsg
just curious  i tried using wechat paired w my CC in singapore  but it doesnt seems to work when i ask the Scarlet Supermarket cashier to scan my QR code.am i pairing it wrong?,btohqsg
ele.meÈ•ø‰∫Ü‰πà can be used for food delivery if u r using sg number,btohqsg
Am heading to Guangzhou  any tips for travels within this would be great too!,btohqsg
thrs prepaid transit card on apple wallet if ure using iphone if u prefer not having to open close the alipay transport option cuz might fumble if ure right at the tap in n tap out so best to prep beforehand,btohqsg
i think wechat doesnt work in sg linked to ccüòÖ only chinese bank acc  tried in daiso previously doesnt work as well,btohqsg
Have this same issue with Alipay in Singapore  I can‚Äôt seem to scan any QR in Hawker Centers  is it the same for the rest ?,btohqsg
maybe targeted at foreigners as thats their main form of payment  i didnt change any cash and went empty handed,btohqsg
Wechat Pay outside of chinese mainland only works for Chinese nationals,btohqsg
oh then does alipay work in sg?i am travelling to shanghai end of year  i dont wanna be caught blind sided if the payment method dont work,btohqsg
The error will clearly say overseas payment for China mainland real name verified users only,btohqsg
Bring cash if you scared lor,btohqsg
alipay doesnt work in sg as well but so far ill say most likely if no technical issues it shd work in china,btohqsg
So unless you have a mainland IC and mainland union pay card no Alipay or weixin outside china,btohqsg
do they still accept cash? i keep hearing that they no longer accept cash,btohqsg
wechat/alipay/trip.comhas a prepaid card option under unionpay if u worried the cc link doesnt work,btohqsg
so basically just go to china and it will magically work?haha its my first time so kinda having anxiety over this payment thing,btohqsg
okay i hope smooth trip for me too üòÖ,btohqsg
It is meant for Chinese tourist visiting Singapore. So they don‚Äôt get culture shock of having to use cash?,btohqsg
For Shanghai  I use Alipay with no issue. Just have multiple credit cards linked to it  sometimes credit card companies will overzealous block thinking it is a scam. It happened to me first time in China when I use trust credit card.,btohqsg
okay then i'll just use Alipay with wechat as standby,btohqsg
You can use paylah directly via unionpay qr at malls etc  the street stalls don‚Äôt accept it. Exchange rate was very competitive,btohqsg
wah thanks!! that is also good data!!!,btohqsg
does anyone have issues adding cf card to spaylater?,btohqsg
Buy their 3 day metro pass at the station at airport. You can access city and their interest within with the trains. I never need to take their car,btohqsg
Is it expensive to use didi if there are say 3ppl,btohqsg
anyone know good card to use in indonesia?,btohqsg
3 pax and above just take didi,btohqsg
Use their local gao de taxi  dirt cheap,btohqsg
Thank you both! Appreciative of all these tips üôè,btohqsg
Remember to report last 4 digits of your phone number to the driver,btohqsg
Hi all  eight sim card can work in china shanghai?,btohqsg
Ohh what‚Äôs the purpose of this Chris! Is it some security thing! And what if I don‚Äôt have a china registered phone number!,btohqsg
Verification to the driver to confirm passenger. Register using SG number will do,btohqsg
Hey  I will recommend at least 10 working days. Setting it for payment the day before will almost certainly trigger your giro/card payment.I could be on the cautious side but I have been reliably using CardUp for Prudential for awhile now.,btohqsg
may i know can i meet the eligibility of spend criteria if i pay the enrichment class fee by UOB one or OCbC 365 credit card installment?,btohqsg
Any card recommendation to pay tax?,btohqsg
Hi all   what is cardup ? Is this a debit or credit card ?,btohqsg
Anyone have experience wif stashaway's private credit? Positive returns so far?,btohqsg
Hi  for mortgage payment using cardup  if the actual monthly mortgage is $3000  is it possible to only set up to pay $2000 through cardup (ie partial payment through cardup)?,btohqsg
for prudential can use credit card pay directly via prudential ipay (or set up recurring payment via pru access) no need set up cardup,btohqsg
Does anyone know what‚Äôs the MCC for in-app purchases on Apple App Store/Google Play Store?,btohqsg
HeyMax and Dobin don‚Äôt seem to have App Store‚Äôs MCC and Google interprets it as ‚ÄúApple Store‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúApp store‚Äù,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check if we hold both DBS altitude visa and citi premiermiles which allows 2 visits each to priority pass lounges  does it mean we have up to 4 visits a year or do they overlap?,btohqsg
I was thinking if it only counts as 2 even if we have both cards because both are under priority pass,btohqsg
5816 for game apps in google play. could be other mcc if non-games.btw if you charge to phone bill it becomes telco mcc (obviously),btohqsg
They do  worst case no change,btohqsg
You have to create 2 diff accounts so u hv 4 visits,btohqsg
do you think CPF annual limit will increase next year ? based on next year 8k cap  only 6k of bonus will attract cpf which is quite damn little. last time based on 6k cap  up to 5month bonus got contribution. for next year will be less than 1 month üòÆ,btohqsg
You need to get 2 priority pass cards. One tagged to dbs  other tagged to citi. Both prioritypass cards will have different serial numbers. When using  rmb to tag the right prioritypass to the right credit card.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can help to confirm my understanding?How Kris+ reads transaction:1) Kris+ payment are all in-app I.e ApplePay Google Pay2) Kris+ payment are consider online transaction3) Kris+ payment retains the same  original MCC of the inherent merchant.Question:I can use Kris+ for Dinning (9mpd) and stack with my UOB lady (dinning 6mpd) category to earn 15mpd yaOr I can use Kris+ for retail  online spend with UOB visa signature up to $2kOr PPV up to $1 110. (Consider with Kris+) ?,btohqsg
1. Yes2. Yes3. Mostly yes but some cases mcc are different (like travel companies)Uob lady doesnt care payment method  only mcc so can use with kris+. Beware of mcc.Uob vs doesnt give bonus miles for online sgd transactions so no.Uob ppv only gives bonus miles to selected whitelist for online transactions. Check tnc.,btohqsg
uob lady is 4mpd+ 2 mpd only of keep 10k in lady account,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs intentional.It‚Äôs currently just left pocket right pocket now with no significant increase to employers.If they raise the CPF annual limit  employers will have to fork out significantly more for the employer contribution portion. Sure make noise.,btohqsg
Thanks ya both guys; yes I have activated the 2k mpd.Ok will take note for VS and PPV So generally dinning and hotel for UOB lady generally ok.Btw the travel MCC will change to other MCC ah? How was your experience,btohqsg
Recently got dp at Natas fair‚Ä¶Kris+ chan brother is 4722.No guarantees it won‚Äôt change again!! Always test if big amount.,btohqsg
Ya for mcc sensitive card  always test mcc,btohqsg
Ok thanks guys. Btw side question; like how do you find the chat so fast; I‚Äôm trying to learn this telegram.Like some question and answers I see before  but when I wanna search üëÄ long time  any tips to searching or archive better,btohqsg

Hi all  just to clear up some confusion regarding overseas spending fx conversion and markup  correct me if mistaken:If using chocolate finance debit card : fx conversion is ~3.25% charged by VISA + fx markup is ~0% charged by chocolateIf using citi rewards + amaze : fx conversion is ~3.25% charged by MASTERCARD + fx markup is ~0.3% charged by citibank - ~1% discount on fx conversion by amaze,btohqsg
Hi gurus (including@ChrisHMSG)  would like to check  for online payment in THB (> than SGD 1K) for Thailand hotel stay  which is the best lobang?1) Amaze wallet2) Amaze + CRMC (I'm am a miles chaser)3) Chocolate debit card (0 FX spread iirc?)4) Any others that I may missed out.,btohqsg
chocolate finance debit card using visa fx rate  markup about 0.3%-0.8%  no fx feesamaze+citi rewards  about 2.1% markup on top of mastercard fx rate (about 0.3% to 0.6%)  no further fees/discount,btohqsg
citi rewards exclude travel mcc e.g. hotel. For miles  consider using uob visa signature or uob lady/solitaire or dbs wwmc or chocolate debit card,btohqsg
Thanks  so you mean use uob lady / dbs wwmc directly and pay for the fx charged by cc and earn miles?,btohqsg
okthanks.  will do calculations based on $0.015 per mile to see if worth to pay the fx,btohqsg
note uob lady 4mpd capped for 1k spend  uob lady solitaire 2k.,btohqsg
should be $0.015 per mile not $0.15,btohqsg

Can i sum it up as such?Chocolate finance debit card : visa fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + chocolate fx markup 0.3%-0.8% = 0.6%-1.4% total feesCiti rewards + amaze : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + citibank fx markup 2.1% = 2.4%-2.7% total feesCiti rewards only : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + citibank fx markup 3.1% = 3.4%-3.7% total fees,btohqsg
She got the whole village to support her spending,btohqsg
Chocolate card no markup. So it's 0%.Naked Citi card is 3.25% fcy fee on top of Mastercard rate.,btohqsg
Chocolate finance debit card : visa fx rate 0.3%-0.8% (no further fees)Citi rewards + amaze : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + amaze fx markup 2.1% = 2.4%-2.7% total feesCiti rewards only : mastercard fx rate 0.3%-0.6% + citibank fx fees 3.25% = 3.55%-3.85% total fees,btohqsg

Hello  after watching videos and checking with my expenses. I intend to sign up for UOB visa signature and UOB PPV for offline purchases. It would make sense to use UOB visa signature first then UOB PPV right?Any sign up/ referral link for win-win situation?,btohqsg
Always use UOB visa signature first until you hit 2k.,btohqsg
Thank you for assuring me. Very worried I get it wrong and waste more opportunities üôè,btohqsg
For sign up  UOB only has good one for UOB PRVI with AF paying option if you are new to UOB. Else  just get the cards and spend away,btohqsg

What the best card for mile for big purchase cum traveling? (Anything above 1k)?,btohqsg
It isn‚Äôt as mathematical as this in Practice.The problem is master and visa only update their official rates a few times a daySo when u use the card at 12pm when their last fx update is 10am and there was a big market movement at 11am it might appear as if master or visa markup from fx spot rate is 1% for example.,btohqsg

Hi  what is the best bank/way to receive money in USD then convert to SGD? usually major banks has bad rate for currency conversion,btohqsg
Yes  but the interest is credited on last day of the month. For the next month  UOB shows how much you need to top up & maintain to get the interest. So its quite easy to manage  eg: it will show (Top up $x this month to earn your bonus interest. Balance to maintain: $y).,btohqsg
"You can check on the UOB Stash website or check with UOB if unsure.Not financial advice.This is the information I found on the uob stash website.""If you have performed withdrawals  you can still receive bonus interest when you top-up again within the same month. Simply login to UOB Personal Internet Banking or UOB TMRW to find out the required top up amount and balance to maintain for the month.""",btohqsg

$2000 x 4 mpd = 8k miles yes,btohqsg
