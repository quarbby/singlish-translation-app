Reason I won‚Äôt q buy after it movedI will remove q if never getBecause out of 3 scenarios I will only benefit from 1Scenario 1: run without me go to skyScenario 2: come down hit me and drop furtherScenario 3: come down hit me and go upBy probability only 1/3 chance can make $So unless very sure is good support price or prepare to pick upI don‚Äôt give myself such credit for picking bottom so I refrainTo each his ownScaredy cat usually die slowestI just like to play probability,btohqsg
Well said bro üëç if missed and don‚Äôt get right away after a quick rally   also will remove it.This is very good advice üôèüèª,btohqsg
Always about the momentum  best is to follow and join it,btohqsg
Vested in Vicplas and looks like have buyers at 240 - 250 range. Upcoming dividends. Not much but still a consistently dividend paying company. When choosing long term counters  always good to look for those who pay dividends consistently. Anyways  I expect medical to have some play soon and this one should have good chance as I believe the recent buying is accumulating play. Good luck. DYODD,btohqsg
Will Yinda cross 0.09 this afternoon?,btohqsg
PanUnited. ($0.285)I have been eyeing this one for long time. Watching the PA for a while and it somewhat similar to when I mentioned and shared on Hanwell and it was Stucked $0.200/$0.205. Then the play came.I got a good feeling about this one. This one limited downside. Good company. But for those who can hold.,btohqsg
