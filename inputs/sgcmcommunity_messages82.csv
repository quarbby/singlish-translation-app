I doubt I’ll driveaway with a Polestar with this experience. But@arnavgulianishould we get the mini to drive when I have it so he buys one?,btohqsg
let me undercut then i charge $800 for a week,btohqsg
easily cover the installment and maybe can sell the car for a profit,btohqsg
thats an expensive test drive for a week,btohqsg
worth to rent for a week? maybe.Worth to lease? only if you drive alot. Increase mileage on a car decreases resale and battery health  which affects resale  maint etc...,btohqsg
Model 3 lease is also close to 4k a month,btohqsg
Considering the road tax and insurance premiums  actually not paying a lot more for peace of mind,btohqsg
Paying 4k a month for car is never worth it,btohqsg
Unless you're an expat with everything covered by company,btohqsg
Pay 4 k a month to sit at the cafe wait for car to charge,btohqsg
i have a friend leasing long term from wearnes a Polestar 2 LRDM,btohqsg
his mileage easily 50-60k a year,btohqsg
Well…not a Model 3 or a Polestar...,btohqsg
Charge 45mins  30 customers will pump petrol and pay at counter and smile at u and ur 4k a mth.,btohqsg
What the fudgination does he do…?,btohqsg
imagine the battery health after 2 years 😂😂😂,btohqsg
i think it make sense ba,btohqsg
How I wish my company pays for the car,btohqsg
WHAT!!! WHERE DO I SIGN UP!,btohqsg
Cost of owning a tesla sr+ for a monthDepre 20k/yr = 1.7k/mthRoad tax 3k/yr = 250/mthInsurance 3k/yr = 250/mthTotal = 2.2k/mthNot factoring loan interest  petrol savings  and other misc stuffs. Last yr when i checked there was lease rates of 3.5k/mth.So to me  its not a lot to pay for ev experience.,btohqsg
I could use an extra $1K and still get to drive the Polestar,btohqsg
Oh. Have to pay ah. Thought they pay me so good,btohqsg
HAHAHA free rental plus get paid 1k. where to find?,btohqsg
I thought SGCM rocks one mahh 😅,btohqsg
hahhaha if anything sgcm can do that for toyota cars only,btohqsg
I’ll take whatever I can get sir 😊😊,btohqsg

i believe the ARF less than 20k after rebates,btohqsg
Actually  what's the diff between omv and arf?,btohqsg
"and while the arf is ridiculously low  also means purchase price ""lower""",btohqsg
without the rebate we probably pay 45k more,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admin  the total basic cost dont add up,btohqsg
total basic cost should be 156208,btohqsg
government say want to promote ev but AD come out this kind of pattern.... lets just stick to V8❤️❤️,btohqsg
they will have to close down if they cant make their ev price competitive,btohqsg
aiya govt also dont 100% committed to EV  why still impose fuel tax,btohqsg
to recoup your rediscover voucher 😈😈,btohqsg
the formentor 190 is now going for 13% premium,btohqsg
but they dont have the AWD one?,btohqsg
I think Mr mini will throw some signs in our face and say a few words when he hears the pricing,btohqsg
Even then  how is he driving all the time. I would assume his car would need to be stopped more often?,btohqsg
190 is also awd i think,btohqsg
but the 310 vz not listed anymore,btohqsg
but still have ex stock and can indent i believe,btohqsg
They've been heavily marketing hertz lease programs in their Facebook and Instagram recently,btohqsg
just saw this in my feed,btohqsg

Kinto leasing ads haven't hit sgcm pages as much yet,btohqsg
More through the articles and videos,btohqsg
saving up when coe hits 60k,btohqsg
need to prepare extra 20k more mods haha,btohqsg
How we wait for this time,btohqsg
With a shortlist full of cars,btohqsg
But with migration you get added costs,btohqsg
And probably end up paying higher taxes,btohqsg
You save on something but you lose it elsewhere  unless you're stable enough to go anywhere you want and not worry about finding an income source there,btohqsg
i'de be homeless but with 10 cars,btohqsg
and then you realise some cars are already the price of your house😢😢,btohqsg
Does laundromat runs in his Veyron,btohqsg
i stopped following stradman for a while,btohqsg
Arf amount is base on omv   the higher the omv the more arf u pay   if our car omv is like 80 k and above your arf is more then coe,btohqsg
Cars above 80 k omv are luxury car,btohqsg
Like 7 series s class and above,btohqsg
Ev can’t earn servicing money ma haha dealer eat what,btohqsg
He's waiting for his house now and delving into modern classics and classics,btohqsg

Anyone driving Glb200? How's the experience? I may want to get one😅,btohqsg
1 year ago they offered GLB200 AMG Line for $160k,btohqsg
2 years ago PI offered 149k,btohqsg
its a decent ride  jack of all trades but master of none,btohqsg
tht time shld jitao buy 10,btohqsg
the 1.3L can feel a little strained when carrying mid to full load  but shld have no issues for city driving  just maybe step harder if want to overtake haha,btohqsg
shall not speak of the driving dynamics since its a people carrier which can average 13-14km/L,btohqsg
hahahaha the dealer shortage of stock  even cancelled some orders and refunded deposits,btohqsg
149k incl coe  and when coe shot up  they probably made losses,btohqsg
Many deal breakers last time  not sure about now. Panel gaps on every GLB i see  Interior feels very cheap leh. Alot of mechanism in the car doesnt feel like it will last 10 years LOL. The car design also isnt the best. Recently i think they had a recall for the car because some will catch fire iirc,btohqsg
Also the 1.3L engine is tune to be very torquey up to 3k rpm  after that bor lat,btohqsg
can still make 80k each car,btohqsg
are they still having shortage now?,btohqsg
quite a bit plastics everywhere but generally still good  still got soft leather and alcantara-ish and aluminium bits here and there,btohqsg
no la  back then they shortage cos cut losses i believe,btohqsg
but in general when it first launched  stock was limited  and was widely receievd  now shld be no issue,btohqsg
"i think the plastic was abit too much for me compared to its ""competitor"".",btohqsg
3-4 yrs ago 200k can buy coe GTR,btohqsg
i think the 280k is really too much for me to stomach...,btohqsg
anybody who buy it is really a richie mannnn🤑🤑🤑,btohqsg
280k with no rear aircon too,btohqsg
there is a glb220d in the market for 220k,btohqsg
280k can only buy a base 3 series now,btohqsg
so a 7 seater sub does seem like a better deal,btohqsg
7 seater suv really limited choice,btohqsg
sorry i wont buy any merc cos i cannot afford anything e-class and above. Anything below E-Class really isnt worth it at this price point,btohqsg
why you dont like glb35 leh,btohqsg
2 years ago my friend bought Mazda 6 at 90k  now I think 160k plus,btohqsg
for the right price point  i think okay,btohqsg
like if A180 was 150k new,btohqsg
can buy GTR liao make passenger squeeze in the boot,btohqsg
not trying to be pete but C-Class and lower you really kena shortchanged,btohqsg
But I don’t mind buy the w205 c class leh,btohqsg
no la to each their own,btohqsg
i scared ppl think i merc hater,btohqsg
if i said the thing u will clown me for days,btohqsg
but their pricing agent can send to imh liao siao liao,btohqsg

u come i help u paste on your civic,btohqsg
i buy from tb $10 nia,btohqsg
I almost burned my kia down because I tried diy,btohqsg

Hey guys  what do you think of MSIG insurance?,btohqsg
Cheap.buy2 yearYou avoid the 8 & 9 % gst,btohqsg
Shld be  because the car Infront will claim against your insurance.,btohqsg
If my car is in a carpark  no one driving… a car knocked me  and my car knocked into another,btohqsg
And if my insurance company claim all against rear car… that means my insurer and I do not need to pay anything… what justify the drop in ncd,btohqsg
If 2 years then ok but any workshop repair or their's?,btohqsg
Price about the same as NTUC if any workshop,btohqsg
Anyone has any experience with Volkswagen Polo/Golf? May consider getting one maybe with about 1-2 years left for work purposes. Wondering if it’s a good call or are there other hatchbacks worth looking into?,btohqsg
Don't over think 😅 you know the answer.Of cos parked car is different story.But if you in the car  in a chain collision  they always said you never keep a safe follow distance.Why NCD drop? Because kena claimed. Lose money.😅You can use your wife name  if she has full NCD to buy insurance  transfer the ownership to her.,btohqsg
Not sure  will check it out,btohqsg
Rented a fairly new Polo recently during an overseas trip and really enjoyed the drive. Definitely not expecting the same quality of ride with a much older car but want to make sure it’s fairly fuss free and reliable (which I’ve heard unfortunately Volkswagens are not) but wanted to gather more info before shopping around,btohqsg
Not sure ABT this.Life never fair.,btohqsg

I did consider a V40 myself in the past but they run a little over my budget back then! Volvos are gorgeous,btohqsg
If maintenance cost is bore by someone else  than Cheong for conti lo. If not  better be kind to your pocket. Uncertainties are high in the near future  better have some cash on hand. I owned VW before  maintenance is higher than Japs and Korean. So stick with Japanese if you want reliability.,btohqsg
Thank you! Don’t want to fuss with too high of maintenance so that is definitely a factory we need to seriously consider.,btohqsg
VW not too bad tbh  it's the golfs specifically that have issues thanks to certain owners and the way they keep their cars. *cough* doctor gearbox *cough*,btohqsg

nope  larger rims = larger tyres = thinner tyre profile (section height) = harsher ride,btohqsg
stock 1.4 golf impossible to feel bumpy unless your absorbers spoil,btohqsg
i thought it would improve on something,btohqsg
not always true. larger aftermarket rims can be lighter than smaller stock rims...,btohqsg
Sorry I forgot to add. Not just weight. Wheels with wider widths  and/or larger diameters will increase rolling resistance meaans you need more power to move those wheels.,btohqsg
you are also moving a larger diameter  which means you do more work by putting in more effort,btohqsg

Here's the issue  if everyone PPI then dealers also gonna start learning how to cheat the system or partnering with common workshops,btohqsg
cheat system cheat customer just to earn a extra buck and make others life harder,btohqsg
you 赚钱 (make money) so much only to unkowingly get cheated,btohqsg
Technically is not cheating  it's just glazing over details that should not be glazed over,btohqsg
You say cheat later they sue you,btohqsg

PPI is basically pre purchase inspection  bring to workshop or dealer of ur choice  get them to check the car etc etc make sure no hidden problems,btohqsg
dealer can accept this request? like bringing the car for pre purchase inspection?,btohqsg
But if they don't then don't buy the car 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Because they're probably hiding something or don't want to take any liability,btohqsg

I think he was about to change lane to the left  but saw the bike  miscalculated the bike location  and swerved to the right,btohqsg
Never let anyone know your next move,btohqsg
@SGCM_AdminI think there might be a mistake in the features of the Volvo 90 series. On the sgcm NEW car listing  it is indicated as no HUD but the newer models do have HUD.,btohqsg
Someone is looking for new car… rich,btohqsg

Still waiting for insurer surveyor to assess the car,btohqsg
Claim own damage first… to speed up process,btohqsg
There's always one who needs it more than the other,btohqsg
I remember reading an article from GIA Singapore  in an accident  claim from own insurance for repairs first. Thereafter dunno is it insurer or owner then file to claim the other party's. But then I thought usually drivers would claim opposite's for fear of penalty,btohqsg
But for chain collision  from what I gather,btohqsg
Front car will claim middle car,btohqsg
And middle car will claim last car,btohqsg
Ncd of middle car will be reduced even though not his fault,btohqsg
Why is it middle car not at fault?,btohqsg
And impact push middle car to knock front car,btohqsg
Actually is at fault  failure to keep safety distance,btohqsg
If you kept a safe distance and manage to NOT hit the front of the car in the event of sudden braking but then got rear ended and then hit the car in front  how?,btohqsg
And you can prove you kept a safe distance just that the front slammed on their brakes for whatever  cat run across the road..or rickshaw suddenly crash,btohqsg
i put then the screen crack,btohqsg
You put wrong side. If put outside  then it will protect the windscreen at the same time 😂😂,btohqsg
Put on roof so roof not too hot,btohqsg
Then would it be 50:50? 🤔,btohqsg
