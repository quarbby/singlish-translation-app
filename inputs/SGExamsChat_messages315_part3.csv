So if I wanna ask stuff about poly (coz I just ended my O's and wanting to go poly) I should go for poly bot?,btohqsg
Yep! Just head over to@PolyChatBotand select that you‚Äôre an incoming/prospective student under ‚ÄúMy Profile‚Äù (and under ‚ÄúMatch Settings‚Äù  you can choose which poly/course/year your match should be from! :),btohqsg
Ah I see okay... How about the verification part? Remain unverified?,btohqsg
Yep  incoming/prospect students will remain unverified for now (until they actually enroll and get a student email)!,btohqsg
Ah I see okay noted! Thank you!,btohqsg
@nusmatchbot@smumatchbot@ntumatchbotare the new uni bots for more specific matches where you can match by major/year etc. (for prospective students too).,btohqsg
you can also head to the@nuschatbot/@ntuchatbot/@smuchatbot/@susschatbot/@SUTDxSITbotfor more instant matches (but less specific),btohqsg
P.S. for those who aren‚Äôt sure how the JC/Poly/Sec Sch bots work  the bot acts as a ‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù for both you and your match to exchanges messages.Haha there were a couple of tiktoks made by some users for the uni chat bots so you can check out to get a rough idea! The new bots I just released allow you set your match preferences though! :)https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeCWLBPf/https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeCWNVWe/https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeCWNf12/,btohqsg

hi guys  I need your advice! i am currently planning to put a course from NYP on my first choice for JAE. The Cut off point is 15.My ELR2B2 is 18 & cca pts is 2.Do you think it‚Äôs possible for me to get into the course if I put it in my first choice? Is the selection process very stringent on my points or do they allow any leeway?Thank you!! :),btohqsg
If 16 points net might have chance,btohqsg
It also depends on the course planned intake/popularity etc,btohqsg
My friend last time wanted go for pharms then abt the same situation as her ^,btohqsg
Yea that's why there's 12 choices in case you don't get in,btohqsg
Never know when the management will change the intake,btohqsg
My friend went social georontology course,btohqsg
Net pts mean without cca deduction?,btohqsg
Didnt meet the cutoff by 1 point,btohqsg
Im not sure if dae is possible,btohqsg
Advise you to just put it as 1st choice but ensure that you're willing to take your 2nd/3rd choices if offered,btohqsg
ah alright  thank you so much !,btohqsg
No one knows for sure whether the COP will change bc that's supply and demand but no harm trying but just prep contingencies,btohqsg
Thank you so much guys :),btohqsg
