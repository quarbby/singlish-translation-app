Sg drivers: u signal and want to overtake  I accelerate faster from far behind and block you. Even if you have right of way and in merging lane,btohqsg
yah i kena block on lane 1 alot times,btohqsg
today I learn. Itâ€™s not osamsake! Hahahahaa,btohqsg
then if u go lane 1 to 3 overtake go back lane 1,btohqsg
Lane 3 overtaking can be dangerous so really make sure you have clear visibility and speed differential from lane 2 not too much. Cyclists  breakdowns  road works etc,btohqsg
In europe  inner lane overtaking can be illegal too in some places,btohqsg
I do that a lot of time leh,btohqsg
If you go rounding  if they see two cars doing that together: HOR RACING!!! helo pulis,btohqsg
Less chance of stirring people if you overtake gently or not so loudly,btohqsg
and it is illegal  but not enforced,btohqsg
All over the world lah haha,btohqsg
sometimes lane 3 run 90 faster than lane 1 and 2,btohqsg
Understanding which lane to take at which part of highway,btohqsg

Not viciously trying to block people lah.,btohqsg
Then undertake on lane 2 safely lor,btohqsg
Stroke your gf hand one time then continue driving smoothly,btohqsg
Own self no need to be stirred lah. Play your fav track and enjoy the drive. Later own blood pressure go up,btohqsg
