wah what's new in the syllabus,btohqsg
Or last year's year 1s who take H2 MTLL,btohqsg
I took the new Malay syllabus last year and compared to the old syllabus  it's much harder as you're given less help and the requirements is more.,btohqsg
As shag as tsla price now,btohqsg
As shag as the Israel-Palestine conflict,btohqsg
Wait a day more  if you still have fever  go see the doctor and get swabbed again,btohqsg
Not sure about Covid  but you'll still have to see the doc by law if your fever persists,btohqsg
Not to assume the worst  but Covid sometimes takes a while to manifest,btohqsg
You can try posting in#surveysat our discord,btohqsg

Do y‚Äôall‚Äôs chat disappear on WhatsApp or tele ?,btohqsg
My secret chats allGone without me logging out,btohqsg
SGExams has a Whatsapp chat? I didn't know that,btohqsg
No leh   the other party still have it,btohqsg
But I can‚Äôt find it somehow,btohqsg
think it happens sometimes  quite rare,btohqsg
Is it cause of the new tele update,btohqsg

My rou xian I v confident,btohqsg
the gz ensem that go and coordinate their rises and dips,btohqsg
look like one wood block moving,btohqsg
then go all the way down to strinfs,btohqsg
Guys is it normal to keep taking part in competition when u have alr graduated -?,btohqsg
I dont think i would la,btohqsg
But well  if u want to whats stopping u,btohqsg
I take part almost any competition I see available,btohqsg
Just do it for fun ah,btohqsg
what i realise is most ppl b4 graduate dw take part,btohqsg
Cuz too much commitment time before graduating,btohqsg
Like fr u can use the time to study tho,btohqsg
Nw waiting for uni can do all the thing uw,btohqsg
before graduating needa do project  grades etc,btohqsg
Should i buy laptop or a desktop zz,btohqsg
Why do u think he will have the money,btohqsg
Ur NS allowance is more than his tbh,btohqsg
Even then the ques is the sqme,btohqsg
Its not that hard actually. I managed to save $100 per mth when im drawing $600+,btohqsg
Ure getting almost twice as much,btohqsg
Just a matter if u want to or not,btohqsg
I limited my spending to $300 a month during NS,btohqsg
Including transport and phone bills  etc,btohqsg
Managed to save up a bit,btohqsg
+1 to having desktop and laptop üòõ,btohqsg
just get a laptop and a giant battery,btohqsg
Depends what are you gonna do?,btohqsg
Depends on purpose of usage leh,btohqsg
Work purposes where you need to bring to uni? Laptop,btohqsg
I need it to be portable but laptops arent upgradable ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Do you want to like Intel HD Graphics performance,btohqsg
imagine paying 200% the msrp for a gpu,btohqsg
are u willing to sell a kidney?,btohqsg
gtx 1070s are legit going for $600 ea now,btohqsg
bruh i bought mine 4 years ago for $450,btohqsg
Depending on your budget uh  Legion 5 Pro or one of the MSI,btohqsg
and I thought I would be lucky to sell it for $300 a year ago,btohqsg
Why do i feel personally attacked,btohqsg
do u care about its weight,btohqsg
if u care... then get an ultrabook & a desktop,btohqsg
Ya man it was $200 2nd hand a few months back,btohqsg
otherwise ya u can get one of those thiccboi gaming laptops,btohqsg
ETH mining going away soon tho,btohqsg
waiting for GPUs to flood the market,btohqsg
Milo u can pay for my gaming laptop,btohqsg
Tbf there are other coins that you can mine other than eth,btohqsg
Even if eth swaps away from pow there's still many other altcoins to mine,btohqsg
Hahaha I got the Legion 5 Pro; it's a beast in terms of performance  but a backache to carry it around,btohqsg
As long as crypto prices are high gpus will be in demand,btohqsg
not as profitable  but ya can is can,btohqsg
Yeah but if it's profitable there will be demand,btohqsg
I think probably will still have higher 2nd hand supply tho,btohqsg
cause like ppl come in for ETH and don't rly know much about actual mining and altcoins,btohqsg
so when ETH goes POS then they just fuck fuck panic and sell,btohqsg
and I don't have 32 ETH to be a validator,btohqsg
I'll be a bit paranoid letting someone hodl my coins ngl,btohqsg
Why would you need to upgrade anyway,btohqsg
ya that's why I'm waiting for stuff like Rocket Pool,btohqsg
If you need it to be portable it's just laptops alr,btohqsg
trustless staking pools are the way to go,btohqsg
Unless you want to wheel around a desktop with a 20kg battery,btohqsg
I say this as I leave my coins in the exchange cause transferring out costs too much,btohqsg
Why need to upgrade is because i dont want to keep buying new laptops coz processor is soldered,btohqsg
Then just buy a higher end now,btohqsg
It's not like you'll game on it rite,btohqsg
spend 4.5k on a Razer Blade,btohqsg
Use laptop for basic productivity stuff and get a desktop for heavy lifting,btohqsg
FEM still got GPU requirements doe,btohqsg
You don't need to have very good specs on your laptop then cause it doesn't matter,btohqsg
You can use remote desktop if you wanna steng resources from your desktop,btohqsg
just remote into your desktop whenever u need that GPU power,btohqsg
even if u wanna game  there are remote desktop solutions that are p good for gaming,btohqsg
I didnt even know u could do that,btohqsg
Actually@andrewomethis was why I wanted remote desktop also haha from the convo at discord,btohqsg
but honestly my recommendation is just to drop 4.5k-5k on a Razer if u want a portable laptop with considerable power,btohqsg
Holy shit 4.5-5k could buy me a laptop and a desktop rig...,btohqsg
Just get an insane computer and a decent laptop lmao,btohqsg
but if u want a light but powerful laptop  that's the money u gotta drop lor,btohqsg
and admittedly the remote desktop solution can be a bit jarring for some ppl to get used to,btohqsg
but if u want low latency  high(er) FPS  less screen tearing,btohqsg
But doesn't work with all mobile ISPs,btohqsg
Im just gonna wait for sugar mommy then,btohqsg
Razer laptops GPUs are Max-Q versions  underpowered,btohqsg
lol for me is just a gaming compputer,btohqsg
Your average Asus Zephyrus can beat it easily for half the price,btohqsg
that works for both school and leisure purposes  and prob costs aroudn 2k,btohqsg
Only got this for ard 1.6k,btohqsg
If I had unlimited budget I'd be using a flagship ultrabook üòÇ,btohqsg
I went through uni with an asus zenbook ah,btohqsg
My course doesn't really require much heavy lifting anyway,btohqsg
Probably looking at an XPS or Gram for myself after I ORD,btohqsg
Yasss man xps 13 looks so good,btohqsg
13 abit small for me tbh HAHA,btohqsg
Just dun ord and use that 30k bonus to buy laptop,btohqsg
13 a bit smol but man the weight ahaha,btohqsg
Well can always get another portable display,btohqsg
I think combined still lighter than the 15,btohqsg
Yup  their ultra thin bezels are because these GPUs are thin  and 90-100W versions,btohqsg
Normal RTX 3070 should go to 140W,btohqsg
I think still not that bad value,btohqsg
only thing is XPS doesn't have AMD version,btohqsg
4.5k is uh...like buying an Apple gaming laptop,btohqsg
Paying more for the brand than specs,btohqsg
well there's a lot more to it than specs,btohqsg
if it's specs alone I can dump the best specs in and cheap out on everything else,btohqsg
price it at like 2.5k and call it a day,btohqsg
I think if everyone in this group donate me $1 id be able to afford that,btohqsg
True true  build quality also plays a part,btohqsg
Aftershock tends to use cheap plastic and will crack after a while,btohqsg
Can the treasury bear such an expense,btohqsg
there's a reason why Dell XPS can sell for $4k+ and have a lower spec than Razer,btohqsg
Yes coz the treasury is not mine,btohqsg
Wait I've always wondered  what is it that makes the XPS so good and expensive,btohqsg
build quality  keyboard  touchpad  display  bettery  etcetc,btohqsg
fairly light for its power  keyboard & touchpad is p good  overall build quality is good toojust has v little flaws I guess  compared to everything else,btohqsg
it fits the criteria of a good ultrabook,btohqsg
only thing is it's IO... only type c ports,btohqsg
Icic  that is a good deal,btohqsg
If people can survive with 2 type c ports on MBA so can XPS users,btohqsg
when you value the health of your back  while still needing good amounts of power for your everyday work  you start to be willing to dump more money,btohqsg
I'm resigning myself to that fate soon,btohqsg
probably just a USB dongle tho,btohqsg
I got no money for a thunderbolt hub lmao,btohqsg
its been a while buddy  how have u been,btohqsg
267 days to pink IC is all I can say,btohqsg
Why do we have the same number of days,btohqsg
What's the diff between USB c and thunderbolt,btohqsg
USB C is a type of connectorlike micro USB is actually USB Micro Bthe usual computer one is USB Athunderbolt is a hardware interface by Intel that allows wtv u connect to have direct access to PCIe lanes while also acting as a DisplayPortand because it can directly tap on PCIe lanes  it can support stuff like external GPUs,btohqsg
Thunderbolt 1 & 2 actually used mini display port as its connectoronly Thunderbolt 3 & 4 uses USB C,btohqsg
So that mini displayport connector on my old laptop,btohqsg
Can actually be used as thunderbolt?,btohqsg
wait how does remote desktop work for individuals,btohqsg
It needs to explicitly have thunderbolt support,btohqsg
it just shares the desktop from the host to the client computer,btohqsg
u setup remote desktop (parsec  TeamViewer  wtv) to be able to allow remote connections without anyone needing to press allow on the host side,btohqsg
typically remote desktop solutions like TeamViewer or AnyDesk will encrypt the data  then route it through their servers such that it reaches you,btohqsg
so usually this can only happen if both sides are connected to the same account  otherwise it's insecure as fuck,btohqsg
ahhh so what are the advantages of this for students?,btohqsg
if you're working with multiple computers it can be useful,btohqsg
you can also use it to transfer files to and from computers,btohqsg
Or like mentioned before  you can have a powerful computer and a relatively cheap/weak laptop,btohqsg
Whenever you need your desktop to do some stuff you can just remote in and work,btohqsg
ok wait i noob one ah  but i can just get a desktop at home (which for equivalent specs is much cheaper than a laptop) then i just use a cheapo laptop when im working outside but still get the same computing power as my desktop at home?,btohqsg
wah then why dont more ppl do this?,btohqsg
Assuming you have a internet connection,btohqsg
It's not exactly required for most work flows,btohqsg
plus is singapore is like everywhere got connection,btohqsg
if i can donate my gbs to u i would la,btohqsg
Like if you're just doing excel and word your laptop will work just fine,btohqsg
and it's not exactly intuitive to implement it into any random Joe's workflow,btohqsg
U can just donate the $$,btohqsg
mine is like 18 for 50gb?,btohqsg
data is cheap   but the amount of data u need to download/store stuff makes it expensive in the long run,btohqsg
Oh and yeah you need set up a bit,btohqsg
Cause if computer sleeps you probably can't remote desktop unless you enable wake on lan,btohqsg
and wake on LAN is a bitch,btohqsg
You can rent a server online without having the actual hardware,btohqsg
or u can just download more RAM,btohqsg
anyone can give tips for eae writeup pls,btohqsg
And write why you wanna go,btohqsg
And write what you aim to get out of the course,btohqsg
im in a pretty general course,btohqsg
Yea then just put what do u aim to get out the course in poly,btohqsg
Why does that affect why you want go infocom sec,btohqsg
You can always take part in coms uk -?,btohqsg
There's nothing to be unsure about  being in ITE doesn't mean you cannot want to be in infocom sec,btohqsg
Is SjChO still on this year?,btohqsg
kenna rejected frm NUS comp science üò™,btohqsg
I just lost a potential classmate :(((,btohqsg
were u from poly or a levels,btohqsg
ah  u got thru direct right,btohqsg
my GPA fell short  I was hoping my ABA could save me but it didn't,btohqsg
even last year sem 1 there were offline lessons for cs,btohqsg
What does Ben leong have to do with this,btohqsg
and I'll be pretty irritated if CS is the only fac with in person lessons,btohqsg
i think he's very involved in cs curriculum,btohqsg
i heard of how even though hes not supposed to be involved in cs1010s in sem 1,btohqsg
so he has more chances to tell people to change majors,btohqsg
If u were to choose btwn medicine or computer science which would you pick,btohqsg
I still have 1 more year to try  I ORD next year,btohqsg
i really really wanna get into NUS,btohqsg
no interest in the field  no interest in the grind  no interest in communicating with people,btohqsg
Take part in hackathon in the meantime!,btohqsg
NTU is too far for me,btohqsg
I can try to apply SMU next year,btohqsg
I have lots of projects in my portfolio actually,btohqsg
hope you don't mind me sharinghttps://seet.games,btohqsg
the competition is really disgusting now,btohqsg
yup  my GPA is not enough,btohqsg
3.86 cutoff  but mine is 3.7,btohqsg
yeah I also applied CS for NTU,btohqsg
ideally NUS  but if NTU accepts me also  then I'll take it too,btohqsg
I'm really passionate about game development  but I also hope to be able to pursue other career options in the computing field in the future,btohqsg
For a moment I tot Ur my brother's classmate when I saw the web,btohqsg
u mean when u saw my website?,btohqsg
hey all just trying my luck here,btohqsg
is there any study group that's active that i can join  virtual will do now since got covid,btohqsg
like something to keep people accountable and productive,btohqsg
oo can I see his page,btohqsg
Idk I nid ask his permission when he back from camp,btohqsg
oh he currently in NS also,btohqsg
But U no follow him so,btohqsg
Idts u both know each other@Seet1,btohqsg
i was from RP Game Design,btohqsg
Guys sorry I'm stupid  if they say acceptance is on 24 May  means 24 May 2359hrs then close right,btohqsg
has anyone received neither rejection nor offer yet for NTU,btohqsg
wth man first window not 24th may close meh,btohqsg
some ppl say second window for appeal,btohqsg
so what does that mean TvTthey don‚Äôt work on sat right so they make decision on mon and if we get offered we need to accept on the day?,btohqsg
Id say call the adm office but its weekends,btohqsg
Good morning  everyone  may I know if anyone has the set of slides for the SGExams¬†Effective Studying Skills Workshop? May I obtain a copy of it please? Thank you  your help would be greatly appreciated!,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know if I'd receive any confirmation after I confirmed one of my choices on the university joint acceptance portal?,btohqsg
The portal just says that I have selected my option,btohqsg
they'll email u  but not immediately,btohqsg
I wonder if I've put the wrong email address?,btohqsg
or will they only email me next week,btohqsg
nah it's rly not that fast,btohqsg
I think they'll only email after the whole acceptance thing closes,btohqsg
what is the next thing that happens after I accept in the portal,btohqsg
actually if you're a girl then idk oops,btohqsg
cause for guys they'll send a confirmation of programme reservation cause NS,btohqsg
mine is just for ppl going NS,btohqsg
