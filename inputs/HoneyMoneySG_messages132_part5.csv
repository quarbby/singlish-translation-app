U see fun or not when u trying to pay for $20-50 items and your miles or cashback card gets declinedIf u pay by YouTrip overseas you are essentially losing 2-6% value on every single transaction.,btohqsg
Usually I will chat with CSO 1-2 weeks in advance before an oversea trip to give them a heads-up  so to ensure my oversea transactions will not be declined during that period.,btohqsg
Any sign up promotion or freebies for HSBC premier if I am existing hsbc personal?,btohqsg
Yes if u want to commit to $200-300k lock-in for 6 months. Pssst not worth it.,btohqsg
lol. What‚Äôs the promotion currently? Couldn‚Äôt find it in the website.,btohqsg
That's really troublesome thoughüòµ‚Äçüí´ why do banks make us go through this when we alr enable overseas transactions before travelling üò≠,btohqsg
They need to balance the genuine use cases like u. And the innocent / gullible who get fraudulent overseas transactions,btohqsg
With this  you will less likely hit by fraudulent transactions while still can enjoy trouble free shopping experience during oversea trips.,btohqsg
Actually I‚Äôm not sure about this.By doing this  if u kenna fraud  can the bank turn around and say. Hey u asked us to lower the security for your card.,btohqsg

Hi. Anyone knows if it is possible to setup eGiro in UOB online banking to pay UOB credit card bills  and how fast does it take to setup?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking of cutting cost  probably prepaid wallet like YouTrip?,btohqsg

Sigh don‚Äôt have Maybank Mastercard. Only Horizon Visa  3.25% fee for 2.8 mpd üòû,btohqsg
Horizon vs at 2.8mpd is a net 0.2% gain if your miles valuation is 1.5 cents.Better than YouTrip but barely.,btohqsg

Hi everyone ! Is it still possible earn KrisFlyer Elite Gold just from credit card points conversions.?,btohqsg
"Not sure about youtrip  but we used wise card/uob card for every transaction in Spain. We only needed to withdraw ‚Ç¨50 to purchase sim for ‚Ç¨25 and ended up not touching the remaining ‚Ç¨25 for the whole month. There are many atms that charge you ‚Ç¨5 on top of horrible rates  but if I recall  you can check out santander or caixabank  they might not charge a fee or very low fees for withdrawalAlways select ""no"" when they ask offer option of currency conversion.",btohqsg
Isn't paying with credit card more expensive ? Compared to youtrip ?,btohqsg
You need to take into consideration of credit cards rewards. Youtrip has zero rewards vs cc with fcy fee and rewards.,btohqsg
Yes. Me  30mins ago. It is fully redeemed now.,btohqsg

It is too late. Ideally you redeem by 8am.,btohqsg

If you have a big trip. Com spending. What's the best CC to max the mile earning rate?,btohqsg
