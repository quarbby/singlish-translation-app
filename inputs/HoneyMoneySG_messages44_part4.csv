Does anyone know what rates Instarem Amaze follows? Heading to Taiwan but canâ€™t seem to find the rate on the appâ€¦,btohqsg
Got the response from ocbc. They say itâ€™s based on posted date and not the transaction date. The mechent post few days later. So it closed next mth. The worst part of ocbc is  their posted date is not in the statement. Itâ€™s hidden inside the app that u need to drill in for details. Unlike uob where both the statement and app show the post date. Simply sucks. I already lock the credit card and take my business else where.,btohqsg
You can't check it. They'll only tell you after you make the transaction,btohqsg

May I know how does EGA works? For normal not premium type. Eg. Deposit 2k monthly for 3months. The promotion rate will be credited after 3 months  meaning at the 4th month. Can I deposit 2k at the start of the month  then withdraw it. Before end of month. I put back the 2k funds?,btohqsg
Are you keeping funds within the account?,btohqsg
So why do you want to put in $2k on 1st and then take out the $2k?,btohqsg
But the rates will only be given at the end of 3rd month.. I rather withdraw the funds n put in my savings acc  end of month put back in the sum I took out,btohqsg
