These days everyone fighting to foot the bill to clock cc spend. Unless you help own family to pay for air tics  then likely you sponsor also 😂,btohqsg
Hi if I plan to spend over 5k on pc at shop like aftershock  any recommended card for sign up bonus?I think I exhausted all the options from dbs uob maybank and standard chartered last year.,btohqsg
Hsbc just called to check on offering BT. I remember I click BT info in app for viewing and did not submit any application. Seems they track clicking activity in app yeeee,btohqsg
I got calls from them too right before cny. It's their routine haha. Already received 3 this year.,btohqsg
Really. I received same call yesterday. Didn't pick up. Today call again only know it's from hsbc,btohqsg
I will cancel t1 along with revo after finish utilize lounge access 😅,btohqsg
Actual 2 in 2024 and 1 in 2025 right before cnyIs it already 1y from your HSBC t1 approval? They may not let u cancel before 1y,btohqsg

Hi all  I have to pay for an upcoming holiday amounting 8600 USD.Is it worth it to pay by credit card (UOB krisflyer  3mpd) but incurring 4% fees. I understand that this haven't taken into account the exchange rate. Not sure if it's worth the miles.Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
Start with the basic  how much do you value 1 mile?,btohqsg
How's theChocolate Visa Card?  Anyone has it. Was thinking to sign up citi premiermiles before this.,btohqsg
Just launched and the spending promo hasn't even started yet. You sign up Citi PM for the SUB or for some other reason?,btohqsg
Ok. First uob kf may not get 3mpd unless you are paying for SIA groups or within whitelisted mcc or merchants.At 1.5cpm  3mpd is 4.5%  barely better or maybe worse than using trust cashback.,btohqsg
Having citi rewards. But always max out the 1k. Upcoming got some trips overseas. Thinking to get a all in one card as second card,btohqsg
Since you're not NTB to Citi  there is no SUB to speak of. Hence  you can get the Choco card first  max out the 1k 2 mpd rate  then switch to Amaze + CRMC for next 1k,btohqsg
Shouldn't I max the amaze crmc first for the 4mpd then go Chocolate card,btohqsg
4mpd at 2% fee and 2mpd at 0%. Your choice :)Remember heymax doesn't have KF as transfer partner.,btohqsg
2% fee is it the 25dollar transfer fee ?,btohqsg
Wait I don't understand. If I spend locally with amaze Card offline in the right mcc don't I get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Can is can  also make sure you leave some choco card space for your travel transactions since those only earn 0.4 mpd with CRMC,btohqsg
My understanding for this is correct right,btohqsg
foreign currency spread  don't you want to use the card overseas? Local got other options,btohqsg
Added punctuation for clarity 😅Amaze + crmc will give 4mpd for non excluded mcc.But let's focus on fcy spend as it's ur original question,btohqsg
XD alright thanks. I go places like China quite frequently so I don't use amaze + crmc Thanks for the answers I got better undwrstand now,btohqsg
Anyone can advise what is the mcc for National healthcare group pharmacy pls . Thx,btohqsg
Which mean you already spend above $3k on manhattan,btohqsg
does it work with cardup to buy miles👀,btohqsg
Actually how to spend this hey max miles? I only have 16xx miles  understand that we can’t transfer it to KrisFlyer  can we use it reimburse for SIA flight? Is it 1.8mpd? So if I purcased $360 ticket   can reimburse for 20k miles?,btohqsg
Can. Can do partial redemption iirc,btohqsg
1.8 cents per mile  not miles per dollar. Different unitsBut basically you purchase your ticket on the heymax website as an OTA  then use your max miles to offset the payment,btohqsg
Hi  anyone got your HSBC account under review for doing the normal giro deduction and all?,btohqsg
This one? How to use max miles to pay?,btohqsg
This is on the earn side. I thought OP was asking about the burn side,btohqsg
Yes  how to use the miles earned,btohqsg
You can transfer to their airline partners or use their OTA service to book flights and hotels,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/nnw9ayUQS8Y?si=HSrTXm68okMrzAhmChris has a video on this,btohqsg
Less than 10 min to livestream! Pardon my first time  a little anxietyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDdysrHulpQ,btohqsg
You really have lots of max miles 😁,btohqsg
Can I use UOB Ladys Card  chosen category is transport  as apple pay to tap into simplygo transport options? Do I still earn 4 miles per dollar?,btohqsg
Apologies for the typo  i chose transport  but does apple pay affect?,btohqsg
Anybody got recommendation for a miles credit card with no minimum spending only for simplygo & airticket usage? Basically I’m switching to Citirewards CC and looking for alternative for the restricted MCC,btohqsg
anyone have issue adding amaze card to google pay? seems like it keeps failing,btohqsg
Yes you can tap with phone and earn 4mpd with transport category,btohqsg
