I think so   the staff there working are all y3,btohqsg
idk who wld put ginger into pumpkin soup,btohqsg
his gpa just nice can buy apple pie leh,btohqsg
which is easier combined physics or bio,btohqsg
but depends what type of person you are  if you prefer memorising information   then bio  if not physics,btohqsg
talking bout 07 kids  lets talk about 09,btohqsg
after my year everything went downhill,btohqsg
did blud just say jc poly and ite are the same difficulty,btohqsg
im not 04 so i can say that,btohqsg
this bout subj combi for o's,btohqsg
"Saying u find a subj boring is like a guaranteed ""you are fucked"" for that subj",btohqsg
and blud's saying it even before taking the subj ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i hate chem and find it boring,btohqsg
tbh i kinda regret and dont regret going rp LOL,btohqsg
pros is i do what i want + legit 10 mins away,btohqsg
cons shit sch and shit system,btohqsg
but eh im alr in another hell hole,btohqsg
issok im desperate for money too ðŸ˜»,btohqsg
how   I stay near tp yet I nvr go there,btohqsg
Which is easier combined physics or bio,btohqsg
what if I don't have any interest,btohqsg
"you can take ""easy"" subjects and they wont feel easy because youd feel like shooting yourself doing them",btohqsg
then wtf do u want to do after o's,btohqsg
with the exception of art  take whatever the fuck you want,btohqsg
imo if you dont have any interest poly would be suicide,btohqsg
then see the poly choices tht u are interested in and take the subjects related to it,btohqsg
"what even is ""easy way out"" in sec school",btohqsg
thats just poor work ethic liao,btohqsg
but if u nt interested in anything..... then gg,btohqsg
but you nust take a longer way out of schooling,btohqsg
i have friends who fumbled Os,btohqsg
but you have a shit experience with the subject,btohqsg
ik some1 went sec 5 then end up gg to ite,btohqsg
why not take something you like and actually LEARN,btohqsg
rarher than poring your life over marks,btohqsg
if u like then take la,btohqsg
only thing i wouldnt recommend is art,btohqsg
physics  becuz its all common sense,btohqsg
who gives a shit about marks (unless uw to go RI),btohqsg
if you hate physics youll do fucking poorly,btohqsg
i find chemistry interesting at the very least even though i did poorly for pure chem,btohqsg
isnt that the point of education anyway,btohqsg
why would you torture yourself for academic validation,btohqsg
go for bio its just brainless memorisation,btohqsg
I alr got result for my subject combination I'm just thinking of I want to appeal,btohqsg
physica requires some intuition and skill,btohqsg
i didnt like chem but i still did well,btohqsg
just take some time to look theough every subject,btohqsg
pure hist peobably gonna be the hardest onethere,btohqsg
hmm but if pure hist maybe better to take physics,btohqsg
which is harder pure geo or pure hist?,btohqsg
im biased so ill say pure geog,btohqsg
I feel pure hist also ur luck,btohqsg
pure hist is double the content and half the SBQ,btohqsg
sekali u donâ€™t study then gg,btohqsg
cuz other than that I can only choose art or d&t,btohqsg
@epitonexwhat do uw to do after sec school/school,btohqsg
but if u want to go engineering or science in poly,btohqsg
just take amath if u can,btohqsg
sec 2 math is nothing compared to upper sec math/amath,btohqsg
algebra or non algebra u fuck up,btohqsg
tbh if u just purely memorise concepts without understanding them  its hard to do well in either,btohqsg
if ur algebra isnt the stringest magbe best to void amath but i always advocate for it,btohqsg
Practice more try to rly get the logic behind,btohqsg
Unless u tell me u rly fucking hate maths,btohqsg
combined physics was hot garbage this year,btohqsg
I'm taking pure his and elec geo,btohqsg
Idk how elec geog is like so,btohqsg
The only subject I got A is history,btohqsg
Tbh the humans bellcurve is q friendly (imo),btohqsg
Eh idk which is more fucked up sia,btohqsg
Pure hist elec geog or elec his pure geog,btohqsg
u shod take elec hist pure geog,btohqsg
elec hist is the same as ss,btohqsg
but the skills is the same,btohqsg
if your SBQ is garbage take pure hist,btohqsg
But must be careful abt like,btohqsg
but sbq in hist relatively ex,btohqsg
Not making Ur ans too hist in ss and vice versa,btohqsg
i got straight a1 for ss and ehist so,btohqsg
anyways his combi is fine rn,btohqsg
thats my strat for ss and hist,btohqsg
I rly got away w spotting ngl,btohqsg
I don't want regret it ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
at least he taking combined sci,btohqsg
Ya if u take that combi w pure bio chem,btohqsg
i advocate for combsci over pure sci,btohqsg
aint no way we got the same combi,btohqsg
most JCs let you take 2H2 anyway,btohqsg
except i dont take elec geog,btohqsg
I took pure geog e hist,btohqsg
which is easier combined physics or bio sorry for asking again,btohqsg
i took full lit (im insane) and ehist,btohqsg
what do you find more interesting,btohqsg
you dont take a subject based on difficulty,btohqsg
Even if the rest of the world think is rz,btohqsg
total count for me is 5@chemcer@Polarbearnextdoor,btohqsg
Last time ah ppl tell me DONT TAKE GEOG then I believe la cuz everyone ard me complain then I rly wanted,btohqsg
But then my sec sch kinda force if iw pure bio I must take pure geog,btohqsg
So I'm like aiya I like bio so much I go take la,btohqsg
I like geog more than bio and find it easier to study,btohqsg
Alot of ppl will complain abt geog in gen,btohqsg
Idk abt the new sylla tho,btohqsg
bro i voted bio but thays cuz i fucking love bio,btohqsg
if u ask me its up to u,btohqsg
Ok UK how I decide my science,btohqsg
but honestly just dont take full lit,btohqsg
"""which section of science I sleep the least in class""",btohqsg
just leave your combi as is,btohqsg
my sch doesn't offer full lit,btohqsg
even ppl who love lit cant do full lit,btohqsg
good dont take lit at all,btohqsg
i appealed to drop 5 times,btohqsg
Eh wahlao if I keep sleeping in lower sec I upper sec die,btohqsg
ik that's why I picked elec geo,btohqsg
so i just barely get c5,btohqsg
the key to acing lit is to read fanfiction,btohqsg
and also be obsessed with a fandom,btohqsg
Ok imo the good thing abt geog is,btohqsg
ALL MY FANFIC ENTHUSIASTS GET A1 FOR PURE LIT,btohqsg
It's pretty much the most sciencey humans (in sec sch),btohqsg
if youre heavy enough in a fandom to read fanfics youd love character analysis,btohqsg
U literally only rly have 1 real ans (esp for physical geog),btohqsg
nah manga dont hit as hard as fanfiction,btohqsg
So is like in terms of exam....,btohqsg
It feels less how to say,btohqsg
Then is imo easier to prrp,btohqsg
cos not everyone peaked in NS,btohqsg
FRFR OK LETS MAKE IT NS NOW,btohqsg
the part of joy in art is the freedom,btohqsg
even tho i draw i dont take it,btohqsg
my friends are burning in hell takinf art,btohqsg
My sec sch don't even offer to expressðŸ’€,btohqsg
they restrict so many art forms,btohqsg
like u cant even draw manga,btohqsg
may there be express NFS for future sec 2 students,btohqsg
whats the point of going art,btohqsg
But ya I rmb my sec sch the only,btohqsg
Coursework subj for express was drama,btohqsg
art is a freedom of expression but not in o lvls?,btohqsg
Ya I hated art in sec sch,btohqsg
dang I got until tmr 12pm to appeal,btohqsg
just leave your combi as is,btohqsg
science/humans is up to you whether you like it or not,btohqsg
I'm ok with humans the only thing I'm clueless is the science part,btohqsg
what do you not find dumb anyway,btohqsg
but u said bio was easier,btohqsg
