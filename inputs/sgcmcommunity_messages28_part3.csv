Maybe can cover different financing options when buying a car  a lot of young buyers these days getting lured into some schemes that leave the debt ridden with high monthly payments and debt which makes it impossible to sell the car,btohqsg

how to deal with people that dw to change tires,btohqsg
jkjk how to not take full loan when buying car,btohqsg
Out of concern  my advice to everyone is toNEVERdrive with worn-out tyres  regardless of the years of driving experience one has.Having worn-out tyres means your car is not road-worthy to be driven on the road  let alone to pass vehicle inspections.,btohqsg
Okay  that's an interesting topic to explore!,btohqsg
Best advise for the morning. You deserve to win the prize for this week.,btohqsg
Wait .. you‚Äôre the admin! Hahahahahah,btohqsg
One admin give to another can?,btohqsg
tires are the only contact between the roads and the car itself... dont cheap out on them.,btohqsg
i do agree but many of these accidents can be prevented by using road-worthy tires. I have seen quite a few cars aquaplan and spin going 70+kmh on the expressway during a rainy day...,btohqsg
maybe now i know why nobody wants to sit in your car...,btohqsg
Rainy day still drive fast is the drivers fault already,btohqsg
aiyo so rainy day u on the expressway drive 30kmh?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs y it‚Äôs the driver not the car that matters,btohqsg
Ur car bald u need drive in rainy days,btohqsg
Thanks for meeting. Be happy üëç,btohqsg
my car no hair its okay,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs the case then buying a fanciful car wont buy you respect‚Ä¶ its the driver not the car,btohqsg
Driving with bald tyre is like walking slowly on wet floor with this type of slipper.You may not slip and fall if you're lucky but it's very slippery üòÖI slipped n fall and hurt my tail bone before. Very painfulüòÇ,btohqsg
My proton 30% thread left. Not bald like this bro,btohqsg
Fanciful car must come with fanciful tyres bro if not embarrassing,btohqsg

C40  XC40 and PS2 will all be on the same platform,btohqsg
Or could stay the same as the AD will only make money on the margins,btohqsg
Now can compare to the new 3 series and c class,btohqsg
Badge cannot compare but car itself can,btohqsg

You can sell outside  get a better price,btohqsg
