HAHA i like the PS2 alot  but need mods,btohqsg

The air-conditioned one right? I thought it was malaysia,btohqsg
not only bugattis but all customer car,btohqsg
really ah  not sure… see la long time wearnes customer but they no jio,btohqsg
I see.  Never owned a volvo.  Neither a wearnes product,btohqsg
Next time u bring me on,btohqsg
yes yes… he every weekend pop by to see got what new things,btohqsg
Anyway i quite dig the c40 leh,btohqsg
Should be a fantastic city car,btohqsg
bold of you to assume i wld get one haha  450k i go buy X5 40i,btohqsg
very nice car haha  but i heard the new google system got alot of issues,btohqsg
i saw a electric xc40 floor it yesterday,btohqsg
some guy start his car then headlight got disco keep flashing😂😂,btohqsg
Google itself is far from perfect,btohqsg
wah the instant torque make that thing flyyyy,btohqsg
but shag vertex don’t bring in the cupra ateca anym i think haha,btohqsg
not a fan of the facelift anyway,btohqsg
you would be surprised wearnes customers got more mechanical knowledge than wearnes themselves,btohqsg
hehe i’d still buy a arteon over a a7,btohqsg
But the a7 is like 5k depre less,btohqsg
but not a lot of people know what the arteon is so resale market also not the best,btohqsg
i wld defo get A7  better package all round,btohqsg
arteon R but sg don’t bring in,btohqsg
I remember there was a time it was 18k depre,btohqsg
And i asked for 17k i think. Tio rejected,btohqsg
Lol. I need to set up bmw camp,btohqsg
importing better specs of cars not worthhhh :/,btohqsg
i asked someone do the math on the import of the new levorg 2.4,btohqsg
Levorg also didn't sell well back then,btohqsg
They don't seem to understand the fact that people who buy those unique cars are usually the performance enthusiasts guys,btohqsg
Oooooo. Sometimes I see bmw I find them chio leh. Like something stirs in me if you know what I mean. Can I join as a fan?,btohqsg
1.6 did appeal to some families though,btohqsg
sadly MI never brought in the 2.0 :/,btohqsg
I bet the 2.0L would have sold more than the 1.6,btohqsg
I remember asking one of the staff  they said only 2 sold,btohqsg
They sold more s204 than the levorg lol,btohqsg
they sold 25 or 30 s204 i think can’t rmb haha,btohqsg
That many? Last i heard only 3 left,btohqsg
in total MI brought in 25 or 30,btohqsg
wah so jialat lolol i think sales did pick up though cos it was sold till 2020 frm 2015,btohqsg
Funny they only brought 2x s207 here,btohqsg
the other 2 s207 were imported,btohqsg
my friends father one of the owners super chio sia  my fave wrx ever,btohqsg
I think i asked some time around 2016,btohqsg
sunshine yellow only 100 units worldwide too,btohqsg
i think sg all yellow no?,btohqsg
yes i went for test drive in 2016 too haha,btohqsg
Mi unit is white i think,btohqsg
wah didn’t know sg got white s207 haha,btohqsg
more rare then the yellow ones in sg that means,btohqsg
wah this one s207 ah? why he mod sia,btohqsg
I could be wrong  one of the bosses of MI owns it.,btohqsg
cos s207 use the pre fl bumper,btohqsg
Oh  then maybe this the sti only,btohqsg
i’m a huge fan of the s207  i got a black 1/18 model haha,btohqsg
Ok this the sti only haha,btohqsg
i’d assume s207 would get the slightly better end of the build quality,btohqsg
i rmb what convinced my family to buy levorg was also cos i saw it win wagon off the year in sgcm award 2016,btohqsg
Oh u had one? Stock or modded,btohqsg
I used to see one often. I think was dark blue,btohqsg
everything stock except rims 😬 cos other people still need use,btohqsg
some levorgs in sg are really really nicely done up,btohqsg
a lot of money put into them,btohqsg
pity they are 1.6 and cvt,btohqsg
Yeah it did pique my interest until insee its 1.6L,btohqsg
Subaru cvt is a different breed leh,btohqsg
recently mighty car mods ej swapped and sti manual swapped a levorg  best part was all the components fit perfectly cos it shares very similiar platform to wrx,btohqsg
this means some cockster in factory decided to put a 1.6 and a cvt in instead of a 2.5 manual,btohqsg
Someone told me there is a 2.0 levorg own by MI .not sure how true is the urban legend,btohqsg
First time see u talk here lol,btohqsg
Familiar. I shall ask my source haha,btohqsg
Guys. Need help and advise with coe renewal. Currently PQP at 107. By end Nov. likely up and down? I think until headache liao sia.,btohqsg
pls do i am curious too haha,btohqsg
528 worth to renew  maybe not as much since pqp is 107k  compared to last year. But still comparable to the market assuming your parf is about under 25k?,btohqsg
If your coe is not ending next month  u can still wait it out  and see how the market goes.Fyi the moving average for the past 2 months is 106 726. So if the next month drops a bit  the new pqp should be lower than now.,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend any brand for diy ceramic or graphene coating?,btohqsg
Gyeon and carpro have diy friendly coatings which are very good.,btohqsg
TODAY I’D ESPECIALLY LIKE TO WISH ALL THE FOREIGN WORKERS WHO LEFT THEIR FAMILIES TO COME HERE TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PLACE A VERY GOOD MORNING!!,btohqsg
yah u see those dirty things appearing also right,btohqsg
Lamborghini has released the Ad Personam Ultimae Roadster  a homage to the original Miura Roadster 🏎💨The final Aventador LP 780-4 Ultimae was produced by Lamborghini to pay homage to its V12 open-top ancestor  the Lamborghini Miura Roadster  through a special Lamborghini Ad Personam project.Basically  the car not only got power - the colour also chio 😍👉🏻 React with 🔥 if you think Lamborghini did an awesome job with this project!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
Good looking car as usual and maybe it’s just me but I a bit struggle to see any design cue link to the old Miura leh,btohqsg
WHY MUST YOU BURST MY BUBBLE!!!!,btohqsg
Angmoh ladies cannot like SGCM ah?,btohqsg

Don’t want to appear too fan boy,btohqsg
Lost a lot of blood this morning,btohqsg
Nvm lah correct too many times Liao,btohqsg
Not because of my monthly girl thing AH,btohqsg
Lost a lot of blood to this lady who wanted them for some 'blood test' she claimed,btohqsg
my boss say go I go lor,btohqsg
I'm surprised no one's asking what this means LOL - J,btohqsg
Noone wanna risk getting banned 🤣🤣,btohqsg
if you know  you know - J,btohqsg
I learnt about it in primary school hahahha - J,btohqsg
Sialah what were you guys doing,btohqsg
I also learned about blue waffle the hard way,btohqsg
okay calm down@awj_mood. we're going down a dark road - J,btohqsg
Yall move in new place already ah,btohqsg
yeap! we're at New Tech Park now - J,btohqsg
Just sharing here cause I thought it’s quite funny heh - E,btohqsg
What car do you drive Miss E?,btohqsg
Honda Civic FD also? Or RX7?,btohqsg
This is fairly accurate HAHAHAHAA - E,btohqsg
I currently don't own a car cause I have a family car ~ But am looking at purchasing a second-hand,btohqsg
Wait ah I send the listings here. Yall help me see HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Yes yes. Their songs and dance routine very good.,btohqsg
Cause I am a noob at these kind of stuff. I still have more to learn hehe - E,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1141412&DL=1000https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1141568https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1141534Am considering these three or something similar - E,btohqsg
I see you’re a fan of verts,btohqsg
Yes I am heh - E,btohqsg
This one need as some other bro/sis,btohqsg
I used to own a Copen but after that I swore never to drive a 2-seater. So inconvenient - E,btohqsg
I’m more of a japan car guy,btohqsg
But from what I heard the E250 not bad,btohqsg
Jap cars dont have a lot of verts. If have  it will be expensive haha - E,btohqsg
Yeah ikr HAHAHA Not ideal for me cause I would want to drive my family or friends around ~ - E,btohqsg
Any continental car gurus here can help? 🥹 - E,btohqsg
Oooo so the Mercs then? - E,btohqsg
Anyone parked >24 hrs at MBS before? Can advise the charges? $27.4  then 25th hour isit $12 again or $1 per 30mins,btohqsg
There’s a max. Then after that depends on what time your 24hrs hit,btohqsg
Cos first hr $12… idk 25 th hour is $12 or $1.1 per 30 mins,btohqsg
For those who have yet to RSVP  you have until 2pm today and we will do a redraw.Potentially 5 spots open for now - J,btohqsg
i would recommend the lexus is250C instead. reliable  appeal to younger crowd  hard top.,btohqsg
i worry coz he sells rice...,btohqsg
though interior leaves much to be desired. but not like the merc interior is exactly modern too,btohqsg
and the lexus has a much nicer exhaust note,btohqsg
Would you recommend a hard top or soft top? - E,btohqsg
And what's the diff in maintaining the both of them? - E,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1041581&DL=10001 owner and nice sporty red seats. but the wood trim,btohqsg
i would reccomend a hard top. in sg you dont really open it often  so u get better heat and sound insulation. and the soft top fabric may degrade due to time and weather,btohqsg
i believe the hard top mechanism is a little more exp to replace  but if you dont use it that often  it should be fine,btohqsg
and i fully agree with this haha  the v6 is extremely smooth as well,btohqsg
agreed. lexus would be less racey/ricey,btohqsg
i was so impressed the 1st time i sat in one,btohqsg
Budget wise you all recommend the Lexus also? - E,btohqsg
and i was driving a IL6 at that time. the v6 is totally different,btohqsg
slight more exp road tax  but thats about it. NA engine  less moving parts  less maintenance,btohqsg
and i cannot emphasise how smooth that 2.5 v6 is,btohqsg
So it'll be Lexus > Mercs in your opinion? HAHAHA - E,btohqsg
yeah depre in the same range as the merc anyway,btohqsg
might want to send it for PPI though just to be sure,btohqsg
Cause from what I know  my friends who drive a Merc has never complained about maintenance and all - E,btohqsg
they are reliable for sure  but maintenance when u do need it or wear and tear will cfm me more expensive then jap counterparts,btohqsg
Just not that Gen A3 hahah so in your lineup  yes.,btohqsg
yes  merc engines are pretty damn reliable. but lexus is on par,btohqsg
and honestly if u looking for e250 cab  go for the w212 facelift one not the pre facelift,btohqsg
If you're going for a cabriolet  go for the newer A3 or a 2 series!!!,btohqsg
Wah so many diff cars @_@,btohqsg
OMG YOUR LIFE LITERALLY MY DREAM,btohqsg
Friend  my bank account says no HAHAHAHA - E,btohqsg
Light as a feather and parallel parking confirm can pass ~ - E,btohqsg
bro her life my dream sia  i cannot look at coupes,btohqsg
I have a copen registry in my head,btohqsg
Get a Miata  you won't regret,btohqsg
only four doors and big boot,btohqsg
buy a wagon luh admin 🌚,btohqsg
But then only 2-seaters :( - E,btohqsg
You are young and no family commitments yet  YOLO,btohqsg
i am young but with family commitments cannot window shop for coupes 🥲,btohqsg
She had 1 before - J,btohqsg
Might as well get a eg6,btohqsg
Cannot YOLO if bank account says NONO - E,btohqsg
This unit if PPI checks out not bad at all,btohqsg
i rented one for fun. managed to redlien i thinkk 9rpm LOL,btohqsg
Oooo but someone said hard top better leh @_@,btohqsg
Enough room for 1 furry friend or partner,btohqsg
buy a copen  ask ur friend to buy copen also,btohqsg
then u dont need to fery them,btohqsg
In terms of day to day maintenance yes,btohqsg
i was boutta suggest slk but i realised two doors only,btohqsg
There's no substitute for popup headlights,btohqsg
Last time when I drove a copen and had to drive in between two buses  I felt like I was being sandwiched. - E,btohqsg
ur mx5 grp got any NB owners not,btohqsg
the gen not the bad word,btohqsg
But your budget allows for older ones only so you'll have to replace wear and tear either way,btohqsg
NB quite rare leh I haven't met one yet,btohqsg
Soft top hard top really personal preference tbh,btohqsg
it’s 2022 don’t care what people think  get RCZ or megane convertible 😛😛,btohqsg
But the cabriolet looks a bit off,btohqsg
it has a receding hairline from the back,btohqsg
I would say soft top if you have access to shelter parking at home and at office. Soft top enhances the convertible experience,btohqsg
Basically I'm looking for a VERT:- Depre: 12k~- 4-seater- 2 or 4 doors also okay- Preferably left with min of 6 years COE,btohqsg
O m g I love mini but I heard a lot of bad things about their maintenance - E,btohqsg
Every car got their own issues,btohqsg
Like keep need send to workshop @_@ - E,btohqsg
oh but only the older ones can hit 12k depre,btohqsg
People also said that for bmw and mercs,btohqsg
I dont mind older ones cause sometimes the older model looks nicer leh - E,btohqsg
Treat the car right and the car will treat you right!,btohqsg
PARF cabs all at least 18k++,btohqsg
not true. i send mine to workshop twice a year  3 months each time.  HAHAHA,btohqsg
Off peak car sia... Macam off peak months,btohqsg
It's just about finding a decent unit,btohqsg
But mini maintenance not bad as such  like BMW,btohqsg
Because it's basically a bmw 1 series for the f56 gen,btohqsg
So many contrasting opinions on MINI haha,btohqsg
only time i bring bmw ws was when i kena langar,btohqsg
to be fair i feel ownership wasn’t long enough to know the full extent of reliability,btohqsg
The w212 e class is honestly the best choice for your requirements as long as you buy a good unit,btohqsg
Just that it won't offer the best driving pleasure,btohqsg
I was looking at a beetle but they don’t produce that anymore so I’m afraid the old ones will have a lot of problem - E,btohqsg
Don't get me started on Miata variations,btohqsg
The parts actually not hard to find one,btohqsg
I think the vert beetle looks damn cute leh - E,btohqsg
Have you thought about a bmw,btohqsg
But you won't have a great driving experience,btohqsg
Makes me feel like I’m a hamster in a running ball - E,btohqsg
Aiya if you scared of going workshop,btohqsg
It's the golfs and roccos we are familiar with that have so many issues,btohqsg
Like this cause the beetle very round hehe,btohqsg
This also makes a lot of sense,btohqsg
can walk arnd see other shops,btohqsg
Especially used car on 2nd COE,btohqsg
Going workshop to mod my car ok  not leave it there for a week to repair,btohqsg
To see what will be your next car 🥰,btohqsg
I think I meant it as paying a lot to maintain it bah. I don’t mind going to workshop - E,btohqsg
Go workshop means your car will be stronger 🤪,btohqsg
Prepare 10% of the car price for wear and tear,btohqsg
You'll be fixing up a lot,btohqsg
Just don't go turf city buy Citroen can liao 😂,btohqsg
So in your opinion  Beetle is a no no ah?,btohqsg
If you want to upgrade your driving experience from the copen,btohqsg
We can advice but if you want a beetle,btohqsg
I would suggest using the greatest platform SGCM,btohqsg
And test driving one unit of each car first,btohqsg
Gives you a base feel of every car,btohqsg
My shortlist a lot of vert alrd HAHAHAHA - E,btohqsg
See which one talks to you the most,btohqsg
Then see which cars you liked the most,btohqsg
Must close your eyes and drive,btohqsg
And find more units for that car,btohqsg
And if you feel one with the car,btohqsg
What has been catching your eye lately,btohqsg
Then see which unit gives you the best value with price  condition (PPI is a must) and spec,btohqsg
Hmmmm honestly all that caught my eye are like eyecandies. Cannot afford one HAHAHA,btohqsg
But now need to be practical so diff story.,btohqsg
Sgcarmart inspection more catered towards dealer,btohqsg
Who can fix up Wear and tear,btohqsg
Can look out for common issues,btohqsg
Here I put the sticker you wanted to,btohqsg
pls don’t write off the is250c,btohqsg
all must ppi though  and lexus can go garage r,btohqsg
the rest i not so sure  arnav can reccomend ?,btohqsg
I think beetle suits all girls haha,btohqsg
PPI only leh won't cost more than 150,btohqsg
but i want to try the next time my car cocks up (touch wood),btohqsg
You touch anything also will visit doctor,btohqsg
Yeah w212 Merc is the easiest option there ticking the most boxes1. Space ✅2. Decent powertrain ✅3. Many units to choose from ✅4. Maintenance not bad if good unit is chosen ✅5. If you care for this  (I personally don't)  got Merc badge ✅,btohqsg
ConsDriving dynamics not the best as heavy car  cannot thrown into corners easily.But if you're only daily driving  good pick-up  smooth transmission and easy to maneuver,btohqsg
Ooooo is it ex for the vert?,btohqsg
i want full loan with 0.1% interest,btohqsg
You know what else is sticky and free?,btohqsg
PPI good to go to shops like garage r who like to make big bills  cause they always over do ppis and give you a bigger estimate and pick on small things that no one would,btohqsg
Mbm begs to differ  I pay 300 before,btohqsg
But they also gave me a good picture of different stuff to think about,btohqsg
to be far one of my family cars was stuck in mbm for two months before,btohqsg
We may not agree about cars,btohqsg
But we can all agree that west side is best side,btohqsg
West side best side is the truth,btohqsg
Haha it’s nice that everyone is helping me by giving their opinions 🥹 - E,btohqsg
East or west the best side,btohqsg
East or west  south is the best,btohqsg
katong best hood in the whole of sg,btohqsg
And north is just a league on its own,btohqsg
The most dangerous place is the safest place,btohqsg
We can have a car suggesting session at the chemical guys workshop as well!!,btohqsg
Cause your car cant reach west without breaking down,btohqsg
I stand for my west brothers,btohqsg
u don’t like to east cos bus can reach faster then ur car?,btohqsg
kidding kidding i slow also hahaha,btohqsg
I branching out to west anyways,btohqsg
West side is where the youngsters at,btohqsg
coupe open up new world of possibilities and better maintenance,btohqsg
but cannot jump in and out,btohqsg
she need to go down to let friends go in,btohqsg
How to maintain your car and avoid expensive repairs👌🏻Let's be honest - maintenance and servicing is by far the least enjoyable part of car ownership. It costs money  obviously  but it's also a hassle. 🥹So  what should you look out for during your regular service? Here are the main components that you should be regularly checking on  and will require replacing every so often!👉🏻 Comment and share what other parts should car owners check regularly as well!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
Another equally important point is who you buy from,btohqsg
Omg. Back from one customer and lunch  400+ new msg here 😊😊,btohqsg
Only thing E wants to open up is the roof. 😊😊,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA nice one 🥹 - E,btohqsg
This exact car was selling at 8k depre earlier this year,btohqsg
Why no BMW in your list ne? Sadded 🥺🥺,btohqsg
For a copen lover to get more space,btohqsg
e93 not the best condition for most on the market,btohqsg
Just need to pay attention to the roof mechanism,btohqsg
Wah wah so many listings. But I can't open all now cause still office hours 🥹 - E,btohqsg

If you can stretch a bithttps://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1142837,btohqsg
What should I do when I start to realise some information the car I buy on sgcarmart post is not true?,btohqsg
Have you bought the car already?,btohqsg
For example the car listed 17 inch sports rims  but now I just realise is 16,btohqsg
Yea  bought alr  and have been driving for at least 2 months,btohqsg
You can try to go to the dealer and argue,btohqsg
Some unexpected dents and scratches on the rims also just realise 🙃,btohqsg
But I doubt you'll get anything out of it,btohqsg
This isn't something to fight on after 2 months of the purchase,btohqsg
Need to check when you took over the car,btohqsg
And they can easily argue you caused those curb rashes,btohqsg
But highly lightly is won’t get anything right?,btohqsg
Because you signed the contract and accepted the vehicle as is,btohqsg
They are only liable to engine and gearbox warranty for 6 months,btohqsg
Or any big mechanical failures can be discussed,btohqsg
Hmmm alright! Thanks for the info!,btohqsg
It’s working WITH the system! 😉,btohqsg
PPI is everything and one needs to point all that out bah at that stage,btohqsg
Maybe@SGCM_Admincan come up with a PPI checklist for car buyers (if not already done so). These three PPI letters have been mentioned by many community brothers and sisters many times too.,btohqsg

Oh and your rims aren't diamond cut,btohqsg
So repairs for the curb rash should be easy,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA can okay~ Maybe start next week onwards hehe - E,btohqsg
Cause I already scheduled for this week ~ - E,btohqsg
Better to plan in advance than to be late 🥹 - E,btohqsg
Please give Ms E and Mr J a raise,btohqsg
Then we change J'sceratoto a stinger,btohqsg
And get E a f33 4 series or an e93 M3,btohqsg
And increase budget for E's car purchase funding HEHEHEHEHEE - E,btohqsg
and wanna change my bodykit. the bodykit now is ugly... i didn't know theres the N-line kind of bodykit... not sure whether can i get a trade in or something,btohqsg
Wheels and tyres still decent trade in,btohqsg
There is an N-line and full fledged N variant in the global markets but we don't get that here,btohqsg
yea but i have seen existing avante with those n-line bodykits,btohqsg
Komoco didn't offer n line avantes in Singapore,btohqsg
Aftermarket means not legal in sg?,btohqsg
As long as they conform to width and height regulations,btohqsg
But just rare to get in singapore?,btohqsg
More rare compared to a stock avante? Yes.,btohqsg
But rare in terms or hard to get? No.,btohqsg
Go to any bodykit shop and they can usually order one in for you and install with paint,btohqsg
The rare/hard to get bodykits are those that are custom ones like a liberty walk kit or customer widebody kits,btohqsg
Takes longer to order and get those in and costs much more,btohqsg
Regular upkits for Hyundai n line  Merc AMG upkit  bmw m upkits  Audi RS kits are quite common,btohqsg
Customized bodykits cost more compared to universal kits.,btohqsg
And you don't have one vendor to choose from as many copy the same kit and sell as well,btohqsg
if u got the budget  go for customised. looks nicer,btohqsg
i usually see CN7 with universal,btohqsg
so seeing one w a customised might just turn some heads haha,btohqsg
Yea I think N line bodykit is chio enough,btohqsg
Yes because anything more a bit much already,btohqsg
It's like doing very aggressive wide body kits on a Honda fit,btohqsg
i mean if ur gna do bodykits on a cn7  might as well do it all the way. Shows that aggressiveness profile of the car,btohqsg
Haven’t been to a cn7 meetup before  but wish there’s one,btohqsg
I feel it's a bit too long and flowy for an aggressive wide body,btohqsg
The proportions don't work the best,btohqsg
there should be a car group for it. gotta find,btohqsg
End up looking like this but longer,btohqsg
I do this the Elantra N kit would look better than N line on the cn7@woshijordanjr,btohqsg
The only good looking custom wbk I could find for the cn7,btohqsg
But must commit to changing wheels and doing suspension,btohqsg
Yea  I looking for such body kits  later I take photo of my current body kit  doesn’t look as good,btohqsg
I don't think you have a body kit on right now....,btohqsg
Spent 1k on it :( but still doesn’t look as good as N line,btohqsg
Check out '2020 Hyundai CN7 Avante Side Skirt n Full bodykit ( Type C )'  available at S$230 on#Carousellhttps://carousell.app.link/Koz4TYW5gub,btohqsg
Ideally would wanna have this  but not with red line colors,btohqsg
what do u need to change,btohqsg
let my brother@awj_moodshow you good fitment,btohqsg
maybe u shud tune the car,btohqsg
to explode? NA car nothing to tune man,btohqsg
just boost abit of torque and HP. I personally feel hyundai cars r sluggish without some tuning or cold air intake modifications,btohqsg
i dont wanna tune yet because im still under komoco warranty,btohqsg
and dont wanna do anything to void the warranty,btohqsg
nice? idk man! i kinda feel like the side skirts would be nicer with the n line kind,btohqsg
ur car just got how long? slowly slowly do,btohqsg
but also because my car color is amazon grey  then the bodykit is black  and easily get water marks after raining  which looks ugly ah \,btohqsg
If you do the complete N kit  you'll void warranty on your parking sensors and cameras,btohqsg
Need to paint the bodykit to the same color,btohqsg
Because this involves changing the bumper as a whole,btohqsg
does it mean i have to disassemble them again?,btohqsg
dont need N kit  find a kit where the lip and bumper isnt so big. this is v big thats why doesnt look very good,btohqsg
oh damn  no lah dont wanna go that extend,btohqsg
The one you sent as the screenshots is not the N line but universal side skirt for any and all cars,btohqsg
also the red v ugly haha,btohqsg
The one he has now quite nice,btohqsg
new wheels and fitment wld be beyyer,btohqsg
maybe i will just consider changing the side skirts  or else i can look to spraying the body kits,btohqsg
"but definitely i wanna change my tire and rims. currently now mine is 16""  wanna get 18""",btohqsg
I'm sorry to say but this one is the universal one for all cars,btohqsg
means not as good as the one im having right now?,btohqsg
But your current ones much better in my opinion,btohqsg
thanks man! then maybe i look for shops that do respray at a cheaper price instead!,btohqsg
Yeah because the N kit as a whole changes both front and rear bumpers completely,btohqsg
Like changing regular A4 bumper to rs4 kind,btohqsg
Try to look at 17 also  that way can maintain driving comfort,btohqsg
arrow tyres my go to ba,btohqsg
alright! will see the main difference first,btohqsg
For tyres I go to Kim hoe,btohqsg
Bigger inch = more FC tho,btohqsg
1 or 2 inches don't make a huge difference,btohqsg
The issue is when people change rims and then get cheap tyres,btohqsg
admin do y’all have any insider info if elantra n coming sg,btohqsg
Let's see how they do with it,btohqsg
they gna ask footballers market it now HAHAHA,btohqsg
They get to have fun in the Giulia aglio oglio hopefully,btohqsg
Then you're not using it right 😉😉,btohqsg

Isit good to go Malaysia and do?,btohqsg
But from all I've seen and heard,btohqsg
Tyres are more or less the same price if not higher in Malaysia,btohqsg
Because they have different import laws on tyres,btohqsg
Oh then I think it’s safer to do in sg,btohqsg

Braided steel hose for brake lines,btohqsg
Listen to our legend Pak Legeng@awj_mood,btohqsg

Anything and everything can break if you abuse it,btohqsg
Was quoted 168 for front 2 brembo carbon ceramic pads,btohqsg
If ssbh can break then worse if stock hose.. Brake fade earlier,btohqsg
