Pika World Daily Update 12 August 2021Equity Markets Soak in OptimismThe Dow and S&P 500 set another record close on Wednesday as investors relieved the inflation data.Consistent with our analysis  the US Senate had approved the $3.5 trillion budget resolution  which will open the key to tapping onto the budget reconciliation framework to push through the ‚Äúhuman infrastructure‚Äù bill.As we have set eyes on European markets  it continues to do well. The STOXX 600 index was up 0.4%  with France‚Äôs CAC up 0.6% as Carrefour rose sharply by 2.5% after it announced plans to consider selling away its Taiwan unit. The FTSE also increased by 0.8%.Pika World continues to favour European equities to broaden the breadth of our portfolio as the US entered into the mid-cycle transition phase.Weaker Inflation but BewareThe much-anticipated consumer price data rose less than expected after a fierce rise in June. However  inflation data is still relatively high since 2008. Thus  the latest reading essentially meets Wall Street‚Äôs estimates. Moreover  car inflation increases have started to moderate  consistent with Pika World‚Äôs estimate that the inflexion point of peak inflation should be on the horizon.Tesla‚Äôs Deliveries Isn‚Äôt A Concern as YetThe delivery data shows that Tesla delivered 8600 cars in China  a substantial drop from the previous month. Based on data from The Chinese Passenger Car Association shipments detail  Tesla delivered around 33 000 from its Shanghai factory  of which 24 300 were exported.While some investors were concerned  Pika World remains confident of Tesla‚Äôs future. The data  while it seems surprised  is consistent with Tesla usual delivery pattern. Recall the data in April where Tesla delivered about 26 000 cars  of which 12 000 is for the local Chinese markets while 14 000 is exported. By June  we see that Tesla had around 33 000 vehicles  of which only 5000 is shipped  and 28 000 is for China market.Such a trend shows that Tesla often appears to export a large volume of cars in the early quarter and move towards more local delivery towards the end of the quarter. This strategy is perhaps logical given that shipment overseas required more time and documentation; thus  prioritising overseas shipments is likely wise.Coinbase Earnings a Spectacular PerformanceThe company easily top estimates as sales and profits were well ahead of Wall Street‚Äôs estimate. In addition  it shows that the trading volume and transaction revenue continued to drive top and bottom-line growth. More importantly  the monthly transaction users rose to 8.8 million from 6.1 million  a bright spot among the result.The outlook has some dull points  given that trading volume was weak when Bitcoin had a significant fall in July. However  the August volume seems to return as Bitcoin prices recovered but are still lower than seen in the early part of the year.Given the mixed results  Pika World continued to remain constructive on the stock with mild accumulation as the results were a mixed outlook but beat on the earnings result.What‚Äôs on the Menu Today?We have another piece of essential data.At 8.30 pm  we will welcome the PPI data  which is expected to rise 0.6% after a sharp rise of 1.0% in the prior period.At 1 am  we will also have the 30-Year Bond Auction.It is 12 August  Thursday  8.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York. The market has been rewarding our strategy  and we wish all our friends a marvellous day ahead!If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
