What does courier means to customer?,btohqsg
Just sharing my thoughts...I think we accept the job base on different scenario..The job might be $12  but u are just 1 - 2 minutes drive away from pick up  And $12 job I guess the distance to deliver might be less than 6km? Will you wait for the surge? While waiting  the order might be taken by others and you have to look for other order and have to drive further down to pick up other order... end up telling myself I should have pick up... even if the order surge  there's also chance u lose out to other rider or driver...If the order going to MBS or mall that sure kana parking charges  den I make sure the order surge before accepting  otherwise part of it goes to parking  unless there is a free parking which I'm unaware...,btohqsg

Do you think the job will pay you 12$ for 1-2 minutes away? It wont.,btohqsg
If 1-2 min away the job is 7-8$ only,btohqsg
Charge and pay is based on the distance,btohqsg
short distance mean pay less and charge customer less too,btohqsg
pay is getting lesser and lesser compared to last time,btohqsg
but all things price hike up but only salary go down,btohqsg
cost of living is not balance eh,btohqsg
If its shop house to shophouse i think the fees is ok.Sometimes get those condo need to park at visitor lot and walk so far just for $9 is crazy,btohqsg
Somtimes those security guard are very rude too,btohqsg
