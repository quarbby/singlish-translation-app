I agreed. They are not flexible towards customers. So if you plan to take up their products  make sure you can fulfill the requirements and not hoping for exception. I wanted to take up the their saving account but decided not because their product is bad  it is quite good  but I have bad experience with how they interact with customers.,btohqsg
i have bad encounter on late fee waiver. i rmb it was due to the GIRO not set up and it was 1 day late. They refused to waive my CC late fee and i told them i will cancel the CC. They gave me the waiver after several days.,btohqsg

I‚Äôm going to Japan in march  my plan is to use money I exchanged in SG and my YouTrip card. I feel that YouTrip generally has the best rates  and can also withdraw cash if really needed at ATMs that accept mastercard. Currently YouTrip withdrawal is free up to $400 then there‚Äôs a fee after that üëç,btohqsg

Not sure where to share this for awareness so I post multiple places.I tried to use my amaze at Ueno family mart.I used human A amaze with paywave. Merchant said failedI used human b amaze with paywave. Merchant said failed.I used human A amaze with chip insert. Merchant said failed.Fed up I went on to pay with Suica. Success of course.After I left family mart  1 minute later I got notification human A amaze transaction went through. Amaze points credited lol.I hurriedly went back to the family mart but they kept claiming (luckily there was a chinese speaking cashier) that their credit card machine has no records of any recent transactions. Ask me to call my bank.I was only given a copy of a more detailed receipt which showed Suica transaction was successful by family mart.I immediately chat with amaze and they will raise an investigation. Amount is small at $15 and my best guess is merchant will not claim the credit card funds and it will be auto released after 7-14 days.Imagine if this had been a large transaction what would u do?,btohqsg
Im suprised anyone still use Amaze actually. I have ditch it long time back.,btohqsg
