Do y'all wish to continue seeing more good deals like this?👀,btohqsg
Good deals on shitbox JDM please,btohqsg
those are never good  deals cmon wake up,btohqsg
some people like to restore let them la,btohqsg
some cars possess things modern cars don’t have,btohqsg
good for them  but no way i'm calling them good deals  though,btohqsg
record for being on the jacks,btohqsg
$1000 for auto supra u won’t take 🌚?,btohqsg
$1000 for 1 week rental ah no thanks,btohqsg
how do you like a rod flying out of your bonnet?,btohqsg
rather pay  2k for a z4,btohqsg
i like oil and water together,btohqsg
good taste but 2K abit overpriced,btohqsg
this one not like in good condition only 😂,btohqsg
idk he said 1k for a auto supra,btohqsg
with sgcarmart  you can get it for a lower price😉😉,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admincan help me lower the price of gtr? 288k is too expensive,btohqsg
i heard headgasket is one the favourites in your search history,btohqsg
Why always have promos? Sales not good?,btohqsg
why alfa no promos? sales too good?,btohqsg
promo or not they still earn,btohqsg
enthusiast car  they're not in it for the volumes anyway,btohqsg
you not their salesman ma  you mazda salesman i sure buy,btohqsg
their target audience not as big as mazda,btohqsg
I guess you have to direct this question to the ADs themselves😂,btohqsg
margin high and volumes decent  can sell and still cover up,btohqsg
why promo  though? eurokars pays sgcm to advertise  therefore got promo,btohqsg
2.5 liter cx5 would be better. Car body is heavy,btohqsg
"Also  Most ADs always have ""promo"" rather discount in the form of an over trade on the value of your trade in car. Just that some dealers with good volumes and demand tend to drop the price a bit more by absorbing increase in COE/further trade in bonus/free road tax for a year/accessories  etc.",btohqsg
So many brands in singapore for a small market,btohqsg
Some will have to shut down,btohqsg
market not that small to be honest,btohqsg
market size is capped for sure (COE Quota)  but the competition is high and demand exists,btohqsg
Yupp  they tend to move over to a partner dealer and do PI arrangements at times,btohqsg
In case their own appointed AD decides to shut down. But usually every AD will have more than 1 brand that they are serving as the dealer for or have a good pre owned subsidiary,btohqsg
For example  C&C has Mitsubishi  Mercedes  Kia  Citroen  DS  Maxus etc and their used car dealer. Obviously citroen  DS  etc. sales much lower. But their margins and volumes are higher on the kia and merc side of things,btohqsg
I remember many years ago a dealer backed up by strong ntuc dropped opel,btohqsg
further  they get commercial clients a lot of times as well. If you remember opel  not very popular  but they gave out good deals to PHV leasing companies and put a lot of their Mokkas on the road,btohqsg
Another company picked them up  and they are doing pretty decent with the PHV leasing with Crosslands and Mokkas and the commercial side of the business,btohqsg
