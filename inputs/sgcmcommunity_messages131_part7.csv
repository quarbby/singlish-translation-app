Cash out but then COE continue rising,btohqsg
Plus some i think dealer really anyhow bid also,btohqsg
End of quarter need hit target so they just bid to register the car tooAlso have the PHV company still buying in carsTbh a lot of things contribute to the rise so I doubt it’ll go down,btohqsg
I dont need it go down. I just want it stop skyrocketing,btohqsg
I met a car dealer. He helped his client to do the bidding. Was a 6 bid 83k non guarantee. Guess what? The first bid and he successful gotten the COE under Cat A. The QP is 93k. The dealer company ate the balance of 10k. I wonder how they managed to get the COE so fast. Said low quota and high COE but they still manage to bid the COE for first try. By the way  the company is AD not PI.,btohqsg
I rmb open cat can hold fr awhile,btohqsg
Is everyone selling to owner? They cashing out?,btohqsg
out of 10 ppl who sell  u have maybe 20% cash out 40% upgrade 40% downgrade,btohqsg
What's considered high quota and what's considered low. Now I'm seeing cat As 400+,btohqsg
I think as referring like last time about 1k,btohqsg
eh wth march 2018 bad example,btohqsg
Cat A cost more than Cat B,btohqsg
Wow cat A quota 2000s vs quota 500s,btohqsg
maybe people go scrap their cars  the quota will increase. unless govt says scrap car  the quota remain same. then LL,btohqsg
also dun forget this company will surely going to push up the COE price further.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/comfortdelgro-to-buy-up-to-1000-new-hybrid-taxis-to-replace-diesel-cabs,btohqsg
I think now everyone enticipating 2028 (cause 2008  2018) to drop coe  they're buying cars that last till then. We should expect quotas to eventually ride a thinner band?,btohqsg
i thought taxi quota is separate from private \,btohqsg
is it? I am not sure. maybe any expert know about this?,btohqsg
bruh  imagine taxi and public buses need bid,btohqsg
Quota highs getting lower  quota lows getting higher,btohqsg
the fare also better decrease when COE low sia,btohqsg
Since 2012  taxi operators do not have to bid for a COE to register their taxis. Instead  they draw from the pool of Category E (Open) COEs and pay the Category A COE prevailing quota premium.,btohqsg
they still need approval from LTA though,btohqsg
don't think they can suka suka add 1000 new taxis just like that,btohqsg
