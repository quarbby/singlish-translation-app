Hi. Yesterday I have subscribed and fund money into  moo moo 5.8% guaranteed for 2 months. Where can I check the amount that I have subscribed n confirm effective? As I can't find it on moo moo app. Anyone and advise pls,btohqsg
will still definitely go through as long as GIRO in place. issue with overpayment is  if you have only 5k left in the account and they still deduct 10k then the whole payment doesnt go through even though due amount is only 5k. if you have sufficient in the account for either amounts then no worries,btohqsg
the offer still ongoing? i think expired alr,btohqsg
whoops  just checked and the offer has expired  my bad,btohqsg
thoughts on cimb fd? 3.5% for 6 months,btohqsg
decent.. not great not lousyyou can do better if you play with high yield savings accounts but that takes effort,btohqsg
A no-frills bank account sounds like a good start for you.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163614,btohqsg
Does SPPower payment via UOB counts to thr 500 spend ?.,btohqsg
What does the tnc say üôÉ,btohqsg

Hi does any1 know if cc payment to tour companies count as travel expense for the uob ladies card?,btohqsg
just tap it physcially on the reader and u shld be fine. Using of Krispay app would change the mcc code to something else that is not eligible,btohqsg
Slots are currently full and it doesn't seem like they'll open any in the near future,btohqsg
anyone knows what is the minimum time i have to hold on to the card before cancelling?,btohqsg
Great sp series 12  3.5% for 2yrs opened today,btohqsg
Did you take sign up gift?,btohqsg
Then check the tnc is they will claw back anything or pay anything before 12 months. Usually if no sign up gift don't have any penalty to cancel.,btohqsg
So ShiokReceived 25k UNI$ as sign up bonus prvi miles last year,btohqsg
Maybe I know point earn usually based on posted date or transaction date?,btohqsg
i want to cancel this and wait 6mths and get it cos i missed out when i applied for ladys card first,btohqsg
Check tnc before you plan anything... Do they need you to be new to bank customer  new to card customer  and others.,btohqsg
Ya check the tnc what new to bank means lo,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows how to set up giro to pay another bank's credit card through the HSBC app?,btohqsg
yes must check mcc to be safe  i did encounter one travel agency with mcc code in another category instead of travel,btohqsg
Only can do it through form.Make sure you have signature set-up with HSBC then submit the GIRO form to the other banks through snail mail.Takes at least 2 weeks to clear usually.,btohqsg
unfortunately very manual  need to print out form and send via mail... no joke lol,btohqsg
I link to YouTrip because I have the impression that Alipay and WeChat Pay are payment services providers and therefore no cashback or miles awarded. If u don't want to be bothered about weekdays or weekend spend  then go for YouTrip,btohqsg
what card should i use for travel stuff (hotel  air tickets  etc.) if i‚Äôm not a miles person?,btohqsg

"Don't think have any spending requirements.My guess is 120k min income (strictly?)  SC/PR  21 years old  very good credit score (possibly BB/AA? 1900+?) and stable employment history (I'm guessing no ""holes"" in past years income).",btohqsg
If withdraw from ocbc360 account 9k from 109k for adjustment to 100k at end of month  will it affect the bonus interest?,btohqsg
If it affects your average daily balance to drop below the $500 increment requirement then you'll lose out the 1.5% p.a. lo,btohqsg
You need to check what is your last month MAB n this month MAB after withdrawing $9k. If less than $500  thenüò©,btohqsg
Withdraw end of the month will affect the $500 ?,btohqsg
How to check last month and this month mab?,btohqsg
I would assume you would have made an excel sheet to track your balances if you plan to withdraw monies at the end of month..You plug the number into your excel sheet and see if it affects when you minus off from the month before's ADB lor,btohqsg
If you still don‚Äôt know your MAB today  why take the risk on 29-31 Jan?,btohqsg
The month before adb amount is taken from 31dec2023 or 01jan2024?,btohqsg
Wdym? The amount is from 1 Dec 23 to 31 Dec 23.1 Jan 24 is this month lol.,btohqsg
But each day adm amount is different,btohqsg
ADB for ocbc 360 will reset every month on the 1st?,btohqsg
So if you not sure of your ADB now  then wait for 1st when the new ADB is captured  then you start working from there with what Mouse Hunter sent herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/156691,btohqsg
