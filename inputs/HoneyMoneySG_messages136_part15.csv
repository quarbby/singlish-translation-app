hi i would like to cancel a SC credit card  but unable to do so online due to outstanding balance (annual fee). how do i proceed with this? do i seek for a fee waiver first then cancel the card?,btohqsg
Is it easy to take offer then cancel T1  Heard many had issue with it,btohqsg

Can get for sign up bonus and 4 lounge visits. If next year cannot waive annual fee  then cancel.,btohqsg
No it is not üòäCardUp truly did a u-turn as I hoped.,btohqsg
CardUp still accepts until end of December 2024 only if you received the targetted offer of HOME175. Even using RECURRING185  it stops at December 2024.Let‚Äôs see what they will announce for 2025 in December 2024 for us to setup for the next year.,btohqsg
Silly question but if you cancel  do you still have to pay for the fee? ü•≤,btohqsg
Fee is for next year membership so no.,btohqsg

Hello. I am new to the community and looking to get credit card strategy advice after HSBC revolution was nerfed.Looking for one / two cards max for simplicityMy wife will be added to each card as a supplementary cardAverage monthly credit card spend: 3.5kMain categories: groceries  transport  dining  shoppingMain goal: air milesAny advice on strategy will be more than welcome! Citi rewards/amaze + SC Smart card was my plan but recently learned amaze has a 1k limit.,btohqsg
I am using FSMONE with 0 Fees. Can check it out.,btohqsg
I do not see anyone talking about the FSMOne 0% fees for RSP.,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA bonus interest promotion for Oct- Nov  the baseline Average balance is calculated based on Sept balance for both Oct And Nov or only for Oct?,btohqsg
for 3.x% both Oct and Nov reference to Sepfor 1% from everyday+ rewards; Oct reference to Sep  Nov reference to Oct,btohqsg
yeah alot of my friends and I and some people i talked to came to FSMone conclusion but i still wanna make sure compared to IBKR which one is better,btohqsg
"Well the webiste indicates that the 0% Fee is a ""promotion"". Unsure when the promotion ends.As for IBKR  the RSP seems to be more flexible. You can choose when to deposit and when to start the RSP but for FSMONE  deposit only on 8th of the month and can automate 4 times a month.",btohqsg
IBKR is a better platform for me but i save on fees on FSMONE. So i chose FSMONE for now.,btohqsg
FSMONE  minimum RSP amount for CSPX is 100SGD,btohqsg
Hi  for the dbs yuu card  the 600 dollars minimal spend is by calendar month?,btohqsg
hello any idea where to park a sum of $1000-$1500   i wont be touching it like tbills or moomoo or chocolate finance,btohqsg
i think ibkr minumum recurring investment amount is $10. it charges u transaction fee  but u save on FX spread. if u r investing 200/mth  maybe go for fsmone. if u r investing 600/qtr can consider ibkr,btohqsg
its btr than moomoo fullerton fund?,btohqsg
I applied for Citibank rewards+ card via singsaver but did not receive the unique reference to claim for the rewards. Where can I get the reference and any advice how to resolve this?,btohqsg

Anyone know if UOB VIM card worth getting? I just gotten an invitation to join this card,btohqsg
at the level  only you can determine the value. What do you want to get from it?,btohqsg
May I know if FSMOne fees are reasonable when u sell? Buy is ‚Äúfree‚Äù but what is the sell fee?,btohqsg
hey gurus  quick question. is there any way to get cashback for paying standard chartered credit card bill? excl. EGA GIRO  cardup. maybe more of using say a debit card to pay via AXS estation,btohqsg
Also  how is the FX spread when u use FSMOne? I heard someone say the FX conversion is worse  I wonder if that already becomes the fee when u buy.,btohqsg
0.15% or min GBP 150.15% or min USD 20,btohqsg
You can edit your message btw,btohqsg
when u RSP  you dont pay anything. Balance will sit in cash account  where it earns 2% P.A.,btohqsg
It auto converts same as IBKR,btohqsg
anyone knows what the fees are for IBKR when selling ?,btohqsg
