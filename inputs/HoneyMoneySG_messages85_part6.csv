Chris thanks for making this video. You answered the qn I had after watching a documentary on how Okinawa people live to 100... and i have been questioning my initial FIRE goal since.

Compared to using youtrip card  using amaze wallet seems to give similar rate with 1% cashback for foreign currency. Wouldn’t it better to use amaze wallet for foreign currency? Not sure if my understanding is correct or I miss out some point.,btohqsg
Not sure about now  but back in Nov'23  Amaze rate much worse than YouTrip/Revolut. By about 1+%. Amaze Wallet is very slightly worse than YT/Rev,btohqsg

Sorry  I am new to CPF Investment Account.Given:- OA 60k + SA 40k > $60 000 (OA > 20k not entitled for additional 1% interest)- OA > 20k interest is only 2.5% p.a.I am considering to place my OA funds in OCBC Fixed Deposit (3.1% p.a.).Since the CPF interest payment is computed based on the lowest balance for the month  I am planning to:1) Perform the FD placement from CPF OA on the 1st day of the month.2) Upon maturity  perform FD placement again - without transferring back to CPF OA account (to avoid interest loss).May I know if my plan is feasible?*P/S: I have considered T-bills with higher return but it could ending up losing more interest due to the CPF interest calculation method.,btohqsg
Doesn't have to be foreign currency,btohqsg
yeah the answer is based on the original poster's questions of why people using amaze even though it has worse foreign currency conversion rate,btohqsg
Hi  anyone with recent conversion of citi rewards pts to krisflyer miles??? How long does it take to reflect on your krisflyer acct????,btohqsg
1. They will compute combined balances in this order: RA (if over 55) > OA (capped 20k) > SA > MA.2. You can only use CPF-OA monies above the first 20k for investments.Below 55  the first 20k of your OAALWAYSgets the 1% interest before SA/MA  at the rate of 3.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Amaze pair with Citi Rewards is better than Amaze wallet. Reason being higher cashback from Citi Rewards (2.27%),btohqsg
Actual name is Instarem Amaze card  u have to pair with a master card inside Instarem Amaze app.,btohqsg
Thanks.I see. Given:OA: 60kSA: 40kThen the interest rate for 40k in OA should be 2.5% p.a. hence I can place them in FD.,btohqsg

Why not transfer OA to SA for 4.05%? That way you accelerate to FRS faster.,btohqsg
