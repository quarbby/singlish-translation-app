U habe to plan an answer,btohqsg
I think the newer generation smarter,btohqsg
Idklah the science and math still same tho,btohqsg
the edu system be making others stressed out,btohqsg
Might change cos the sec 3s use diff tb alr,btohqsg
wtf all the kids now 175,btohqsg
Yeah the sec school kids taller than me,btohqsg
wtf. is that the normal height alr,btohqsg
lol i now s4 175 got sec 2 as tall as me,btohqsg
study lah hi how are u im good thanks,btohqsg
Im an fas kid. How to travel,btohqsg
archi   the laptop u buy oso not gna be cheap,btohqsg
Dont go archi i need alot of money and what doi not have? Money.,btohqsg
You have alot of time to work,btohqsg
lol all the rendering and shit right,btohqsg
iw to go into mass comm..,btohqsg
to learn how to setup website and all that social media stuff,btohqsg
Then when i start my business,btohqsg
I can do all that on my own,btohqsg
ok ah that one no need money,btohqsg
just study hard get points go in,btohqsg
Hes a long time loyal member,btohqsg
I go poly also need work hard,btohqsg
actl i got a friend quite lucky,btohqsg
Walao y i nvr think of this when i was 7 yrs old no wonder they ask what u wan be when u grow up,btohqsg
he want go mass comms but never got in cos his english just missed,btohqsg
I dont like how people who do well in acads think they are so hardworking when there are so many factors at play,btohqsg
"one day get phone call from poly office ""do u want to go into mass comms instead?"" he ""YES YES YES""",btohqsg
actl connections in sch still okok,btohqsg
go out find people talk to also can,btohqsg
Ive been saying that my whole 2 yrs,btohqsg
RI is provided you alr have the capability to get into their different programs,btohqsg
honestly if u feel u cant handle o levels  time to go overseas,btohqsg
some unis accept o lvl cert,btohqsg
Double standards currently faced cos i cant relate to those with more income than i have but tbh i keep quiet and listen,btohqsg
Iike idklah its unspoken but i can feel it,btohqsg
enter Uni with o not so ideal. u dh a lot of choices,btohqsg
And to make the matters worse theyre so narrow minded,btohqsg
I know people like you. Till the very end they do not have the discipline to grind. In the last 3 months they will be flailing around only to realise its too late but you cant change it its human nature. Only those smart or kiasu enough will even do well. The rest looking with dread and claiming their hardwork failed them yet they never really give their brains time to absorb.,btohqsg
Monarch ah but that one my mother say during her time its a ‚Äúdumping ground‚Äù grades no good js go there,btohqsg
But i rlly dk whats not giving me the drive,btohqsg
Studies have shown that theres no such thing as talent,btohqsg
without uni your responsibilities plateau very early lor,btohqsg
some overseas offer full coverage scholarships if u just pass ur o levels so..,btohqsg
One thing was shared among all successfull individuals they spent 10k hours at what they were doing. There was not a single person who rose to the top with just talent not even one,btohqsg
i rmb a reddit post..someone asked whether after failing their n levels can go overseas anot to continue studying,btohqsg
I love this chat grp man,btohqsg
the more important concept is that talent only gets you so far,btohqsg
so unless you can spend 2k hours studying in last 3 months,btohqsg
ehh for the unis i saw only o lvl then can,btohqsg
technically u go overseas like US to do their ver of o/n is basically easy path but you come out 10 years later having lost all braincells,btohqsg
Shld i aim to improve by prelims?,btohqsg
Just motivate ur self everyday like if u fully commit for 5 hours today  u can play 30 min of games or sthg,btohqsg
Aim for A2s for all lol,btohqsg
bruh just aim as high as you can,btohqsg
Idk ah for me I hated where I was and it somehow was a natural fuel,btohqsg
Physics F9Chem c6English A2Mt A1Combined humans B4Emath b3,btohqsg
Ouhh wait I remember one quote I used to follow,btohqsg
nah bro dont do that  u will overstress.Just aim to internalize and understand the content. Important is that u put ur best in o lvls anyway  dn to care abt school exams,btohqsg
focus on ur sciences and humans then since ur languages are strong,btohqsg
lmk if you need help with physics,btohqsg
exam is just remember as much as you can,btohqsg
i'm at least free over the next few months,btohqsg
can vouch  this man phys god,btohqsg
Anything that can go wrong will go wrong  and at the worst possible time.,btohqsg
honestly that seems quite ok for internal papers?,btohqsg
varies from sch to sch tbh,btohqsg
I think chem is one of the hardest subjects,btohqsg
idk chem in sec sch is really quite ok,btohqsg
it's not hard  it is just ur opinion,btohqsg
Tho honestly if ur finding o lvl hard to manage then u might wanna reconsider jc cuz that is a whole new hell,btohqsg
there are many variations of exceptions and some of the theory is extremely simplified for sec jc because we cant comprehend the depth of it,btohqsg
@Jobama124is it just me or ns more hell than jc,btohqsg
compared to math physics and other subjects straightforward,btohqsg
if you don't do something else,btohqsg
Can you do one for my brotyer,btohqsg
can help me do for my studies also,btohqsg
Especially when you get free milo,btohqsg
i actually have no more classes,btohqsg
i'm just doing research and TAing,btohqsg
I actually cannot do em waves all those waves thingy,btohqsg
Ever heard the electromagnetic spectrum song?,btohqsg
you can dm me if you need anything ah,btohqsg
My chem cher texted me. Idw open cos it makes me demotivated,btohqsg
For o levels prelims my physics and chem both f9like 30+/100for bothi just mugged 10 yr series papers on multiple choice and nothing else until weeks before o levelsI turned my F9 to C6,btohqsg
my mentee went from C5 average in prelims to 7 raw in o levels,btohqsg
put all my time into science...and totally ignored humanities,btohqsg
just grinding papers esp for math and science,btohqsg
He want me consult him twice a week,btohqsg
Nah its about the same average school even increase only those rgs etcetc got half,btohqsg
Ok but i feel damn stress when i consult him,btohqsg
My parents funny when i study they scold me,btohqsg
They dl me study at night,btohqsg
Why u dont study in day,btohqsg
I study better at night in fact,btohqsg
i'm 100% good at studying at night,btohqsg
Ik i dont mean tht way,btohqsg
Wake up at 7 go library,btohqsg
But i mean i can efficiently work at night,btohqsg
in library no choice you cant sleep game etc etc,btohqsg
you have to study in library,btohqsg
i study at the library aft school alot,btohqsg
And 100% idk what im doing but i def know it helos,btohqsg
Its like you can taste the o level competition,btohqsg
if not at home you would be oblivious,btohqsg

Anyways all the best Sometimes you can hard work like a dog and still do badly so dont place ur worth on grades and prepare at least 6months early to do well for anyone taking exams,btohqsg

Okay good for a moment I shit my pants,btohqsg

eh machiam...liddat i also can say  my goal in life is not to be homeless,btohqsg
you know in my poly they have taught me alot abt life,btohqsg
i got one whole module dedicated to teaching me abt life,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ok  it‚Äôs kuro life logic,btohqsg
yea that was for last sem,btohqsg
2hrs long again...we call them life skills...i alr finished 1 and 2  now its 3,btohqsg
I js woke up off to studying,btohqsg
i alr did my morning routine,btohqsg
I know someone during internship also fk up his sec school education then end up in army,btohqsg
Owadio already his parents force him go back study I think  but he ownself say is he ownself want study,btohqsg
Then he took up ITE WSdip,btohqsg
His basics really rabak then need the other interns teach him. Things like valence electron he also dunno,btohqsg
Dunno how he's doing now  during work also keep ck so like idk uh,btohqsg
I have no idea what that means son,btohqsg
Now I‚Äôm about to in the train,btohqsg
Brozoned but with a significant age gap,btohqsg
daddyzoned might not be a bad thing,btohqsg
*puts u in old folks home*,btohqsg
So you're only pocoyo during the holidays?,btohqsg
i am so sorry for your loss  you‚Äôre not even that bad,btohqsg
Ayo  that's even beyond the sibling zone,btohqsg
I js realised i studied for the wrong thing im gnna kms,btohqsg
But its okay im gnna grind the content im supposed to study rn,btohqsg
Knowledge is important in life after all,btohqsg
Reasons why I'm not after a degree for economic viability,btohqsg
not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with doing that,btohqsg
Yeah  there's nothing wrong with that - to each their own :),btohqsg
Go hard or go home  homie!,btohqsg
is it bad I never tried it,btohqsg
Yall got see the post on sg exams,btohqsg
both brooke n jiabao r stupid,btohqsg
cuz as an influenza brooke shld be setting good role model n not lying to all her fans,btohqsg
its a path that she chose,btohqsg
Like the comments look like a toxic girls forum,btohqsg
she got a pr firm to get her on straits times,btohqsg
nus that she should not get in,btohqsg
because there needs to be repercussions for what she has done,btohqsg
she says she will be transparent,btohqsg
she will just sweep under carpet,btohqsg
pretend to be pretty cute perfect student,btohqsg
So idk why people not more riled up about matters that affect everyone,btohqsg
there needs to be leverage to make her be accountable for her actions to the so many impressionable fans she has,btohqsg
cuz they look up to her ma,btohqsg
Idk man the comments reek of jealousy,btohqsg
like got mean comments on appearnace,btohqsg
but in general its abt holding her accountable,btohqsg
i read through and i can instantly sense jealousy,btohqsg
hi! is anyone from sim rmit and know how long rmit will take to get back to you about the poly exemptions!,btohqsg
but too far to want her dead etcetc,btohqsg
for all I know is  I told myself I will read the lectures  now my room is pitch dark. I shall shuijiao,btohqsg
yeah ppl can become smth else,btohqsg
aiya honestly right  plagiarism or what  don‚Äôt take things on TikTok üòÇüòÇ Jiabao want to file for plagiarism you take it to court then we can see who real. Getting this stuff on TikTok does nothing but biased opinions  which doesn‚Äôt even help at all. If Jiabao refuses to take this to court and claims this as a ‚Äòminor‚Äô issue  there‚Äôs obviously smt wrong,btohqsg
as someone who strongly believes ‚Äòend what you started‚Äô don go on tiktok and expect something for this. if uw to put Brooke down  do it at full operation. Like go and actually file for plagiarism,btohqsg
then again  similar to kpop industry  is about creating popularity out of these rumours.,btohqsg
so maybe she trying to get clout la ^^,btohqsg
If theres nth of value to say dont,btohqsg
this is convenient cuz she keep putting ambiguous importance abt her gp approach then keep saying shes releasing a book,btohqsg
I mean that one cannot stop  as a girl  it‚Äôs a girl thing üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
but cuz she dont actually explain what shes doing,btohqsg
shes virtue signalling ppl to get her book,btohqsg
guys only know how to gossip about people body count and people they fuck üòÇ girls gossip about these,btohqsg
"cuz even if i dont want to get the book i want to read the book just to see what the hell is jiabao doing to claim this ""insight"" as her approach",btohqsg
since when she got a book tf,btohqsg
theres no such thing as bad publicity tbh,btohqsg
she said she was releasing a book,btohqsg
called ace gp and more or something,btohqsg
see now u say liddat  it‚Äôs getting you to buy the book,btohqsg
I‚Äôm literally reading media marketing lecture notes rn but ok üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
cuz ur mom is boomer gen,btohqsg
we talking abt gen z now,btohqsg
Wow good thing guys are direct.,btohqsg
uh honestly right kuro  it‚Äôs js u,btohqsg
pls la direct but hurt so many individuals,btohqsg
ya lol sometimes guys too direct,btohqsg
can be direct but must have tact,btohqsg
for all I know  I not happy with guys üòÅ I will stand up for feminism. no I‚Äôm joking pls ah I not these sort of people,btohqsg
Look at me everyday kacau kuro,btohqsg
but guys not too good too right,btohqsg
ok but I rly don‚Äôt like certain guys. legit need to sew their mouth,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt und anything you‚Äôre saying but ok  have u cooked im hungry,btohqsg
thank you  want gossip behind back i anything  u tell me INFRONT of my face I whack u I tell u,btohqsg
eh wtf is my world revolving ard alot of douchebags or what,btohqsg
bcz I cannot relate to kuro  unless kuro is js boomer atp,btohqsg
wow my phoen change to yellow,btohqsg
Since when I adjusted the settings tf,btohqsg
Brookemonk should fight the strongest hater 1v1 and end it once and for all,btohqsg
everyone loves the wraps sia but i find the texture of the wraps a bit weird,btohqsg
now you are on their list for potential rewards in the future,btohqsg
ah yes...imagine your father saying your future career is gonna be a stripper,btohqsg
my days in sgexams are over,btohqsg
a senior told me rp got 3 planes,btohqsg
hello everyone can i ask for those who are experienced in going to jb via train,btohqsg

nvm i solved the issue alr but thanks lol,btohqsg
I told my investment agent I stop payment and she say ok,btohqsg
then somehow cos no monthly payment for a while they took my money,btohqsg
like they are so desperate to sell shit,btohqsg
it is called hard selling duh,btohqsg
Lucky I save the rest of my ns money in cash,btohqsg
Theres 3 pages of small print,btohqsg
She told me got nth just sign,btohqsg
I saw the investment agent instagram lol,btohqsg
bro contributed to the insurance agent lifestyle,btohqsg
leave out the most inportant details,btohqsg
not as bad as I thought,btohqsg
i think im on a aia plan,btohqsg
I think you should keep paying,btohqsg
i dont wanna be that guy...but my agent is pretty ok looking too,btohqsg
nvm not gonna call myself that,btohqsg
I spent on tuition and retake,btohqsg
why? your insurance person not nice meh?,btohqsg
nah tf would i do that for,btohqsg
what makes u think i do insurance ‚ÅâÔ∏è,btohqsg
no i meant like you buy insurance right?,btohqsg
if not nvm  cause i thought it was regular for ppl to buy some form of insurance,btohqsg
you saw the news of that one woman that sold a 50+ million bungalow at sentosa..got a 1mil comission,btohqsg
imagine stooping so low just for the incentive and leaving out the most crucial info,btohqsg
^this is why all the insurance shit is so saturated and full of pawns,btohqsg
I want to warn the young ppl abt aia,btohqsg
im very sure they dont get all the money,btohqsg
didnt you pull out after a while,btohqsg
They are actually pretty fking evil,btohqsg
i mean they provide a service and people pay for it..whether they have done it right or not is up for dabate,btohqsg
but at the end of the day its still a service which they have provided,btohqsg
something i find weird is why especially in singapore context  when someone scams/cheats or sell products here...They get fined less than how much they earned from those products,btohqsg
The profit off the account will easily cover,btohqsg
Its like the law have no idea how to give a justified punishment to these people,btohqsg
2 months ago she said all good,btohqsg
i was going to sign up with another insurance guy,btohqsg
it makes me think  this could possibly a reason why ppl still continue selling illegal products or scam ppl,btohqsg
at least i learn my lesson,btohqsg
because at the end of the day...if you maange to scam and get 1 million  the authortiies is going to fine you like 1/2 of how much you gotten illegally and maybe send you to prison for 5 yrs,btohqsg
but at the end of the day  you leave prison a few years later with 500k still,btohqsg
yes  its just something i have been thinking,btohqsg
but im pretty sure what im saying has truths,btohqsg
i have to pay with my body lorh,btohqsg
Bro...if i commit a crime and still can keep 100k,btohqsg
why tf would someone desperate enough that he feels like his life is at the downhill not do this?,btohqsg
"but if you already at the ""end of your life"" type of scenario",btohqsg
how do u have the heart to do that,btohqsg
i dont  but that is what you can say about these people i guess,btohqsg
its the same thing as like selling e-vapes,btohqsg
i know of some people who would.. smh,btohqsg
nah vapes is another thing  can confirm,btohqsg
at least youre legit returning a product,btohqsg
I was 18 so i had to ask my parents to sign,btohqsg
and Idk how to tell my parents so much gone,btohqsg
the scam would just freeze your entire bank account. it‚Äôs mainly compensation back to victims and then talk about fines and prison. unless you really hide until cannot trace the money,btohqsg
i keep getting 5.21 x 10 ^30,btohqsg
I am just gonna get it back,btohqsg
its been 1h we still at the first question,btohqsg
i mean yea  you got a point...but if you are dealing with such high numbers...these criminals will always have a safeplan,btohqsg
you can say that for lots of things,btohqsg
i know morals is nothing in the buisness world,btohqsg
when everybody has one goal in mind,btohqsg
ive learned too much about singapore to know that the success we have today came from alot of betrayal and crimes,btohqsg
people always have the false perception that only demands drives supply,btohqsg
there are some things in life that without demand there still would be supply,btohqsg
Imagine being paid to trick and cheat people. How does your conscience even allow you to do it.,btohqsg
sometimes when someone have this thought  ill just redirect them back to their schooling days...Because its a given that people will cheat in test/exams etc...and even now becoming more prevalent,btohqsg
ya but that because they die die die die die need money.... considering that many of these scams are done by normal wealth people.. abit wrong yk,btohqsg
How do people even want to be alive after killing someone lol,btohqsg
"but when you cheat  its a close minded mindset there that ""the effects will only be felt in school"" and nowhere else",btohqsg
until...you see the same question being asked but now in a real world context that could potentially cost a life...then you will realise why cheating is a extremely major issue,btohqsg
kuro has always been the same,btohqsg
NONO I SWEAR IT WAS KURO JN,btohqsg
Man I have to work more now,btohqsg
when you talk about morality...it always only ever will come to a factor when its just right. You dont do too much harm but do just enough harm,btohqsg
u no sch meh y tf u always so free,btohqsg
i think the idea here is to tell potential drug mules to not become one,btohqsg
like if there was ever a case when they could be given the choice to choose...dont become a drug mule,btohqsg
I know singapore has been running on dirty money,btohqsg
its evident and clear....but maybe to the average person  it may not seem too major of a issue,btohqsg
I can tell u by law,btohqsg
slay.. should ahve kept your eyes on your phone while walking along the corridor,btohqsg
thats the thing tho...you can have a law but if you dont know how to enforce it,btohqsg
ryan free as fuck for a y2,btohqsg
Ive seen two exact same scenarios of crime getting diff punishments.,btohqsg
ryan do rj do do do,btohqsg
i dont hv for whole of poly,btohqsg
i think ppl keep having that one stragihtforward image of rp,btohqsg
but dont you have longer internships?,btohqsg
You are actually trolling if you think sg law ppl cant enforce properly,btohqsg
idk what type of crimes you are referencing,btohqsg
100 thousand is barely material loss for big players,btohqsg
SG clams down pretty fcking hard on economic torts,btohqsg
i think mine is 3/6 months can choose,btohqsg
If theres anyth sg is good at its with laws that have to do with money,btohqsg
yea literally everything else is like a numbers game,btohqsg
I want to feel sad or angry,btohqsg
whether you get the lucky sentence or you dont,btohqsg
girl just first week into nyp,btohqsg
still got alot of time to learn about nyp,btohqsg
im pretty sure you gonna be tasked to write some essay,btohqsg
that is related to what you learnt for the module,btohqsg
they alr going thru assesment briefing.. hence cfm no such thing,btohqsg
unless its by semester then maybe got (idk whhy i js anyhow say),btohqsg
my online mods also got irl,btohqsg
i wonder how the other poly's actually go through online mods,btohqsg
mine is straightup...like a normal school day just i go ms team for lecturer only,btohqsg
wah kuro i damn happpy im nt in np,btohqsg
ppl keep having misconceptions that rp's rj must be like 300 words long everyday thing etc...But in reality its probably like 8/13 lessons  still alot dont get me wrong,btohqsg
But they will specify a number if they want a longer rj  if not usually people just write as much as they can,btohqsg
nah...the worse is attending class then getting mc,btohqsg
to cover the hrs you did not attend for the day,btohqsg
i mean...if people had the choice between rp or ite  rp would be a better option,btohqsg
but if you comparing across all 5 poly's...then yea rp should be your last choice,btohqsg
going uni is even harder in rp...because your gpa falls on consistency,btohqsg
it does not fall on major exams...i can confidently say 3/4 of your final gpa for graduation is made up of daily results,btohqsg
in rp  remoding is not seen as something uncommon,btohqsg
your 2nd point is also another reason why choose rp over ite,btohqsg
cause you are just going to a better ite academically wise,btohqsg
this is the tertiary mindset alr,btohqsg
oh yea  btw another intresting thing only rp students would know is that the dismissal time can range anywhere from 11am-3:30pm,btohqsg
The dismissal time depends on the lecturers,btohqsg
but the start time is the same throughout,btohqsg
that is music to rp students ears i guess,btohqsg
Imagine attending class at 9:15 then getting released at 11am,btohqsg
