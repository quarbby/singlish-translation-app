Anyone knows how to open a HSBC EGA account if I'm an existing credit card holder?,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thought they can guide us to do it online. Must I deposit money on site?,btohqsg
I thought without amaze points  youtrip wud be better leh? Cuz exchange rate for using amaze is not good right? Did i rmb wrongly,btohqsg
thought there were issue applying online if already have hsbc cc.,btohqsg
Amaze still good if can get say 4mpd from CC,btohqsg
Yeap I think have to drop by their branch to open,btohqsg
There's a request a callback button for those who already have cc but no bank account with them.. maybe can try ü§™,btohqsg
"the only reason to use amaze+ Citirewards is the conversion of any purchase/transaction to become an ""online"" one hence making most things (as long not excluded MCC) get the 4mpd from citirewards.what you seem to be comparing (foreign fx rates) is quite different from the above use case (apples to oranges) as i do believe youtrip doesn't convert purchases to online while maintaining MCC for  citirewards",btohqsg
Yes I understand  but the context here is for overseas usage,btohqsg
Ok great so Amaze + CitiR(4mpd) overseas still better than Youtrip ah?,btohqsg
i mean if you value youtrip's benefits over 4mpd + instapoints then yes? its really two quite different things that will appeal to different people based on their preference :/,btohqsg
From both cashback or miles perspective  youtrip no longer makes sense compared to using amaze + your favourite MasterCard.This is because either cashback or miles earned would more than compensate the additional fx spread that amaze has over you trip.Youtrip (in my opinion) only makes sense for the purpose of withdrawing cash at atms overseas because the net cost of the foreign currency cash is cheaper than changing cash at Arcade money changers.,btohqsg
Guys what is the best ways to top up my Grab Wallet? thank you in adv..,btohqsg
Get out of that trash ecosystem called grabpay. Its completely worthless at this juncture,btohqsg
Uob absolute cashback. But using the credit card itself (1.7%) is more worthwhile than using it to topup grabpay (0.3~0.6%),btohqsg
thank you due to some personal reasons i had to topup and I am likely to use a Credit card to do so,btohqsg
Amex TCB no longer gives cashback for grab top up,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for sharing. That mean I have been using for nothing .,btohqsg
Any credit card to intro for use to pay in hospital bill?,btohqsg
Is possible to create new id in Instarem and order another amaze card pair with same credit card?1 card can link with 2 different amaze card?,btohqsg
Agreed. Was hoping for one last hurrah of some cashback before the new horrible system kicks in.,btohqsg
Want to ask if they don't allow to waive the annual fee  can we cancel it immediately without paying it?,btohqsg
Hi has anyone gotten the moneybull $3k promo? Is it really cash? Or is it a voucher to buy share?,btohqsg

No personal referral codes to be posted or this group will be flooded with everyone6codes,btohqsg
i just find a $20 signup bonus for cash+ guarantee somewhere else  thank you guy,btohqsg
Less than 15mins you managed to find a $20 sign-up bonus  that's unbelievably fast üòÇ,btohqsg
