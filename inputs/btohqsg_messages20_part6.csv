there are no first timer or second timer units. if u got a queue number  then its all accounted for alr,btohqsg
unless youâ€™re talking abt at the application stage. 95% reserved for first timer and 5% reserved for second timer.eg: 100 units  so 95 units reserved for first timer and 5 units reserved for second timer. there are no specific units reserved  itâ€™s like in general  5 second timers will get a unit and 95 first timers will get a unitso the queue number can go up to 95x3 + 15x3=330 (i think),btohqsg
in the case of 100 units  if there are 20 first timers and 80 second timer applicants  will all the second timers still get a queue number? or will the excess slots for first timers flow to sbf,btohqsg
no for the first part  yes for the second,btohqsg
like i said only 5 units reserved for second timers  so 20 first timers will cfm get a queue number  and only 15 out of the 80 second timers will get a queue number,btohqsg
so there would be 35 queue numbers in total  and the remaining 65 will go to sbf,btohqsg
i see  where do you see this,btohqsg
i can't find any official information online,btohqsg
yea i think there isnâ€™t official info haha  but got some bits of info here and there in bto chats,btohqsg
then again  if the take up rate is too low  i also dk if hdb will cancel the project or not hahah,btohqsg
i may be wrong too ðŸ˜… just gathering info from everywhere haha  better to cfm with hdb directly if this situation affects u!,btohqsg
I hv a friend as a second timers apply for Feb 2023 BTO for Kallang Whampoa (Farrer Park Fields / Rajah Summit) & can get the queue no 3xx  very lucky. ( Total no of application 6857 received),btohqsg
One more person which I know also (First timers) apply for Feb 2023 BTO for Kallang Whampoa (Farrer Park Fields / Rajah Summit) & queue no 9xx.,btohqsg
Hi anybody has been notified on the date to select the BTO for  parc meadow and plantation verge?,btohqsg
Question....If i applied for BTO Aug 2023  got queue number  800+ out of 500+ unit.Havent book flat or anything.If i apply for BTO Dec 2023  i am consider 1st timer or 2nd timer?,btohqsg
First timer more referring to you did not receive housing subsidy before,btohqsg
@DerekChuawythe Aug launch you're saying was launched in Oct right? In that case do see these rules^you will still be considered a 1st timer when applying for Dec launch but if you get a selection appt for the Oct launch  future applications will be cancelled,btohqsg
Can anyone assist me In my situation?I bought a brand new 4 room flat in 1994 sold in 2000 bought a resales 5 room and sold in 2013 and downgrade to a 3 room flat. 1st and 2nd all using HDB loan and currently mine 3 room is fully paid by CpF. Can I still apply for BTO?,btohqsg
I think best you check with HDB. You should be eligible to apply as a second timer but HDB might not loan to you.,btohqsg
One of my colleague told me that he will not buy his second BTO  becuase his first BTO was sold before 2006  HDB said that need to pay for 22.5% for re-sale lavy if he buying second BTO. Better ask HDB.,btohqsg
if bought after 2006  it's a fixed amount,btohqsg
Subsidised flat sold on or after 3 March 2006  its a fixed amount.,btohqsg
Hi so sorry just want to ask if we are still students applying for this and having a reassessment of HFE later  do we put this as taking loan from FI or not taking loan?,btohqsg
not taking loan means not taking loan at all for this bto,btohqsg
ah i see what abt the deferred income thing,btohqsg
yeah when i applied there was no option also for it. I just selected whatever as it says you can still change when signing agreement,btohqsg
Yeap but my first was sold in 2000,btohqsg
deferred income is automatically applied if youâ€™re eligible. donâ€™t need to apply for it. if youâ€™re not eligible then u canâ€™t do anything abt it,btohqsg
Hi i just realised that my current location is within 4km of the area but in the application i applied as not within 4km what do i do now? is there a way i can alter it?,btohqsg
You applying for Dec? If yes tmr call HDB ask them help you amend,btohqsg
yeap! okk thank u i will ask them tmr,btohqsg
i have another question - anyone here planning only to do the kitchen and retain the original fittings?(my BTO no opt out of OCs  hence thinking of only doing kitchen),btohqsg
hi guys  if i were to buy resale before cancelling my Oct2023  ballot and before flat selection appointment  am i still counted as first timer and eligible for first timer resale grant?,btohqsg
i do and its within supply,btohqsg
i did but it only mentioned BTO restriction  im not interested in BTO anymore,btohqsg
so even if i cancel my BTO id still be consider as first timer core applicant for resale if i hit all the criteria?,btohqsg
"this is an interesting question. don't take my word for it  but i believe you'd still be eligible for first timer resale grant  as the sole criteria for eligibility for resale grants is whether or not you have been subsidised before (this page  under ""household status"").as such  assuming you've never bought a BTO/SBF  nor a resale using grant  i believe you're eligible.i doubt the oct 2023 restrictions on non-selection are relevant to you  since 1.2(e) inoct 2023's conditions for purchase documentonly says that those who reject ""will not enjoy the following when they apply for a flat in any HDB sales exercise within the said period"". you'd be applying for a resale flat  not taking part in BTO/SBF exercise.",btohqsg
hey  thanks for replying  thats really helpful and informative!,btohqsg
np! i reiterate to not take my word for it though haha  i'm guessing myself too ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know the main contractor for Ulu Pandan Glades?,btohqsg
Hi all  some people have been asking about this! Someone on another bto chat asked :) name hidden for privacy,btohqsg
Yo friends and future neighbours  i just called HDB to ask about this. The service executive clarified that the 95% quota reserved for first timers will be fixed. So the excess flatswill notgo to the second timers. Instead  they will go to SBF.,btohqsg
Admin pls do something about this thanks.,btohqsg
Deleted and banned! Thanks for alerting,btohqsg
No problem it is our responsibility to keep this group free of nonsense.,btohqsg
Thanks for helping to ask! But there's one more question: will they still issue queue numbers beyond the flat supply for the second timers who did not successfully get a Q within the flat supply (the 5% units)?If so then might be possible still for second timers to get the chance to select a flat.,btohqsg
eg: 100 units  so 95 units reserved for first timer and 5 units reserved for second timer.since hdb allocates up to 300% of supply so the queue number can go up to 95x3 + 5x3 =330 (i think),btohqsg
Hey  it wasn't me who asked  I hid their name for privacy purposes!But yes still queue numbers given for 300% of flat supply,btohqsg
I see! That's good to hear. Thanks!,btohqsg
I recall reading that BTO only starts construction if demand exceeds 70 percent of the project. Does that mean that the Dec 2023 Queenstown (Ulu Pandan) and Bukit Merah (Alexandra) are at risk of getting cancelled? Does anyone know of any similar precedent?,btohqsg
