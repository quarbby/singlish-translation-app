They can impart valuable life lessons,btohqsg
only the end credits was good,btohqsg
happens to be in yuying sec?,btohqsg
i happen to not know if i need to retain o.o,btohqsg
am not a student there hahah,btohqsg
if you have any qns just ask dont be shy,btohqsg
yo take that advice seriously @ sec 1 kids,btohqsg
know your limits  dont just force study till the pt you dont know what ur studyingif your study method suits you  dont change it just to fit others. everyone is different. someone like me can only focus if i memorise the whole syllabus frm 12-5am  have 1 hr of sleep then recoup after my exam. others need to break into bits. figure your style but it will take time,btohqsg
yea i just finished my a levels,btohqsg
so i kinda know the way ish,btohqsg
school is not all about studying also  enjoy your secondary school life as much as possible,btohqsg
my sleep schedule is messed up cuz my study method is v diff cuz i have short term memory so,btohqsg
also  to add on  find a study methodi personally am an auditory learner so i learn best by watching/listening to youtube videos.oversimplified carried my history last year LOL,btohqsg
not sure honestly im just going with the flow,btohqsg
i already planned my course of action in fhe worst scenario,btohqsg
someone teach me how to study,btohqsg
but if there's any sec 1s here that is all legit advice 100% not kidding,btohqsg
oh for me i plan to go to any course  just learn  if i cant grt into a uni  i plan to retain or take it in other private schools,btohqsg
any NUS ppl here who had multiple finals on the same day last sem? How was the experience?,btohqsg
yea cuz like i know i not gonna do well  i rather just take any course im at least ok with  then after that figure my way cuz i learn quite alot working in mg dad office these 2 months,btohqsg
yea make sure you don't completely hate whatever you're gonna take,btohqsg
otherwise you're gonna burn out really quickly,btohqsg
Not last sem but i've had 4 finals in 2 consecutive days before,btohqsg
And one sem i did 5 finals in 4 consecutive days,btohqsg
then do u really need a degree...,btohqsg
after As u dont get degree u do what haha,btohqsg
u at least need a back up plan,btohqsg
you cant just depend on one thing alone haha,btohqsg
but u shld get one to safeguard your future?,btohqsg
and putting effort into getting a degree may not be the best use of your energies,btohqsg
i mean like who's gonna take u in if you just have a A levels cert,btohqsg
so u saying all non degree holders are screwed in the future?,btohqsg
and that might be the consequences exactly,btohqsg
Anyone here knows of anyone in cyber nsf? I wanna ask some questions.-.,btohqsg
no? but if you could  wouldn't it be better to have a degree????,btohqsg
u don't need to be hired...,btohqsg
if it didn't take any effort and money then yes sure,btohqsg
And is it normal that the nsf take down my name and contact number n nvr got back to me?,btohqsg
Hey folks  we will be having an online study group project coming right up in late feb  where you can study with other students who may be stronger in subjects that you are not  and vice versa. This will aim to be a an additional  more organized version of the different study channels that we already have. Do look out for it!Rules and guidelines,btohqsg
but if you r spending 4 years effort and 30+k  I would explore other options too,btohqsg
The execution was fast and painless,btohqsg
ultimately it depends on what the person wants to do in the future lol,btohqsg
Pls ping me if have ~,btohqsg
im planning to do 2 consecutive finals for GEM mods,btohqsg
i wanna get a degree but idek what i even want to do specifically so i just do anything,btohqsg
You die but you die very quick,btohqsg
was it like the first mod in the same day end up as B+ then the 2nd mod in the same day was B-?,btohqsg
"it does  that's why research what u want to do and find out the steps to get there  instead of just thinking 'i need a degree or I'll die""",btohqsg
im someone who actually likes learning anything,btohqsg
B  B  B+  B+ in order of the exams taken,btohqsg
businesses aren't definite successes you can achieve,btohqsg
but paying lots of money to learn something is kinda stupid,btohqsg
getting a degree is also nor a success,btohqsg
Not if it allows u to get a job,btohqsg
but u at least have a back up plan if you choose to not be an entrepreneur??,btohqsg
For the 5 finals one i couldn't find time to study for the last one,btohqsg
Ate a c+ but it was a UE,btohqsg
I know  I'm just saying 'learning anything' is a rather hmmmm reason to go uni，I also love learning  I just do it by learning directly from books/videos/people,btohqsg
got degree doesn't mean have job hahaha,btohqsg
Worst i experienced so far is 1 day 1 exam,btohqsg
No but it means higher chances of getting a good job,btohqsg
ok but the pay will definitely be different? will you pay a person with a degree more or someone with alevels more?,btohqsg
Generally modules within a faculty all same period one,btohqsg
So if you do a lot of cores you might find yourself having b2b2b,btohqsg
If u expect 5k monthly starting salary as a fresh grad  good luck,btohqsg
I will pay the person who does the job better more,btohqsg
My GEM mods im keen in are an example,btohqsg
that's what u will do but not all business owners would,btohqsg
why would they pay you more if they can pay you lesser,btohqsg
If u can justify why u deserve that amount  u will get it eventually,btohqsg
nice if you think that way  but at least that's what the harsh reality i'm seeing.,btohqsg
my mum hires people and i know what are the pre requisites.,btohqsg
Just jump into the cs bandwagon and get your 5k median expz,btohqsg
If u can justify why u are worth that much to ur boss  as I said  in the end u will get that amountBut of course  like you said  not all bosses are willing to raise one's salary even if the justification is valid,btohqsg
so I can retain u and continue making money off u,btohqsg
in the end u jump ship,btohqsg
it's not underpaying because you dont have the qualifications lol,btohqsg
as long as u bring in more money than you r being paid,btohqsg
if you have a degree you'll definitely get a higher pay than people who don't.,btohqsg
do you know about maximising revenue tho?,btohqsg
if you can pay workers lesser and get more money  why would you pay your workers more and decrease your revenue?,btohqsg
of course you can get a pay raise  but those who have degrees will definitely get more increments than you.,btohqsg
if every worker is dispensible then yes sure I would try to pay them less,btohqsg
i get your point  if one worker proves his worth  he can be paid more. but at least i don't believe all non-degree holders can do this. not judging their abilities bc they don't have a degree but not EVERYONE can do well in their jobs  same for degree holders. but if having a degree can allow them to safeguard a higher pay in the future  i would believe that having a degree would be better.,btohqsg
Hey folks I read through the convos.When yall starts doing internship in a few years time  yall will realise education really matters...  two employees (one degree + one non degree) with same job scope & workload can have different salaries...,btohqsg
btw when does sec schl strt schl ah tmr?,btohqsg
i think depends on the school,btohqsg
but the employee with lower salary may not mind the difference due to various reasons e.g. Good worklife balance/work environment/good boss,btohqsg
Those that mind the difference will jump ship for salary increase or go back to school for further education,btohqsg
Yo ppl from sp and nyp,btohqsg

ur promo grades very zai ah,btohqsg

Overseas oxbridge and ivies outside that not rly,btohqsg
i think it helps slightly for scholarship but not thaaat significant i guess,btohqsg
which is btr for chemical engineering ntu or nus,btohqsg
Maybe uni scholarships idt external ones care much,btohqsg

This is the first mention of chanric in this group since I joined,btohqsg
at least now wilson knows that he got dumber,btohqsg

also to people who wants to retake and stuff  just a general advice. think very hard if you really want to do a retake. PC is a really fucked up journey to do,btohqsg
There goes my d7 for maths,btohqsg

Hii  does anyone know when the form teachers would see the students’ results? Would it be earlier on the same day or a few days in advance?,btohqsg
results are usually released via 2 modes  online and offline (in the form of results slips),btohqsg
Remembered being in the staff room on o lvl results day and teachers be gossiping over how well/badly some students did,btohqsg
Same day earlier so if youre anxious avoid all eye contact with all teachers,btohqsg
Your other subj chers will also see yours if theyre interested,btohqsg
unless the form teacher willing to share,btohqsg
My other subj chers all my class's results though,btohqsg
aka ur math teacher cant see ur chem grade simply,btohqsg
prob after o lvl results yes,btohqsg
on o lvl results day in the morning no,btohqsg
I mean like phy cher know your phy result,btohqsg
Some of the other teachers knew some students actual full results tho,btohqsg
ur subject cher will know ur subject result that he/she is teaching  but he/she wont know how u did for other subjects until like sometime aft o lvl results release,btohqsg
cos they will share thru a common ict platform,btohqsg
So the only way other subj chers will know your points is if your form cher tell?,btohqsg
Is it the samr for As,btohqsg
Do they know the exact percentage?,btohqsg
My teacher told my senior that if he had done better for one section of the maths paper then he could have scored better,btohqsg
Maybe your senior just discussed the paper with your teacher after the paper,btohqsg
Breaking news: if you get more marks you could get a better grade,btohqsg
Secret tips and tricks teachers don’t want you to know,btohqsg
How did the teacher know that he did badly in that one section of the paper?,btohqsg
If the teacher knew how he performed for one section of the paper  does that not mean that she knew the marks that he scored?,btohqsg
She told him ‘if you did better for this (particular section) you would have gotten a better grade’,btohqsg
After the results were released last year,btohqsg
Something as specific as assuming which section of the paper he did badly in,btohqsg
Is like a little too specific,btohqsg
Maybe it was just a passing comment,btohqsg
I don’t think people do that?,btohqsg
Ya but reassurance based on a pretty far fetched assumption?,btohqsg
Let’s just leave this between your senior and your teacher  I think you would feel more at peace✌️,btohqsg
no one will ever know the exact marks unless seab internal,btohqsg
and which teacher so free to find out the mark breakdown of every student,btohqsg
or even which questions they get wrong or correct,btohqsg
plus teachers only know whats up with the previous year exam papers when they go for briefing with seab,btohqsg
like this cohort did well in so and so topics,btohqsg
and did badly in so and so whatever,btohqsg
And what subject was that in?,btohqsg
Only thing I can understand teachers sayin that will be for science exams with practicals since that is marked by ur teachers so they know ur scores.Otherwise as long as the papers are marked by Cambridge  it is not possible to know the exact score.,btohqsg
The practicals are marked by the Teachers?,btohqsg
ya so ur teacher wont know,btohqsg
wah im done talking abt this le,btohqsg
basically theres no point worrying about ur exact raw score since u wont really know (unless you try to estimate),btohqsg
Rubbish. That was the old SPA system. Its now back to a practical set by Cambridge for 3 years now...,btohqsg
From what I know its still internal marking since each school produces different practical results  making it impossible for standardisation if cambridge marks it.,btohqsg
Of course  you can correct me on this if you are a current MOE teacher teaching science,btohqsg
Very misinformed. A teacher does the practical at the same time as the students. The teachers results are used as a base to compare against students answers   and marked by Cambridge.,btohqsg
Holy shit why didnt i think of that,btohqsg
Hello to students who have just finished o levels! results will be soon and I would like to ask if there would be a demand for a free jc trial class for H2 math! If there are enough people i will conduct a class for free online  on h2 math  for people to have a better idea on what jc is going to be like. dont worry  no hardselling or anything. at most  you finished one topic of math hahah before sch starts. i also dumb once i wished someone told me more. just dm me if you're interested and if there are any other updates  i can dm you personally from there! good luck peeps.,btohqsg
if this violates the community guidelines let me know ill take it down!,btohqsg

this period is usually for course specific orientation,btohqsg

He only took H2 chem lmao,btohqsg
He said q hard for him tbh,btohqsg
How u go med with only H2 Chem?,btohqsg
h2 chem h2 bio h2 phy h2 ki h2 math h2 f math h2 mt h1 pw,btohqsg
havent include the h3 yet also,btohqsg
He finished his poly aso lah,btohqsg
maybe took as additional interest. The poly course must have given one relevant knowledge to apply for med,btohqsg
Hi lads is anyone familiar with material science modules at uni level?,btohqsg

Not recommended if ur English isn't v strong,btohqsg
i only heard of jc n poly,btohqsg
U shud add in ite too cuz I don't really discriminate them-,btohqsg
ive heard good like things abt ite but i doubt im gg there either way,btohqsg

if u wanna play safe then poly,btohqsg
Nono I'm not saying u would go there I'm just saying u shud say u know abt JC poly ite,btohqsg
