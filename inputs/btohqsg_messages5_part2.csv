they said based on the resale transactions,btohqsg
if people are lazy to walk  they can take a bus (which u still have to cross a overhead bridge to get to  so maybe 5min walk to the bus stop) haha,btohqsg
but one stop to the interchange by bus not worth the bus fare  haha,btohqsg
so i hope this will deter some ppl from woodlands proj  hahaha,btohqsg
yeah so might as well walk,btohqsg
other proj for May is closer to the MRT,btohqsg
yeah then you have a higher chance,btohqsg
your parents stay at Woodlands ah,btohqsg
if I'm going for BTO in the future  I'd like to pick one next to mall  can also mean there's a MRT station too,btohqsg
by then old liao  must make my life easy,btohqsg
Nope  hahaha  my parents stay in bukit panjang. not within 4km. I cud go for tengah (near bf's place) but i really like woodlands. I am eyeing Jurong East for Aug but might as well try every launch i can bid for for better chance of getting a unit,btohqsg
haha  no worries  i legit like this one,btohqsg
i already went to walk around the site and surrounding amenities,btohqsg
so for May  you are trying for Woodlands and jurong East of Aug launch,btohqsg
Hi all  are we really looking at 6-7yrs for completion of a bto?,btohqsg
if a couple starts to pak tor at 18  they can get their house at 28 ✌️,btohqsg
means such a development might be launching in between 5 and 10 years time,btohqsg
10 yrs...sound like BTO investment for those current hdb users wan to change location next time,btohqsg
10 yrs.. really too far to imagine sia T_T,btohqsg
that's based on current covid situation,btohqsg
We're ofc hoping covid wont be so severe in a few more yrs  then construction can speed up  then wont take 10 yrs. Just that the 1st few couple of yrs might be slow progress,btohqsg
This is referring to GSW only. Not even launched yet that's why 10 years. From launch to key collection average should be 4-5 years,btohqsg
Last year CB  those units where the work stopped  I hope the water and moisture and rust didn't get into the structure and weaken it. Else would be nightmare in future.,btohqsg
Could see they didn't protect or place any form of covering over.,btohqsg
Already PPVC has many joints risk.... work stoppage without protection will worsen it.,btohqsg
whole structure on the jeopardy of tumbling it down?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the May BTO for geylang when launch?,btohqsg
Next week is the last week of May if they want to call it May launch,btohqsg
Wondering what's taking them so long,btohqsg
They usually dont clash application week w PH,btohqsg
Theyve launched on 30 May twice before  so really no surprise if they launch on last day of May. Have to keep ur expectations low,btohqsg
This month flew by so fast cuz im just waiting for them to launch  haha,btohqsg
31st May starts on a Monday  so technically it's called May 2021 Launch also.,btohqsg
if cannot hang on  please consider the resale and save your option fee,btohqsg
Depends on your work location I guess,btohqsg
I am staying in a HDB flat at punggol,btohqsg
yes and maybe I'm looking at 2r flexi in punggol by the water  in 10 years time,btohqsg
haha mine is impossible to wfh,btohqsg
also  on sundays  now they are not allowed to work  for both allowing them to rest and if they work  the main con has to pay OT rates. which could potentially eat into the profits,btohqsg
I realised the same journalist has been writing such article for some time already,btohqsg
Maybe to justify bringing in migrant workers,btohqsg
Electronics are not meant to last,btohqsg
Especially heaters  ovens  iron and such,btohqsg
What about fridge  washer  dryer haha,btohqsg
Let's go back to the stone age,btohqsg
I ever thought of minimise the reno of my house  but not possible,btohqsg
Hi guys  some units write FF  OK and OF.  These are SBF  And i just want to ask. If it indicates FF  does that mean it does not have open kitchen? Or like if it mentions OK  does that mean it does not have floor finishes?,btohqsg
"if you are balloting for SBF  doesnt matter if is FF AA BB or CC. you will pick up whatever the previous ""owner"" have opted for their OCS",btohqsg
Okay so now the options are here. So im asking if example i pick level 7  does that mean theres no OPEN kitchen?,btohqsg
they didnt say. but u can confirm that they have floor finishes,btohqsg
