Yeah it's not on the record,btohqsg
Essentially your SPMS admin has to first grant you a time stamp exception because Intern sem automatically locks you out of the stars system,btohqsg
Then after that u need to somehow register for mods but u cannot use STARs,btohqsg
3 of these mods are sem fking 1,btohqsg
and the other mods im already doing them now,btohqsg
So u can only do it during Add drop ig assuming even that if the admin says yes,btohqsg
Essentially if you are on intern/exchange the system locks u out,btohqsg
Soft condensed is sem 2 but abt chem,btohqsg
i see 4k mod i scared tho,btohqsg
tbh 4k vs 3k the difference isn't that big,btohqsg
honestly its not an issue for me,btohqsg
1 to 2k and 2 to 3k is a larger leap,btohqsg
i am gonna do 2 mods in that sem  and just s/u both,btohqsg
but the problem is i also intend to do a non-credit bearing internship in that sem  so i dk if i can find the time to at least pass the mod,btohqsg
I sound like a y4 saying that,btohqsg
its more like  (assuming i do get a non-credit bearing internship in that sem) will i be alive after work to at least read up about the mod and know enough to pass,btohqsg
fyp + 2 4k mods for the entire two sems,btohqsg
roughly gonna be same for me  i guess rn the plan is to intern y4s1  then do 2 BDE (S/Ued) and 9 MOOC for sem 2 to grad (and do another intern somewhere),btohqsg
Think is possible to do a legal internship  esp since smu mostly have that requirement (idk smu requirements but certain unis have that compulsory intern requirement),btohqsg
But whether you can find one or self source one is a diff story,btohqsg
Idk if law firms will want me,btohqsg
I.e. doing up a resume  interviews and all those things,btohqsg
i donâ€™t think I can find a job,btohqsg
I shld just isekai myself into another world,btohqsg
I wld say try to gain work relevant work experiences,btohqsg
I hope some NS transport operator just isekai me with a truck,btohqsg
U know u can double count rite?,btohqsg
So u can get a free minor essentially,btohqsg
I think it might be quite hard to minor at y4,btohqsg
6AUs double count + 6AUs S/U and u choose 1/3 of the mod to be your graded 3AU BDE,btohqsg
wha za fak is double count,btohqsg
i aint smart enough to game NTU system like that,btohqsg
I can use for physics major,btohqsg
Count your MPE or Core as part of the requirements for a minor,btohqsg
I can also use for math minor,btohqsg
So 12 au more to complete math minor,btohqsg
Is that the only common course between the 2?,btohqsg
15 au - 6 au = 9au,btohqsg
9AU = 3 ModsSU limit is 6AUsSo u choose 1/3 mods to be graded BDE,btohqsg
I forgot how to study since I enlisted,btohqsg
ME GO WHERE ME SHOOT WHAT,btohqsg
Oh you dont wanna know how many ppl have gone thru that painful experience of getting their memory back from ns,btohqsg
do you know any other seniors,btohqsg
ah okay that one yeah i know,btohqsg
CAO takes time to process it,btohqsg
yea don't do it if you can help it,btohqsg
It took them 1.5 months for my to reflect,btohqsg
sian i did have mods i want to do in y4s1,btohqsg
Legit lmao they even put in bold letters. That's the clearest indication that they have been asked that so many times,btohqsg
Our cores only end at y3s1,btohqsg
