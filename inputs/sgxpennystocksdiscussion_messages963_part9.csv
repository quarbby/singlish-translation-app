Oxley actively doing SBB.Does looks like they are at a strong support base price wise  coupled with the fact that they are buying back shares from open market helps to create a psychological price support base indeed.Based on SI  NAV stands at $0.1944.Yesterday Oxley bought back shares at $0.076.Can keep this in watch list. Waiting for the BBs to come. Hopefully sooner than later.DYODDz,btohqsg
Oxley chart view. Does looks like finally a reversal might be coming as there almost no incentive or reason for existing shareholders to sell down further.But DYODD.,btohqsg

Seems like V2Y pull pack from recent high of $0.027 is almost done with few sellers at yesterday bid of $0.022 where I added some yesterday.Overall  uptrend intact.This week might get interesting as TA suggests that we are at the apex of a more impact move   be it break down or break up.DYODD  hope it’s the right wave 🌊 and up  if so  some scalp game along the way. Meantime  $0.022 should be current pivot to add a little more  depending on market situation  where we must always remember to react in accordance.,btohqsg
CSC buying back shares at $0.008 this week. Looks the base here. Currently seems bulls vs bears here at this price.Any pip up is already a 12.5% gain.Bought 8   in Q to sell 9 😂Micros every pip already a decent % gain.,btohqsg
There are blocks of q at 0.18 and 0.22 onwards  just collect and wait BB to push,btohqsg
Ya also hope to sell soon,btohqsg
