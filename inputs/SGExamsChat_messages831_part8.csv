The worst might be ostracising and name calling but u definitely won't see anything become physical at least I guessThen again depends which one u think is worse; not everything so black and white,btohqsg

hi guys  do u know about recycling?,btohqsg
idk but just wanna cfm general sentiments that ppl know abt recycling,btohqsg
but there being an intention behavioural gap which requires behavioural intervention?,btohqsg
But would people be willing to recycle even when incentives are provided?,btohqsg
bcuz in sg  sticks appear to be more effective in behavioural intervention  as compared to carrots,btohqsg
how did u gather that conclusion,btohqsg
cus tray return with fine was more effective than free kopitiam coffee for tray returns,btohqsg
Unless you telling me there is a garbage truck for plastic metal and paper individually..what is the point of separating out the recyclable materials,btohqsg
They all gonna end up in one large bin inside the trucks,btohqsg
That is something I realise very early on about recycling in Singapore,btohqsg
Omg how did you know that? Technically I saw the cleaners pour everything into the same bin last year so I felt it didn't matter.But I just have to do some research on how students recycle cus it's for a marketing project. It's not on the recycling process and facilities to sort and stuff like that,btohqsg
I mean if you are talking about actions of students regarding recycling...Most will try to do it if there is a recycling bin infront of them...but we ain't gonna go out of our way to find one of those bins,btohqsg
You do realise that all your recycled material gets dumped into a garbage truck that does not separate anything whatsoever,btohqsg
Haha most peeps don't know this fact,btohqsg
there used to be 2 trucks last time right?,btohqsg
It don't matter those trucks those seperate the products,btohqsg
What happens  the trash bags inside each get tied then thrown into the garbage truck,btohqsg
Hey but still they end up here üò≠,btohqsg
Why is water spilling out of the truck?,btohqsg
people who throw plastic with liquids inside,btohqsg
