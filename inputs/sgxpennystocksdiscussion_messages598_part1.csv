That came after MV Werften  an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary  filed for insolvency on Monday to a local court in Germany  as salvage talks between the local governments and Genting came to a dead end. Potential cross defaults arising from that insolvency could amount to $2.78 billion  and relevant creditors affected ‚Äúmay have the right‚Äù to either demand payment or take actions regarding the financing terms  Genting said.More here,btohqsg
