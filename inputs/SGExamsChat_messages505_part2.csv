so that you‚Äôll learn to fix a problem rather than give u a new laptopüòµ‚Äçüí´ we‚Äôll be grateful they don‚Äôt have teamwork,btohqsg
this one is gd. bank on gd teammates,btohqsg
ive taken the ESE for maths before,btohqsg
you just need to do notes  and in those notes just take note of the working done in class,btohqsg
but there was a math quiz at the end of that lesson and i left like 5 questions blank because i didnt know how to do üò≠üò≠üò≠ they have quizzes and all that stupid shit,btohqsg
very high chance...the exact same qns you did in a worksheet will reappear in exam with changed variables,btohqsg
ok so u cng to bdk to yck,btohqsg
and i cant just keep copying,btohqsg
in exams cannot copy from teammates one,btohqsg
as in what does that gotta do with teamwrk,btohqsg
so you copy down qns that sticks out,btohqsg
without teamwork no one want to fix a problem,btohqsg
no i mean just straight up copying the solutions because idek how to do...,btohqsg
lol. I fixed the problem myself. nvr use teamwork,btohqsg
the learning environment in rp legit doesnt suit me at all because i prefer studying in quiet environments,btohqsg
not places where people are always talking..,btohqsg
what im saying is  it dont matter because after this module..you will never touch maths in poly again,btohqsg
my class is relatively quiet ig,btohqsg
there is no module after A113 that will touch on maths again,btohqsg
i realized that i actually managed to learn something during lunch breaks when my classmates were all gone and nobody was in class distracting me by talking loudly.,btohqsg
as long as you can pass...you are good,btohqsg
no good if the person is aiming for uni,btohqsg
for me its not the content i mainly hate the lecturer and the class,btohqsg
invest in a pair of good noise cancelling headphones,btohqsg
but its mostly during class sia when this happens,btohqsg
then i cannot hear my lecturer speak how,btohqsg
then you have to rely on resources outside your lecturer then,btohqsg
yea..but if content is not the problem  it should be alright,btohqsg
like throughout my whole programming lesson 2 class that fucking bitch (my teammate) was talking so loudly i couldnt even hear the lecturer (worst thing is he was already talking so fast...),btohqsg
i got a C for this lesson^,btohqsg
actually oso no need to buy   ask ur parents sign some credit card   hit the minimum amt & u will get it,btohqsg
kk la but idk how much also,btohqsg
if its very expensive my parents will prob never think of buying me one.,btohqsg
im doing that but its only during lunch breaks when i can actually remember shit because during class people are talking so loud i cant concentrate,btohqsg
I saw banks giving out new XM5 when u sign a card and spend $500,btohqsg
there are cheap tws with good nc,btohqsg
then idfk whats going on during class and when i dont talk my lecturers start to say my gpa is going to fall...,btohqsg
ya la i study a lot at home one,btohqsg
i read through programming and computer parts notes and did slides,btohqsg
not surprised its filled with higher nitec and pfp studentsmost of my classmates are proud of not handing in their hw on time,btohqsg
for some reason i really like general mods because theyre quite fun,btohqsg
one big reason could be because  the classmates you have come from diff schools,btohqsg
because the students here mostly come from ite so youll never expect those folks to study anyway,btohqsg
you will realise in rp  alot of the top scorers come from international schools,btohqsg
interesting.. ite students will move to other poly(s) too no?,btohqsg
because like my classmate  they claim someone paid them money to go rp,btohqsg
rp cop lower so rp is more likely to accept shit students,btohqsg
is that why ppl call rp as ite north?,btohqsg
and also because you drop out of other poly can go rp,btohqsg
guys! affordable headphones for studying  so not too heavy  and fast charging i guess?,btohqsg
