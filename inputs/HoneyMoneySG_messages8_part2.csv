No limit but 2.5% fee after $500 previously,btohqsg

You are mixing up two different matters,btohqsg
Will appear on the top-up page when you ty to exceed $500 top-up,btohqsg
A lot of exclusion too. Like airasia food delivery and pickupp not in the cashback.,btohqsg
It's difficult to use because it works on whitelist rather than blacklist. But I will share something about it tonight,btohqsg
*prior to this $250 topup nerf*,btohqsg
1st July so still can do 1 more top up,btohqsg
Not the same  refer to my Jipay video,btohqsg

Tested jipay  paying singtel  some grocery and train rides  only train rides track 1.5% cashback... is telecom payment excluded from the cashback list?,btohqsg
Telecom doesnâ€™t award Cashback but if u use grab to top up JiPay u have gotten it already.,btohqsg
Ok  thank you. Maybe will pay telecom directly from grabpay next time since jipay will reduce max top up using grabpay next month onwards.,btohqsg
Hi guys So far  from your usage  what's the transactions that have given 1.5% cashback besides simplygo public transport? The description in website is quite confusing. Not sure purchase in places like ntuc  guardian will qualify or not.,btohqsg
Is there anyway to view the Jipay card number before card arrival?,btohqsg
so far i used for food and shopee/lazada  all got 1.5%. Top up kopitiam card no 1.5%,btohqsg
Food as in food court  coffee shop  any restaurants? So far  I've gotten cashback from simplygo rides and topping up ezlink app,btohqsg
