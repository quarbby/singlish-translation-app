The recent Woodlands one 400k for 5rm ok la,btohqsg
Median salary also rose over the decades,btohqsg
Nturally BTO pricing will rise in tandem.,btohqsg
years ago 5r at ulu yishun is $330k onwards,btohqsg
Drink less BBT can afford LOL,btohqsg
Now resale prices back to all time high. From 1999~2007 pretty stable pricing. 2014~2020 also quite stable. Now shoot up again.,btohqsg
Either way I'm glad I got my BTO after almost 10 tries ðŸ˜­  if not I need to continue headache about resale ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
10 tries.. wah that's about 3 years,btohqsg
that's not the best plot of the area,btohqsg
best plot has been taken last year august,btohqsg
Resale 550k+ almost 600k.. I'd take 400k any day,btohqsg
But those who take bto now must be mentally prepared that their acquisition may yield very little profit to no profit.OK la. I mean HDB is meant to be a home  not a speculative investment vehicle .,btohqsg
Very little lor. And have to factor in more than ten years to realise that amount.,btohqsg
Hope u got a good location for your determination,btohqsg
Risk and reward wise  BTO now become purely own stay play. Can forget about for investment.... lots of forces trying to clamp its growth.,btohqsg
Socially and politically not gonna allow it to rise too much...,btohqsg
Yes  this time finally lucky  actually close to giving up alrdy  next 2 exercises this year don't have my preferred locations either.,btohqsg
(but then we keep seeing more and more >$1m resale HDB??) something not quite right,btohqsg
Yes  that's my point. Cos the other day my colleague got telok blangah beacon 4room. Being a close friend  I asked him to consider carefully.,btohqsg
Ya  part of it is the build up pressure and demand  leading to lottery effect mentality when get appointment to choose unit  then forget need to wait long long to move in,btohqsg
But T.Blangah Beacon is a very sought after one right? at least strike 4D,btohqsg
With resale value so high and bto building to be super slow  fresh grads usually apply bto asap so that by the time they get the keys they have enough savings and are also just nice in the age to start a family,btohqsg
Which is approx 28 yrs old,btohqsg
Thanks for the elaboration  I get it now,btohqsg
This pandemic really changed a lot of everything sigh,btohqsg
Anyways  bto is harder to get than winning toto or 4D now...,btohqsg
Almost every horizon is stretched out....,btohqsg
Yea  resale prices are driven up like crazy,btohqsg
Really up the demand for new homes as many are wfh and find that they need private space,btohqsg
Correct  the pain is biting most on a daily basis,btohqsg
The moment u see a punggol HDB sold at 900k.... Punggol. No offence la  but ya  punggol.,btohqsg
U know it when u see MSM featuring news of SINGLES who moved out for SPACE and 'growth',btohqsg
I stay there and... yeah  its defo not worth 900k,btohqsg
It has never happened b4 really.,btohqsg
I thought gov gonna have some sort of new rule to suppress the sales of HDB?,btohqsg
I top up 100k I can go skyterrace,btohqsg
I dunno why that guy go punggol,btohqsg
I also dont understand why people want to buy a 49 yo hdb for over 1 mil,btohqsg
Punggol is a well manicured (artificial IMO) estate,btohqsg
Might as well buy a car,btohqsg
The crowd can be maddening even during Phase 2 HA on weekends......,btohqsg
That price can get 99 yrs landed also in other location,btohqsg
Cannot get ur own parking lot in ur land as well,btohqsg
Need to park at public carpark...,btohqsg
Don't think it's worth the money. If I can summarise that location in 4 words.Out of the way,btohqsg
Tengah gonna be the next Punggol lor,btohqsg
Yes. Look at the way they are pushing out projects at tengah,btohqsg
with all the hype about intelligent homes vehicle less boulevards etc,btohqsg
"I thought this one is the ""sea-view"" one",btohqsg
LOL u go tiktok and see how many people are consoling themselves that they got Seaview.,btohqsg
