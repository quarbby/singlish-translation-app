let say coe car that is 1 owner,btohqsg
Ya this one quite reasonably priced,btohqsg
i find those pretty cool and a good buy,btohqsg
Think cause the road tax also chor,btohqsg
Been keeping tabs on it for a while,btohqsg
this is itðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ good find HAHA,btohqsg
Haha yes indeed a gem and a sleeper too,btohqsg
Just slap on a 640i badge,btohqsg
4400cc somemore. N coe. The road tax is so expensive,btohqsg
Arbo u buy m6. Also 4400cc,btohqsg
Seems like a pretty good buy imo-R,btohqsg
Get m6. 650 n m6 r 4400cc. Might as well get m6,btohqsg
Haha think of it as last hurrah before going ev,btohqsg
Road tax cheaper than a tesla m3p for now.,btohqsg
u buy 650 will regret not buy m6 1,btohqsg
I think so too. Price has been stagnant for a while.,btohqsg
I like the way you think-R,btohqsg
Technically its the same engine with a few upgrades on the m6 but the m6 gc is asking for 26k-27k depre.,btohqsg
If u want value for money the f10 m5 is only 18k depre. Same 4.4 v8,btohqsg
Great difference. 650 use n63. M6 use s63,btohqsg
Yes but the main difference is the turbo only,btohqsg
And m6 top speed is 330,btohqsg
Honestly launch control  nobody ever uses it,btohqsg
M6 side mirrors look very cool,btohqsg
Hahaha by the time you engage  the other car might be miles(or kms) away,btohqsg
Yes thats true. But i always prefer a sleeper anyway,btohqsg
Oh thats nice. Mine takes i think 5 secs lol. Not that i have tried anyway,btohqsg
With launch control  B4 car move  the rpm already 6k,btohqsg
Wow 6k is really high for launch control,btohqsg
Ppl see ur badge m6 also balls shrink,btohqsg
Ya the Ms do get much better stuff  but at a premium,btohqsg
Not sure im willing to pay another 8k per year for that. Definitely not over the m5,btohqsg
i got a friend that got a fresh 10yr 650 at 145k,btohqsg
Hahaha ask pete. I've never seen one,btohqsg
Yeah it has. But in recent times  this unit price hasn't moved. Or at least not by much,btohqsg
Maybe because the 650i is very niche. It makes sense to get the m6 if u got the moolah. Or the m5 if u got less moolah,btohqsg
personally will go with the 6,btohqsg
F10 reputation abit fked from those yp,btohqsg
anyway for anyone whose interested all launch control does is limit torque throttle and gear to ensure maximum acceleration from standing start... not as some joker claim,btohqsg
6k rpm can wheelspin till 3rd gear if you get 4.4 V8 turb,btohqsg
ikr  but cannot let misleading comments go,btohqsg
I think everyone here is dying to know  maybe u can tell us what car is it so we can learn a thing or two,btohqsg
im curious tho  uk what is 650 competitor or does it not have a direct competitor,btohqsg
0 to 100 kph - Yes,btohqsg
No idea  not my league hahaha,btohqsg
but for 650 coupe dont have leh,btohqsg
Bro get either 640 or m6,btohqsg
I dont think the sl came with the sub amg variant,btohqsg
yeah thats what i thought too,btohqsg
Will let u know when i get one,btohqsg
