APA 3.0Pros1. Pure investment plan  your premium paid is purely for investment and fees.2. Decent welcome bonus (based on premium)3. Has additional bonus for longer term (based on premium)4. Good institutional funds invested5. Money just put in  no need think so muchCons:1. No sum assured (full investment plan)2. High fees for first 10 years (higher than other companies)  bonus cannot cover charges3. Invest ownself will be cheaper4. Welcome bonus varies a lot  depending on how much and how long you putting in5. No dividendsRecommendation:Decent for a no-fuss  long term (20 years). Not recommended if short (10 years) or mid (15 years) term or if you have decent knowledge in investing.,btohqsg
The bonuses cover my fees(unfortunately they don't),btohqsg
Thank u this is super good stuff! I was thinking of using it as a part of long term diversification (eg I have 2k+ to invest every month and I put $1k in this plan)  as the fees are high I would be doing this for at least 15-20 years. (Bonuses cover the fees too) does it sound like this ‚Äúplan‚Äù will outweigh some of the cons?,btohqsg
If you need the money to be liquid then no  but if you can afford long term  and you want a fuss-free solution  it's decent. Other might also recommend long term ownself put s&p 500 / voo. But it's your choice üëçüèª,btohqsg
"hmm on my iphone dont have the ""personal hotspot"" option",btohqsg

CIMB FastSaver and StarSaver  which one is better to open?,btohqsg
Problem with investing thru insurance companies is you can't stop the premium if something happens and surrender penalty is very high.,btohqsg
ya i doing this now..if all u can hit....up to $8k p.a (5k from one account and 3 from stash),btohqsg
hi friends  im just discovered this channel and watched all related videos on chris's yt channel  and wanna ask for yall's real life experience with uob evol and citi reward + amaze  and if possible some advice on which i should go for.currently im not holding any credit cards  monthly spend is around 900 - 1.2k  rarely shopping online  salary giro meet the requirement for uob one saving acc extra interest ratehesitations lies in 1. probably cant get the 20$ cashback from uob evol online shopping 2. if go for uob  saving acc and credit card work just nice,btohqsg
How much do u spend? Is it combine 500 +100 from stash card?,btohqsg
stash account no movements...all at one account..mine not credit card..haha$500 min spend monthly,btohqsg
Oh yeah. There's also premium pass and premium holiday.With premium pass  you can stop paying premium for 1/2/3 years depending on how long your policy is  without being charged any fees.After you used the premium pass(es)  you can go on premium holiday  which they will charge fees from the existing units you have.Which also mean you have lesser premium paid  so naturally your policy value will be lesser.,btohqsg
You don't pay anything online? Outside of buying stuff from Shopee/Lazada/Amazon  you can also make online payment like; book grab/cab  online subscriptions  Singtel bill  hawker with XNAP  restaurants with in-app/website payments.,btohqsg
thanks for the quick reply  appreciate it!personally i dont buy much stuff from shopee ect  online sub are family plans taken care by my friendsi didn't know restaurants with in-app/web payments are counted too  as i thought they are still subject to mcc restrictions?,btohqsg
Welcome to the community.As Melvyn shared  payments via app tend to be coded online  and also contactless in some cases as you make payment via GooglePay or ApplePaySince you know your spend habit and think the programme suits u  just go for it.IMHO even if u can't hit the $600 requirement of the card  seems like u can hit the requirement of the bank account in the least,btohqsg
lots of offline spend can be converted to online spend e.g. fairprice app  buy vouchers on shopback/wogi etc  scan qr using xnap (for hawker food/coffeeshop)  shopback  favepay  foodpanda self pickup. Paying telco bill on telco app/website can be online spend also,btohqsg
MCC is jut a code to determine the type of the merchantThe other categorisation is payment mode - online/contactless/physical/magstripe,btohqsg
Think of it as a combination of the two (even Fave voucher purchases code as online),btohqsg
Maybe check back on your spending for the past months and see if you consistently spend $250 on eligible online spending.Unless you say 100% of your spending is literally tapping your phone or card/paynow/cash.This is based on UOB EVOL card spending requirements. At least minimally you hit $600.The other $250 spending is the ones you currently tap using your phone or card. In fact  if you're already tapping your phone  don't tap your card anymore.,btohqsg
Actually he can also consider UOB One first la...,btohqsg
Haha that's true.. but if don't use Grab/Shopee/shop at Dairy Farm also not worth... But if can consistently hit 1k monthly also not bad,btohqsg
yeah tbh my current habit is just apple pay + paynow everywhere  but i guess if i do go for uob evol i would change my habit when possible  e.g. start using fairprice app etc,btohqsg
what about compare to citi reward + amaze  is there anything i should be careful of for citi?,btohqsg
Oh I tot stash acc come with cc and must spend like uob one card. I thinking to apply stash acc,btohqsg
Don't use for public transport and travel-related expenses (hotels  airliens  etc.),btohqsg
mm yea this one i know  i'd probably add on standard char smart for public transport; and if i don't have much online spending for uob evol  should i just go for citi reward instead?,btohqsg
Why do u need an insurer to invest for u using publicly available diversified funds while charging u hefty fees and commissons  when u can do the same yourself using cheaper platforms like poems or fund supermart.,btohqsg
UOB Evol... i think can use for public transport also. If your goal is to collect miles  can consider looking at Lady's card for UOB One (I use only for Xnap  foodpanda  restaurant payments)Cause now i see your approach abit mixed up on what u wanna achieve hahaha,btohqsg
Should consider if you want miles or cashback :),btohqsg
im fairly new to this at this point i dont really have a preference actually,btohqsg
mine no take card..all transact done on the app...mostly no movements..just park and sit thy cash inside,btohqsg

Hi experts  for Standard Chartered BonusSaver account  paying the bonus saver credit card 3 times with $50  is it considered 3 eligible bill payment?,btohqsg
I think its more of time and effort needed to actually read up on it and understanding the underlying funds and UTs. Plus ILPs are 100% for passive investments where people do not have the time or sufficient background knowledge to do it. I just ended my 10 year APA with AIA and i overall made a good amount from basically just putting my money inside(Definately more from what i would have let it be rotting inside my bank lol) Yea the fees are high but my FA and his team really put the work for it where they texted me every 1-2months giving me market updates and my portfolio suggestions on how to switch funds etc! So if anyone needs a trusted FA  you can pm me.I think yea the stigma towards ILPs are bad cause the people who sell them mostly do it for the commissions. But to me is if u can find a trusted advisor who truly advises you according to your needs and not their wants. It generally addresses its purpose of being a passive income strategy towards wealth accumulation.,btohqsg
i just completed my 10 year APA 2.0 . If you want to know more u can PM me!,btohqsg
