I actually got number 5 in cohort for h2 econs w a B lmao,btohqsg
In mbt was a huge wow coz i got top 14 in chem 5th in econs and 1st in phy,btohqsg
chem is all about making an educated smoke,btohqsg
you see the data and then you smoke up some explanations to explain why the data is liddat,btohqsg
h2 chem is a shitty subject,btohqsg
dont bs with the bs himself,btohqsg
i still dunno what happened lmao,btohqsg
It is my highest scoring subject,btohqsg
But tbh the subject I spent most time with,btohqsg
well you're in pharm so makes sense,btohqsg
In my sch I think the top scorer (or if not within top 3) for h1 Econs prelims got C for a levels,btohqsg
fk the paper la i still hv nightmares that i got 30/75 or smth,btohqsg
results come back alr still nightmares,btohqsg
Then for my h2 Econs I got B even though I was within the top 15-20 for prelims,btohqsg
I considering retaking just econs only even though it won‚Äôt help with uni applications,btohqsg
I think not really worth to retake for the sake,btohqsg
I want to become an Econs tutor in the future and I feel like some phony/imposter if I can‚Äôt get A in the subject I want to teach,btohqsg
Nah it‚Äôs like I just can‚Äôt bring myself to teach the subject if I can‚Äôt even get the A myself lol,btohqsg
My cohort top in h2 econs is 80%,btohqsg
But like maybe I should scrap my plans to become an moe teacher,btohqsg
I enter the private sector first,btohqsg
people trust me to tutor them in H2 math despite my E for A levels,btohqsg
I wanted to but nie too far away,btohqsg
It‚Äôs harder to switch jobs from teaching to the private sector if I hate teaching,btohqsg
Ah it‚Äôs a good thing you didn‚Äôt go,btohqsg
me looking at my 0-20percentile chem in prelims,btohqsg
Some of my teachers entered the profession only in their 40s or even 50s,btohqsg
My useless gp tutor openly told the class ‚Äòi came to teaching out of no choice‚Äô,btohqsg
i‚Äôm gonna be at NTU for 8 years and the mrt there still won‚Äôt be complete,btohqsg
aye wtf if u go ntu,btohqsg
i may see u in ntu lol,btohqsg
haha idk i faster apply then go,btohqsg
if you take any math or physics mod there‚Äôs a non zero chance i TA,btohqsg
After then my impression of him went fr worse to worst,btohqsg
Yall should try treatsure it‚Äôs legit damn worth it,btohqsg
fk la uni accept me faster pls,btohqsg
Some hotel i went to I filled half my box with satay,btohqsg
