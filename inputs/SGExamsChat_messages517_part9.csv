From neutral to most flavoured in my opinion is Vodka Rum Whisky then Gin,btohqsg
Not as neutral u can get sweet notes from it,btohqsg
Wheres Vodka is basically from eitherpotatoes or Wheat,btohqsg
I am not gonna talk about Whiskey cuz that's a Pandoras box with Irish Scotch Bourbon,btohqsg

The laws only states that one cannot purchase alcohol below the age of 18.,btohqsg

I donâ€™t think PM shows up at MPS,btohqsg
Maybe for some grassroots bigger event but I donâ€™t think PM personally sit in,btohqsg
Minister level dont sit in i think  too busy and security risk,btohqsg
Aiya u get the point la he shows up certain events what maybe opening of a new building or some shit,btohqsg
No rlly once since endemic SDA don't exist liao,btohqsg
His body guard is defacto sda,btohqsg
Even for Ministers I see in dialogue sessions usually the security just blend in,btohqsg
I think even if minister kenna Covid wonâ€™t make news  only PM,btohqsg
If it's DPM or the main core cabinet then should be on the news,btohqsg
I donâ€™t recall any of them got report they had Covid tho,btohqsg
Maybe all younger and vaccinated so like me,btohqsg
Kenna all kind of flu but not Covid positive,btohqsg
