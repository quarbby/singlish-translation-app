🎉Pika World Daily Review – 3 March 2023🎉💎Against all odds towards a green closing🗽Equity markets shed off the burden of a rising yield and pare all losses decisively towards the closing  potentially averting a breakdown of an uptrend. It was a night of turbulence. First  we saw the 10-year Treasury yield rise above 4%. Then  the 2-year treasury yield rose sharply to 4.9%  a 52-week high.Without a doubt  the latest US jobless claim stood at 190K  which is still a resilient labour market. For the past few weeks  the firmer economic data with hawkish commentary from many Fed officials had dampened sentiment of any pivot or slowing of the interest rate hike. Now  market participants are pricing in a 26.2% chance that the Fed will boost the rate hike by 50 basis points during the March meeting.💰One comment  One boost- MVP goes to Bostic🗽Federal Reserve President Bostic believed a cautious stance was appropriate given the current restrictive monetary policy. Therefore  he supports a 0.25% hike which appeared to relieve the market. With that  the market breathed a sense of life  and we saw equity markets return to a solid footing.Nonetheless  we remain cautious of further headwinds as we welcome more critical data today.📮What are our dishes today?📖At 10.45 pm  we will have the S&P 500 Composite PMI for February  which is expected to climb to 50.5 from a contraction of 46.8.Next  at 11 pm comes many strings of data. The most important will be the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI data which is expected to moderate slightly to 54.5 from 55.2.FOMC Member Bostic is expected to speak at 12.45 am. So it might be yet another market mover again.It is 3 March  Friday  8.55 am in Singapore and 7.55 pm in New York. We have arrived at the final trading day of the week. So let’s hope for another green shoot and catch up tonight on the latest economic data release analysis.From your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Yea  I think this one hit rock bottom. They dump Biolidics shows that they are restructuring. Not an easy move considering they brought Biolidics to listing.

Back in 2017   Clearbridge IPO $0.280.Good to note that CEO Jeremy Yee was former CEO of Cordlife.He should be equipped with all the know how  IR and should have the capability to turn Clearbridge around now that they have gotten rid of loss making investment Biolidics.Those who have holding power can consider keeping some since they are trading at big discount and are in a good business sector for retailers to buy into (Aging population spiralling in SEA)By 2024  good probability they will be profitable. Fingers crossed. Dyodd. Let’s see. Good luck too.,btohqsg

Thats hw 1970s-1990s pick up...thats how we learn knn  kns  kkj also..Instead of speaking chinese or dialect to our babies.. alot turn ch.5 when their babies pop out.. how to expect our following gen to learn our language? Are we giving them the chance to learn? Keep saying grow up liao then learn... Grow up liao then all the other reasons come out..Then our following gen. Turn out to be bananas then we suck it up,btohqsg

Chinese my family definitely teaches cos we feel it's impt but dialect hard to find the extra time.,btohqsg
We're happy if our kids can do higher Chinese. Good enough,btohqsg
Dialect will rarely be applicable to career etc so unfortunately while I fancy kids being able to speak it  I think the practical reality is no longer for it,btohqsg
Tats more of like social skills  being able to clique.. like when talk hokkien to enciks in camp  being able to seek help when holiday in taiwan and speak canto in hk  just like being able to speak malay in malaysiaBut moreimpt.ly  sense of belonging  knowing one's identity  just like how malaysia trying to protect malays by giving malay benefits,btohqsg
Yes ideally but no time. You got kids bro? When you have then I hope you can do that. We don't have time or energy to bother about dialect,btohqsg
