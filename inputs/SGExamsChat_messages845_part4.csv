to be fair  even as an o level student  i would prolly recommend pfp more than sec 5,btohqsg
only exception is if you legit vaguely dunno what to do yet or if you are interested in jc,btohqsg

What's the cost for private candidate if I want to take for O Levels?,btohqsg
to be fair  math & science concepts + topics alike are harder when taught from different levels,btohqsg
i can say that for python but nah ppl still find basic python class tough ☠️,btohqsg
total for one just one subject as a private candidate student  can cost more than a few hundred dollars alr,btohqsg

I'm learning H2 Econs for the first time and I've found it quite intuitive,btohqsg
based on what my textbook has told me,btohqsg
if you're learning smth for the first time  it's easier to enjoy the process compared to students who have been studying the same content longer than someone who is just picking it up,btohqsg
or like when you end up picking up smth after a long time,btohqsg
it's more enjoyable when that happens,btohqsg
