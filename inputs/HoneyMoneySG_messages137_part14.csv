For yuu card can I confirm the 600 spend is supposed to be in calendar month or statement month?,btohqsg
Anyone know how to contact singsaver if no response via email?,btohqsg
This ding dong strategy. Is it always in on 1st day of the month and out the last day of the following month? Thank you.,btohqsg
One of my humans is actually loss $30 if inclusive dividend. Then add $80 voucher only gain $50.,btohqsg
I am not too sure what you mean.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜®. I only participate few months ago. If plus vouchers  return is about 4.5% pa.,btohqsg
Might as well just HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
Not p.a? Have u sold investment liao?,btohqsg
Not yet sell  still holding it. If not calculate per annum  then average 0.375% per month depending on how many months you have bought the fund. I think I bought at the right timing. I did not participate last year promo. Only participated few months ago.,btohqsg
Hi guys  need some help  I am currently still short of $200 to clock the min. Spend for HSBC live for this monthCurrently I am overseas now  did not bring the physical card along and also never activate the overseas usage.Is there recommendations to clock the $200 spend online?,btohqsg
Never activate can consider hitting requirement? Some banks no activate dont count,btohqsg
I think OP says he did not activate oversea usage n can use in SG only.,btohqsg
I dont see any option to activate overseas usage though,btohqsg
I just tap with google pay when overseas  transaction went through,btohqsg
Not sure is buying voucher via Heymax qualify?,btohqsg
I never had to call hsbc bank to activate overseas usage.,btohqsg
The only bank that blocks overseas possibly first time use is UOB,btohqsg
Anyone heard of Big Tiny investment ?,btohqsg
Not sure leh  I think hsbc need to call in to activate the overseas,btohqsg
Does scoot earn 4mpd for hsbc revolution ?,btohqsg
Yes   apparently they are offering 8-10% ROI,btohqsg
So I was wondering anyone tried before,btohqsg
Usually this kind of small sized investment platform it is very risky. I wonâ€™t want to call it a scam because I have no evidence. But usually this kind the founder is enriched by investors regardless of the actual performance.,btohqsg
Ya. I agree. He wants to offload his risk to unsuspecting investors while only paying very little,btohqsg
No one rent then ownself stay lor ðŸ˜‚For vacation,btohqsg
Yes. Maybe they are 100 houses and 10 000 investors. How?,btohqsg
"Normally you don't own the assets. Only the ""shares"" in that company",btohqsg
No lehz... I believe the investment model is... U buy 1 tiny house.... And they manage for you,btohqsg
If he had gone to actual banks to seek financing. Either he will get rejected or the rates charged are way above the 8-10% pa mentioned/projected.,btohqsg
8-10% is too low for the amount of risk to take. I would expect at least 30%-50%,btohqsg
Ok I had a Quick Look at the website.U are basically buying an ikea house on wheels with no land ownership.Am I correct,btohqsg
Hmmm not sure how that can even qualify as an investment.  lol,btohqsg
You believed is you believe. Actual is actual.,btohqsg
Still havent received EGA bonus interest. Anyone same? (Yup i have been yapping for few days already.. ),btohqsg
I got July-Aug. I think itâ€™s July promo,btohqsg
Ok! My stupid mistake! The interest is actually in  but is in human B acct on 24th. 2nd time receiving this EGA bonus  didnt realise it is to be received alternate between the 2 accts every month! ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
So jul aug ega bonus interest was in only on 24 Oct ?,btohqsg
So far only heard this date from thise who received,btohqsg
So Sep Oct ega bonus interest will only be in end Dec? Any hsbc ega experts here can confirm ?!,btohqsg
Look at the tnc for your promo. Safest,btohqsg
