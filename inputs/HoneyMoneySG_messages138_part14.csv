Can I ask a quick question  thanks all in advance.If I activate my CC on 1 Nov 24. Does this means my CC statement will be from 1 Nov 24 to 30 Nov 24?,btohqsg

hi gurus  if i were to travel to msia say 5-8 times a year  for hotel booking what's the best way to maximise points (miles  cashback or just points in general)say using UOB Lady's card1. book on tripdotcom  agoda  etc. via heymax to earn max miles2. book directly on 3rd party sitesor are there other alternatives that you guys use?thanks!!!!,btohqsg
i personally use ladys card via shopback book on trip/agoda/klookmaybe can also compare heymax and shopback miles/cashback rate and see which one more worth,btohqsg

Is instarem still working with Citi premium miles card? Tried making payment with instarem but payment keep failing,btohqsg
These stores have 10mpd if i pay with yuu cardI found them in yuu app,btohqsg
When I tried to link again with amaze it says my card needs authorisation but no authorisation message pop up,btohqsg
Check with citibank if they blocked the card for online use,btohqsg
Hey guys may I know whatâ€™s the best card to link to NTUC fair price app?,btohqsg
no 10mpd (36Ã— yuu points)  only get the 3x  5Ã—  6Ã— as indicated,btohqsg
Thanks!So i can use amaze+citi/kris flyer,btohqsg
If I do grab top up remaining amount using ocbc 365  will it allow me to hit the min $800 spend?,btohqsg
hey guys  is there a card that can do both daily expenses (groceries  eating out) + travel at the same time. idk if its a good idea to get diff cards for diff purpose bc i only spend on myself and my travels are probably around ~$4-5k per year  which isnt that much ?,btohqsg
which cards best to pay medical bills via HealthHub? Thx,btohqsg
That card doesn't really exist unless you want to use unoptimized general spend cards.,btohqsg
would Citi Rewards .. UOB signature .. UOB preferred .. work as well? cos exceeds cap,btohqsg
use family of uob cards that earn uni$ that pool. Use uob PPV for mobile contactless (travel/groceries/dining etc)  uob ppv for online dining/groceries/shopping  uob vs for local contactless or foreign spend  uob lady for travel etc,btohqsg
thx .. is there one more card ? with that 2 cards I can settle 4K over 2 months,btohqsg
You can take ur sweet time to settle health hub. They will send mail and gently remind u to pay. And that's all. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Do you find the price is significantly higher when you use click through ShopBack vs not ? Thatâ€™s been my experience,btohqsg
For trip  price about the same for me. For Agoda price via shopback is higher. Didn't try klook so can't comment.,btohqsg
eh thats a great question... i never noticed at all ðŸ˜… ive always been using shopback,btohqsg
Expedia price remains unchanged from my checks,btohqsg
can confirm klook price is the same so safe to use shopback,btohqsg
Yep same with Agoda. Price jumps differently when using between Heymax or ShopBack even. Klook always unchanged in my experience.,btohqsg
Sorry. Can I trouble whoever is curious to do price challenge,btohqsg
Ok guys and gals. Just for education sake. Whoever is curious and free.Can u all use your best platforms and tell me what price u can get for this hotel. 2 queen beds no breakfast. Non refundable. 1-6th December 2024 (5 nights). 2 adults.Yes u can use your ShopBack and heymax and whatever.Thanks.,btohqsg
I still donâ€™t understand why nobody raves about Expedia.I never found agoda cheap compared to Expedia,btohqsg
Citibank agoda have 20 percent off now. Can spilt night to get more out of the booking,btohqsg
173.8/night with some random coupons dk from whr ðŸ¤£ on agoda,btohqsg
Is that 2 queen bed (not one king)and what happens if u press claim the 10% offer,btohqsg
can expedia free cancellation and pay nothing until xx date?,btohqsg
Any promo code to enter for this?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Expedia has free cancellation for many hotels actually.Pay nothing I think price goes up,btohqsg
775 for 5 night if spilt for citi into 3 booking. 155 per night,btohqsg
cant get the 10% link anymore ðŸ˜… mb for 2 queen is 200.8/night ish  might be able to get 194.8 w dbs card -$30 off not sure if applicable for this hotel tho cant check atm,btohqsg
Ok are u all ready for my Expedia price?,btohqsg
Nope just need to go citi agoda landing page and see if your hotel is eligible.,btohqsg
Pay nothing until xx date is a scam. 5% will be added for that convenience.,btohqsg
