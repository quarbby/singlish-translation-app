How do you know what's inside you unless you test yourself? Don't do one push-up  do 100. Don't run one mile  run a marathon. Don't have one family  have a second family all the way across the country. Don't just have a second family  have a third family in Santa Fe with an alternative lifestyle. Don't spend any time with the first two families  make a commitment to family number three  and double down by announcing it at his war-hero father's retirement party. Don't go to the funeral  'cause  remember  you got two other families to deal with and a marathon to train for. Don't just let Kenneth walk out of your life  take his life from him. Don't just go to jail  go to death row by killing the other two families. Don't just let anyone have their closure by apologizing  send a message that you're not afraid of hell. Nike.

... Holiday. I've given up all chance for a holiday. I've made my mind a sunless space. I share my dreams with ghosts. I wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago from which there's only one conclusion  I'm damned for what I do. My anger  my ego  my unwillingness to yield  my eagerness to fight  they've set me on a path from which there is no escape. I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost and by the time I looked down there was no longer any ground beneath my feet. What is my sacrifice? I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I'll never see. And the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror or an audience or the light of gratitude. So what do I sacrifice? Everything!,btohqsg
