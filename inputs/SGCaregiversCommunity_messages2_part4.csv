Hi Jane. This course is not suitable for caregivers caring for stroke survivors  as this course is meant for caregivers caring for loved ones with developmental disabilities. If your loved one is subsequently diagnosed or suspected to develop mental health conditions as a result of his/her physical health conditions  then you may wish to consider attending our C2C PMHI coursehttps://www.cal.org.sg/c2c. Hope this clarifies. Thank you.,btohqsg
Thank u for yr clarifications. Much appreciated üòä,btohqsg
The Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being was set up in July 2021 to oversee mental health and well-being efforts for the population  focusing on cross-cutting issues that require interagency collaborations.The Taskforce has identified three focus areas to address and has proposed a set of preliminary recommendations.We seek your feedback on the preliminary recommendations and any other suggestions you may have to improve the mental health and well-being of the population.
