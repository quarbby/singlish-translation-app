Like the chers dress as hitler,btohqsg
Yeah i messed up my Os as well didnt stjdy shit,btohqsg
if you have the drive  you'd be looking for opportunities yourself and not be waiting for school to bestow it upon you.,btohqsg
ya apparently my friends bought us and USSR flags for hist,btohqsg
say that to the MPs from RI,btohqsg
looks like I said wrongly sorry about that,btohqsg
HAHHAHAH yah dammn funny bro I wan go,btohqsg
was referring to going to nush and not doing well enough,btohqsg
True when there is a will there is a way,btohqsg
Don't forget that each cohort is more than 1200,btohqsg
At the end of the day  depends on what you do,btohqsg
If u go elite better chances,btohqsg
In that 1200 each year  how many are going to become our MPs?,btohqsg
For elite schools  they have tons morw,btohqsg
every school has via and servie learning opportunities,btohqsg
But of course depend on urself,btohqsg
if you try and failed there can only be 2 reasons,btohqsg
Not entirely true.A lot of schools don't even have access to olympiads,btohqsg
I’ve seen the ones at ACJC,btohqsg
I heard ri has a humanity programme,btohqsg
You can be in RI and just do A’s and you’ll be no different from any other JC student,btohqsg
I mean its gives u a good study profile but even if u r in a bad scg if ur alevel results are good then they will look at yr results not sch,btohqsg
Hey bedok how r u doing in sec 5 buddy,btohqsg
Practically opportunities no matter your interest,btohqsg
I should've jst take part jn math olympiad when given the chance to do so,btohqsg
Untrue  even YIJC has participation in Olympiads like chem olympiad,btohqsg
1. You didnt try hard enough or 2.Barking up the wrong tree. If you're sure you've tried hard enough  look for another tree that is more suitable for you to bark up.,btohqsg
Nice!Whr u panning to go to aft tht,btohqsg
Like other than.sch u can join via leadership character and cca so Ig its wat u prioritse,btohqsg
Then again w without winning anything in Olympiads  no point in going,btohqsg
I must have been seeing apparitions then,btohqsg
focus your time on something else,btohqsg
Ye I can’t find the  tree,btohqsg
DHS would most probs accept u haha,btohqsg
When i was j1 during the j2 study week chem lecture they put up slides asking us to apply for chem olympiad if we want to,btohqsg
Itll look good in ur profile an dlike I guessed like all ans once and like miracle I got in so like u nvr know,btohqsg
Correction  blunder on my part shouldve been JPJC,btohqsg
Yah I mean try but udk jus guess,btohqsg
Maybe thats for your cohort they did it in november 2018,btohqsg
I got so much hate for the math olympiad shit lol,btohqsg
Cause the smart people in my sch didnt think I deserve it,btohqsg
Cause I was the only one who got im and mot them,btohqsg
If thats true then i must have been hearing things,btohqsg
So during mo training they were like omg ur so fab,btohqsg
they could’ve signed up by themselves,btohqsg
anyone wrmember taking those UNSW tests in pri sch,btohqsg
Then they whispered to my frnds that fab meant fucking asshole bitch lol,btohqsg
