I never said that I just finished Os.,btohqsg
How abt you?? You're in uni?,btohqsg
Forgive him. He just finished his finals,btohqsg
But all i can think of,btohqsg
Is present value of increasing perpetual cash flow,btohqsg
Just because he just finished his finals? Isn‚Äôt that its original state?,btohqsg
Have fun with that. Good luck with that.,btohqsg
2wks of rest then its all hands on deck,btohqsg
all hands on deck for what,btohqsg
I hv 1 case competitions to participate and 1 to organize,btohqsg
And need plan ori nxt yr,btohqsg
there's quite a few hoops to jump through to get everything done,btohqsg
then this is like the best time where no classes,btohqsg
Ori is play play oni la,btohqsg
Real killer is 2 competition and cca,btohqsg
i going back ntu here and there to watch IHG,btohqsg
2 dec everything back full force,btohqsg
While people have cca and ogls,btohqsg
mine is just lots of meetings  talks  and conferences to attend,btohqsg
I just changed mine coz it's been years already and one fine day wifi died but lan iso k,btohqsg
4 is about time I guess,btohqsg
Dw im here to provide unlimited moral support,btohqsg
i do that for every group projects also,btohqsg
Can support the competition im hosting,btohqsg
I wan to be a slacker,btohqsg
But theres no carry to carry my ass,btohqsg
My anxiety stops me from being a slacker,btohqsg
as much as I want to be,btohqsg
This sem i hard carried 2 projects and got carried for 1,btohqsg
let's check out my data rn,btohqsg
Idk Netflix that data hungry sia,btohqsg
I thought its j like YouTube,btohqsg
does m1 charge you for calling them ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôd rather have your unlimited support in teaching Joel to know how to remotely roast back.,btohqsg
The girls bf carried our team for python mod,btohqsg
You never did give me any pop lyrics to correct.,btohqsg
full marks   why you even bother asking smh,btohqsg
Does anyone want to study together,btohqsg
ohhh never say...based on my observation...people spent more time flipping pages than actually writing and doing the paper,btohqsg
Do I look like I have a holiday,btohqsg
I‚Äôm studying photoshop. Its not that sad.,btohqsg
Over vc. Because I hate the silence.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt miss school. I never had one day just to myself. I had medical commitments.,btohqsg
Imagine doing night shift 24/7 on top of working 15 hour days.,btohqsg
I hate humans as a result of that usually.,btohqsg
Yall should pick up a gaslighting job,btohqsg
The only way his argument is flawed is because your understanding of his flawless argument is severely flawed.,btohqsg
How are we even gaslighting you here,btohqsg
I dont use gaslighting when I flame,btohqsg
Yeah. Roasting isn‚Äôt equivalent to gaslighting  which is an artistic form of psychological manipulation.,btohqsg
Im concerned about the use of artistic here,btohqsg
You‚Äôre not even flaming  you just pour the gasoline fuel all over yourself then give us a lighted match to burn you with it.,btohqsg
Examples of Gaslighting ParentsLabeling the Child's Feelings. You're not really hungry. ...,btohqsg
so yall labelled my emotional state or feeling,btohqsg
He should be. Because he‚Äôs saying that the equivalent of gaslighting is roasting.,btohqsg
yes the deepest darkest face of telegram,btohqsg
stories of her horrible executions tranverse the lands near and far,btohqsg
You‚Äôre not such an asshole. Joel just hasn‚Äôt possessed his ability to not be deluded since his conception.,btohqsg
I come back to seeing Joel being roasted?,btohqsg
I'll be doing research  so it's studying in a way,btohqsg
bedok do we look like weebs to u,btohqsg
Oh? I couldn‚Äôt tell  but not surprising since you tell us all to ‚Äúchill‚Äù when we tell you to go study  because do you even possess the ability to take any matter seriously? Absolutely not. And that‚Äôs a fact.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even enjoy the consumption of anime forms of entertainment media.,btohqsg
I am gonna study now bye,btohqsg
my best friend has like >1000 titles. born weeb,btohqsg
then also went to Japan for a semester exchange,btohqsg
and got hit on by so many japanese guys (cos she's white),btohqsg
Its so satisfying  because I don‚Äôt even have to break a sweat or even put in any effort to do it  since he‚Äôs not worthy of either  anyways.,btohqsg
The worst thing about roasting Joel is when I have other things to do,btohqsg
Its the only decent plot other than violet evergarden,btohqsg
going on with no talent and no hope¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª¬ª,btohqsg
I called his bluff immediately earlier.,btohqsg
more interesting than being the most powerful,btohqsg
Oh  that sounds like its the ultimate description of you  though.,btohqsg
It isn‚Äôt necessarily something that you should be happy or proud of,btohqsg
been seeing that thing for idk how long already but still keep forgetting,btohqsg
Krebs cycle is just OCAS FM radio station,btohqsg
just somehow found it in my gallery LOL,btohqsg
That‚Äôs where I recognise it from.,btohqsg
my phys cher keeps saying that,btohqsg
to remind us energy doesn't just come from nowhere,btohqsg
you know something I realise dads teach survival and moms teach love,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think that you‚Äôre in any position to give us such baseless advice that we should take  because why? Did you attend and then survive studying and graduating medical school  chronic slacker? If you don‚Äôt have any experience with that  please can your unsolicited advice.,btohqsg
I always get compared to him,btohqsg
That explains why I am a stone cold heartless survivor,btohqsg
But only freakin‚Äô warrior queens  am I right?,btohqsg
yea  and mass is also energy,btohqsg
It can only be transformed from one form to another.,btohqsg
Who says that I‚Äôm sad? That‚Äôs cute that you think that I am.,btohqsg
Still doesn‚Äôt give you any right to shove unsolicited advice down our throats when you haven‚Äôt even firsthandedly experienced it for yourself.,btohqsg
but I dont love people that much,btohqsg
but yeah if you like people its for you,btohqsg
Of course you do  how predictable coming from you. You‚Äôd choose materialistic riches than to actually make any effort to make an impactful difference and leave your legacy to change the world for the better. Why should any one even be surprised by that? Its not like you‚Äôve given us any reason to expect more than that  especially when it comes from the likes of you.,btohqsg
I rather be rich and happy than happy and poor,btohqsg
there aint no legacy if you dont become one someone else will take over you,btohqsg
I probably know him personally and could argue that you‚Äôre nowhere even remotely within the considerable league to even have the honour of being compared to him  not to mention be his own pushing competition to challenge himself there.,btohqsg
I only care abt my family,btohqsg
I'm gonna make the comp sci people redundant,btohqsg
I hv to say it takes a certain lvl of character to wish to do good and actually work hard 2wards it ah,btohqsg
And it usually takes a certain lvl of affluence for ppl to say that,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know that trying your best means that it looks like slacking off and procrastinating actually studying  which is what you routinely do  apparently.,btohqsg
Most ppl i know who wish to spend their lives helping ppl come frm comfortable backgrounds,btohqsg
Like you saved a life. That you changed someone else‚Äôs life.,btohqsg
The most help I'm offering to people is discovering more about the world lol,btohqsg
And hoping to implement it into something tangible,btohqsg
For me the point of life is for myself to experience all good the world has to offer,btohqsg
so different from those typical stories we see on shows lol,btohqsg
but they sacrifice their sanity and years of their life for it,btohqsg
and I aint gonna do that,btohqsg
Then at least you can say that you gave it your best shot. That you didn‚Äôt lose. Because the only way to lose is to have not bothered to fight. And the only way to win is to go down fighting  even when the odds seem impossible.,btohqsg
But it does take a lot of hardwork and drive whuch i admit i do not hv,btohqsg
My MAs have. I‚Äôm usually that someone.,btohqsg
...dont do this unless last resort,btohqsg
Not every thing is a fight to the death,btohqsg
Try to win b4 the fight,btohqsg
If you ‚Äúinsanely respect‚Äù them  as you claim that you supposedly do  then make an effort to make a difference. Make it easier for those working in the healthcare system  not exacerbate the issue further by burdening it.,btohqsg
Eh its applicable to alot of things,btohqsg
I was just saying i would nvr go there,btohqsg
And the way to do that is from the ground up on the inside.,btohqsg
Different ppl hv different goals in life,btohqsg
Neither are you helping the situation  which is contributing to the issue. You have access to the resources to unlock every opportunity for yourself to help  but instead? You‚Äôd rather procrastinate studying.,btohqsg
what do you want me do sia,btohqsg
Healthcare professionals do have that  its just a matter of how badly you want to prioritise having it. And what you consider to be your relatively acceptable definition of it.,btohqsg
But joel u wan med meh,btohqsg
And u wan med also isit,btohqsg
Ngl I kind of got lost in this conversation a while back,btohqsg
But dr is the most infamous one yes,btohqsg
Most of my job prospect is like this,btohqsg
Or  we could at least try to go down fighting to make it better.,btohqsg
I am done studying for today,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt tell who you‚Äôre speaking to,btohqsg
I mean he str8 up doesnt want healthcare tho,btohqsg
If imma gnna spend so much time on work,btohqsg
Might as well rake in big bucks,btohqsg
My lesser goal would basically let me live very comfortably but never rich,btohqsg
Unless my bigger goal works out very well,btohqsg
I wanted to be a pshychologist when I was young,btohqsg
its about my childhood aspiration bro,btohqsg
Im more of a sleazy wall street guy than a sleazy mother basement guy,btohqsg
EH WRONG   MINE IS PNS OCC,btohqsg
Experienced ones in Singapore is so difficult to find.,btohqsg
Psych is one of those fields where if you want a job actually in the field  Bachelor's isn't enough,btohqsg
I want yall to have an existential crises,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt they have to work on call as well,btohqsg
look at your own notes i guess,btohqsg
In psych u hv to deal with x10 ppls problems,btohqsg
Imma go for an easy life,btohqsg
If ur mental not strong enough,btohqsg
you can see your feelings are really absorbed by your therapist friend,btohqsg
By ur therapist in general ah,btohqsg
I use to think therapist is jobs for empaths,btohqsg
people who commit suicide are optimists,btohqsg
And you need to take care of your own mental health. Don‚Äôt take on your patients‚Äô emotional burdens onto your own to solve  either.,btohqsg
enjoy the simple things in life,btohqsg
Maybe  that‚Äôs the point of life. The purpose of living. Having a lot to lose when you fall makes your life even more emotionally vibrant and worth living.,btohqsg
Wlao I can't type tdy ist,btohqsg
Because its just life. Its going to be over before you know it. And at the end? If you experience truly enough  you‚Äôll have good stories to tell at the end of how you actually lived.,btohqsg
I feel like shit experiences make us rly appreciate the good ones even more,btohqsg
Cuz that's this basis of comparison,btohqsg
Don't focus on the tangible. And easy come  easy go.,btohqsg
Not to minimise that the shit was bad ah,btohqsg
And also make for interesting stories,btohqsg
Altho usu it's not exactly funny more just jaw dropping,btohqsg
I was thinking how dna polymerase and the stupid end replication problem is the reason why our lifes are much shorter,btohqsg
If there was a way around it,btohqsg
but cant change it cos it would mess up everything,btohqsg
What about thinking about solutions to issues within your examinable syllabus first?,btohqsg
hey hey curiosity is in the 21st century learning outcomes,btohqsg
Spend sometime figure out  what do you want your eulogy to be. =),btohqsg
this lowkey worse than germany losing to south korea,btohqsg
but both goals scored at the v end,btohqsg
argentina had a whole 40 minutes to catch,btohqsg
Messi did an interview pre game saying they will confm win,btohqsg
saudi only had 2 on target,btohqsg
i feel vv sad for the vast majority of the fans who support argentina,btohqsg
The two goals were very good though,btohqsg
bro iw to see the match,btohqsg
i rly wonder what really went wrong,btohqsg
can he change course if he does well,btohqsg
subject to approval  but generally much higher chance if he does well,btohqsg
cos the program he wants may be competitive,btohqsg
he's going to get way better answers by emailing the faculty office,btohqsg
if uni GPA 3.5 can change anot,btohqsg
Only way is to do common engineering courses then switch over  if he has not entered uni and has accepted the offer. Else  reapply next year.,btohqsg
If he does well in like EE,btohqsg
If uni  then of course  smart is based on the exam scores  higher the better and mind you  the competition.,btohqsg
then can do well and transfer,btohqsg
Not my problem if he don't score and cannot switch course.,btohqsg
I'm trying to say  smart not equal to high cap.,btohqsg
just tell him to study his ass off if he wants a chance,btohqsg
at least now NTU got the annoying general education curriculum in first sems,btohqsg
I think he last minute burnout,btohqsg
just some mods you'd have to make up and stuff,btohqsg
I just wanna know any requirements,btohqsg
i wanna know for both transitions,btohqsg
the only common ground is the common mods all NTU students have to take in their first year,btohqsg
cos they'll be taking less course specific mods in the first sem,btohqsg
Then why dont people switch course in uni if As cmi,btohqsg
as in for the course they want,btohqsg
also I said no strict requirement  not no requirements lol,btohqsg
so most people dont do this kinda stuff,btohqsg
Courses have pre requisite. Fulfil them by any means  you move to 2nd year. If u wish to switch to any discipline  fulfil the requisite. School  don't care how u do it. Pay extra sem or overload.,btohqsg
eh I'm an outlier experience too then,btohqsg
there's some profs in my faculty that are known to be very good at teaching and caring for students,btohqsg
Can I switch also from comp engi to comp science,btohqsg
He is a com sci prof. ü§£,btohqsg
I hope bell curve is strong enuf,btohqsg
I would say  choose a course that you like or you are good at and don't mind burning midnight oil over. Comp sci has a certain dna compared to every engineering branches.,btohqsg
If you don't know what you like  just get the shortest degree out and go out work.,btohqsg
Ntu comp sci also so high,btohqsg
comp sci is just very saturated rn,btohqsg
and i'm speaking as someone that's in the interface of physics and comp science lol,btohqsg
anyone percentage of students who get 90rp  and go biz,btohqsg
I cant go alot of places,btohqsg
I am damn borderline B and C,btohqsg
You need to be of certain mindset thinking for com sci. Not everyone survives there.,btohqsg
Yupz. So don't matter how smart u r. It is the bell curve.,btohqsg
I hope bellcurve lower all the way,btohqsg
Chem was hard thats what I heard,btohqsg
in my y1  I took a calculus module with Math majors,btohqsg
I manage to pull up mcq to 22,btohqsg
2 more I no need worry,btohqsg
and their cohort bigger than physics,btohqsg
my p4 lets say 75 then p2 60 p3 52,btohqsg
Take ranking as a pinch of salt.,btohqsg
What do you think Its gonna be,btohqsg
I just ask cos the name Ivy League really doesn't translate to quality nowadays,btohqsg
and the cert is good enuf,btohqsg
for A? I think low 70%,btohqsg
yea I mean if the goal is potentially working in the states  it's a no brainer,btohqsg
Paper 2 went alright like B,btohqsg
Overseas is all about the education. It isn't force fed like in sg. This trains up a certain mindset in terms of thinking and analysing  assuming all else the same  e.g drive to work the ass off. Also  overseas has more opportunities  not sure about it now.,btohqsg
P2 i dont think so   a lot of hidden knowledge i feel? Average person should be getting 60%,btohqsg
i know people got A for prelims also never finished p3,btohqsg
but they prob did the ones they knew well,btohqsg
the messed up thing was although it was memory work   the marks allocation quite little hence quite rush,btohqsg
I checked my 1st question i misread,btohqsg
then last one I was rushing,btohqsg
p4 I think I got 80%,btohqsg
no one gets full marks bro,btohqsg
ok so everyone got 60% for chem p3 qh,btohqsg
I got 48 minus 6 hidden,btohqsg
full marks on 1st dec harder...,btohqsg
later i go in see 5 Bs in a row sheesh boom gone,btohqsg
Is so much easier than chem,btohqsg
my chem mcq always higher than bio,btohqsg
like I did all the planning all,btohqsg
then first 20 questions no Dlast 10 got 8 Ds,btohqsg
If on the dot then np,btohqsg
Says the guy who‚Äôs annoyed by the unwavering faith of your mother.,btohqsg
Hey SY. Wait  may I call you SY?,btohqsg
lol i had an NS nickname,btohqsg
if you read my name tag,btohqsg
there'd be this one guy that's just like,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not that much of a menace. Not to most people  usually. Unless they are Joel. In which case  they have no chance of getting me to like them.,btohqsg
Thank you for saying what we were all thinking  but couldn‚Äôt bother telling him again  because he never does listen no matter how much we say.,btohqsg
C is gonna be so ugly man,btohqsg
I wouldn‚Äôt take my chances there.,btohqsg
A levels is said to be one of the hardest exam in the world  you don‚Äôt want to have to do it twice.,btohqsg
then route march you sleep and stand or sleep and walk LOL,btohqsg
I feel bad for your future wife. What if she‚Äôs talking to you mid-sentence  and you fall asleep on her.,btohqsg
He will get a slap first.,btohqsg
Unless you are conceived and born as Joel aka you.,btohqsg
me during a level right now,btohqsg
Joel. Please respectfully shut up  and stop talking; go study instead.,btohqsg
WHAT DID I DO TO JOEL,btohqsg
i hope our papers switch up,btohqsg
At least you didn‚Äôt almost drop them.,btohqsg
Still sounds like more sleep than my Uncle has gotten in a week  but not everyone can be him,btohqsg
eww imagine your friends get BBBB,btohqsg
the only difference is 1 handwriting nicer,btohqsg
Essentially my Uncle except that he never gets a break of full sleep.,btohqsg
Thank you for saying what we‚Äôre all thinking.,btohqsg
OH MY GOSH. JOEL. STOP TALKING AND GO STUDY.,btohqsg
Always taking one for the team when we‚Äôre already exhaustedly done with him and dealing with a stubborn piece of work.,btohqsg
night night dont let the bugs bite,btohqsg
Kiss up to bios ass and make it your bitch to kiss yours.,btohqsg
"i saw this as 90% or 87.5% for bio LOLLLL and i was like ""gg  im gone""",btohqsg
But yeah  good idea  I‚Äôm not putting my effort in going there to inflict bodily harm on him physically before the paper.,btohqsg
This is the nicest thing you've said to him,btohqsg
I know right. Be proud of me.,btohqsg
Was trying to find a roast in it but nope,btohqsg
First time smth nice came outta ur mouth,btohqsg
I am nice to Kuro. And SY. And Yunrui.,btohqsg
Accurate description of what I do.,btohqsg
Joel is such a special boy,btohqsg
Confidence without character is dangerously lethal  but character without confidence is a much more solvably rare prominent issue.,btohqsg
His mother wouldn‚Äôt have the patience to deal with constantly putting up with his bullcrap.,btohqsg
Do u mean character as in morals or just personality,btohqsg
Its not really the same thing,btohqsg
I wasn‚Äôt even trying. There is no effort put into trying.,btohqsg
I mean she says that but shes here all day talking to joel,btohqsg
I‚Äôve actually been told that I‚Äôve a nonexistent sense of humor.,btohqsg
I feel she is pass the point of roasting,btohqsg
I‚Äôm actually here all day to talk to Kuro  Pocoyo  SY & Yunrui. Except Joel showing up is coincidentally adding to my day‚Äôs to-do list.,btohqsg
I put my face as my pfp,btohqsg
Great  you‚Äôve accepted your fate then.,btohqsg
When they once had energy and exuberance to live.,btohqsg
I developed an unhealthy reliance to caffeine.,btohqsg
I've had less than 5 cups of coffee in my life,btohqsg
I‚Äôm guessing that she‚Äôs one of the strange species that appreciate tea.,btohqsg
My friends have hypothesised that if you gave me 3 shots of espresso  I might have a cardiac arrest,btohqsg
I agree considering that you're old,btohqsg
How do you survive on just three shots a day,btohqsg
I mostly just drink water lol,btohqsg
overdose of anything can kill u,btohqsg
We shld b full of energy and longing for tomorrow,btohqsg
i'd rather take later finals than cramping all my finals in 3 days,btohqsg
U gotta look at the silver linings,btohqsg
I DONT NEED HOLIDAYS I NEED TIME TO REVISE,btohqsg
we both applied that time wat,btohqsg
