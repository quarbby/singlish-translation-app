PHV sticker annoying la every year have to go back to check,btohqsg

blue sticky will kana look down,btohqsg
Yea. Every time I go w/ my friend who has GrabDriver app to just show the cashier,btohqsg
I pump 66L I pay $130,btohqsg
I need to make some grabdriver friends,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt have to actually. If you free enough you can go Carousell and look for Esso voucher listings. Some of them wanna earn points by giving you the advantage of pumping under their PHV scheme,btohqsg
So you get the full benefits of PHV discount at Esso  but you don‚Äôt earn the points because you‚Äôd be using their cards to get the discount,btohqsg
So you pump  get the discount  but they earn the points,btohqsg
Which I feel is fair enough of a trade,btohqsg
In SG that‚Äôs the cheapest already,btohqsg
I have not pump any petrol since early July 2023,btohqsg
Lolol then what‚Äôs your comment in relation to?,btohqsg
I did not know the petrol is so expensive,btohqsg
I only know the price keep increasing,btohqsg
I am waiting for the lucky draw for the petrol,btohqsg
The increase so far has fluctuated around the 8c mark,btohqsg
So the difference is less significant in comparison to 2 years ago before the petrol excise duty came in to play,btohqsg
Price of V Power in SG in 2021 was $2.85/l before discount,btohqsg
u now got car to pump meh,btohqsg
u shud hav kept ur cold car,btohqsg
cus now sell like loss leh,btohqsg
Is V power / 98 really much better than 95? My fuel cap shows my petrol recommendation to be 95 but some people that I know swear by 98 & V power to give 100-200km more than 95.,btohqsg
need to try for 3 full tanks,btohqsg
btw let the engine/ecu run in,btohqsg
Fuel tank is from full to warning light?,btohqsg
More smoother definitely but extra 200km i doubt so,btohqsg
newer cars can adjust the air fuel ration and engine timing to give more power when using higher grade fuel,btohqsg
gives you a little more power but doesn't mean more mileage,btohqsg
"I see  so I should definitely strike off the ""extra milleage"" claims that they made",btohqsg
The car that I driving is like so basic  I won't benefit much from it. Maybe for those drive conti that require more power is better for them,btohqsg
There is literally no point for you toPump V power or even 98 if you‚Äôre not tuned for it or you drive an ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù car,btohqsg
Even shell fuelsave also unlikely to give you more bang for buck considering you pay more for it,btohqsg
Best way to get more mileage is still driving habit and using the recommended petrol on your fuel cap,btohqsg
Most conti i know still use 95.. unless stage 2..,btohqsg
unless u drive a high spec engine which required a higher octane  u are better off pumping 95,btohqsg
Mileage and fuel consumption also depends on how heavy footer u are.. size of rims plays a part and also.. how much junk u store in ur boot leh ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™,btohqsg
Shouldn't look down  cos if they dun come  pax LPPL,btohqsg
Most cars use 95. Some lower CC cars even go to 92 as recommended.,btohqsg
Which fuel cheaper then pump which fuel,btohqsg
You will get lower mileage if you put alot of things in your boot i.e your spoiler,btohqsg
Once awhile give the vehicle a nice pump,btohqsg
Their discount 5 dollar for 70 gross spent lol but better than nothing,btohqsg
I got vouncher   should be able to stack,btohqsg
so good ah. I pump vpower i lesser mileage cos happily stepping cos of 'perceived' power,btohqsg
my is min 92. i pump 95 good enough,btohqsg
even a 2017 honda city w 1.5l ivtec also recommended 92 iirc,btohqsg
