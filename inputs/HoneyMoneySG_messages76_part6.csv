If I'm buying laptop from harvey norman  I link my posb card to kris+ app. Is it right that I'll get points on kris+? And it will help me hit the $1500 dbs spend (and get $150 rebate)?,btohqsg
i think other dbs card link to kris app is better then posb everyday?,btohqsg
Haha  I only have everyday card and 2 yuu cards ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Didn't apply for other dbs cards... coz I tot I have uob cards  revo  crmc le... nvr spend so much every month also. Abit regret ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Then go n apply  still can get it?,btohqsg
Oh  that means I delay the purchase first... now got black Friday sale. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So recommended cards for dbs are livefresh and altitude. Right? Always see u all mentioned these two cards...,btohqsg

Hi all..quick question...the UOB $500 min card spend..if i got a November 31 transaction..when it goes thru a few days later..they count as nov or dec one ar?TYIA...,btohqsg
How come your transaction can have 31 November? Which phone you are using?,btohqsg
Posting date is after Transaction date,btohqsg
Considered as Dec. All transactions counted must be POSTED in the month of period stated.,btohqsg
refunded amount will reduce the card spending amount  need to topup spending,btohqsg
Usually the EGA deduction for dbs credit card for giro will be on which day of the month upon approval yesterday ?,btohqsg
Any suggestions on what vouchers to buy to clock online spending for UOB evol ?,btohqsg
The 417.20 Singapore Airlines ticket on Ladyâ€™s Card just gave 83 UNI? Travel selected as category,btohqsg
Among the supermarkets  Cold storage posts the transactions fastest. Sheng Siong voucher doesn't have expiry date  Nov 25 is still early. Should be able to get posted by Nov 30 if you buy today.,btohqsg
$417 x 0.4 miles / 2 = 83 UNI$Correct. It is 83 UNI$,btohqsg
But since RA already created  does this still works for above 55?,btohqsg
well don't use this grp to advertise your referral then ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But u need to check on your statement to see if giro is effected by dbs even though it have been approve incase u miss payment.,btohqsg
Hi  sorry if someone has already posted this question. Will I still be qualified if I empty my UOB one account by end of Nov and deposit it on 1 Dec?  Thanks in advance.,btohqsg

Can buy from any ss shops?,btohqsg
Should be. Ask at cashier. They will contact their supervisor.,btohqsg

Hi  ask a noob question on Webull  will there be any unforeseen charges for those Webull free shares inside margin account?,btohqsg
Yeah.. it has been a few months already.. half of my Tada rides are classified as Not online.. DBS customer service just said it is merchant who submitted the transaction details and they can't do anything about it. Thus I am using UOB EVOL for TADA ride now..,btohqsg
realistically for me I think enough ah haha  maybe retire at about 70 den left about 10-20 years to live haha,btohqsg
anyone got tip on how to save 10-20K at 16-18 yr old   I'm still young but wanna be a entrepreneur in the future. Currently schooling but have a part time job that's pays $10/HR. I also use to have a side hustle on carou but I stop liao cuz no time haha.Now my sch savings (CDA) got like 10K already but only can use for schooling until 21 yr old den can withdraw.Norm saving POSB got about 1.3K  interest vv jialat (0.03Â¢)/ monthMaybank 1.3K oso  interest for me is (0.20Â¢)/ month quite good lah.I can't invest in stocks/crypto/webull or wtv investment things cuz I not yet min age to do that .So only can count on working more and getting bursary haha,btohqsg
At 16-18  you can park funds at high saving accounts with no salary requirements like CIMB Fastsaver. Change your bank account is the first step. After that can slowly read about investing,btohqsg
Yep when I research about banks I saw that CIMB had the highest interest,btohqsg
Yes it still work for MA.. u can also top up RA  but personally I wouldn't do it,btohqsg
Just study hard now. Money will grow exponentially next time.,btohqsg
Yup. I wonâ€™t top up RA. Thanks  will check on MA Topup,btohqsg
Study and balanced with a good life  find your purpose & meaning  enjoy your youth,btohqsg
I don't like studying ðŸ˜… but I like computing so sometimes I help people in computing haha   might be working in that field.,btohqsg
Yes in future maybe get a degree in computing etc  can work and earn big bucks. When you have big bucks  you can grow that money quicker rather than grow $1000 right now which gives you less than $5 right now when you invest etc.,btohqsg
