as in the leader ask the grp pump in money cuz its gonna rise,btohqsg

sucks tho this ns is gonna cut through my uni life,btohqsg
There aren’t many vocations available for E boys,btohqsg
At least it’s just uni life,btohqsg
So you’re free after your 2 years,btohqsg
All the available vocations are just clerks under different names,btohqsg
yeah but still  it kinda interrupts ur study path esp when syllabus is constantly changing,btohqsg
why are u complaining when you don't even need to wear a helmet,btohqsg
cuz i care about my academic performances?,btohqsg
academic excellence isnt the only key to success,btohqsg
if everyone thinks like that  sg is fked,btohqsg
or else ppl wont choose the poly route,btohqsg
yep try telling that to my mom,btohqsg
ah i see the parental pressure  understandable,btohqsg
Implying you can’t achieve academic excellence in poly,btohqsg
quite some ppl choose poly as a diploma allows them to start work upon graduation,btohqsg
Guess 4.0 GPA isn’t academic excellence,btohqsg
u sound like poly ppl arent very keen in academic performances,btohqsg
doesnt necessarily mean its not academically rigorous,btohqsg
but at the end of the day  a considerable amt of ppl choose poly because it allows them to work in a related field of study upon graduation,btohqsg
@binsonnnnjust googled  apparently the film is more about hedonism drugs and hookers than the financial market  exactly what im tryna avoid,btohqsg
as much as it is a classic i probably wont watch it,btohqsg
and how do u graduate to work in your desired field?,btohqsg
u have an easier life than many others for NS alr,btohqsg
im just saying it cuts thru my uni which sucks and most ppl in my classes do agree they prefer having a more vigorous ns life to having their uni lives disturbed,btohqsg
