It sucks even more seeing it being btr after i left (in terms of how the school leaders treat the people),btohqsg
Imagine pam yoong removed the subject awards during my j2 yr and then it marks its return the following yr,btohqsg
Imagine she making it big â€˜the first batch to have gotten the trio (gold  silver  bronze)â€™ during college day 2021  my batch got none of the â€˜joy and honourâ€™,btohqsg
She didnt even reveal my batchâ€™s a level stats  pa system for 10s (and i alr know it prior through a jnr),btohqsg
But to be fair  TM was the worst merger (i heard that the teachers were hving conflict themselves???),btohqsg

Told u Mother is innocentHaters Evils Black Hearted U Curse Haters is OK but not ðŸš«right 2 Curse their Mother,btohqsg
Actually it did in my yr but ofc i was not part of the pull down,btohqsg
But actually what i mean by worst is not the grade,btohqsg
Like more of how the merger turned out,btohqsg

Tbh i would advice against choosing yi base on location. My friend REGRETTED it (coz the 2 closes to her place was asr and yi but she didnt get asr),btohqsg

Tbh i would hv chosen non-merger if i could lol,btohqsg
