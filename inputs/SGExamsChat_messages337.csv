Tbh I felt like sleeping thru alot,btohqsg
It's abt oil and sustainability or smth,btohqsg
Maybe I'll join mun again in jc,btohqsg

Sounds good next month pay i buy,btohqsg
you could repartition your main drive to fit ubuntu inside,btohqsg
if your drive has enough space no need for an extra one,btohqsg
Its got enough space for now but ill be needin the space soon,btohqsg
while each os has their own partition  you could also do a shared partition between linux and windows as a common space to put your files in  to maximise space,btohqsg
even scarier  so the easiest method is still a new drive😅,btohqsg
I did the external drive thing with my laptop  when the hard drive got shaken a bit/the USB loosened everything went haywire so I stuck with the internal drive,btohqsg

Unless the age can be changed.,btohqsg
Anyone here knows anybody that can review resumes?,btohqsg
I know one  but I don't know how much he charges.,btohqsg
if you are thinking of professional one,btohqsg
if basic one  I don't mind doing for free to look through quick,btohqsg
Usually help my own students to quickly look through. Mainly to spot potential errors only  that's about it.,btohqsg
Can I ask you for it,btohqsg
Sure can I send you tonight,btohqsg
Sure  you can pm me the resume.I will see it as soon as time permits.But have to bear in mind  I'm really not a professional at it. It's really more of just to ensure all the basics are covered  and whether I feel weird reading it  which is what you don't want potential employers to feel.,btohqsg
If you want a professional resume review  can PM me too.,btohqsg
is it up to 3 choices of any sch for eae ?,btohqsg
hey! js wanted to ask if reserving seats on nlb are reinforced or something,btohqsg
I WAS THE ONE WHO DID THE CHOPE,btohqsg

The Chope culture at NLB is back?,btohqsg
My smurf one then yuumi all day,btohqsg
Maybe cuz too many people returning back.,btohqsg
No more fighting for plug seats,btohqsg
I see most libraries have that except the Orchard one.,btohqsg
So with this system   you can’t walk-in and sit at a space anymore I guess.,btohqsg
I buy too much anime merch on Tele LOL,btohqsg
last time i bought something on tele  they last-seened me after i paid,btohqsg
Actually libraries should switch to having USB C plugs since increasing number of laptops use that now.,btohqsg
I wish got charging ports everywhr then no need fight LOL,btohqsg
But.. It will be very expensive to rewire extra points.,btohqsg
Or you can buy those powerbanks that let you charge laptop. Settle alr.,btohqsg
Cries is weird lenovo charging port,btohqsg
Ok la tbf I usu use to charge phone 💀💀,btohqsg
But given that I think most ppl aren't pricks,btohqsg
I've even seen people go and book other ppl seat straight,btohqsg
No seats u just book their one,btohqsg
And tell them u got priority,btohqsg
Just build your own wfh setup if you have the opportunity to.,btohqsg
The chair you use at home will be better than what the library uses.,btohqsg
This one is a good idea also,btohqsg
Ive been looking for the comfortable chair like the ones at LAN,btohqsg
But cant find any at afforable price,btohqsg
":"") thank you brothis makes me feel better",btohqsg
Unless you act that daring then u can push their stuff away,btohqsg
Id prefrebly want a ergotron mobile desk but thats even more expensive,btohqsg
But most nlbs have a decent no of seats,btohqsg
the thing is rightwith a table too short for a tall chairor my tall table with no back supportor the table too far from the plugs... 😭but dw  i still study at home as much as i can focus,btohqsg
ntywho knows which angry sgean i may invoke the wraths of,btohqsg
I describe the experience of even trying to seat in between 2 people already decently daring,btohqsg
That ‘s why there ‘s sit-standing desk but not everyone will make full use of it.,btohqsg
hi guys  do yall know when is the last day of the woodlands pasar malam,btohqsg
The bigger problem is that woodlands has a pasar malam,btohqsg
At woodlands u might as well go JB alr,btohqsg
They can plant a pasar malam in literally anywhere less secluded,btohqsg
I have yet to visit a Pasar Malam even since those resumed.,btohqsg
it's wild -a person who hasn't visited in 10+ years,btohqsg
yeah i felt their eyes shifting to glimpse at megood god,btohqsg
Nvm once you go there more you will master the act of NOT looking at anyone,btohqsg
you just act like no one exists and sit down,btohqsg
sir i am recovering from social anxiety,btohqsg
BUT WILL I TRY SO? YES,btohqsg
Not in library tho. A lot of places got sell.,btohqsg
U are forced to do it,btohqsg

i had to peptalk myself into switching locations earlier tdybc my laptop died,btohqsg
Huh nlbs alm all got the switch leh,btohqsg
Ok but almost every seat got plug,btohqsg
You never heard of such desks?,btohqsg
maybe i have but looked away once the price presented itself to me,btohqsg
Ohh. Those are heavily marketed by influencers hence the high price tag. But there are ‘cheaper versions’ of it.,btohqsg
what do you think is a good price,btohqsg
Depends on how much you would like to set aside.,btohqsg
at less as i canafter all i am your local broke student,btohqsg
hey that'snot too..bad?...a week' worth if i did the math right,btohqsg
Yup. It ‘s not bad. But flash sales only.,btohqsg

hi  not sure if it's been asked before but i wonder what happens if we were to write more than 600 and/or 1000 characters for the eae write upstried skimming google searches in case i could find a shorter/easier answer but to no avail (as of now anyway bc it's almost 6am lmao)would appreciate it if someone could answer me  thank you!,btohqsg
eae website doesnt allow more than 600 characters,btohqsg
so even if u copied and pasted a write up with more than 600 characters it would just filter out the excess,btohqsg
omg i thought i finished all my hw then i js find out i got a shit ton of fce hw 💀💀💀,btohqsg
OUH GOD fce as in food and consumer education...?,btohqsg
Man glad I don't take fce now,btohqsg

Waiting for Usain Bolt to be Usaina Boltina or something,btohqsg
Later someone call u transphobic or bigot,btohqsg
its unfair but its not wrong. u sound like u r promoting gender inequality tbh,btohqsg
I'm PES F. They gave me bacuse I'm high functioning autism.They didn't care that I was gay or clinically depressed. They looked at my diagonsis of autism and said I'm either Pes E or F. If I could produce evidence of work ethic (Internship no problem)  then I'll be pes E.But they gave me F after discussing with parents and 6 months deferment.,btohqsg
Oof hard to say. Honestly I don't really have one?I'm very grateful to have supportive friends who've done everything they can to help and be there. I can just be myself around them. Raw and unfiltered. It's amazing.,btohqsg
And people seem annoyed by it,btohqsg
Find people who don't care/mind/accepts you.People who get annoyed are the people who self-filter out of your life.,btohqsg
People tend to judge rather than clarify nowadays...,btohqsg
Yes  it's a trending video indeed.,btohqsg
am i thenonly one with whatsapp web connectivity issues,btohqsg
hi! qns regarding eae: wld it be okay to write about achievements in pri sch?is preparing the portfolio important before submitting write-up?is it possible to write 1000-char or 600-char in point form?,btohqsg
Can you write in point form,btohqsg
i can't rmb the eae process on the website but is it compulsory to submit portfolio asap,btohqsg
oh man.....idh any official certs from sec sch aside from cca achievements 😭,btohqsg
You can write in point form* sorry I slight drunk rn AHAH,btohqsg
Portfolio only needed when u go for interview -,btohqsg
Just put all your certs you have :),btohqsg
Idt portfolio is compulsory  thing is most people have some form of portfolio so have to fight the competition,btohqsg
It depends on the school... If you're selected for the interview  they'll give an email what to prepare... So if the email do not state anything about portfolio then u don't need it.,btohqsg
hi guys! for the testimonial to put in for the EAE portfolio given by the teacher(s) right  is there like a specific template for them to fllw and write?,btohqsg
hi everybody  i went into my current diploma course through eae last year… (went through all the stages: writeup  aptitude  interview) for anyone needing help for their eae writeup and needs a template etc etc. you can ask any questions.,btohqsg
so for testimonials  my teacher just wrote for me and just talked about the qualities in which i possess. however  alot of my teachers also told me how that testimonials dont buy leverage for EAE applicants :(,btohqsg
Hmm my teacher didn't ask for template leh,btohqsg
It's a recommendation letter  quite common lah,btohqsg
yes  testimonials aren't that important from what ive heard by the year 1s this year  but it still doesn't hurt to have ah,btohqsg
Tip for EAE and any of such applications in general  just remember that there are 1000 other people just like you trying to get in. You just need to find the ammo/stuff that will help you stand out. Testimonials help a bit  but you realize anyone can write a testimonial too. Portfolio helps  but if all you have are certs  many people have that too.,btohqsg
hi for the EAE process whats the time frame that I can get offers from the different polys?,btohqsg
It depends on the value the testimonial brings to the student.Every student these days will have a teacher’s testimonial  but how many would have an industry leader’s testimonial?,btohqsg
Like what they said  what do you have that makes you stand out?,btohqsg
Anyone here has EAE to business course successfully before can PM :),btohqsg
Hello! I’ve EAE’ed into NP’s Business Studies :),btohqsg
I happened read somewhere EAE only would call for 1 interview even I put 3 choices,btohqsg
So  unlikely to be call for interview from 3 Diploma courses?,btohqsg
Hi any pure geog students here? what sort of essay qns will they give for food resources up to G2,btohqsg
It depends how well ur write up is,btohqsg
you can get called up for all 3 interviews,btohqsg
hi! for testimonials for eae  must they be written by a teacher?i'm currently applying as a private candidate (if i'm not wrong  that's possible  right?) and i'm not in contact with my teachers,btohqsg
And testimonials all only show during interview & not important during your write up,btohqsg
Is dengue still part of alevel h2 bio syllabus? Just want to double confirm  my friend said no longer in syllabus.,btohqsg
Not necessarily! It can be by a relevant professional in the industry too! Perhaps your outside CCA coach. Member of the management from the place you frequently volunteer at _etc_,btohqsg
It shldnt be anymore. For viruses  you only need to know HIV and Influenza,btohqsg
It can still be technically tested as an application question,btohqsg
hi guys!! does anyone know any nice studying sports in changi airport,btohqsg
i think there’s starbucks there if im not wrong!,btohqsg
Wow hope hv chance call up for 3 interviews,btohqsg
thank you!unfortunately i still don't think i'm able to ask for a testimonial from anyone of that sort 🥹,btohqsg
take a gap year to build portfolio?,btohqsg
"hais can't afford to waste time already :""""]took o's last year so there's the past testimonials i have (if i can find them)",btohqsg
i think i had one from my cca teacher  eng teacher and form (?),btohqsg
aren't those considered testimonials from teachers,btohqsg
even if they're from last yr  it's okay?,btohqsg
i used my sec 4 graduating testimonials for my uni applications lmao,btohqsg
:O NICE HAHAHA thank you!now i'm just gonna pray i can find all of them...,btohqsg
if u can't find u can always try contacting the school  they might have a copy in their records,btohqsg
i can try i guessbut i doubt so since i asked them through whatsapp (which.. their chats are lost in the sea of unread  unsaved numbers  etc),btohqsg
u asked the sch thru whatsapp?,btohqsg
but i think i can still find them :D,btohqsg
Long time ago but my seniors asked our compooping teacher for testimonial coz they were entering game design,btohqsg
For me even easier coz my chem teacher and form teacher is the same person,btohqsg
Became a 2 in 1 testimonial lmao,btohqsg
Helloois it advisable to pursue for an internship during dec holidays for j1 students?i feel like applying for one but i dont know if i would even be able to get one of have enough time to do so,btohqsg
I heard a lot of people say to use the time study instead of doing internship or finding a job,btohqsg
It depends on what type of internship also bah and the commitment,btohqsg
And the capability of the individual to multitask  how is their promos,btohqsg
While results are impt  an internship helps you to stand out in the long term.,btohqsg
Just work and study at the same time. Its not gon be easy  but everyone would be doing it if its easy.,btohqsg
hii  is it okay to apply for multiple domains for jc-dsa or will they accept only one submission?,btohqsg
