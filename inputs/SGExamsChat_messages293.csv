natural numbers are basically positive integers,btohqsg
Natural number: 1  2  3  ... Whole number = 0  1 2 3 4  Integers -     ... -2 -1 0 1 2 3. Rational numbers = can be in the form of a/b  real numbers - any number that can be placed on number line,btohqsg
I thing changed after this or smt,btohqsg
tb change oni change the character inside,btohqsg
so for example  pi is not a rational number  but its a real number.,btohqsg
From xiao bai to alan ah,btohqsg
Guys rmb prime numbers n composite numbers ah,btohqsg
Eh guys they ask for irrational numbers ah,btohqsg
oh ya  composite is basically non-prime,btohqsg
If they say irrational number bigger than what,btohqsg
Like irrational number between 5 and 6,btohqsg
Prime numbers only consist one factor and itself,btohqsg
at least we all know 3.142,btohqsg
yeap  thats why 1 isnt a prime number. its factor is 1 (which is alr itself),btohqsg
Tho we dont know 1k numbers,btohqsg
Isn't pi stated at front page of paper,btohqsg
and also know the recurring number notation  for eg. ⅓  u can say as 0.3 with a dot over a 3.,btohqsg
Nahhhh we dun do that here,btohqsg
Hasnt come out since forever anyways,btohqsg
as in it's a known mathematical notation luh LOL,btohqsg
why you shouldn't just ignore it is,btohqsg
know like  when they ask for the rearrange in ascending order or whatever then they use this  u shld know what it means,btohqsg
Guys I wanna ask for recurring deciminds if its 0.202 and there's a dot at 2 n 2,btohqsg
0.30 with a dot over the 3 and another dot over the 0,btohqsg
With the dot on top of 3.,btohqsg
This is the first time I have felt confident fr a maths paper bef,btohqsg
Math was ok for me hahaha,btohqsg
But some ppl still find it hard,btohqsg
Just wait for it. By 6pm sure already got some tuition centre got question paper and post their suggested answers,btohqsg
will moderation go up or down?,btohqsg
honestly i got caught off guard by the damn stats qn,btohqsg
cry idt i even did it right,btohqsg
i think i can jz cry and say bye,btohqsg
paper 2 is gonna be worse than thid,btohqsg
haven't end all exams yet  dn lose hope 🥲🥲🥲,btohqsg
I completely dissociate n space out n miss like the last 3 questions,btohqsg
Which idk 20  30 marks?? Or am I overestimating isdjcnx,btohqsg
issokay i nvr do some parts too,btohqsg
I think most impt is to not dwell abt ittt!! Over alreadyy work on the next paper!!,btohqsg
Tru... hard to focus tho Ik I couldve done better,btohqsg
where can get the emath paper,btohqsg
Buttt like we can’t edit the paperr,btohqsg
I'm making a vocab list tonight  any of y'all want?,btohqsg
I think they’ll pass to teachers a soft copy or smtg,btohqsg
Aight I'll send y'all  when im done,btohqsg
do y’all have English papers pdf?,btohqsg
Y’all know which sch and year this is from 😭,btohqsg
I won't be done until like... tonight so until then the Marriem Webster Word Of The Day list is really good honestly,btohqsg
Ok I most likely got 55%  good enuf for me :'),btohqsg
almost put first question answer as 12000 💀💀💀,btohqsg
Common sense nearly leave me ♡,btohqsg
Tackling Paper 1 Editing_Student Copy .pdf,btohqsg
anyone else editing is quite strong? i normally get 7-10 marks for practices,btohqsg
hi to all those taking o’s yea atb & jy ! pls rmb to take care of urselves oso,btohqsg
My editing is shit HAHA but o lvl editing still can make it,btohqsg
Ok idk if its just me but when I read theediting passage out loud it's easier to spot mistakes,btohqsg
I mean mentally not out loud,btohqsg
it's hit or miss for me but if u find out  lmk too!!,btohqsg
Guess I'll just send it to the grp,btohqsg
Moment I get home promise I'll work on it,btohqsg
Guys if I get a B3 for math p1,btohqsg
How much more to A1 for p2,btohqsg
Isn't the emath curve super high,btohqsg
Uhm  can u D7 at least?,btohqsg
I give u gun  may u do the honor of eliminating an opponent(me) HAHA jokes,btohqsg
theres no such thing as bell curve,btohqsg
Yes my p1 I just checked shud be around 49-51,btohqsg
U could tell that to the no. of students gettig 80+ in past years to get A2-B3,btohqsg
if like too many people do well   then like for example a1 can be higher to become 81%,btohqsg
could be 90+ as well lmfao,btohqsg
if too many ppl do terrible then like a1 can become like 70%,btohqsg
That is technically bellcurve  in another format,btohqsg
The minimum cut off score to get each grade is more or less determined,btohqsg
Just that it changes a bit every yr for A1/A2,btohqsg
B3 and below usually dont change much,btohqsg
It is possible to make a comeback for paper 2,btohqsg
Any seniors who did crap for paaper 1   but manage to comeback for p2?,btohqsg
What type of passing is not 50% omg,btohqsg
Im quite sure overall % to get C6 for english is lower than 50%,btohqsg
My friend did 2 yrs ago when I was 16  lost contact but she manage to pass math overall after failing P1,btohqsg
But whether 50% on the dot or lower depends on subject,btohqsg
My math Cher said before it’s possible,btohqsg
Ye u need to compensate ur mistakes in p1,btohqsg
So if i manage to pass one paper i could still fail overall,btohqsg
Ofc but if you do well in one  you'll most likely be fine in the other.,btohqsg
Emath A1 is almost close to 90% overallA2 probably 80% overall and above,btohqsg
How do I calculate my grade btw  45/80,btohqsg
U cant u need combine with p2,btohqsg
Both out of 80 so can 50/50,btohqsg
My fren scored 70+% for emath,btohqsg
Who damn suey 97% for alot of people,btohqsg
Whoever tell u 97% is joking,btohqsg
Im sure if u hit 91%,btohqsg
Who 100% u come out now I summon u,btohqsg
Yeah 90+is alr like... god level,btohqsg
No wonder u went to pasir ris jc,btohqsg
He's admin guys he speaks the truth,btohqsg
Depends on year also...2018 was one of the most difficult years for E Math...I got friends claiming they got as low as 80+  still A1,btohqsg
Like practical planning... the examiners have to solve,btohqsg
To be fair  thats a better jc than some of the elite jcs,btohqsg
What's the cut off for pasir ris jc,btohqsg
Ok depends on what u comparin,btohqsg
Acads is mostly student based lmao. Good students lead to good results (most of the time),btohqsg
Simi is pasir ris jc 🥺,btohqsg
Im lookin at difficulty of sch paper as a metric,btohqsg
Then pasir ris jc is best jc alr,btohqsg
Every jc has their own shit depts,btohqsg
Air con canteen is a ++++ reason to go,btohqsg
Boooo thumbs down bring the air con back,btohqsg
Save the environment pls air con canteens and halls are why climate change is worsening,btohqsg
How to sign on when im studying now,btohqsg
No pls the one time my family tried to make our own aircon our bedroom got flooded,btohqsg
Honestly every year without fail there will be quite a lot of such ppl  just that most know that they should keep quiet,btohqsg
How is the paper even doable Much less easy,btohqsg
I rmb my actual p1 i panicked couldnt do half the paper but by the end of p1 i could do almost everything,btohqsg
I got 56% on a paper one and I'm 2 years older than the rest of the candidates  the paper sucked (and I'm bad at math),btohqsg
Eh seniors how do u self care after ur papers HAHA,btohqsg
How much did you get in the endIf you don’t mind sharing with me,btohqsg
Seems cruel to have consecutive papers with no time to chill out,btohqsg
like after the entire exam over?,btohqsg
Like stop being anxious n shit,btohqsg
+ i destress by doing what i enjoy,btohqsg
Cuz like I got EAE and I rly rly dont wanna fuck this up,btohqsg
If you know you will be depressed after looking at answers  from tmr onwards pls don't look at answers anymore  it will only make you more anxious,btohqsg
I have more than 5 instruments to destress my ass,btohqsg
dont look at the answers lol,btohqsg
Thanks guys yall are so nice,btohqsg
i never looked at any answers given by some tuition centre,btohqsg
But this shldnt persist till uni,btohqsg
Ig for geog/bio/lit I shouldnt bc I'm definitely not confident,btohqsg
There are ppl who dont look at their results cos they know they may not do well  or the cohort did too well,btohqsg
its useless  it either boosts ur confidence or breaks ur self esteem + some of the answers may be wrong,btohqsg
She may not be the top student but she's such a miracle worker,btohqsg
Tru  thanks for the advice ♡♡♡♡,btohqsg
Is it true for ur exams this sem LOL,btohqsg
i dont have exams this sem,btohqsg
Oo is the criteria also 26,btohqsg

So if u know ur stuff easy to do well,btohqsg

like how i drew a line for the huan question back in 2018 😳😳😳,btohqsg

i forgot how o level el paper format was like,btohqsg
for essay read up on like decent examples for certain topics,btohqsg
score well for editing and p1 so if u mess up ur compre ur p1 can back u up,btohqsg
plus p2 is where most ppl mess up,btohqsg
does anyone have the empty paper 1,btohqsg
try to get full marks for editing,btohqsg
Just try ur best for emath p2 and dont think too much,btohqsg
Go to the o level grp,btohqsg
But the emath p1 seems doable. I wont say very easy but yes is doable,btohqsg
Sorry is it me or is it extrememly hot these days,btohqsg
And im the bottom in class for math,btohqsg
Yea but this week especially so,btohqsg
More frequent extreme weather events due to climate change,btohqsg
HAHHA but yes it's very hot and humid,btohqsg
Yeah...especially the past few nights  sun haven't rise and it's 28 degrees,btohqsg
One thing i like about O lvl is that  everyone taking the paper cab relate😭😭,btohqsg
I just woke up and i sweated lol,btohqsg
I walked for like 5 mins from bus stop to MOELC and I got a headache,btohqsg
Then after the paper I walked back I got a bigger headache  what is this bs,btohqsg
Really? I feel today it's more cooling alr. First time in probably 1-2 weeks I can stand at the bus stop in the morning without sweating. Anyway next month onwards it's gonna be the wet season so don't have to worry so much alr haha...,btohqsg
Im morning person  wont study at night,btohqsg
Lol if exams in the morning then how?,btohqsg
But a/o levels wont have that,btohqsg
I dun need the previous night lol,btohqsg
Same but bc our air con spoil,btohqsg
Also cuz nervous but... the air con spoil,btohqsg

People...stop asking about grade thresholds lol. We are not seab,btohqsg
U dun need to. Havent do p2 yet,btohqsg
I am not going to get 80 so 75,btohqsg
maybe 90 plus for a1  80 plus for a2,btohqsg
So I can’t do much for now,btohqsg
peers were sayin how easy it was . 😭,btohqsg
This yr paper is rly ok,btohqsg
All cuz of the Huang question,btohqsg
That’s why people say 71/80 isn’t good-,btohqsg
Why isnt it good if theres no bell curve,btohqsg
At least no need study much ig haha,btohqsg
Can just relax and panic over smth other than math,btohqsg
Juz paper 2... and that's on the 21st,btohqsg
Not only because of that...there were a lot of 4m qns and some unusual qns in paper 1 also,btohqsg
Yikes how did y'all cope with that?,btohqsg
Anyone have a list of examples for essays,btohqsg
I have to be honest compared to 2017  this year paper is relatively harder for maths :/,btohqsg
Likeee uk ermm Steve jobs all tt,btohqsg
Argumentative and narrative are my best but narrative I tend to have a boring tedious plot,btohqsg
Do u intend to go poly/jc?,btohqsg
Descriptive sucks bc writing in 1st person is so awk to me,btohqsg
I nearly felt emotional after completing the continuous writing 🤣,btohqsg
Let your hand go on autopilot,btohqsg
Emotional is one... whether the examiner also cry along with you is another HAHAHA,btohqsg
Honestly for me weirdly I did continuous first followed by situational.,btohqsg
Wait u in my class ?,btohqsg
I had a dream last night where I skipped the continuous and sit writing by accident,btohqsg

i just got back my results and was wondering if anyone knows for DAE whether they will minus CCA points for you? or just take raw scores,btohqsg
also for cop can just refer to scores on site right,btohqsg
HiIf I remember correctly  you don't have to think about CCA points or raw score all that (if you're planning to apply DAE at RP)During my time  I couldn't apply both EAE and JAE as I failed my O level English. DAE was my last resort. I applied DAE at RP  which required me to choose up to 3 courses.After that  I went to all the interviews for all courses that I chose at once  where one of the interviews required me to do a mini test. I passed the interview (the one with the test) and able to get into the course,btohqsg
That's for RPI'm not really sure about other polytechnics,btohqsg
