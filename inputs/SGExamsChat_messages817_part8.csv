Back then I conduct my job search,btohqsg
Then Japan is the first and the only one who gives me the job offer,btohqsg
Me wanna go exchange in jp,btohqsg
But first need settle a lvl,btohqsg
I feel that Japan's job offer is probably the best one,btohqsg
They pay might not be as good as the one in Singapore,btohqsg
But the experience is very good,btohqsg
I probably won't be getting a very fruitful experience if I work in Singapore,btohqsg
Is it like you got a job offer from a company based in Singapore/that company has a branch here,btohqsg
Bruh my ADHD ass cannot be punctual,btohqsg
Your job is sth related to retail right,btohqsg
There is actually no branch in Singapore,btohqsg
I legit cannot work in japan,btohqsg
The Japanese company is in Japan,btohqsg
at some point i have to pick between passion vs literally every other pro possible ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Bro how much do they emphasize on punctuality there,btohqsg
So I started with IT outsourcing,btohqsg
I recall you mentioned something about supermarkets?,btohqsg
Outsourced to Hitachi Solutions doing image processing,btohqsg
Then outsourced and finally converted when I am in Japan Weather Association,btohqsg
Actually my job is in demand forecasting,btohqsg
And the companies that I am dealing with are like supermarkets and restaurants,btohqsg
From outsourced staff to contract satff,btohqsg
I'm not converting to full time because the benefits are worse and I am potentially leaving SG soon,btohqsg
So... You part time or sth?,btohqsg
Actually my job now is more of dealing with supply chain,btohqsg
So in Japan there are different job contracts,btohqsg
You have haken which is the outsourced staff,btohqsg
Mine is a keiyaku which means contract staff (1 year renewable),btohqsg
Then you have the ultimate of the ultimate which is permanent staff,btohqsg
Things like inventory management  replenishment with the aid of weather data,btohqsg
Its pretty rare to do such stuff in Singapore ngl,btohqsg
Considering supply chain is actually a sunset industry in SG now sadly,btohqsg
Well it is what it is,btohqsg
But I generally discourage females to work in Japan because you probably won't get good benefits in terms of the pay compared to the male counterparts,btohqsg
Again it depends on the company,btohqsg
But Japanese payscale usually follow the traditional payscale,btohqsg
So by age and then by gender,btohqsg
So you have done 3 different jobs in Japan so far?,btohqsg
Heavy Thundery Showers With Gusty Wind,btohqsg
I go to sleep and wake up Mayushii is still there,btohqsg
I went off for so long  still see Mayushii and E120,btohqsg
I actually woke up at like 7am Japan timing,btohqsg
And then go back to sleep,btohqsg
Like prolly polo + jeans / pants for guys,btohqsg
When i was in jpn  i woke up at ard 6.30am almost every day,btohqsg
I cannot go back to sleep after getting out of bed:-(,btohqsg
Just wore black and grey long pants and t shirt,btohqsg
