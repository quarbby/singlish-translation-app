Hi all   I’m interested in the 1% cashback giro for credit card payment from HSBC EGA . I have read all the TnCs. Just want to confirm this is what I need to do in order to qualify for it .1)Deposit 2k into EGA at the start of the month .2) do 5 transfer outwards transactions.3) wait for the giro to deduct .I will need to fulfil point 1 and point 2 before the giro is due . Is this correct ? Thanks in advance 🙏,btohqsg
Yes. Best to set recurring transfer in and out of HSBC ega.,btohqsg
Poem has a 5.9% guarantee deposit promotion but only first 1000 customers....how to check still have ah?,btohqsg

Hmm…. I don’t think the 1% cashback giro is for credit card payment from EGA acc.,btohqsg
