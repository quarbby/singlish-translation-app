yea my school also keep saying 4h2 is not needed for scholarships or overseas uni,btohqsg
idont think moe jcs allow h1 => h2,btohqsg
but the perk is that with 4H2  the worst auto beocmes H1but 3H2 1H1 later your worst sub is the H2 then more damage,btohqsg
still considering if i should take H3 chem  but time will tell,btohqsg
why we talking about this when we all are over that stage,btohqsg
you can only choose h3s if it's good enough,btohqsg
wait then whats the bare min,btohqsg
i mean i can always drop it if i don't feel comf,btohqsg
just need to excel promos lol,btohqsg
i think for scholarships you just need consistent good enough grades and then pass wtv selection stuff they have,btohqsg
eh im more than halfway ok,btohqsg
i forgot to consider that one i was thinking of some other scholarships,btohqsg
my friends told me90rp - some scholarships88.75/87.5 - at least 1 scholarshipif you SCðŸ¤¡ðŸŒš,btohqsg
the hardest thing here is the last statement,btohqsg

3h2 1h1 can alr or need h3s also,btohqsg
you check your uni websites lorr,btohqsg
not that i can make it also,btohqsg
like i thought u can get extra points for rp calc or smth,btohqsg
but the not oxbridge no 4h2 also can,btohqsg
prob just the standard 3h2 and 1h1,btohqsg
depends on which course as well,btohqsg
i think might need because you are competing against sg students also HAHAH,btohqsg
because some are more competitive than others,btohqsg
max is 70rp but they incl ur mtl or ur h1 if it improves,btohqsg
