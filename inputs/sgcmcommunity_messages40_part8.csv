Signal lights costs more for bmw,btohqsg
That’s why alot of people don’t take that option,btohqsg
I would have installed Pain Protection Film for new car😅,btohqsg
you are trying to tell me bmw copied VW beetle styling,btohqsg
315 dont even remotely look like a beetle lol,btohqsg
I kena a deep scratch by an auntie driving 2007 Altis. She parked on the white line.All I can do was 🤦‍♂🤷‍♂No point argue. They have 5 auntie.5 mouth Vs 1 mouth. I'm not gonna win😂In AMK AVE 10 market... Later other auntie also join in 😂 young men bully auntie😂,btohqsg
PPF whole car ah sir? but but... after 1-2 years in our climate  the glue turns .. yellow leh.. then how?,btohqsg
this. you're a smart man. it is a losing fight.. imagine the visuals.,btohqsg
Find a good film lo.Anyway even if sell. The new driver won't know there PPF unless he's a car enthusiasts 😅,btohqsg
😭😭😭 you can never win an argument with aunties,btohqsg
Even worse if they bring their whole crew 🤣,btohqsg
you should have tried. they might compensate you seeing handsome dude,btohqsg
PPF vs ceramic coating  which one is more feasible?>,btohqsg
polestar 5 max they bring in srsm for 350k,btohqsg
who wanna pay 10k road tax,btohqsg
This auntie like ah ma. They Don't eat fresh meat 😂My face also black.unless  I can pull off a white flesh meat  accent 🤣,btohqsg
later so handsome they offer to pay in kind how. jitao run.,btohqsg
PPF obviously better protection but ppf have lousy ones. PPF tend to yellow too after exposure to elements. Both need maintenance as ceramic coating also need to reapply. PPF tend to darken if not reduce the colour gloss on the paint same with cheap ceramic coating.,btohqsg
hmm  like easier to maintain for simple washing and etc.. like alot worries on ppf of the glue..,btohqsg
If you drive in tuas or any industrial area wear rocks are plentiful  get PPF,btohqsg
I'm had Graphene Coating. My take was I was the car look shinny.For deep scratch  I will just go Ong Kian Seng there touch up 50-80 dollars / per spot.PPF $2000+. If new car. I will put.,btohqsg
Both need to wash haha  but ceramic coating is cheaper to maintain ah.Obviously u sacrifice the solid layer of protection lor,btohqsg
Im very an@l about my paint and all but im not willing to spend my money on a ppf thats is gonna yellow in 2yrs so i just ceramic coat and reapply when it wears out lor (usually 9-12months),btohqsg
That the CON. During removal  can peel off the original paint.You know painting whole car also around $2000PPF$ 2 000I seen new  Lamborghini put PPF. Because their new paint cost.more than 2000 I believe,btohqsg
Ppf is like wrapping but in a clear coat..,btohqsg
Compare the cost of new paint versus PPF lo,btohqsg
vs ceramic more like chemical barrier,btohqsg
if she shows you her beautiful daughter you will say otherwise!,btohqsg
Yes I know.1)The disadvantages of PPF is the film can peel off your original paint. Repainting whole car around the same price of PPF.2)The film can turn yellow3) remove PPF can leave slots of glue stains.,btohqsg
No la. I married already. Give my birth date? After life can look for my soul😂 pre -arrangedNext life la. 😂,btohqsg
downtime for installation is about same as a full car paint job too..,btohqsg
