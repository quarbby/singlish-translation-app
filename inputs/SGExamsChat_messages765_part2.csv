In Acjc for 2021 a levels the top person for h2 geog prelims got C for a level,btohqsg
Idk man  he normally quite good for geog internals eh,btohqsg
Cap i saw yall holding hands,btohqsg
Of course! I respect anyone from tmjc,btohqsg
Ik someone dropped from A to E?,btohqsg
SOMEHOW GET A EVEN THO IM IN HER TUTORIAL CLASS,btohqsg
Thought that was the only year it happened,btohqsg
he told me his cousin who was top in AC geog dropped from A to E,btohqsg
I think the year right before,btohqsg
also respect the ending at 4+ everyday,btohqsg
fml this is the most dog shit UI i have ever seen,btohqsg
how was ur gp timed trial,btohqsg
Im procrastinating my essay writing for my friend,btohqsg
i wrote the one about music has no purpose other than entertainment,btohqsg
I think JJC 2016 Qn 6,btohqsg
Hmm is the cousin a he or she,btohqsg
I rmbr the A to C person is a she,btohqsg
Could very well be the same person,btohqsg
Ik its not 2021 because his cousin is older than him,btohqsg
I thought my class rojak alrd,btohqsg
only 3 combis cuz ej doesnt offer jackshit,btohqsg
My class got 6? Combis iirc,btohqsg
but ngl all the BCMg ppl are ok but some of the BCMe people are ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤® yet my closest friends in the class are BCMethen again most of the class takes BCMe so not surprising,btohqsg
The girl who top H1 geog for my batch,btohqsg
In my class everyone took geog and econsGELmGEMhGEM h1 cseGEMpGEMcGEMb,btohqsg
In fact Acjc used to offer ONLY h1 cse without h2 cse,btohqsg
theres no h1 csc i think,btohqsg
They started h2 cse for class of 2024,btohqsg
Hey she's having fun I suppose,btohqsg
i thought h2 csc used to have the research paper but they scrapped it alr,btohqsg
I only heard they change syllabus but still there,btohqsg
Val u need more P&C practice?,btohqsg
Oh maybe since I canâ€™t find the subject code in the new a level timetable,btohqsg
also maybe thatâ€™s why Acjc started to offer h2 cse,btohqsg
cuz i heard their chinese department is like quite jialat,btohqsg
PLS don't cancel me but ..,btohqsg
Seems to be  itâ€™s not inside the a level timetable this year,btohqsg
Itâ€™s jialat but it has nothing to do with h2 cse what,btohqsg
:( sad but then again back when I did it I was the only candidate lmao,btohqsg
In fact one of the cse teachers is a Malay guy,btohqsg
oh i thought csc change to cse,btohqsg
Wait what  maybe Acjc didnâ€™t offer h1 cse then,btohqsg
But csc not offered at acjc,btohqsg
It was like on the way to get phased out,btohqsg
Cse is taught in English what,btohqsg
i think a sch offers either but not both,btohqsg
like dhs only offers csc but not cse for obvious reasons,btohqsg
I guess so  idk of any schs that offers both,btohqsg
Class of 2023 still had h1 cse in Acjc,btohqsg
Wait orpheus you took history econ cse and math ?,btohqsg
