The wrapping up in blanket sounds comfy though,btohqsg
It's pretty good if you have a huge blanket,btohqsg
It shouldn't be taboo to bring a blanket instead of a jacket into libraries,btohqsg
does anyone that have or knows where to get free prelim papers except sgfreepapers,btohqsg
I would if my blanket wasnâ€™t vast enough to hit the floor,btohqsg
Doesn't that actually mean he's too short,btohqsg
Who here is paranoid about Chinese ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I can't stop thinking about Chinese,btohqsg
Do u all have server in discord discussing  sharing files  audio chatting over chemistry?,btohqsg
We could look at ways chemistry and technology combine to attract investments too?  Haha,btohqsg
I going abit ding dong. Haha. Forwarding my own messages,btohqsg
So this is the power of affirmative action,btohqsg
You can hardly find any white people in the pic  even though white people are the majority in the US,btohqsg
And also no women for some reason,btohqsg
Asking a question in japanese is just putting desu ka at the end of your sentence,btohqsg
Something tells me the whole sentence is not Japanese,btohqsg
Like a ripoff? Are they scammers,btohqsg
how to set default browser to open document,btohqsg
Are you on a mac or windows,btohqsg
I only know how to do it on mac,btohqsg
Settings > Default apps > Web browser,btohqsg
What is the point of creation?Lord Allah whyðŸŒ±ðŸŒ»,btohqsg
What's the point of life to you,btohqsg
anyone kind enough to try out my bot,btohqsg
I think there are still a few bugs,btohqsg
okay i see you tried searching for fx,btohqsg
I'm not sure how investments are supposed to work,btohqsg
But it just loads indefinitely lol,btohqsg
oh thats because no support for fx yet,btohqsg
like AAPL  GOOG  AMZN that kinda stuff,btohqsg
i will definitely look into fx,btohqsg
and looks like my api limit is maxed out,btohqsg
"ank you for using Alpha Vantage! Our standard API call frequency is 5 calls per minute and 500 calls per day. Please visithttps://www.alphavantage.co/premium/if you would like to target a higher API call frequency.""",btohqsg
guess this api isnt the best for much use,btohqsg
but thanks for testing at least i know the db works,btohqsg
yeah its a python graph HAHA,btohqsg
but its reliant on the api which has a 5 calls/min limit...,btohqsg
As long as no one spams it should be alright,btohqsg
not sure its worth paying for more apis,btohqsg
Like from the time I click to when I get the graph,btohqsg
Yeah but not sure if there's anything you can do about that,btohqsg
cause it passes through a few commands like retrieving data and plotting the graph etc. etc.,btohqsg
but definitely something i can look at to streamline,btohqsg
Erm also there's no way to see the stocks which I have saved?,btohqsg
its giving a lot of errors,btohqsg
cause i dont really have fx included yet,btohqsg
thanks haha i realised my code to prevent duplication didnt work somehow even though it was fine in local,btohqsg
Right okay it works I guess,btohqsg
yeah but when you added jpy it stopped the favourites function,btohqsg
Just need to make sure people don't input a stock that is not implemented I guess,btohqsg
