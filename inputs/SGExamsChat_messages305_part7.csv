(Publicizing this on behalf of a User here)As part of my schoolâ€™s project work  my group and I made a video game about climate change and food security.The game is based in the future where you  as the leader of Singapore  have to take measures to protect Singapore. Disasters (including floods  heat waves  mass insect extinctions  and much more) will ravage your country. The disasters have been gamified/exaggerated to make the game interesting but research has been done to make the game educational as well. Lots of non-related stuff has been added to make the game relatable (we hope).We would really appreciate it if you could play our game. It works best on PC but does work on some phones as well. If you enjoyed it  could you please share it with your friends?PC:https://disasterinc.itch.io/disasters-inc(If it doesnâ€™t load  you can use the link below)Mobile + some PCs:https://simmer.io/@Disasterinc/disasters-inc(Ads are not our own and we don't get a single cent so don't worry :D),btohqsg
