To be exact is not rly serving NS cuz like I get to do uni while serving it,btohqsg
Which actually allows me to gain 2 more years of work experience,btohqsg
Ive a fren that enlisted willingly also  she says not gonna do that shit,btohqsg
Work experience? What does comp sci have to do with army?,btohqsg
Your future prospects outside NS with CS is better than signing on,btohqsg
If you can get into cybernsf  then sure,btohqsg
but honestly just do mdes scheme,btohqsg
But if regular one dont even do it,btohqsg

Iâ€™m beginning to second guess myself now,btohqsg
seeing as JAE results are out in 10hours,btohqsg
hello has anyone gotten the jae msg,btohqsg
im half asleep and fully done with this bs but its been 6 minutes,btohqsg
I thought it was supposed to be 9am then I got woken up by the notif,btohqsg
If u want know now maybe can login to the JAE IS,btohqsg
Ohh thatâ€™s where the 9am comes from,btohqsg
Mine was like 6.01 am so maybe theyâ€™re slowly sending?,btohqsg
Literally got in my 9th choice,btohqsg
do we have to accept or something,btohqsg
Can I choose to appeal my course?,btohqsg
u go into the jae appeal portal,btohqsg
Eg. If the course that I want to go in has a cut of point of 14 and mine is 15  is it possible?,btohqsg
You need to at least meet the COP of this year,btohqsg
Polys have their own appeal system,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s another thing u can try,btohqsg
if this year's COP increase then yes,btohqsg
whatâ€™s it like being in rp,btohqsg
participate in class and do your rj to get free marks,btohqsg
Iâ€™m gna be y2 in dphm,btohqsg
ngl the culture here like q chill and tbh I made my closest frens here HAHAHA,btohqsg
the workload uhhhh questionable la but like that aside rp legit isnâ€™t as bad as a lot of ppl think,btohqsg
it's aircon everywhere in the main buildings,btohqsg
so won't sweat if you walk from class to class or lab or canteen,btohqsg
also u donâ€™t need worry abt like being super late for class bcs campus legit isnâ€™t v big,btohqsg
For poly  MOE website says theyâ€™ll send an enrolment package in end Feb that youâ€™ll need to accept,btohqsg
Do I have to do anything after receiving the SMS?,btohqsg
Or just wait for enrolment package?,btohqsg
to appeal to a JC  what documents do I need?,btohqsg
what the hell is acedamic awards,btohqsg
guys  rp no exam is it?,btohqsg
@gd_alor other rp ppl pls confirm,btohqsg

guys after receiving jae results we just wait for Letter right,btohqsg
then follow instruction on the letter?,btohqsg
No u follow instructions from God,btohqsg
Just pray and uâ€™ll get instructions,btohqsg
It is useless in opening up more uni choices (it opens none)  however it is useful in giving you the chance to pursue an interest in maths  get a small head start in STEM uni courses  and the workload is considerably smaller,btohqsg
The question is  are you capable of handling FMaths,btohqsg
When you say workload  what are you referring to?,btohqsg
Say you take PCM as your H2s,btohqsg
Chem has way way more content than FM does,btohqsg
Oh so FM is more manageable than chem?,btohqsg
Chem has more content  but FM content is harder,btohqsg
To take FMaths or not depends on how much u like maths/how good  u r,btohqsg
When comparing physics to chemistry  does chemistry have more content?,btohqsg
Not that it is light in content,btohqsg
Lol so many of my classmates going to RP,btohqsg
Does it help in getting into uni courses like comp science?,btohqsg
if your results need interview maybe,btohqsg
i heard from seniors h2 comp is just foundational course in uni comp sci .. ? im not sure,btohqsg
I mean for most subjects  your whole A level syllabus is one mod in uni sooo,btohqsg
Got some going to banking and finance,btohqsg
I know that itâ€™s something related to that,btohqsg
why do ppl say rp is a bad school,btohqsg
Compare their coursesâ€™ cutoffs to their counterparts in other Polys,btohqsg
Its natural cos of its past bad reputation,btohqsg
But yes some 26 points courses not 26 anym,btohqsg
They attract really horrific students too,btohqsg
All the losers from my cohort are going to RP,btohqsg
the average ones SP and NYP,btohqsg
the better ones NP and JC,btohqsg
students in sp pharmaceutical and students in rp pharmaceutical is it fair to say they learn the same things,btohqsg
Because my form teacher says that courses with the same name can have varying account between JCs,btohqsg
hey guys. Is anyone here an international applicant to SMU  NUS  NTU and has heard back from any?,btohqsg
sorry Iâ€™m new to telegram and the Reddit group too but the anxiety Iâ€™ve got about school admissions is eating me up inside ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
Not going to lie  if you don't find an answer here  you might want to post on reddit,btohqsg
wait is np considered best poly or sth,btohqsg
ik its the hardest to get in by JAE but,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there's English Oral in jc,btohqsg

Hiii is anyone here doing IB and applying to the US?,btohqsg

30 groups  with 20+ students in each group,btohqsg
i mean that's what the ogl told me hahaha,btohqsg
then the I take is 700 to 800 sia,btohqsg
if ur l1r5 meets the cop of the stream u can always try,btohqsg
but it works half the time if u tryin to jump streams in the same jc,btohqsg
try is try lah but whether will enter it or not is a different story,btohqsg
I even ask my English teacher help me edit lol,btohqsg
hahaha if your l1r5 is good enough there's a chance they might take you in,btohqsg
on the dot 15 nett bruh,btohqsg
maybe there's a possibility that there's space in arts stream?,btohqsg
it does restrict your choice of course in uni though  but it's just the science courses haha,btohqsg
so I just go poly in that case already,btohqsg
but A level is pretty generic  so if you're unsure of what u wanna specialise on in the future  A level will be better hahah,btohqsg
unless of course  you know what u wanna do,btohqsg
I just want to go JC,btohqsg
if you can't get into JC,btohqsg

Hello! Can I ask whatâ€™s the benefit of joining a CCA in polytechnic? Iâ€™m aware that itâ€™s optional. But if someone decided not to join any CCA  will it affect uni admission/ GPA etc?,btohqsg
No impact on your academics  but if you end up having to apply to uni through ABA or applying for scholarships  lack of a CCA is not exactly an attractive thing,btohqsg
Unless you have something else behind the scenes also,btohqsg
Like you secretly run ten volunteer organisations,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s for the tangible effects  I mean,btohqsg
Joining a CCA will let you have more fun in poly also and learn cool things,btohqsg
If u join exco itâ€™s a good chance to learn leadership stuff,btohqsg
Itâ€™s potentially enriching to you as a person  provided you pick a CCA suitable for you,btohqsg
What would you like to know,btohqsg

Shinglee is good for Maths. They are new to Science.,btohqsg
Papers same. Answers depends on who they get to pen out answers. Most answers are too long winded. Must summarise further  for Sciences.,btohqsg
Nice! I brought e and a from shinglee!,btohqsg
The sch doesnt give ans meh? I mean for sci and hum at least,btohqsg

That's what my cher did :/,btohqsg
For all subjects? Likely just a few?,btohqsg

Probably some secondary schools do the same too,btohqsg
Anyone took pure literature in Os,btohqsg

duty of care toward every student,btohqsg
they are not really sensitive to the trans student's needs n situation,btohqsg
haha not just tik tok i believe,btohqsg
Moe could have done better I agree,btohqsg
just the modern culture and all media,btohqsg
Especially the western side   Singapore very controversial about this sia,btohqsg
But like protest in a pandemic no,btohqsg
sg controversial about it meaning.. sg have lots of opinion about the western culture?,btohqsg
who knows it is a real issue that the student is struggling wiht,btohqsg
yes what moe is doing now is like boxing ppl up,btohqsg
Hello I am form de la salle primary near the west,btohqsg
but openness in becmoing more n more liberal is a socio-cultureal trend across the world,btohqsg
but not deter ppl from pursuing what they feel they need if it has already happened,btohqsg
what is the average age here,btohqsg
maybe bcos the gov is not ready for it,btohqsg
they may not be able to handle,btohqsg
and those retiring politicians know v well,btohqsg
that the younger n more open gerenations r going to make their roles obsolete,btohqsg
they r not catching up well,btohqsg
oh i just heard the news,btohqsg
minister vivan balai said that they aim to make sg have the best tracking system or sth like htat,btohqsg
it's a good vision they have there,btohqsg
that sg is trying hard to make a statement in many things,btohqsg
This children feel very patriarchy . Protest relatively in a pandemic  :/,btohqsg
maybe branding n positioning ourselves to the world is the last few strategies the country has in its book alr ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Tbh I both parties are wrong,btohqsg
Moe not allowing trans to school wrong,btohqsg
Damm. So education does not matter,btohqsg
Like that an actual illegal shit to expel someone,btohqsg
Is same sex marriage actually illegal in sg,btohqsg
Our countries not very open minded,btohqsg

True I mean sg low birth rate,btohqsg
like uk how couples apply for hdb that kind  they cnt do that,btohqsg
As in no gov subsidy but any 2 parties still can go ahead n apply  right?,btohqsg
Wasnâ€™t prime minister son in law gay or someone then got,btohqsg

Oh ok.. hmm i tot 2 person can jointly apply..,btohqsg
I know someone form paliment gay,btohqsg
Then the person overseas alr ma!,btohqsg
and they have to wait until 35 above,btohqsg
but im not too clear on this,btohqsg
i think thereâ€™s also a portion on the part where they need written consent on hdb,btohqsg
Oh yes yes. No privilege n grants thats all,btohqsg
Because then the lhy can stay in sg I guess,btohqsg
How about obama? Does obama approve?,btohqsg
btwn the cultrally diff beliefs & views of diff religious and ethnic beliefs,btohqsg
whether he truly approves or disapproves isnt the pt,btohqsg
they only believe that doing this will prevent fights and all,btohqsg
I honestly dunno if my religion approves ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But i would like to think that God does not make one human judge another human,btohqsg
Welp I know we know our does not allow,btohqsg
But if the Bible said so,btohqsg
I hope that the Bible does not said anything,btohqsg
So if a person is born to have sexual orientation complications then how,btohqsg
We are not God we cannot make decisions,btohqsg
But I respect not support them,btohqsg
But I hope that someone can enlighten me that being gay is a sin,btohqsg
I mean God said love your neighbor,btohqsg
Love the sinner hate the sin,btohqsg
Being gay isn't a sin. God loves all of his creation. It can only become a sin when one acts on their sexual urges with another male.,btohqsg
yeah  judging a situation to make decision is fine. judging people isn't okay haha  but it is in our sinful nature to do that. hence  repent.,btohqsg
yeah  don't worry too much about it,btohqsg
Meh Pope Francis is creating a lot of division in the Catholic community due to his liberal attitude,btohqsg
Iâ€™m definitely leaning towards being conservative though,btohqsg
I realized  i embrace both extremes,btohqsg
