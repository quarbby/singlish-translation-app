i can see why the IT guy take his own sweet time le.,btohqsg
well if the IT guy every other time kanna left right up down center by you,btohqsg
you think he will take his own sweet time to settle your issue?,btohqsg
how would he know the exact problem ?,btohqsg
he needs to test and try ma,btohqsg
well if its the same problem  it may mean the previous solution applied may not be suitable. hence he try out other possible solution ma,btohqsg
alternatively... he has so many problems on hand all the time (presumeably)  he wouldnt be able to remember all problems and associated solutions either,btohqsg
Unless it's a very common issue,btohqsg
common but recurring also may indicate current solution is not good,btohqsg
