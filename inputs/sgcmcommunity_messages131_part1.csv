You're not exactly following it by clamping a car that's appropriately parked for a short term sir,btohqsg
Later some itchy people will scratch the car   more heart pain if that happens   who to complain to sia,btohqsg
Best solution  all park inside house,btohqsg
How do you define by short term ?,btohqsg
I'd say anytime during the day hours is reasonable,btohqsg
Since night time is when most estates fill up completely,btohqsg
And parking further away to your house can be annoying at that point,btohqsg
