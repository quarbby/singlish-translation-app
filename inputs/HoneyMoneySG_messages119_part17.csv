I usually put in a bit more than 500 just in case of all these MAB calc hiccups.,btohqsg
Ya I personally kena for this mth for my own acct. Put in zhunzhun but still miscalculated somewhere.,btohqsg
Never zhun zhun... I rather lose 4+% interest on $100 than 1.5% on $100k. Lol,btohqsg
Isn’t scb esaver also no frills and a much safer bank?,btohqsg
Scb also an alternative.  All banks are the same,btohqsg
The second part is definitely not true,btohqsg
MAS has good control over the banks operating in Singapore. I will trust the ones with stronger Singapore ties.SCB latest promo jun - Jul is 3.55%.,btohqsg
Haha. Yeah that’s why banks have credit ratings.,btohqsg
It gets fuzzier now with the digital banks.Are they equal  safer  or more dangerous compared to bricks and mortar banks?,btohqsg
he cannot hit the credit card spend so i didnt include the cc spend bonus itnerestand also its 4.65% only if u have 100k  ir increases from 3.85% to 4.65% as ur balance increases from 75k to 100k  only after hitting 100k do we actually get 4.65%,btohqsg
Digital banking is a new animal to me.Probably ask those who knows more.,btohqsg
How to link the second yuu card to yuu app?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  can I kindly ask for your consult? If I pay my periodic payments on atome  does my credit card recognise Atome’s MCC or the underlying merchant’s MCC? Context  I’m trying to use the correct card for my atome credit card payment. Thanks!!,btohqsg
For digital bank  my view I look who is the backer. That why I started with Trust as it is from SC and FairPrice. But now they have made it difficult to fulfill the requirements.,btohqsg
Contact yuu CSO to remove the currently linked card first  then link the second card to the app.,btohqsg
