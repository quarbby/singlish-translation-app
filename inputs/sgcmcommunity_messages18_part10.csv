I am picky on tires. Cos for my car it is just literally me  my steering wheel and the tyres,btohqsg
Yeah makes complete sense no electronics at all. But I feel tires should be one thing that no one should cheap out on  because they're your only point of contact with the roads,btohqsg
15 incher is still very economical today. What a long sightedness that VW foresee when it was first designed way back in early 1940s,btohqsg
I am actually very happy with Malaysia continental made Dunlop SP Sports J5.,btohqsg
"even tho it was an ""economy sports"" tire lol",btohqsg
This size fits murcielagos  Corvette rears  vipers  etc.,btohqsg
I think for you  the stability and wet weather capabilities are the top priority! Economy sports segment tires tend to do really well with that,btohqsg
Considering the car isn't meant to be a performance car anyway,btohqsg
They usually don’t bring these special tyres to Singapore and even if have  will be $$$.,btohqsg
Ya how my tyre can last me 1 more year lol,btohqsg
Then these stock should arrive liao,btohqsg
Yup  designed for wet.They have a wet indicator. If that is worn  it is time to replace; while it will still perform good in dry,btohqsg
Try asking for a 295/40-22 ps4s,btohqsg
With the price hike and limited supply  I heard $1k+ each also can’t get even if you’re willing to pay for it.,btohqsg
Can consider group buy with other electric vehicle owners,btohqsg
Might bring the price down a bit,btohqsg
Kana side wall nail is really heart pain,btohqsg
15 inch is considered big in 1940s,btohqsg
I see those old RR from that era also use small wheels,btohqsg
Change ur rim to this to pair with the tyres,btohqsg
Not sure they provide at SEAT or Skoda pricing?,btohqsg
Well not all parts are interchangeable usually it's the platforms and a few things only,btohqsg
Part price from a stockist can be similar but the major difference you see is when you go to a dealer to do it and they charge you extra for the part and labour,btohqsg
same parts put in a Toyota box Vs one in a lexus box could be big difference,btohqsg
NIO debut in singapore sees down price,btohqsg
Facelifted BMW 3 Series can now be had with the firm's Curved DisplayThe BMW 3 series is undergoing major changes to pit itself against the likes of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class  Audi A4 and Lexus IS!😎If you had to pick  which of these cars would you choose?👉🏻 React with ❤️ for the BMW 3 series!👉🏻 React with 🥰 for the Mercedes-Benz C-Class!👉🏻 React with 😁 for the Audi A4!👉🏻 React with 👍🏻 for the Lexus IS!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
actually  now SEAT and Skoda are priced to meet Audi pricing and not the otherway round..hahaha,btohqsg
Congrats lo. Their brand perception also not that attas!,btohqsg
if you compare A3 to Scala  the most apple to apple comparision you can get on the market right now,btohqsg
A3 197k  Scala top variant at 151k,btohqsg
Golf in the middle at 169 to 179k,btohqsg
imagine a SEAT at 149  I used to drive the SEAT that cost less than 50K... of course times have changed  now the SEAT and my Golf almost on par except some features and the interior materials are better quality looking for the Golf,btohqsg
You are a wise man. We remember our painful experiences.,btohqsg
NIO is going big and they will have stations to replace your car's battery in less tha few minutes instead of having to wait for charging time with a minimum wait of 35mins,btohqsg
Exactly  times have changed  there is demand for each and every one of them. there are minute differences in the materials and features but the difference in price is a lot more  20k between the Golf and the Leon. You just have to pick and choose what you want to pay for and what you consider value for money,btohqsg
haha i think tesla market share too big for NIO to be popular here,btohqsg
unless NIO themselves can come in without any markup from AD  i think it wld be tough,btohqsg
Tesla hype train will still be around to give them tough competition,btohqsg
really depends on how they can price here too and what kind of market identity they can create,btohqsg
Or course la. You’re so slow surely braking distance you win,btohqsg
If this is fitted on beetle heads turn,btohqsg
imagine if you have these rims on a toyota century,btohqsg
Beetle needs to be in metallic gold colour first lol,btohqsg
i sold NIO last year warned others not to buy but sell,btohqsg
is this orderable in singapore? damn cool.,btohqsg
You can register interest but no deliveries,btohqsg
In general the new model X deliveries are delayed  especially the plaid,btohqsg
Yes but that's import used and still won't get the updated model with the landscape screen like model 3. Will be the older one plus no supercharging,btohqsg
