and this is my 6th year there,btohqsg
its always the people who are inside the school,btohqsg
who will slander their own school,btohqsg
if you're not slandering ntu you're not in ntu,btohqsg
and if you're in ntu and you're not slandering it then you're either ntusu or ntu corporate comms office,btohqsg
i will try to make it work,btohqsg
first time used canva was in uni during my fyp lmao,btohqsg
im starting march on a horrible note,btohqsg
mfw ori takes one month away from my life,btohqsg
Ah yes. M for March and for Midterms,btohqsg
My JC ori was done in 2 weeks,btohqsg
M for m ded because there's 3 mid terms and 2 submissions in week 8 and m still stuck at week 2 content,btohqsg
your ori mood depends on your og,btohqsg
if you og is shit then your ori is shit,btohqsg
my worst experience with these kinda groups based activities so far is still..... obs ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Ok bur tbh some ori fun uh,btohqsg
Esp when you guys go out and do stuff tgt,btohqsg
and ''my fun fact is i like to sleep'' ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
my fun fact is amos yee used to be my primary school classmate,btohqsg
"Honestly I would actually say that  but I would say I would ""daydream"" more",btohqsg
my og can never go out tgt,btohqsg
i shall not elaborate further LMAO,btohqsg
my dhs classmate was some youtube rapper that got arrested for blackmailing,btohqsg
the problem with my og is there's 3 types of people:1. those few ppl who cannot leave a clique2. introverts playing brawl stars 24/73. people who have given up on socialising with their og and abandoned their og to join their friends (me),btohqsg
so cannot mix and go out tgt lor,btohqsg
literally all of my friends ogs can go out sing song at ktv  go beach  go ppls house and mug tgt...,btohqsg
my og literally cut off after ori (still got talk online la),btohqsg
rare ones lor. Usually they only do that DURING ORI  after that it dies,btohqsg
my 3 OGs all stopped the moment ori ended,btohqsg
"Worse ones are when you are like ""hey wanna hang out"" but then everyone stay silent.",btohqsg
now im hoping my class will do something nice or else my jc life is plain af,btohqsg
im the ambivert tryna initiate going out but my og/class doesn't care,btohqsg
so i just go out with my cca mates and their ogs,btohqsg
Legit issue is too big alr,btohqsg
Then like dowan bring others along,btohqsg
Like as in og is too big,btohqsg
gg to beach as a whole og is possible  but we can't even cut the og in half and go to the nearby mall sia,btohqsg
I feel like if it was like precovid this can happen,btohqsg
Like everyone forming their own cliques alr,btohqsg
pre covid days were the goated days,btohqsg
idk how these girls can click along so fast sia...like i saw one of my friends ig story getting starbucks and tagging her clique,btohqsg
class cliques formed like right off the bat,btohqsg
first day and alrd buddy buddy sial,btohqsg
meanwhile there are ppl in my class whom i never never talked to for 2y,btohqsg
my class is still isolated cos we don't have much class activities rn,btohqsg
actually  i think i had my friend clique since orientation too but i forgot how but we just started talking and formed the clique,btohqsg
my JC pro was 2 days,btohqsg
SHAWTY FIRE BURNING ON THE DANCE FLOOR,btohqsg
Eh but legit when they want to do next ori  I was triggered why they want to change the dance,btohqsg
