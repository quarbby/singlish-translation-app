It's one of what I consider the last of the old school sports cars,btohqsg
RWD  high rev NA big cc engine. Very analog car,btohqsg
No turbos  no hybrid motors or batteries,btohqsg
don't take it the wrong way  but calling an LFA a sports car lowkey does the LFA a disservice itself ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Somewhat flawed  but where it excels  it has no equal,btohqsg
it sold like ass when it came out,btohqsg
sure  extremely well engineered  co-developed with Yamaha and brutally tested on the Nords.,btohqsg
but it has come to a point where every 12 year old jerks off to the thought of it,btohqsg
with a kerb weight of 1.6 tons and a dodgy 6 speed automated manual...?,btohqsg
Actually they made 500 of them only and that is what they sold,btohqsg
don't get me wrong  it is a marvel of a car,btohqsg
but they aren't all THAT great,btohqsg
It was never meant to be a big volume sports cars like the R35 GTR,btohqsg
it never was  but even then it never sold well.,btohqsg
It's a halo car  it actually lost money for Lexus for every unit,btohqsg
It was meant to be a marketing and branding exercise,btohqsg
if anything  the loss of the then-planned Honda NSX was a contribution to the lack of sales,btohqsg
"""We can do this wonderful thing""",btohqsg
the NSX which turned into the HSV-010,btohqsg
the financial crisis played a part too.,btohqsg
It was not the fastest car when it came out  the R35 was faster,btohqsg
as much as one would kill for an LFA now  not many would've want to fork out the amount brand new,btohqsg
it was never about speed really,btohqsg
It was always about getting there fast  looking and sounding good,btohqsg
"the LFA was meant as a huge ""fuck you  we're incorporating every thing we've learnt from motorsports""",btohqsg
all while being comfortable and reliable enough to be a toyota,btohqsg
4.8 litre NA V10 with 550hp at 8700rpm,btohqsg
The only way you can get that kind of banshee scream is from a GP bike,btohqsg
go yishun more often  once in awhile can hear some auntie screaming from her kitchen window,btohqsg
So we got Mario kart edit before gta 6,btohqsg
Hmmm I only can see the white one  the other is blocked I think,btohqsg
