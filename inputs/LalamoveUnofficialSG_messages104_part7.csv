Investment.. win some lose some at times. lols,btohqsg
Cos u say 1 hr  I though all short trip,btohqsg
This is a good price  cos u stack 3. Long distance must stack or else not worth,btohqsg
Long trip. But delivery location nearby... Lucky.,btohqsg
I nvr take too advanced jobs  so nvr get to stack more than 2ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Stack is necessary for some part of time  otherwise  you earn too little  below minimum wage I guess.lols!,btohqsg
I stubborn. Always want to wait for higher priceðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But now very very difficult cos jobs out gone immediately. N bids so hard to win,btohqsg

Y always for bike only? What abt car,btohqsg
does the chart mean that there is a ceiling fee for current pricing for bike distance?,btohqsg
May I check if the rating review max that show in the apps is 20 ?,btohqsg
only the 10th kilometer is $2.40  it's 35c/km before that and 40c/km after the 11th. There is sharp fee jump at 10km  unless the chart got typo.,btohqsg
Yah don't understand y like thatðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but those long distance multi-drops will be a bit fairer price.,btohqsg
