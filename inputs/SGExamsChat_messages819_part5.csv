When you got a poly that allows you to go to y3 with a gpa of below 1,btohqsg
You know you got a fucked up poly,btohqsg

you gotta pon half your mods religiously,btohqsg
U still hit attendance requirements if u do LOA correctly,btohqsg
Yes then by Y3 they fucking pissed off as they realised the cert is as useful as Toliet paper,btohqsg
im pretty sure if at y3 ur gpa is < 1/4  u cant really buck it up to at least 2 by end of the year,btohqsg
You can take 2 loa without reason+5 loas...that is out of 12/13 lessons,btohqsg
You can literally Pon 7/13 lessons without failing the module,btohqsg

If the teachers don't want to mark rj  they will just say no rj or ignore the qns,btohqsg
