It should come together with the service transcript,btohqsg

Can check if it matches the NRIC checksum,btohqsg
If it doesn't it's 9999% fake NRIC fake person fake transcript,btohqsg
I probably should’ve read it better then,btohqsg
if it matches the NRIC checksum tho,btohqsg
Then....it's actually just a fake transcript but NRIC COULD belong to someone LMAO,btohqsg
And who would have an IC number with S9765432Y,btohqsg
I’ve a friend with a stupid easy IC number,btohqsg
More like PR IC numbers. PRs usually get Sxx7/8xxxx,btohqsg

I think it was easier this year but still prob get PARTICIPATION,btohqsg
Or maybe its becus I'm sec 4 this year,btohqsg
Idk I forgot I had it until they emailed me,btohqsg
It was compulsory so I had to go :(,btohqsg
A lot of people halfway then enter the exam lol,btohqsg
It’s only really compulsory if there are consequences,btohqsg
I mean they paid already so I'll prob get a scolding,btohqsg

Why bother with SMO questions when they are generally not inherently interesting? Better to learn more serious stuff,btohqsg
Everytime I talk to a mathematician involved with olympiads  they go  we know that this is not 'real' mathematics  but this is just for fun and to try to get people interested in mathematics.  To them if they give 'real' mathematics to younger students they might be disinterested.,btohqsg
I would draw the parallel to competitive programming and never really needing to ever use those algorithms ever in day to day use,btohqsg

but the way you think and approach the question  i think that's a valuable skill that people will look at,btohqsg
Yeah but olympaids don't help increase your grades for your O/A level subjects,btohqsg
Most people won’t touch that though,btohqsg
One of them was my Cambridge interviewer. Told me he knows it's not real mathematics but just to get people interested. When he mentioned olympiads and the expression on my face he knew I didn't like it. He seems to hate olympiads himself,btohqsg
Not quite the mathematician way though,btohqsg
I think most people do it for the points,btohqsg
We like to think if things work in a more general case,btohqsg
