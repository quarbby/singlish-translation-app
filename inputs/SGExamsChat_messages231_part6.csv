Linux refers to the kernel  Ubuntu is a linux flavour,btohqsg
Oh  so Ubuntu is a variation of Linux?,btohqsg
Linux is the kernel  all distributions (ubuntu  rhel  centOS etc etc) use the same kernel,btohqsg
Ngl the first time I used saw linux I thought it looked very ugly,btohqsg
have you experienced windows ps hell,btohqsg
I think you get used to it yeah,btohqsg
I think the default is ugly but you can customise to look nicer,btohqsg
Lol I'm not really a windows user,btohqsg
anyway are you referring to the GUI?,btohqsg
Ur not the only one :>,btohqsg
My first linux distro was linux mint so,btohqsg

Okay maybe for the ladies shorter is nicer (?),btohqsg
But for males there's literally nothing good about being short,btohqsg
