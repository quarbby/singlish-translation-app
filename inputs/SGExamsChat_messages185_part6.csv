U know what is rank point right,btohqsg
Ur A Levels performance is measured by rank points,btohqsg
so 3H2 1H1 you will get 70?,btohqsg
If you 4H2  your weakest H2 is a H1,btohqsg
4H2 lowest h2 downgrade to h1,btohqsg
yes I'm planning to do H1,btohqsg
Like 80% of students don't take H3,btohqsg

It's not fair to factor in H3,btohqsg
