yup no worries i think u should be fine because ur queue no. is well within the amount of units ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
How about 300 out of 400? üòîüòî,btohqsg
üòÇ im no magic ball but its also well within the amt of units,btohqsg
Prime June has about 20% and prime Feb has about 18%,btohqsg
But according to the metrics of 66.7% I stand no chance,btohqsg
Is it higher dropout rate for prime location ? My is Sengkang bto,btohqsg
If you are within supply then u don‚Äôt have to worry in securing a unit. As long as the ethnic quota is enough for Chinese assuming you are,btohqsg
300/400 is within the queue no. so u stand a lot of chance  unless ethnic quota,btohqsg
I believe it‚Äôs lower but can‚Äôt be sure,btohqsg
18-20% is very low dropout rate,btohqsg
Average was 40% in the past,btohqsg
My selection is estimated in April. üòÇ,btohqsg
66.7% is virtually guaranteed. Historically no one can‚Äôt pick if u are at 100% within supply,btohqsg
Yes this exactly what I worry.. ethnicity restriction will make me no chance to secure.. yes I‚Äôm Chinese,btohqsg
I believe as a Chinese u still get to choose about 80% of the unit?,btohqsg
Serious ?! This is some thg I found it very comforting !,btohqsg
Ethic quota at 67% for Chinese with zero drop out guarantees u a unit,btohqsg
So technically u would get unless u give up,btohqsg
I doubt any land allows less than 67% for Chinese. Lol never heard of,btohqsg
Depends also on the applicants ethnicity for the project as a whole,btohqsg
Also chances of 100% chinese before u is quite low la hahaha,btohqsg
100% Chinese in front of u with ethic quota of only 67% Chinese with also 0 drop out rate is 100% for u to get a unit üòÇ,btohqsg
And u would get to choose mid to good units with that number,btohqsg
I was at 88% percentile and still got to choose a not bad unit. And many Chinese chose after me as well.,btohqsg
I was worried too as ethic quota was 88% for mine. I‚Äôm like very close but then I worried for nothing. Lots of units left to choose haha,btohqsg
How many years ago? Because I heard nowadays the dropout rate is lower,btohqsg
Hello! Anyone has the link to the Kallang/Crawford group? (:,btohqsg
I think generally if within supply should be able to choose.But may not get the block of your choice as the quota also applies to the block.,btohqsg
Hi can anyone advise if they received keys earlier than ECD please,btohqsg
Hi is SBF only for applicants who have applied before? üòÖ,btohqsg
No.. anyone can apply... just quite limited offerings..,btohqsg
Usually is in between. I have heard of one year earlier than ECD pre covid,btohqsg
Nope. But key collection time yes,btohqsg
If it happens to be before ECD would it be possible to request for delayed key collection?,btohqsg
Just figuring out the financial planning haha,btohqsg
I mean if there‚Äôs a particular project you like  the offering for that one is not a lot‚Ä¶,btohqsg
SBF also includes those who have selected at the BTO stage but decided to cancel before they get the keys.,btohqsg
So can I simultaneously take part in SBF and Feb 2025 exercise?,btohqsg
The balance is mostly at Jurong?,btohqsg
Hi all If i got 300+/100+ i pressed proceed for the ballot.And if i didn‚Äôt manage to get  am i still a first timer for next upcoming bto?,btohqsg
The proceed button is nothing actually,btohqsg
Hellooo! ill be heading for  BTO flat selection (on feb 2024) Currently  I am working full time until now and my partner is unemployed since dec 2023 due to some family circumstances. But he had secure a job which start on march 2024. I am able to fork out the 2k during flat selection. So in this case most likely what documents do my partner need to provide though? (as he is unemployed since dec 2023)  are we still able to get a flat or no? sorry as its my first time. As i think they won't reassessing the HDB housing loan the grant??  have anyone encountered this situation be4? thx (sorry for the long message),btohqsg
They see the hfe at point of application,btohqsg
They would still require 12 months of salary to consider hdb loan amount for your partner. Are u able to reapply your HFE?,btohqsg
Flat selection will follow whats stated in hfe. So u just need to prepare to pay the option fee. Usually just need to bring ic. Refer ur email on what other doc needed,btohqsg
Anything regards the loan will be finalise during key collection,btohqsg
When you get the invitation letter  documents required will be stated. . So just prepare beforehand,btohqsg
hello! Asking for a friend. anyone knows what‚Äôs this HDB concessionary loan?,btohqsg
In this case  can still take up bank loan? Or strictly hdb loan only? Does it affect anything? Cos previously when my friend applied  this field was empty,btohqsg
You can change to bank loan anytime  even after you get your flat. Just that can never change back to Hdb loan,btohqsg
