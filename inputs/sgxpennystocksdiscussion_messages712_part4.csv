Knn you go Amoy street for what .,btohqsg
hi dax ..would like to check wat ur opinion on yzj ship n golden ?,btohqsg
Change xmm no need lui ma .,btohqsg
Golden Energy volatile but as they love to flush. Timing needs to perfect when trading this and must enter the right price.(Red   and spot hidden buyers usually better ep)When green and running   suddenly it might come to flush.They are near break out but will they do a fake breakout or will it be real this time. Hard to say.Very difficult counter to trade.,btohqsg
Not sure why Yzj ran up like that on a weak market day. Possibly some inside news leak. Chasers might get caught.Inside news leak  people buy in advance   when news announced   might sell on news ?I would wait and see for now.,btohqsg
Gear confirm won't breakout. If breakout. I confirm all in chase,btohqsg
Once gear see 83Just all in sure win,btohqsg

Overall  This give them more financial stability and support going forward .The longer term play would be the warrant conversion $0.065.For now  good thing is no ongoing concern. Now  company must make the best to turn around their overall business back to profitability,btohqsg
Whether any early play or not  will depends on whether the BBs want to  ultimately it’s much more dependable on the the penny market sentiments.,btohqsg
Good thing is no short item financial troubles with this deal  makes this one safe for play .If they want to raise more  makes sense that they bring price above $0.065 which give bond holder incentive to convert,btohqsg
But time is on their side. Overall   it’s good deal for MM2 Asia.,btohqsg
But no rush for them to pump up this one . Depends on the BBs and sentiments,btohqsg
Keep borrow money. Under table don’t know do Simi sai. Can trade but I won’t hold ba.,btohqsg

Overall losses. Paper or realised . Loss is loss 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Survived for short term. Management needs to turn it around.Safe for trading meantime since there is likely funding and no immediate risks of ongoing concern,btohqsg
I think it’s the same bro. Paper losses still losses .Last time I also buy up and hope.Now  once break have to cut first.If TA good and price recovers   can always buy back later rather than suffer the pain as it goes lower to find base before the rebound.Can be very painful,btohqsg
