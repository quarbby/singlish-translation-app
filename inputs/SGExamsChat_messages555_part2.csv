I believe there is a line between passion and reality,btohqsg
I mean if ur passionate about ur work rite u love what ur doing but u can get out enough money to pay the bills then lifeâ€™s gonna suck,btohqsg
ooo thatâ€™s cool  i heard from my life science friend say that they got direct pathway to postgrad research,btohqsg
I heard that nus is like more interdisciplinary compared to ntu biological sciences,btohqsg
i mean if you get a job with research then you can def pay the bills like thatâ€™s not an issue,btohqsg
and within the bachelors degree youâ€™ll def have opportunities to do research like as an extra thing,btohqsg
from there you can decide if thatâ€™s what you wanna do long term,btohqsg
gap years are fine but iâ€™d usually recommend that for people that dk what major to pursue. if you alr know then itâ€™s not worth to do an intern for it imo unless itâ€™s a rlly rlly good one,btohqsg
bc within your major youâ€™ll have time during the degree to explore,btohqsg
pay the bills + my expensive ass hobbies,btohqsg
my hobbies are technically my side hustles too do,btohqsg
i mean life science is a lot more diverse in job opportunities than you think,btohqsg
i mean if you do life science then do CS mods it opens a door into bioinformatics,btohqsg
itâ€™s way too much of a stigma that if you do a hard science in uni,btohqsg
you canâ€™t pay bills unless you teach or study more lol,btohqsg
anyway my suggestion is fr to go into your undergraduate with an open mind and explore opportunities through interns or research with profs,btohqsg
even stuff you may not think youâ€™ll like  no harm giving it a shot to be sure,btohqsg
if next time you wanna try interning w astar or smth lmk and i can ask,btohqsg
I think they only accept interns that are under a star scholarship,btohqsg
yea but from back door is different,btohqsg
