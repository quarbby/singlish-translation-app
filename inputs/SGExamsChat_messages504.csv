Both are official form of communications with officials,btohqsg
But if you post/call for  something irrelevant or redundant,btohqsg
To whom this may concern Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as a NSF Corporal with the Singapore Armed Forces. This letter shall serve as the required one month advanced notice before my final day here.I would like to thank you for the opportunity to work in this position for the past 15 months. I‚Äôve greatly enjoyed the opportunities I‚Äôve had to practice patience and tolerance  and I value the guidance of my superiors in ensuring that my workplace is kept neat and tidy. I‚Äôve learned exactly what to avoid in order to foster a good workplace culture  and how to motivate staff. Perhaps most importantly  your organization has taught me how to accomplish my work in a safe  reliable  and efficient manner  achieving speed through skill. I will be sure to apply all of these lessons in future places I work in.Career progression has been amazing. Nowhere else in the country can you boast of having a three-time promotion within the span of 15 months - a testament to the value you place on staff development. Salary wise  this amounts to a whopping 11% increase*  which is extremely competitive relative to the private sector.The employment benefits are second to none: Not only is food  accommodation and clothing provided for  this organization has actively invested in the wellbeing of its employees by providing FREE fitness and conditioning programs. Not just that  it actively helps us in achieving those fitness standards  by having complementary trainings on the weekends!I am amazed too  by the healthcare facilities which are foremost and utmost in quality. Never have I seen a company that provides world class medical facilities for its staff to use  free of charge  like the wonderful Pulau Tekong Medical Center.Indeed  words cannot express how grateful am I to have been a part of this amazing organization. The value of my time here cannot be measured in dollars and cents  and the honour and glory of contributing to this organization is mine.Despite this  I have chosen to leave your organization to pursue other goals. It would be unfair to deprive others of a chance to experience this wonderful place for themselves. I wish it every success in its future endeavors.*70 dollar increase on a 630 dollar base.,btohqsg

the problem is he has already claimed if his pfp is successful..he no longer wants tuition,btohqsg
but my stubborn mother wont let go tof the MTL tuition for him,btohqsg

i just dont want him to burnout..because it seems he cant control his own limits,btohqsg
there is nothing wrong with that. my course had entry requirement of 15 or 16  but i still mug like hell so can do well,btohqsg
gotta understand some people dont aim to be bare minimum,btohqsg

Im also hvng a shitshow rn since I'm crying while walking ard aimlessly in a mall,btohqsg

Damn dont worry it will get better,btohqsg
This is a wack paper tho,btohqsg
that guy must be obsessed with flies,btohqsg
Just for it to go down again,btohqsg
I'm at a loss of faith  hope and trust as well as my sanity,btohqsg
I'm this close to deleting everything  throwing away my phone and running away to the forest and live there like as if I'm about to do my own ranger course,btohqsg
i suggest climbing mt batur for the sunrise,btohqsg
Which one is easier to just slip and fall off from?,btohqsg
"""This is going to be a beautiful death  jumping out that window""",btohqsg
There is nothing beautiful about death going out this way  I‚Äôve seen the aftermath of the outcome of one‚Ä¶It is not beautiful at the slightest,btohqsg
Dont look that way. Life will get alot better,btohqsg
How bro? I'm very distressed  haven't been at ease and peace for about 6 months now,btohqsg
Time to down my sleeping pills again,btohqsg
Its ok you will get over it,btohqsg
No one said to go out of control,btohqsg
Just play a game or watch yt  every moment not spent on your negative thoughts is every good moment for you,btohqsg
None of my pasttime activities excite me anymore,btohqsg
Not gaming  not reading  not music,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt have to be excited by it  just be distracted by it,btohqsg
I am just in manchild mode and breaking down while crying,btohqsg
Why am I just a burden in life?,btohqsg
Cos you seem to be letting it get under your skin?,btohqsg
I tell you who are the real burdens in life‚Ä¶because they will never get the chance to say it to you in person.You have have that chance  therefore you are not a burden,btohqsg
I would never cause I know it would never solve the issues I face,btohqsg
I think Imma go and grieve outside first rather than spreading my negative energy here  thank you for your care and concern  everyone!,btohqsg
A good place is at your nearest void deck,btohqsg
Secluded enough at this timing you can grieve in peace but not too secluded til the point it will become Dangerous for you,btohqsg
yes what i do when im distressed is at 1am go for a walk,btohqsg
look around you and reaslise everything at a standstil and you can feel the inner peace,btohqsg
notice how the traffic is empty and ther is nothing going on its wonderful,btohqsg
bro smiling so brightly beside that woman,btohqsg
bet this is a v far away goal for them,btohqsg
Is this a real ad dbs came up with,btohqsg
yes. this is their corporate slide but not an ad,btohqsg
Fcking cmin up with gandalf lol,btohqsg
the previously known FAANG is switched to MAMAA alr,btohqsg
Bro got hooked by that bait pic,btohqsg
yk it‚Äôs bad when pocoyo starts to drink coffee everyday,btohqsg
imagine living in a world where someone can deepfake a world leader into declaring war,btohqsg
i went on a week of coffee once..idk why but after a week i stopped cause i hated the taste of it,btohqsg
We need that Lim Chu Kang BTO,btohqsg
fully occupied before it even opens to public,btohqsg
The dead are preordering their new houses really fast,btohqsg
20 year lease only for small plot of land,btohqsg
Then you have to relocate with about 9 other people and live together,btohqsg
have to become ashes first hahaha,btohqsg
one of the google ai ceo's resigned because he's scared of how powerful ai is going to become,btohqsg
someone said that AI have a 50% chance of creating a doom effect,btohqsg
oh did u see on TikTok there‚Äôs an AI that made AI nude out of a fully clothed woman,btohqsg
So basically some pervert can take pic of u fully clothed,btohqsg
if he say like that  what do u think?,btohqsg
better hope sg don‚Äôt get inspired by this,btohqsg
Isn't that just the enlistment Act?,btohqsg
elon musk constantly warning that if ai becomes too powerful we‚Äôre done,btohqsg
nah but i dont wanna see it lol,btohqsg
They don't show anyt ofc on tiktok,btohqsg
But ya ai is damn powerful,btohqsg
i‚Äôve watched this shane dawson conspiracy video where selena gomez‚Äôs face was deepfaked onto an adult film star‚Äôs video,btohqsg
And its improving because of ai complications and it's making it easier to make,btohqsg
exactly the human race is just digging their own grave,btohqsg
first of all   make sure ai is controlled & oso doesn‚Äôt fall into the wrong hands,btohqsg
If they make ai accessible prevention of falling into wrong hands is super difficult,btohqsg
basically you want people to hide their info from the government but,btohqsg
evil people use that place to sell drugs guns and all those shit,btohqsg
a lot of our stuff have ai anyways like lifestyle devices / cars / home appliances etc.,btohqsg
which is why its difficult lol,btohqsg
I have 2 google nests at home alr gg,btohqsg
hahaha u creating ai nest at home,btohqsg
Chicken and egg question but wtv la,btohqsg
I gt 2 Alexa but i disabled them,btohqsg
everything‚Äôs got its pros and cons,btohqsg
I only have the HomePod that ‚Äòs working,btohqsg
what else gt AI. I think the tv(s) at home are both AI equipped but I hardly use those AI features anyways,btohqsg
Just how advanced ai are that's the diff,btohqsg
Most things u buy have ai alr ig,btohqsg
anything categorized for smart home is considered AI,btohqsg
Well tired about this ai thing I'm being honest,btohqsg
Everything is about ai good or bad it's tiring,btohqsg
last time   we don‚Äôt have such issues ig,btohqsg
the scary thing about technology is honestly how the good of it will never outshine the bad of it,btohqsg
Like what we are seeing in the current ukraine war..because of technology  now drones can be used to drop remotely controlled bombs. When war was about skill  about knowing where your enemy was and how to outplay them..Now its about luck  because you cant outrun a drone nor outplay ai,btohqsg
i heard that people could use deepfakes to start making fake videos of zelenskyy saying he wants ukraine to surrender or something,btohqsg
people can fake speeches of politicians,btohqsg
I saw the post on mothsrship,btohqsg
Nudity how to be on TikTok,btohqsg
I could you not  I saw a popular Instagram reel of a breast cancer survivor just showing her chest  her breast were removed so I guessed it was ok?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs really begs the question  where does social media draw a line towards showing nudity,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrFuNU7pr0_/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==< ai decided to take a break?,btohqsg
there's an ai detection tool that shadowblocks your content if they detect nudity. fun fact it was inherited from dating apps,btohqsg
every country has a public policy officer that decides country specific content policies in accordance to local guidelines for most big tech apps,btohqsg
Btw apparently for my poly  this yr Kahoot quizzes are graded?,btohqsg
Like the results of a Kahoot quiz will affect the gpa you get,btohqsg
7 ppl alr take MC üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
Now rp is using Kahoot to grade students,btohqsg
That is what the y1‚Äôs are saying,btohqsg
Idk what is worst tho   the fact they can do stacking or slacking,btohqsg
Stacking- doing two graded Kahoot in one lessonSlacking-one graded and one ungraded in one lesson,btohqsg
The ppl in my poly tele is just shitting on it daily,btohqsg
ok did I js spam msg,btohqsg
I think this is called flooding,btohqsg
But yea within the same family,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not that straight forward cause you can still get 4.0 even if you fail a lesson,btohqsg
Someone that has helped out for a event or situation is the most simplest layman way of saying it,btohqsg
if i get my NUS offer,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
Guys is it me or pop mart is dying,btohqsg
can‚Äôt relate  left all of them  abit toxic and annoying,btohqsg
Your dear friend threw a kick to obvlivion someone lmao cause of their toxicity,btohqsg
and got better people to chat with,btohqsg
Idk I met someone that was about to go into ns last yr on it,btohqsg
Bro told me about his poly journey etc,btohqsg
I mean is there a better option? Cause right now I don‚Äôt know any,btohqsg
I somehow found the biggest lot of introverted friends,btohqsg
Yea precisely when I ask any of them if they maybe want to go out or something,btohqsg
Nobody replies and I don‚Äôt even see them active on social media as well,btohqsg
i would rather stay at home tbh,btohqsg
At least joking around would help ease up the atmosphere?,btohqsg
But now my brother stole my laptop,btohqsg
Idk if you could tell but they were joking,btohqsg
Anyway I‚Äôm not actively looking to meet ppl irl,btohqsg
Bu If someone wants to  I won‚Äôt deny,btohqsg
That is basically my mood regarding friendships now,btohqsg
Heard that np tele had nudes,btohqsg
Unfortunately I can forsee it getting worse over time but oh wells,btohqsg
Yes  I give up on life.,btohqsg
Ngl telegram right now is just entertainment for me,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs one of the more active apps I use,btohqsg
Yea I left that tele alr also,btohqsg
But a lot more rp peeps joined it,btohqsg
Got some troublemakers went to spread rumours in the ite chat,btohqsg
Ngl I really can‚Äôt doubt my school‚Äôs image on telegram tho,btohqsg
Cause within my first sem  someone alr got their nose broken in a fight that occured at the toilet,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just the environment and where most of the students come from‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Not shocked if pre-school kids start being as such in about a decade's time,btohqsg
The thing about students is that Singapore once trialed to give the younger kids a shot at getting skills,btohqsg
In ite foundation years  they allowed psle students to enrol into ite,btohqsg
That's a whole level jump  damn,btohqsg
Yes that was a programme where those that finished psle was given a choice to go ite,btohqsg
Huh? I'm depressed when I'm back in civi,btohqsg
I feel most alive as a soldier in camp,btohqsg
That is one reason why ITE had the  reputation it had,btohqsg
Lessgo! Ration IC time to shine!,btohqsg
You cant turn out good students if they have yet to even understand the world,btohqsg
Yeah  my issue is personal/civilian - SAF ain't the problem for me,btohqsg
ok you‚Äôre living under a rock,btohqsg
Nope it won‚Äôt  simple reason‚Ä¶you got kids who like to hit and attack each other into a environment with knives and saws,btohqsg
Not enough to survive unless I can finally detach and live truly alone,btohqsg
I open a childcare centre and make friends,btohqsg
Then where you find ppl sia,btohqsg
kuro  I will literally block u on Instagram so u won‚Äôt send me anymore reels,btohqsg
I need some lmao‚Ä¶.all the ones I know either live in like Jurong or are severely introverted,btohqsg
Would love too but WOSpec salary ain't enough in my opinion until I reach WO which could be a Decade or even more from now if I pursue signing on,btohqsg
Dang reels‚Ä¶.awh i was actually thinking of sending you random reels also,btohqsg
But then realise I don‚Äôt look at Instagram long enough to actually find good ones,btohqsg
Idk how to study in rp,btohqsg
I ask the tele  the y1‚Äôs are surprised I even did notes,btohqsg
the toxic reply is : ew don‚Äôt need tryhard,btohqsg
the more serious reply is: good job you‚Äôre getting somewhere,btohqsg
my reply is: i like guys,btohqsg
is it concerning that all my class does notes  yes.,btohqsg
is it concerning that pocoyo doesnt  also yes,btohqsg
Yea agreed to both  because they are also asking why ppl are telling them ‚Äúy1s1‚Äù are thought to be as easy,btohqsg
I actually gave them a rundown on a very good reason why,btohqsg
got ppl say y1 sem 1 so freaking easy close eye still can get 4,btohqsg
For the bias reason  i have friends from both end of the spectrum,btohqsg
üíÄ wait till they realise 80% ain‚Äôt easy. 20/25 for the quiz. dawg ain‚Äôt no way cfm i get 6 or smt,btohqsg
i mean sci of cos must study,btohqsg
ok we‚Äôre not manifesting any of this nonsense,btohqsg
Those that fail like 4 modules and those that get like 4.8gpa,btohqsg
ok simply put  poly is easy to just not study  you can survive  but you will never get a 4 if you don‚Äôt fight your way through your classmates  form good relations with your tutors  and don‚Äôt shake ur ass when u leave the shower,btohqsg
tp next week no lessons weee,btohqsg
The only con conceivable difference I can see from the failure of 4 modules me and the 4.8gpa guy is one word,btohqsg
no i poo poo jn bcz I drank milk  im lactose intolerant,btohqsg
sch gives us time catch up with shit,btohqsg
The failure of 4 modules has no goalMy goal is to finish poly and have a decent gpa4.8 person goal is to get into nus,btohqsg
Bruh why suddenly got breast milk,btohqsg
ok u see I was thinking too far,btohqsg
ya Sia.. at least I got grad week,btohqsg

I think our equivalent in rp is during sem break,btohqsg

We start sem break in rp damn early,btohqsg
nope we also got sem break,btohqsg

Most of my cousins got into NTU,btohqsg

I get 3.7 + portfolio end up still get some 75rp course I tell u,btohqsg

"ah yes remind me of my class lecturer asking the most simplest qns ""What do you think you can do to reduce trash in singapore""Someone then replied talking about what other countries are doing....like bro mentioned 3 diff methods from 3 diff countries.Then the next speaker was like ""dont use too much trash""..",btohqsg
yea is called playing with ur mind,btohqsg
rp grading system is ridiculously stupid,btohqsg
for the current sec 4/5 batch pls study hard so you can go to jc/other polys thats not rp/mi,btohqsg
yea if you plan to want to actually go uni  study hard and get into any other poly,btohqsg
but if you just want to finish poly  get a diploma..then go rp,btohqsg
i not dissing la im just saying pls study hard so you dont end up in rp,btohqsg
Why that Mixtape be looking like some goofy ass demo,btohqsg
i actually qualified for mi idek why i went to rp insteadugh,btohqsg
basically  if you want to get a diploma the fastest  rp is your choice,btohqsg
@ziilinncadvise your fellow friends accordingly üòÅ,btohqsg
the thing is Mi  is not easy,btohqsg
ok that‚Äôs a major downgrade. u could have gone nyp. what‚Äôs this,btohqsg
no  it‚Äôs rp that‚Äôs the problem,btohqsg
yea the y1's in my poly are dissing rp hard af,btohqsg
but rp‚Äôs learning environment doesnt even suit mei fucking hate teamwork and the worse part is when people talk so much to the point im not able to concentrate in class,btohqsg
its like everything eventually comes down to luck if you want to get a good gpa,btohqsg
NYP REJECTED MY 5/6 CHOICES üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
initially i wanted to MI over YI since y‚Äôall said better off going mi  but üíÄüíÄ abit far,btohqsg
ya sia mi is in the west leh,btohqsg
Rp is way easier than Mi,btohqsg

my first 5/6 choices were nyp but they reject üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
it‚Äôs easy to whack yes I und  but 4.0aint easy,btohqsg
alot of rp ppl just want to get shcool done and over with,btohqsg

Ain't that where the money is also?,btohqsg
Oh legit dawg can‚Äôt believe it. Turns out I‚Äôm one of the 2000 eae applicants for my course,btohqsg
i have classmates that talk alot but never get A,btohqsg
somewhat  but end of the day I still need 3.7-3.8+ for nbs which alr super challenging üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
rp got alot..and when i say alot of lecturer bias,btohqsg
fuck rp la just tell your juniors dont come here can already,btohqsg
Rp is not the poly for hardworking ppl,btohqsg
is the simplest i can put it,btohqsg
wait sorry js to ask  the sports sch people go rp for tutorials is it,btohqsg
fuck la then i study for what,btohqsg
I have 0 nyp dictionaries and i am doing fine I swear,btohqsg
May you get into Pulau NTU!,btohqsg

one of my teammates actually transferred to nyp idfk how she did iy,btohqsg
oh rly u cn do that,btohqsg
The ite students nid apply aso,btohqsg
@biology_is_trashdidn't you tried phase 2 to dae,btohqsg
Then they open up the dae phase 2,btohqsg
thats exactly what my first few choices were,btohqsg
rp is a school for connections,btohqsg

liddat i can forget about going to uni,btohqsg
esp most of my classmates came from ite pfp and n levels,btohqsg
most of them dont even fucking study,btohqsg
for ntu/nus  you need 3.8+ and you need a good portfolio,btohqsg
ya la i doing all the slides for a module already,btohqsg
Just find the right grp of friends,btohqsg
the modules you are taking now are mostly not crucial,btohqsg
and the worst thing is when my teammates talk so loud about irrelevant shit and i cant listen in class. bro these extroverts are so fucking noisy,btohqsg
If you are taking a module starting with G...that is a module everybody in rp has to take,btohqsg
just hand in work...and you can get easy grades,btohqsg
and ive only even gotten negative feedback from my lecturers,btohqsg
no this was during common ict,btohqsg
and i put in so much hardwork too,btohqsg
its not like i anyhow write my rj,btohqsg
dont let the negative feedback discourage you,btohqsg
and the kahoot being graded... sia la i just hang myself one day in school,btohqsg
because i never even really took any feedback in for my modules,btohqsg
go ite better at this point,btohqsg
Hahahaha y'all in life sci / dbis  then find me,btohqsg
still getting B after feedback was given and i did not change anything,btohqsg
trust me  i never change anything from the feedback given,btohqsg
so unfair bro i hand in my work on time and i put in effort and they still give me shit feedback,btohqsg
"The  feedback I give is "" pls // after every coding line thanks""",btohqsg
nobody is going to read a feedback that long,btohqsg
And watch me come after u,btohqsg
Is this Boi high on c19?,btohqsg
Mr Chan in rp aso sound like that,btohqsg
want to guess what grade i got for this lesson?,btohqsg
nvm i found a good one,btohqsg
from one of my older modules,btohqsg
U do know Aks is 40% rite,btohqsg
guess what grade i got for this lesson,btohqsg
@litylthis is the reason why i say dont let the feedback affect you....I got a B grade,btohqsg
ok this one actually is bad,btohqsg
the best part about this feedback..was this module had no pre-reading,btohqsg
pre reading..usually is only released on the day before or day itself,btohqsg
its not release in advance of like 2-3days,btohqsg
