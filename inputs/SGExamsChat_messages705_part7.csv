But dont more ppl get 88.75 because of GP and not PW ?,btohqsg
But anyway  pw is pass fail now,btohqsg
bow down to your queen !!,btohqsg
also the schools that  have higher PW distinction rates tend to be the IP schools (eg. Vjc  hwachong and ri mentioned in his post) and IP kids across the various schools have to do mini graded projects that will be counted into their final grade from ip1 to ip4.These projects are commonplace starting from ip1  in order to let the children get used to project work and oral presentations.  thus it is not far fetched to assume that they would have more experience in project work and thus would do better in pw,btohqsg
I still remember in y1 the first english wa  we had to do project work  oral presentation on this: The school has received MOE funds and is building a new facility. It has three ideas (eg. Vollyeball court  vr room  3rd one cant rmb) . The task is to choose which facility is the best and do 10min oral presentation to convince the examiner  why this facility should be built over others,btohqsg
Anyway i have a lot of interesting stories regarding project work in y1y2,btohqsg
But those are stories for another day,btohqsg
There’s one guy here who said he got 88.75rp due to pw  tried nus law but failed thrice (likely due to pw)  while his friend who got 90rp got in,btohqsg
Fail thrice as in no interview or fail interview?,btohqsg
I hope the rebase thing from 90 to 70 is not true,btohqsg
If he didnt get offered interview then maybe yea its riggef,btohqsg
Like for those who took the old exam cycle,btohqsg
But if he failed the interview  means maybe is a skill issue on his part that Also resulted in pw B (eg. Lack of analytical skills)(btw this is not attacking him  just point a possibility),btohqsg
Iirc until a certain year they will still count ur 90 as 90,btohqsg
Sometimes getting a B could be due to many factors outside of their control,btohqsg
Ok break time over time to get back to work,btohqsg
can someone do tldr  im lazy to read,btohqsg
Basically the person say pw unfair cause some schs have higher distinction rates + grading arbitary,btohqsg
