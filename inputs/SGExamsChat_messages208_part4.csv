How is smu in comparison to the 2 Ns,btohqsg
In the end  it doesn't really matter. Unless you are the recipient of some very good scholorship,btohqsg
Bedok you want to take two H3s??,btohqsg
in my eyes if u study hard and can get a scholarship (whether bond-free/bonded) is alr good,btohqsg

They won't allow double H3 in Year 2,btohqsg
Actl can someone who scored a 6 for 0s just go out and answer my questions,btohqsg
if u not aiming bonded scholarships  yes,btohqsg
U have to take one in Year 1 and one in Year 2,btohqsg
Why would you want a trash portfolio,btohqsg

So like nus and ntu scholatship type,btohqsg

i prefer not to be bonded,btohqsg
Actually Bedok which school are you on,btohqsg
some bonded ppl regret cos they see their non-bonded frens offered a 10k/month job they tilt,btohqsg
U must get like near 90 in year 1 if u want Ur appeal to be considered,btohqsg
That's what my senior told me,btohqsg

grooming happens way before jc starts,btohqsg
They dw show us the paper we took,btohqsg
but its cos their other subs dam lit ah,btohqsg
some jcs have an inhouse scholarship program,btohqsg
that selects ppl based on o lvl l1r5,btohqsg
but scholarship selection is based on j2 results performance,btohqsg
so even if u are in the scholar program  but u suck at j2 exams  u wont be selected to apply for uni scholarships,btohqsg
I got invited for USP   shld I apply,btohqsg
Im kinda in one they just tell you if got nice events to go for to boost your chances,btohqsg
So you can still apply  just not through the JC?,btohqsg

No choice  u have to ask around. Form this buddyship with ur classmates cos it benefits them too,btohqsg
Eh but is retaking o levels,btohqsg
Or is just going to JC better,btohqsg
