hello all  understand that most is using Amaze/Instarem + Citi Rewards atm. However i'm unable to apply Citi Rewards due to my credit limit etc. Any good alternatives to combo Amaze/Instarem for cashback ? I'm a cashback person so i'm looking for good cashback alternatives since the old strategy of using UOB AMEX + Grabpay (no more grabpoints) isn't so great anymore.,btohqsg
hi all  can i check for uob aboslute cashback  does topping up directly to grabpay counts as eligible transaction? looking to clock the $1 000 for 2 months for the $300 cash credit,btohqsg
Doubt it. Do download the T&C on uob absolute website for this promotion. It says 6540 - stored value card purchase/load is excluded.,btohqsg
what u spend on and how much in a month?,btohqsg
6% cash back only for simply go and fast food and coffee shop isn't it,btohqsg
groceries at NTUC/Cold Storage  Dining at Hawker/Cafes/Restaurants (also use Shopback Pay)  Buying Bread  Buying ebooks  Internet Bill  Electricity/Power Bill  Mobile Bills  Taking Taxis  Internet Shopping on Lazada or Shoppee. Within $800 to 1.5k. My previous combo was use 1) UOB EVOL and 2) GrabCard + UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX.,btohqsg
yes i did  it seems so.. as per (iii) Balance and/or funds transfers;  thanks bro,btohqsg
Think they got put internet payment to Netflix example,btohqsg
So I don't know if this kind of payment to online purchase is consider their MCC?,btohqsg
nope  this card only award for transactions at specific merchants,btohqsg
Oh so this is only for these they specify not mcc,btohqsg
No charge but subjected to the fx diff,btohqsg
I think you can explore a combination of maybank f&f and hsbc revolution. Maybank f&f need to hit $800 min spend per month  hsbc revo no min spend. Need to see which MCCs you are spending on and optimize. Maybank f&f can link to instarem amaze.,btohqsg
I hear from other YouTubers that you can buy n sell the share within 30 days and still qualify for the bonus...,btohqsg
Best to check with webull sg for confirmation...,btohqsg
Withdraw using linked credit card? Wad mcc will it be?,btohqsg
Not sure. Haven’t tried. This new feature just came out few days ago,btohqsg
2% fee though. Is it worth it?,btohqsg
You have to withdraw from your Amaze wallet.,btohqsg
Best to empty the account on the last day so the account will be back to zero for the 1st of the coming month,btohqsg
Anyone having problem logging in to amaze app?,btohqsg
Can anyone confirm this?The website states no spend exclusion.,btohqsg
I'm looking to purchase an engagement ring around 2.5k  the best cash back card to use for this would be UOB one at 3.3% cash back minimum  is it?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if Peppermint buffet at ParkRoyal is under MCC code for restaurant or hotel?,btohqsg
Have anyone received $5 cash back for Amex purchases for dec for utilities   online shop and telco?,btohqsg
Hi all! Is there an alternative solution to grab pay after the nerf? Or yall still gonna using grab pay?,btohqsg
Restaurant under hotel usually is hotel mcc,btohqsg
also  it's 3.33% only if you spend exactly $2000 for the 3 consecutive months.,btohqsg
I see  ok I get it. So if I spend 500 1000 2000. I will get 500 at 3.33% only,btohqsg
the 3 consecutive months also need to follow your account and not every 3 consecutive months.,btohqsg
yes and if you accidentally miscalculate  BBQ lor.,btohqsg
note cycle might not start on 1st of the month. check your billing cycle. also need to check which month the 3 months start to count. mine is Sep  Oct  Dec. so if charge Dec  Jan  Feb 2k but Mar charge 0  it's zero and BBQ lor.,btohqsg
no prob. I have been utilising the card so quite familiar. the cashback was much better. next year I changing strategy.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may I ask if any invested in SG bank stock? Is it better than saving in FD/SGS/SSB?,btohqsg
Which strategy you going to adopt?,btohqsg
hi all  for hotel bookings on agoda orbooking.com  do you recommend i swipe the DBSWWMC to earn 4mpd?I have the HSBC revolution but afraid i might’ve reached the $1000 spending this month.TIA!,btohqsg
I used Amex  got 3% cash back for the first 5k,btohqsg
Yeap  I got some voucher as well for new sign ups,btohqsg
I don’t have that card  it’s too late for now haha. Planing to propose on 1st jan,btohqsg
I did. I will rather use either Revolut/Wise and withdraw my SGD 350 equiv from fee free ATMs (plenty of them in Europe  America and other places)  or think about partner ATMs: Westpac ATMs in Australia for farmer market shopping (Westpac and DBS-POSB have a longstanding partnership)  UOB in Thailand and so on,btohqsg
anyone knows if UOB preferred platinum visa is see pay date or post date?,btohqsg
Im assuming the item is considered a luxury good. Can use the CIMB World MC which gets you 2%. Then use UOB Abs to pay via GPMC which gets you another 1.7%. Total 3.7% cb. Now also got CIMB Xmas sign up offers.,btohqsg
Make sure you check if got mall promos,btohqsg
Wow  will keep this in tab for the next purchase. Thx ☺️,btohqsg
My understanding is posting date in calendar month.Say I want to get a new red shirt for LNY on 31 DecTransaction posts 2 Jan or thereaboutsIt will be counted for January bonus points cap.,btohqsg
i see  so the limit of 1110 per month is transaction date?,btohqsg
Not really. For UOB PPV it is posting date of calendar month.Not to complicate things but my understanding Of UOB VS is  it's posting date of statement month.Trust and OCBC: Posting date of calendar month.DBS: Transaction date of calendar month.,btohqsg
Can I know Citibank Rewards is under which?,btohqsg
The left one - points. ThankYou Points.,btohqsg
1 month max bonus is 9000 points.. equally to $20 dollars?,btohqsg
