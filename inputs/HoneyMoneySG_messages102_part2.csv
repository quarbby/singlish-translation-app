Hi experts  currently in the market  except for UOB Lady's (travel category selected) and DBS WWMC  are there any other good credit cards for travel?My understanding is still HSBC Revolution  except for MCC 4722 and 7011. For these two MCCs  I guess the best way to earn miles would be to use either Citi Premiermiles or UOB PRVI?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows what is korea CU convenience store MCC?,btohqsg
Lady card can use for Agoda ? Under which cat.,btohqsg
Anyone has the link for the category,btohqsg
I spend at hongdae with amaze and it show as 5331  maybe it is depend on the store coz franchise?,btohqsg
But weird that convenience store fall under grocery mcc,btohqsg
I checked emart and cu. All 5411 groceries for me.,btohqsg
Weird both cu to me is 5331  only 7 eleven is 5411,btohqsg
Play safe use amaze plus empty wallet to test first.,btohqsg
I think is store dependent  coz i have 7 eleven on 5411 and 5331  thus i always use amaze with citi reward for these kind of unsure transaction lol,btohqsg
link the amaze card to wallet feature. then try to do payment. payment will fail due to insufficient funds (assumption). hereafter  you can see the MCC code before correctly making payment with the desired card.,btohqsg
So i should try this out at every store? If wallet insufficient funds  they wont charge to the credit card right?,btohqsg
Hmm. So far which card can use for hospital 8062?,btohqsg
Then u will see staff give u black face lol,btohqsg
Ya siaüòÇ but do yall rly do this at every store?,btohqsg
