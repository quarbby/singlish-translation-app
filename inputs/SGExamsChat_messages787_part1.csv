If you get sentenced to more than 6 years in prison in Singapore and it's a major crime not petty crime. You will never leave the prison system. Drugs are considered petty crimes within the prison system.Because every 6 years you will be evaluated on your behaviour. If you see still deemed a danger which abusers/killers/deviants all will always be deemed. You will never be let out of the prison system.This policy applied in countries like Norway and Switzerland is what gives these countries the title of safest countries in the world.More often than not it's not about the severity of punishments but rather the frequency of retention and release in the prison system.,btohqsg
