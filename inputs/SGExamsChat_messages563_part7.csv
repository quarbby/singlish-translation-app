Guys anyone else got 85++?? ü§™ü§™,btohqsg
q common if u see in the other chat,btohqsg
I said it as a joke,btohqsg
I misunderstood the above graph  thought it was to collate all the points. Didn't know the final amount at December is meant to be the collated kWh after all 12 months,btohqsg
The thing is the last question the graph is pretty unclear,btohqsg
The person is just stating out why D is the best choice as D uses least number of Panels,btohqsg
He mentioned at his concluding statement saying that he would choose D for what reason,btohqsg
But you need to prove that D is the least number of Panels  hence the table should be shown,btohqsg
o levels results also as impt as gpa/rp,btohqsg
with o level result u can have a choice what to do next,btohqsg
was it just me or the phrasing for the scale question was hella weird,btohqsg
and the EWOS sign on contract formüòÅ,btohqsg
but tbh ah if u cannot handle o lvl den poly/jc gonna be way tough,btohqsg
but say real those taking o lvls   focus on the rest,btohqsg
what is done cannot be undone,btohqsg
better then signing on to mcdonalds,btohqsg
after poly u shud sign on too,btohqsg
u should sign on during y1s1 of poly,btohqsg
to max out your sign on bonus,btohqsg
adf means a dumb fk bro,btohqsg
mr lourdes dcc helped me get a b3 in maths,btohqsg
if everyone dies no one dies,btohqsg
My portfolio im making for my module...,btohqsg
if only u fail  is a you problem  if everybody fail den is the teacher's fault,btohqsg
just think of it that way,btohqsg
they gonna answer for it if whole sg cohort flunk their maths paper,btohqsg
Atp no hope alr for Os,btohqsg
Like i rlly dk whats my fate all the paper super rabak imo ive never felt so shit abt exams,btohqsg
can you tell me bellcurve is gonna be low,btohqsg
josh i saw a lot of ppl on reddit saying paper saying it‚Äôs hard tho,btohqsg
i hope my b3 becomes an A2 or smthg,btohqsg
I really really want to pass,btohqsg
i swear sia if i fail any subject,btohqsg
Got an equal amount say easy also,btohqsg
And the comments is like 600-1000 ppl?,btohqsg
Not enough to determine the difficulty Ygwim,btohqsg
the most vocal ones are the people with grievances,btohqsg
The ppl who do well prolly don‚Äôt even care about the Reddit,btohqsg
or they go just to have fun reading,btohqsg
I think i might js straightaway apply ite if thats possible,btohqsg
every paper according to reddit is hard as fuck,btohqsg
Yeah  reddit is for those that just wants to find comfort for their mistakes tbvh. Sadly it's the reality  those that are good at the subjects will just focus on doing the next paper and not go to reddit to find the answers,btohqsg
like if i were doing o levels rn,btohqsg
i‚Äôd straight up avoid reading the threads,btohqsg
Unless if i rlly try v hard for the next few papers,btohqsg
you should be trying very hard either way,btohqsg
Then i think i can rlly do better for next few papers and rlly rlly push myself and make the last few shots my best one,btohqsg
i cant relate to reddit alr...been ghosting that platform for like a month or two,btohqsg
Bruh how have they not caught this guy,btohqsg
every year this timing same thing,btohqsg
