"DBS puts ' hold' call on Genting Singapore under review  citing higher-than-expected $6.8 bil capex planGenting Singapore' s $6.8 billion expansion spend  announced by the company on Nov 10  far exceeds the $5 - $5.5 billion capex projected by DBS Group Research.In its Nov 11 note  DBS acknowledges that Genting Singapore G13 0.00% has the financial capability to support this investment through its strong net cash position of more than $3 billion and robust cash flow generation.However  DBS believes this could negatively impact the company&rsquo s capacity for capital distribution to shareholders.According to DBS  which describes the increase in capex as "" alarming""   Genting Singapore has yet to alleviate concerns that the returns from its planned expansion will be relatively modest compared to its historical return on capital.As such  despite its 3QFY2023 earnings also announced on Nov 10 has exceeded expectations  the market may view this update negatively  says DBS  which has put its "" hold"" call and $1 target price under review.",btohqsg
