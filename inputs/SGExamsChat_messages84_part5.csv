Yup sometimes within a school even lecturers dun encourage us to share or exchange notes with neighbouring classes,btohqsg
my current chem notes dont have copyright i think,btohqsg
School notes copyrighted so better not,btohqsg
My physics lecturer said he took time to prepare the notes,btohqsg
back in J1 i was enthu and took my own notes,btohqsg
After awhile it is too much manual labour,btohqsg
i realised sch notes i read thru can rmber alr,btohqsg
Sad truth about most who make notes is that most copy the notes/textbook content,btohqsg
I tend to make it more condensed,btohqsg
ofc they take references from other books,btohqsg
sec sch onli history got lecture i tot,btohqsg
SS is jus memorise format only,btohqsg
SRQ depends on ur general knowledge and language skill,btohqsg

Hi friends  I have created this new GP Telegram Channel üòÅ It's to share tips for GP and also address some FAQ. This is the link:https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEhni39Ja1zq9yjSZQThe idea is that it can become a daily dose of GP and hopefully act as your GP companion in your learning journey for A Levels! There are a lot of resources out there that focus on news and content but not enuf on Skills. It's difficult to learn skills by yourself  so hopefully this app could help you out with that.In this period of circuit breaker  I have friends and juniors who tell me that they struggle with HBL. As such  I designed this app to make it convenient to receive tips and ask questions about GP.I have personally received a lot of free help back when I was a student (not too long ago üôÉ) and I'm really really thankful for that. Now that I'm in a position to share  I just wanna give back to the community and share some of my knowledge too.All these is completely free so please tell anyone you know who's studying GP to also join. If you're doing O Levels  some of the tips and resources may also be helpful for you üôÇPlease subscribe to the channel  and get others to join too. The more we have  the richer our pool of knowledge will be  and it will hopefully be beneficial for all üòÅ It will officially start next week but meanwhile check out some of the stuff that's already there!,btohqsg
sounds like it's for a good cause but I don't know if advertising is allowed here,btohqsg
the world is your GP textbook,btohqsg
This is very very true üòÅ,btohqsg
tho most of the news readily available nowadays has to do with covid,btohqsg
"this message gives off big ""school of hard knocks is my university on facebook"" boomer vibes",btohqsg
Interestingly  COVID itself links to many themes in GP so it's definitely an issue to focus on. It links to health  politics and governance  the promise of tech  the news that goes online  the art done to encourage people in this trying time  the impact on the environment etc,btohqsg
I prefer the variants like North Korea executes covid-19 patient,btohqsg
Point of modern technology is to not live through hard times though,btohqsg
no it just links to 'I haven't heard anyone ask for an apology',btohqsg
i havent seen any of the migrant workers complain to me in person before,btohqsg
Must mean I owe them nothing,btohqsg
can someone give me my MR2 minister grade yet?,btohqsg
It's both hilarious and incredibly concerning that a MP is capable of such reasoning,btohqsg
reset your world! i heard there are several ways to do it,btohqsg
According to some Japanese documentaries  it is possible to do so by getting hit by a car,btohqsg
Theres an american source that says the car must be driven by the wife of the man whom you are cheating with on,btohqsg
If hit =true & object = ‚Äúcar‚Äù & fatality = true {Reset.player = trueVar monis = 0Var brain = 100Return monis brain player},btohqsg
Half of everything you say to me is a Gatsby reference,btohqsg
Well one of these documentaries got uploaded to neetflix recently,btohqsg
God must be a real boring person if he exists... why our lives don't have truck-kun,btohqsg
Reminds me of that controverial documentory,btohqsg
I would watch it on TV if no one else was at home,btohqsg
Konosuba's comedy doesn't get me for some reason,btohqsg
U can come over at my home,btohqsg

maybe Re Zero is just the superior documentary,btohqsg
Gwenyth Paltrow? She's all kinds of fucked up,btohqsg
Ok weebs  I‚Äôm going to go watch manly American show,btohqsg
