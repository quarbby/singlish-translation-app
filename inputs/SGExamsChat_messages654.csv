It's just one of the more commonly mainstream tuition centres back then man,btohqsg

What kind of Asian are you,btohqsg
i only knew about kumo bc my sis taught there,btohqsg
i mean i didnt. i went other tuition place,btohqsg
but yr imo 42 points so he don't need kumon,btohqsg
my family didn't care much about these things,btohqsg
only tuition i went for was HCL,btohqsg
kumon is more enrichment than tuition,btohqsg

At some point I had it on,btohqsg
Then down the line it disappeared,btohqsg
Get the mouthwash issued by polyclinic,btohqsg
U went to which jc? Oof loll,btohqsg
ofc the worst offending chirstian JC,btohqsg
Apparently a unit decided to simulate total defence food rations yest by eating combat rations,btohqsg
Then the fellas came by to eat the remainders of the buffet😂,btohqsg
Bro if that happens to me I happy bro,btohqsg
If I no electricity I cannot do work,btohqsg
The most they can do to us is make us eat out rations or combat rations,btohqsg
i want to take pic with mikannie,btohqsg
from what i see ntu gonna have simulated building evacuations from 26 to 29 feb  a week when a lot of ppl are having midterms…,btohqsg
imagine doing exam midway suddenly emergency evacuation,btohqsg
plus the econs cohort im in cannot be trusted lol. ppl cheated in last sem’s microecons midterms and ntu did nothing about it. so imagine u evacuate during exam then people come out confirm will discuss answers lol,btohqsg
maybe they did it for TikTok. sajc TikTok jc mah,btohqsg
evacuation during exam and its not even like real emergency 😭,btohqsg
Eh dhs having cshe fair in may i think,btohqsg

i found some link on google,btohqsg
everyone in lan shop during the 2006 era played it,btohqsg
this is my tactic to go harvard for postdoc,btohqsg

all physicists eventually turn into mathematicians or computer scientists anyway,btohqsg

i only went to a lan twice before lol,btohqsg
im quite sure i got watched people play the first few versions of CS HAHAH,btohqsg
i nvr go lan b4. im nt the hardcore gaming type,btohqsg
im the hardcore gamer on the GC😎,btohqsg

my flappy bird highscore on GC was higher than on my phone,btohqsg
what abt not even booking in,btohqsg
I see some scouts and a lot of gorl guides in tampines,btohqsg
2 years of adventure camp? make it 20,btohqsg
eh later the SAJC one sia HAHAHHA,btohqsg
mikan what did you do at ur booth,btohqsg
hi korkor how was ur day,btohqsg
You can celebrate cny with us,btohqsg
other than explaining what the various medic stuff do,btohqsg
just like how poland got invaded by nazi,btohqsg
we got invaded by the japanese,btohqsg
mikan if you come to dhs ping me i go and take pic with u,btohqsg
but actl i am super recognisable lol,btohqsg
when yall shower in bmt  sandals on or off,btohqsg
never heard of someone who wear sandals while showering,btohqsg
i got do with sandal bef and,btohqsg
no amt of copium is enuf for u,btohqsg

well i shower at medical centre everyday and only like max 5 ppl shower there lol,btohqsg
and confirm got people wank there also,btohqsg
im glad i didn't have to experience,btohqsg
that makes u think im a simp,btohqsg
WHY TF DO YALL THINK IM A MATCHA SIMP,btohqsg
LIKE HOW THIS@LERMONBOITHINK I 831 835 SIMP,btohqsg
CB I GETTING SLANDERED LEFT RIGHT UP DOWN FRONT BACK,btohqsg
$3k is now a low wage,btohqsg
Why the LifeSG credits given out so late wth,btohqsg
it's time to increase my fees further 🙈,btohqsg
they got promoted to low income,btohqsg
$3.3k was starting pay for 1st class honours engineers in private companies,btohqsg
but $4k for engineers in dsta,btohqsg
during my time as fresh grad,btohqsg
How long ago was that sia,btohqsg
I heard dsta starting 6k few years ago,btohqsg
as in I dunno market rate now,btohqsg
inflation makes me feel shortchanged 😭,btohqsg
only thing don't feel shortchanged is I got my flat early,btohqsg
if i put in US shares it would have doubled,btohqsg
I didn't know US companies enough,btohqsg
luckily I put heavy into Keppel Corp,btohqsg
now can't grow. My monthly expenditure is high,btohqsg
I was estimating at current expenditure  I can survive only 100 months,btohqsg
that's my savings. My wife has almost an equivalent so maybe another 8 yrs,btohqsg
cannot compare. Your dad older and back when he first started  salaries were even lower,btohqsg
so your dad is more power,btohqsg
2010 I got my 5 rm flat at Sengkang West for 325k,btohqsg
bro like sometimes looking at the money  it makes me wanna do illegal things,btohqsg
I had a chance of EC for 770k  which would have ballooned to 1.5m,btohqsg
but I went for HDB which is at most 580k 😭,btohqsg
then again  give and take  the stress level of paying for the EC would have been different,btohqsg
I probably would have loved my job and not quit,btohqsg
770k is about 10+ yrs fresh grad income?,btohqsg
the only I'm lucky was I move in with in laws and rent out the flat. That rental plus dividend income enough to pay for all expenses at the moment,btohqsg
so I can save my work income for now  at least for 2024  to buy the next car in 2025,btohqsg
factoring in 13 month + bonus + employer cpf,btohqsg
depends on the type of courses,btohqsg
I ever interviewed a tutor. I rejected based on the online course on the resume. Some free stuff or something  can't really remember.It felt like the tutor tried too hard to add to resume and red flags went off,btohqsg
idk my teacher say just add,btohqsg
not that it matters. That person can easily find students so doesn't affect generally,btohqsg
cause like it shows that you have initiatives to learn ?,btohqsg
i think as a student  worth to put. That person is middle aged  so different,btohqsg
sure. Mostly I also don't know but I can take a look,btohqsg
i did online course halfway then i didnt complete it 😭,btohqsg
Better then mine thats for sure,btohqsg
Oh btw just curious for coursera do you need to pay the 50 dollar for it to count,btohqsg
Or dont need pay can just add to the linkedin,btohqsg
looked through. The summary feels off but can't put a finger to it,btohqsg
So you got the cert la,btohqsg
apart from it I think ok,btohqsg
If you didnt get the cert and you put in the linkedin,btohqsg
good enough. Better than mine haha,btohqsg
I was a good for nothing,btohqsg
it's more of when you get older  you need to be more selective of what stuff you include that's relevant,btohqsg
bc by right you should have more experience,btohqsg
I know someone who put PE rep in the linkedin,btohqsg
ya but ur not actually affected right,btohqsg
need to be careful10 yrs experiencevs10 times of 1 yr experience,btohqsg
Actl i got a pic wait,btohqsg
i mean at that point linkedin matters fuck all,btohqsg
fill up for the sake of filling only,btohqsg
10 yrs experience as cashiervs 1 yr experience as cashiernot too much a difference tbh,btohqsg
matcha oi what you saying 💀,btohqsg
just I dunno what's the point of the summary,btohqsg
you are a student. Wide experience and exposure feels better on first look,btohqsg
ok the summary is very fluff,btohqsg
you don't really need a summary,btohqsg
no one knows what will happen in the future,btohqsg
and you will still lose to people with powerful parental connections no matter what you do,btohqsg
but it doesn't mean you should not do what you are currently doing,btohqsg
some progress are made over generationssome over a single generation,btohqsg
a summary CAN be useful but that's contingent on having stuff to put on it,btohqsg
right now you don't have the experience to do that,btohqsg
"Actually right when they are interviewing you and they say ""Tell me about urself"" what do you say",btohqsg
Is it ur supposed to say a hook,btohqsg
like for me  I'm very lucky my parents don't need me to support them. Yet they supported me big during my educational years.That itself helps a lot.,btohqsg
could go even more negative in the thinking.You may even get years of work experience and eventually work under someone with no experience,btohqsg
it's ok i'll hire yall next time,btohqsg
but like I said  it doesn't mean you should stop what you are doing and 躺平,btohqsg
Progress takes time. Some faster some slower.,btohqsg
means just continue and don't think,btohqsg
"you can't stop doing just because you're afraid you're gonna ""fail"" in your own books",btohqsg
another way to put itare u going to stop investing because you scared you may lose money?,btohqsg
or your 3 years of investing experience lost to someone noob who blindly put into Nvidia early and make 1000%,btohqsg
like how people are complaining why cpf gives 4% when Temasek Holdings earn so much more,btohqsg
it's almost petty in a way LOL,btohqsg
empty vessels make the most noise. The others who know just keep quiet,btohqsg
actually there are many who are not very good at numbersbut their high income more than made up for it,btohqsg
eg my sis  she doesn't invest. She and husband just have high income and went for EC. Bought 980k  neighbour just sold at 1.7m,btohqsg
without any actual investing  their assets up by 700k,btohqsg
then there's the $$ in cpf due to their high income. Easily can retire upon age 60,btohqsg
want to sell any of these financial instruments to them to tell them about retirement?,btohqsg
I don't have much in SA  so heck it,btohqsg
I made quite a fair bit of mistakes and still can average near 5% including SSBs  so I'm quite happy already,btohqsg
need more time to digest and think through,btohqsg
How exactly does this affect people?,btohqsg
Why wouldn’t people just buy houses with their CPF money and liquidate it by selling it off?,btohqsg
Do something else with that money then  whatever that gives a comparable yield,btohqsg
I’ve read that you’ll only be allowed to withdraw funds partially tho,btohqsg
guys can recruiters check criminal record via singpass,btohqsg
some recruiter guy send me singpass login link saying he need check if i gt criminal record,btohqsg
What are yall opinions on saizerya food,btohqsg
i heard that govt ask for ur psle score 💀,btohqsg
what kind of link is it btw,btohqsg
govt stuff will ask for everything,btohqsg
it may not even matter but it's their standard,btohqsg
ya i agree its a good price but then ofc you cant expect michelin star food. 5.90 for pasta is quite good though,btohqsg
depends on what you're applying for,btohqsg
if i'm applying for a job idt anything before uni is gonna matter lol,btohqsg
itd be very sad if someone reject from govt scholarship because of psle scores,btohqsg
i not being racist but this guy got angmoh face w chinese surname which made it even worse,btohqsg
Yes but are you actually affected,btohqsg
but any if yall got like job reccos that can SIT DOWN,btohqsg
There is demand for chinese teachers,btohqsg
i actually cant find any tho,btohqsg
wait k what are ur qualifications,btohqsg
write a book about your struggles,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure some banks do offer that  you can find 3.0% PA ones  and with that kind of money  4.0 and above is not a long shot (I could just be talking shit),btohqsg
everyone here have higher qualifications than me (its a fact btw im not trolling),btohqsg
im just using my sister telegram,btohqsg
yours sch 5 not 5 years old,btohqsg
IM ACTL SO DESPERATE TO FIND A JOB THAT ALLOWS ME TO HAVE NAIL EXTENSIONS,btohqsg
ive been holding myself back cuz i work in f&b,btohqsg
I'm actly 3   it's just I'm a child prodigy that's why I'm able to even talk to ppl not ard my age,btohqsg
actually looking at how singpass API works this looks legit but it's ok if you'd wanna play it safe,btohqsg
idt they can know my criminal records via singpass,btohqsg
HUH. idt psle score matters after u get ur gce results lol,btohqsg
my experience is that only one education level down matters,btohqsg
so if you're applying for uni scholarship  then anything below jc is irrelevant,btohqsg
you can use singpass to login to SPF e services,btohqsg
ahh yea i was saying in general. u special,btohqsg
eh my teacher said undergrad scholarships look at sec3 - jc but more emphasid on jc part,btohqsg
cause like the us unis also look at sec 3 to jc,btohqsg
it's ok  you wont be those that finish jc with only psle,btohqsg
You seem to be very confident in my abilities to pass alvls,btohqsg
that's why see you lor. the link is actually a proper singpass link and not everyone can just generate it to access this type of secure info,btohqsg
plus it's a link that expires after a few mins,btohqsg
jiejie  the fact that you in dhs  means you are in rather safe hands alr,btohqsg
Dhs median student should be like 85rp,btohqsg
Even if you’re just average in your sch ur result would still be pretty good,btohqsg
Mikan u added me to contact as what,btohqsg
I can see ur phone number 💀,btohqsg
i just decided to show my number to everyone,btohqsg
i think y5y6 more impt la,btohqsg
if everyone in this chat calls once,btohqsg
damn taking it to the dm,btohqsg
he need to change number alr,btohqsg
i guess maybe you can think of it as them looking at last 4 years lol,btohqsg
like if i applied for a mid term undergrad scholarship they'd look at jc + my current undergrad stuff,btohqsg
yea this but maybe more emphasis on last two lor. heard that us unis also put more emphasis on the junior year,btohqsg
which is like y5 or jc1,btohqsg
yall think i even get notif from yall calling,btohqsg
also even when i applied for postgrad scholarship with astar  they also asked me for everything from psle,btohqsg
actl the purpose of the psle is to verify that you arent liar or smth right,btohqsg
my a level results were disastrous and they still put me through to final round,btohqsg
why do they need it for postgrad tho,btohqsg
no clue but who tf would lie about psle,btohqsg
it's just how government applications work,btohqsg
their centralised portal has the general details,btohqsg
i stay in the east for 10 years nig,btohqsg
i would say je but that one the top is red so,btohqsg
kuro why you steal my fav pack,btohqsg
i was there 12 hours ago,btohqsg
I'm Mimir  the smartest man alive! Are you friends with@neonpotassiumoxide?,btohqsg
I heard she has a GPA of 4.92!,btohqsg
"ok this guy from my pri sch lets call him johnJohn  was rude and arrogant and openly homophobic. like he will insult lgbt ppl a lot.he calls guys who listen to bts and kpop ""gay""   and also mocks them for their hobbies la he also have superiority complex. my friends and i didnt like him. he was aiming for hci.so after psle  his mom talk to my mom  his mom say john got 243 but his choices were hci  vs and a express (olvl) only sch i think  then he got posted to a 188 cop school because he didnt hit cop for all 3. then his mom was complaining to my mom about having to appeali went to dhs and was talking with my classmate then he was like ""matcha dyk john from ur pri sch""me: yes why lehhim:ohh  cause he in my tuition mah  then he tell us he got 268 but i think he is capping lehme: err...",btohqsg
@kohsyanthere you have ppl who lie about psle,btohqsg
i didnt like him cause like i had this guy friend who liked bts and kdramas then john will constantly call my friend gay and stuff in insulting ways,btohqsg
this one car is like 5.6 million triangles btw,btohqsg
I rmb my pri sch got some guy flexing abt the fact he take hcl,btohqsg
ok i stand corrected but like at your age i can see it,btohqsg
it's like people after jc lying about rp,btohqsg
but that's not the same as lying on a government app LOL,btohqsg
i posted this on the discord,btohqsg
i used to do that but i'm not stupid enough to lie on applications,btohqsg
"""wow imagine thinking 243 is a bad psle score  must be sad""",btohqsg
??? i didnt even say that bruh,btohqsg
that server is filled with people with inferiority complex,btohqsg
So did he manage to appeal into a higher cop sch or he stayed in the 188 one,btohqsg
but putting all his eggs into such schs is stupid,btohqsg
i think he appealed somewhere that wasnt the sch he was assigned to but idk the cop of that sch,btohqsg
idk last time he followed my y1y2 class insta lol,btohqsg
that's why i just lump the discord as a whole together,btohqsg
voice message or i type out,btohqsg
How can it be that he appealed into a sch that he didn’t meet the cop though,btohqsg
inferiority complex. and the kind that need to bring others down bc they don't wanna feel inferior,btohqsg
Hopefully he stayed in the 188 one cos serves him right for being stoobid,btohqsg
Man istg those schs stressful asf,btohqsg
243 is below the cop though,btohqsg
i want him to try coming after me,btohqsg
he didnt  i think he went to to a neighbourhood school with higher cop,btohqsg
he's exactly the kind of person i'd wanna snap at,btohqsg
the express only schs i was referring to were like anglican high  crescent girls  cchm etc,btohqsg
Sad that they accepted his appeal,btohqsg
They should’ve said since their sch wasn’t in any of his choices they won’t consider,btohqsg
but im sure he didnt go to those,btohqsg
i mean you know me well enough that i have a line between being logical in arguing,btohqsg
"i said in the discord that it was a bad decision to only put 3 schs none of which were safetiesthen the person who said ""so sad that you think 243 is a bad score"" was like ""but its possible that he didnt know that you should apply to schools that you hit the cop of"" and that he was a 12 yo kid so he didnt know better",btohqsg
i think his parents also a bit delusional,btohqsg
like his mom also quite arrogant type,btohqsg
i mean my first choice was q delulu,btohqsg
i can't comment on that part la,btohqsg
ok tbf the teacher told him to be realistic when he said he wanted to go hci 💀💀,btohqsg
like if you don't even bother making sure your kid puts smth safer,btohqsg
like my first choice was plmgs i think,btohqsg
like our teachers alr told us to put safety schs,btohqsg
i shld go back to my maths assignment,btohqsg
anyway hopefully the person learn the lesson and applied wisely for jae,btohqsg
I heard someone who messed up their Jc choices  and posted to yi got that same reply during appeals on Reddit (idk if true or not),btohqsg
me too but im too tired today,btohqsg
might be getting my first U,btohqsg
I’m surprised bus parents didn’t check his application on the portal,btohqsg
those annoying goofy ass bank qns,btohqsg
btw my school has gp bridging lessons for jae  sounds interesting,btohqsg
if i recall correctly his parents were okay with it and saw him put the choices,btohqsg
then his mom was complaining to my mom why hci dowan him,btohqsg
I think he got his attitude from his parents,btohqsg
“All kids deserve parents but not all parents deserve kids”,btohqsg
she will pretend to be nice but its kind of condescending,btohqsg
and she also the type that think the son can do no wrong,btohqsg
Think this applies for their family lol,btohqsg
and then theres my parents whos like,btohqsg
for psle posting my first choice was dhs the rest i just put what my parents wanted me to put,btohqsg
my mom: you actually study in uni? first time see you study sia,btohqsg
she was right but it still hurt,btohqsg
Isn’t GP a new subject for all,btohqsg
good qn ! i dont know,btohqsg
maybe i ask the teacher on monday,btohqsg
I rmbr my chs ip friend in sec 1 was learning sec 3 o level physics staff in class,btohqsg
I mean stuff like how to read vernier caliber,btohqsg
aint that some shit u learn at s1,btohqsg
havent gotten yet but i think some of my close friends will be in my class,btohqsg
ya i rmb that shit in lower sec sci,btohqsg
Shit I forgot maybe it’s sth else,btohqsg
high chance jst 1 class oso,btohqsg
Or maybe my sch is just bad and doesn’t want to teach us some stuff early,btohqsg
got ppl shouting during breaks and shit lol,btohqsg
cause two of my close friends are like doing bcmx also,btohqsg
do what uw but man at the same time wish u can just stfu,btohqsg
maybe got a lot of people with HCL who need it heh,btohqsg
what does hcl have to do with gp bridging,btohqsg
bro prolly only read the first half or smth,btohqsg
one is chi one is eng LOL,btohqsg
or like those who wan contribute but dk wats gg on so they anyhow wack anyt,btohqsg
isn't it obvious? Their Eng is not as good?,btohqsg
you're applying being good at hcl means not good at english?,btohqsg
can you even make it pass this sem,btohqsg
how bad is this sem for u tho,btohqsg
ik some1 a1 chi c6 eng but eng is her 2nd lang,btohqsg
people can be good at language skills in general  can be good at english only  chinese only,btohqsg
can be good at essay stuff,btohqsg
also i wrote gp bridging forJAEstudents leh,btohqsg
This assumption implies that all jae students take hcl which is already a false claim,btohqsg
