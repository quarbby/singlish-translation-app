i would rather study at home coz i lazy get myself out of the house,btohqsg
but need those quieter ones leh,btohqsg

this actually reminds me of i think during A levels study break  there was one day i legit woke up at 11am and luckily my dad woke me up  and i got so angry with myself and then i rushed my breakfast and went to study,btohqsg

i regretted pushing hard at A levels and not enjoying the good school life,btohqsg
i recently went to study once at starbucks cause i got starbucks gift card and wow. $10 gift card can cover 1 large drink only ah haha,btohqsg
only reason i don’t like cafe is its unhealthy la to drink those all the time,btohqsg

"always in bed when ""studying"" for a lvl",btohqsg
