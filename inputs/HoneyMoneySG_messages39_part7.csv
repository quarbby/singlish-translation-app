Is there any new promotions for ocbc cc cards for new sign up? Saw the previous one expired on 2 April..,btohqsg
Yes it covers. I called up uob Hotline in March and confirmed with the phone banking staff.,btohqsg
Typically  after a year an individual cancels a service  he or she would be considered as a new customer. For the exact 'duration'  good to confirm as it differs from bank to bank and subject to change without notice.,btohqsg
Hello everyone   I‚Äôm wondering how long till I get the sms for HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme,btohqsg
So I transferred x5 5sgd out of my account and deposit 2k,btohqsg
How to check how much spend limit left to use before hitting Grab $30k limit?,btohqsg
When you‚Äôre at ~90% there will be a notice message in the interface,btohqsg
Any credit card recommendations for booking airline tickets,btohqsg
Open grab app -> finance -> grab pay wallet -> spend and balance limit,btohqsg
No sms for fast x5 but have a sms for joining HSBC EGA promo -=========HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.=======Take note you can only participate once every 4 months promo  correct me if I am wrong‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Alright I just joined the ega promo for this month,btohqsg
So I just need to park my money there for 4 months then withdraw in 1 August ? To reset my balance to 0 then join again in September‚Ä¶ not sure about the once every 4 months part,btohqsg
My view - With the fluid interest rates situation  we just have to wait and see how things go after 4 months,btohqsg
But likely interest rates will stay higher for longer. However  the banks‚Äô offers are dependent on their liquidity requirements,btohqsg
For those who applied for Webull SG account last month  check again if your account is approved now. You will still get the same promo by depositing any amount and get your free lucky spins.,btohqsg
There is no spend and balance option in my apps.Are you using Android?I am using iOS.,btohqsg
I got the SMS for Everyday+ btw. But I got it approx 4 days after meeting the transaction requirements.,btohqsg
If it doesn't show  it simply means you have not crossed the 85/90% of the 30k yet  as mentioned by some bros previously. Only when u cross that limit  the spend/balance option will appear in the app.,btohqsg
Hellos can someone help me to advise on the best credit card for high earners.  I managed to get 120k last yr due to bonuses and doubt i will get that high again.Wanna know which credit card is the best.Currently i saw one was the CIMB infinite cos no annual fees.  Any others for me to see see.  Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Best credit card is based on your lifestyle.U can try Prestige  Vantage  VoyageAlso AMEX Platinum if you can,btohqsg
This best CC for high earners doesn‚Äôt make sense. Rebates are in cashback or miles/points,btohqsg
Yeah  so actually more like best CC for a particular lifestyle. above 120k  the cc earn rate isnt that high  compared to those 4mpd cards  but it comes with other perks. So question is really what type of lifestyle do you have.Also note that the annual fee for these cards usually cannot be waived and are quite high.,btohqsg
Anyone had experience of Atome refund declined in InstaRem?How did you resolve it?,btohqsg
As a holder of such card I can only say it falls back to the need of the card holder. I do agree amex is superb in service and the perks for LD. It will be best card for ppl who wants those however it really not a must to have actually unlike eg Citi cashback for groceries 8% which is basic need. Citi prestige only if you travel and stay in hotel 4 days to unlock the perks.. which I didn‚Äôt so cancelled it after a year,btohqsg
Hey guys stupid questions. For HSBC EGA  giro payments for income tax will yield 1% cash back?,btohqsg
So for EGA  1) Open account  2) Fund it with $2k  3) do 5 fast.. rinse repeat every month and the promo interest is unlocked?,btohqsg
Hi all  going to Korea next week  still worth to use Instarem Amaze + citi rewards vs Youtrip if I'm not playing miles and might not hit minimum spending for 1% Instarem cashback?,btohqsg
If you're looking at exchange rate  Youtrip is slightly better than Instarem,btohqsg
how much ang bao money to give colleague for new born baby? anyone can recommend?,btohqsg
I recently just sign up for gogox energy petrol card . I got to know from the customer service that the MCC they using is via stripe MCC 1520 or mcc 5983 . Just checking if anyone is using their services and if I use DBS WWMC to pay will I get 4mpd ? Thanks üôè,btohqsg
guys  can i ask what mcc 4604 is?,btohqsg
Toastbox and Japanese Casual Restaurants offer available now on AMEX app,btohqsg
https://www.citibank.com/tts/solutions/commercial-cards/assets/docs/govt/Merchant-Category-Codes.pdfI don‚Äôt see any 4604 though   did you get the right mcc ?,btohqsg
thanks  bro. let me check it again.,btohqsg
Any idea how to transfer yen out of dbs account get back sgd to local bank account without incurring the regular currency conversion fee?,btohqsg
Does maybank visa platinum can get cash back?,btohqsg
Yes. $30 for spending $300 a month for 3 months  or $100 for spending $1000 a month for 3 months,btohqsg
Ega since 28 March no cashback ‚Ä¶ any one experiencing the same ?,btohqsg
How much is the ticket. If is within 2k  dbs wmmc  within 1k  HSBC revo. Above then you gotta weigh the the optimal configuration,btohqsg
Those 120k cards are not worth in the miles game. Can't beat those 4mpd. Most of it can't waive annual fee. Not worth to get imo unless going after the perks which has got nothing to do with miles game alr.,btohqsg
120k cards are mostly for airport lounge privileges and some other perks mainly..,btohqsg
I will think vantage and prestige will be a good addition . Due to the free lounge visit ( vantage 10 visit   prestige infinite 1+1) . As for fee   depending on your usage . Vantage have free waiver if you spend 60k a year on the card   not sure about prestige,btohqsg
Depend on your usage and how you use it though . Like for example I have monthly rent that I need to pay   with cardup after 1.79% fee   I still get 0.011 cpm which is decent,btohqsg
Which none of the 4mpd card can beat vantage 1.5mpd,btohqsg

Somehow I have stopped receiving HSBC EGA Everyday Rewards + cashback into my A/C since a week ago. used to be daily as long as I have spending the day prior. Have met the criteria 2k in 5 tnx out. Anyone else facing this issue?,btohqsg
To reduce inflation need to reduce discretionary spending leh. Otherwise inflation will forever be high,btohqsg
