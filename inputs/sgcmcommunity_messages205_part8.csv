Whats ur purpose for getting car? Kid or work? Sedan or suv,btohqsg
Harrier is downright disappointing 4 ppl who value performance. Its low bhp is lol esp 4 an SUV that pretend 2 offer anything close 2 dynamic driving. U step on the gas n feel like u waiting an eternity 4 the car to respond. 0 excitement  0 thrill  sluggish  lethargic n utterly weak. If u looking 4 power  this car is embarrassing. Harrier is a poor excuse for an SUV where competitors r leaving it in the dust with far superior horsepower n performance. Actually It’s built for those who r content with mediocrity,btohqsg
Just normal point a to b for work,btohqsg
I've been happy with a polo 1.2tsi  third owner so far,btohqsg

Check ur budget and shortlist a few then test drive. Some cars have much higher arf and they will cost much more. Its all luck. Doesnt mean jap car u can drive all the way till the end nor conti car will give u problems all the way,btohqsg

@woshiHOMu know what car I’m driving?,btohqsg
I think more for detecting dangerous driving  illegal parking  bus lane and beating of traffic light. I don't think bus camera can detect car speed.,btohqsg
Possibly for autonomous buses in future which require all these data to build AI models.,btohqsg
Can Catch those msia bikes with small or no number plate,btohqsg

Hi guys. Want to seek your quick opinion. Was driving along AYE towards Tuas and was not going any faster than 90km/h and for some reason I was snapped? Other cars around were travelling the same speed as me too,btohqsg
Promo has been updated guys  T&C updated as well too.,btohqsg
If u not speeding don’t need to worry. Sometimes I get snapped but nothing happens too. Probably car behind u or something.,btohqsg
Why u drive this speed at lane 1 🥲,btohqsg
You’re judging my driving just based on  a 3 second video? Cool,btohqsg
