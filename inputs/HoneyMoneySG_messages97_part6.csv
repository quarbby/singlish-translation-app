so u only have 2 uob cards excluding cashback cards?,btohqsg
Uob oneUob visa signatureUob amexUob ppv!!,btohqsg
Here is what I published recently on S&P500https://youtu.be/lvnuh3Ituqw?si=UdAVnbGyQ0YqvfMr,btohqsg
i wld just stick to 2 5 then 1. once u exhausted your 4-6mpd cards then use your general spending ones like citi premier,btohqsg
to me personally cashback cards are not worth it as the benefits lacks behind miles cards by alot,btohqsg
Just worry about the exchange rate. Dk which one better,btohqsg
just use the amaze card combo if u are worried abt that,btohqsg
hence option 1 would be ur first choice,btohqsg
Can I check. Can I use the amaze card thru the app? Like without the physical card? Just tap using hp?Or must add amaze card to Samsung pay or Google pay?,btohqsg
Guaranteed returns 3-4% p.a. or 3-4% profit after 10 years lol.You said savings plan right? Savings plan won't have investment portion.If have investments  usually are ILPs  did you check profits after fees?,btohqsg
Yeap mine is ILP  for endowments then is 3-4% P.A haha,btohqsg
Savings plan you'll pay about 3% more if you switch to monthly. You'll probably end up only break even at 15 years lol.,btohqsg
You will get 2% discount if you pay yearly  but ya true because of the charges  that‚Äôs why I do with ILP  6% dividends and can do 500/month,btohqsg
Don't forget to count in the charges for ILP. Depending on how much and how long you put  you might be charged at least 2-4% p.a. so eventual state  your effective yield may probably be 2% or less p.a.,btohqsg
Yeap thanks haha mine is 1.75% P.A. so abit better. 6% + it‚Äôs growing so still quite ok,btohqsg
That's the only redeeming quality. There's still chance to grow. But even with average 4% p.a. growth  I counted max also 3% p.a. effective yield.,btohqsg
Yeap üëçüëç true  so my effective yield still quite good,btohqsg
Haha with average of 4% then Yeap  mine so far doing ok ba so effective yield about 7-8% after charges  BUT I have only been doing slightly over a year so will continue to monitor,btohqsg
"Remember your charges are not on your premiums but on your total portfolio including ""welcome bonuses""",btohqsg
Yeap counted that too but it‚Äôs ok cause the 6% dividend is also based on total portfolio haha thanks for the reminder,btohqsg
Hi all  are there any other accounts beside ega  for cc bill payments or mortgages or taxes?,btohqsg
I always hear horror stories about ILP. Thanks for sharing your positive story. Mine didnt turn out that great like yours. üëç,btohqsg
ILP is just an inefficient investment vehicle.If the underlying investment made 50%  the ILP COULD still make 40% for example.ILP just cannot win investing by yourself or using a more efficient vehicle. Does not mean CANNOT MAKE MONEYlook at Snack... even that can make money .. LOL,btohqsg
Yeap nothing beats investing yourself!!I mainly use ILP for my Uob acc so I don‚Äôt have to bother about the $500/month spending haha,btohqsg
Does it depends what kind of ILP too?I understand that long ago ILP is lump together with life & investment thus when u get older the investment portion is eaten away by the mortality rates. Also the charges are much higher I previously.But currently  they have reduced charges  limited payment term and full investment only - is it still as bad?,btohqsg
Just inefficient loh..Basically higher fees overall. Think of it as a handicap on your investment. But if bet on the right horse  you can still make money  but the ILP provider takes a share of your profits (WHETHER YOU MAKE MONEY OR NOT).,btohqsg
Depends on insurers and the charges also  if the charges too high then it‚Äôs harder to make money also,btohqsg
but if u see the graph   snack lost money before that,btohqsg
My thoughts. On income funds  if it is managed by the institution themselves (Ex: SG United Fund managed by UOB)  it can be considered as well especially for those who are not financial savvy and still get want to get the benefits.,btohqsg
or best if you look at the very start since inception its losing alot of money,btohqsg
yeah .. but it is not true that ILP cannot make money..JUST HANDICAPPED,btohqsg
"You're better off putting in roboinvestor. The fees are typically lower and some even give ""cashback"" as certain funds usually give commission to advisors  which don't exist when you subscribe directly via roboinvestments.",btohqsg
its like paying $10 to ask someone buy chicken rice for u. u still get to eat it  but u could have bought it on ur own at $4.,btohqsg
yeah handicap especially the higher fees for the fund,btohqsg
You still pay $4.. but you share your chicken with other ppl,btohqsg
oh  and u have to puke out all or part of wat u ate if u decide to stop eating halfway.,btohqsg
Haha no la. You still get to keep what you ate but the rest you give the person who buy for you,btohqsg
i mean the surrender charge for the first 10 years or so. u surrender first 2 year  u get nothing back =\,btohqsg
Oh yes. That's true. Then need to puke out ü§£,btohqsg
hahaha chicken rice example not very appropriate la.. but that's the rough idea,btohqsg
but personally i feel ILP is like forcing yourself to save   its like for those people without discipline,btohqsg
ILP is forcing yourself to become god of wealth lol,btohqsg
i would say its more like u paying people (fees) to force yourself to save üòÇ  Getting rich off ILP   i dont think so,btohqsg
Suddenly got feels for chicken rice,btohqsg
Lol. When u are someone need people to  care for yr own money. Then u are in deep shit. Sadly lots of common people does. ü§£.,btohqsg
BUT you can 'force yourself to save' with so many other ways...you can do DCA using a discount broker too..,btohqsg
I think that's not a good justification to pick up ILP. if the issue is discipline  then the person sld learn to be disciplined  not buy a lousy substitute,btohqsg
i guess some people prefer simpler as ILP is literally dumping to your insurance company and not doing anything but for like DCA u will need to login to setup etc,btohqsg
Just received news that American Express x SingSaver welcome offers will be halted tomorrow  those who want to sign up  try to do it within todayTrue Cashback (New only)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1585KrisFlyer Blue (New only)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1587KrisFlyer Ascend (New + Existing)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1586The Platinum Charge S$1 744 (New + Existing)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1589Platinum card (New + Existing)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1588,btohqsg
theres no other reason to justify why people is buying ILP . Some of my friends have ILP and its because they cant save money on their own ( which falls to discipline issues )   which they see 7% PA growth and after xx years become million $ which obviously is not guaranteed,btohqsg
