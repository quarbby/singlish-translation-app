Was like that when I join last yr,btohqsg
Then change then change then change again üòÇ,btohqsg
Keep changing btw 10mins n 30mins,btohqsg
Scammers will die of Covid-19...not to worry if you aren't.,btohqsg
This one confirm must wait long. Picked up  order from them a couple of times. Min must wait 30 mins. One time  customer scolded me  she mentioned ordered at 9pm. I only delivered at 1am.üòú,btohqsg
Same  i think mine one time i rcv the next day. I go chase them. They write your paynow number on their log book. Very messy!,btohqsg
Omg drive for 9 hrs less than 100 dollars,btohqsg
Peak hours is really a nightmare,btohqsg
Hey guys  I‚Äôm new here. Would like to know where‚Äôs the best area I can start collecting my orders from? I stay in Pasir Ris btw,btohqsg
And excuse my lack of understanding but will I get more jobs if I were to standby myself at town as compared to waiting for orders in let‚Äôs say Simei,btohqsg
Does anyone knows what is information fee?,btohqsg
Llm is now no longer a cfm make good $ delivery job. Yes during covid was very good. U will have many jobs with good prices even on weekdays. Now that everything has opened up  it's definite that there will be much less orders  but the number of drivers have not dropped  but seems to be even more. Much smaller pie  much more mouths competing. And now with priority given to those cars with stickers  bikes with bags  it gets much more difficult for you to get the good value jobs.,btohqsg
Used to be fri-sun easy to get $200 onwards  even if not public holiday. Now  u have to really be very lucky.,btohqsg
And so my advice to all those newcomers  if you were attracted by all those llm ads about making good money etc  please get ready to be hit hard by the actual reality facing all the llm drivers/riders here.,btohqsg
Either u really drive alot and take alot of sucky priced orders  which will maybe let u hit $100-200 even on a wkday but in the long run with the high petrol cost ur profit margin is not gg to be that worth it based on time n effort put in  or u r just doing the job to maybe earn a little bit to cover petrol expenses. $100/day is still doable tbh.,btohqsg
The pre covid traffic is a very big factor. Used to have very very smooth traffic which helps in having more time to do more jobs stack. Also even if petrol price goes up but if traffic smooth u will still burn much less petrol. Now with the shit traffic  instead of maybe 10+ mins finishing 1 job  u may need up to 30mins just to finish 1 job order. Time n petrol burnt in jam means u really can't afford shit fares,btohqsg
This is really terrible I don't think it's worth to do this,btohqsg
The time and money u spend on parking and petrol and to send to the client door step,btohqsg
To each their own. Know what u want. If u feel that u can't do that or not worth it  then either find something else or adjust your expectations or the way you r working now lor,btohqsg
Really didn't expect this to be so tough,btohqsg
Hope everyone here can have a good weekend,btohqsg
Just know that current reality is not so smooth  economy is not rosy. Manage ur own expectations. If u want more  either find something better or put in even more effort. Nothing comes ez now,btohqsg
Yeah I guess this is just a last resort thingy,btohqsg
Delivery is self employed  no fixed income. Its always tough. Even when prices n jobs were much better  to get good income/day also need put in long hrs,btohqsg
Job only have 1  u have to bid against few driver for a good job. Those lousy job will b there but eventually ppl will take cos Lanlan. LLM name already say lan lan move,btohqsg

‚ÄúNo air  I will die first. No need about late deliveries if I suffocate successfully ok?‚Äù,btohqsg
All so familiar  I 1st time take their jobüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
The Indian Muslim stall beside United Square will write down in a logbook too,btohqsg
Eh please don‚Äôt pump 95 in Malaysia hor.I noted the big jump even for 97 yesterday from 3.91 to 4.31 RM per liter yday when I rode my bike in.,btohqsg
cos 97 is meant for Singaporean. jhk will pump 95,btohqsg
Eh. 97 is meant for non-Malaysian la.Thailand drivers also kena the same thing when going Malaysia la,btohqsg
What if you claim waiting time and there is no more live chat sia,btohqsg
All vehicles la. As long not Malaysian  don‚Äôt subject yourself and the gas station to trouble.After all  which gas station is gonna pump out whatever you pumped in  along with the possible bits of rust etc back into their tanks.,btohqsg
bike go in waste time ... full tank 10l?,btohqsg
Yup. Just incidental trips where I need to get small stuff for work or makan bits,btohqsg
What's the maximum weight for bike?,btohqsg
8kg. I just posted a screenshot a couple days back  also on LLM website,btohqsg
How come leh? How much did you carry?,btohqsg
Anyone encounter when you see an order it says immediate but when you got it it says pick up 30mins later?,btohqsg
Hi ppl if use llm discount for Caltex can we still pay by ocbc credit card,btohqsg
Can but still 22% lalamove discount,btohqsg
I just want to pay with cc,btohqsg
Cc got fuel rebate 3% to cc,btohqsg
Yup  I encountered that too. I‚Äôm not sure if the user able to adjust the pick up timing after they‚Äôve released the order.,btohqsg
Advanced jobs that are due to be picked up within 30 min will turn red (pick up now category) that's the problem,btohqsg
Just like some1 just pointed out  now scheduled orders due for pickup within 30mins time will turn into immediate pickup now (red) job. So its normal. Some restos  users may also throw out the job once they get the order  and as long as the state the pickup time in 30mins it becomes immediate(red) order.,btohqsg
A lot of llm users use that to advantage to not pay the demand surcharge,btohqsg
Assuming now it's 1432  they will book pick up time to be 1503 or 1504,btohqsg
