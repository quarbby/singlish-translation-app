Confirm that from 30 Apr till now  your total amount never drop below Mar MAB + participating funds?,btohqsg

Hi all  urgent enquiry. I have paid my taxes via cardup and transactions has gone through. But it is still not reflected on my IRAS. Is there some steps I am missing?,btohqsg
Your payment this month will only reflect for next month's payment,btohqsg
Yeah.. I join last sep didn‚Äôt join Jan de. Maybe I wait until 30 May then üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah can wait till then. But you might want to double check your Mar MAB against your lowest end day balance from 30 Apr till today to be sure.,btohqsg
I assume your CardUp payment was few days ago at max? It should reconcile with Jun's payment.,btohqsg
How to check end day balance? The one reflecting on the main page?,btohqsg
Charge date was 20/5  just realised it was due today (24/5).Hopefully will reflect in IRAS records soon?,btohqsg
As on IRAS portal   I have not paid yet.,btohqsg
You might want to check with IRAS... Your charge date is too late. If it's paid through GIRO  20th is the 2nd GIRO deduction date  and will be paid. But through CardUp is about 3 to 4 weeks.Ideally is charge through CardUp on 12 Apr to pay for May. Since 6 May the first GIRO deduction date for May. IRAS will reconcile the payment against your GIRO payment plan.,btohqsg
I was paying one lump sum. So that's not GIRO  right?Sorry  am totally new to CardUo,btohqsg
You did setup the GIRO payment plan on IRAS website right? That's the first requirement stated by CardUp.,btohqsg
Suggest you use#mabcalculatormethod then you can see daily amount. Can stop before step 5.,btohqsg
I just went to card up and followed instructions to pay IRAS,btohqsg
Clearly did not follow the full instructions... Now few scenarios may happen:1. IRAS accepts that payment - all good2. IRAS charges 5% late payment fee and accepts that payment - which you still have to top-up with the fee3. IRAS charges late payment fee and rejects the payment because you did not follow the required first step - suggest you quickly setup your GIRO payment plan and CardUp payments,btohqsg
When you pay at card up,btohqsg
They charged my card on 20/5  IRAS to receive it today 24/5.,btohqsg
