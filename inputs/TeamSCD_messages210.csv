Ok bro   I down my offer to 17.90,btohqsg
Hi anyone driving type R here,btohqsg
type R no.. Euro R have@Gerardo85h,btohqsg
Ahh haha I’m not sure if it’s the same thing but if anyone has knowledge for oil coolers stuff i don’t mind haha,btohqsg
My oil temp running damn high like 100+ degree,btohqsg
i installed. usual 100C become 90C,btohqsg
usual 90C become 85C (becuz thermostat for cooler activate at 85C),btohqsg
Now ah my temp normal drive is about 102-103,btohqsg
Warh if long drive can go up till 115,btohqsg
There was once I hit 120,btohqsg
wa u normal travel also hit 115 ah..,btohqsg
long drive at fixed 3k rpm also shdnt so hot since got air constantly coming in,btohqsg
ur fd2r radiator.. how long le..,btohqsg
take this chance to upgrade lo haha,btohqsg
Dun sound right to have EO temp that high on non track application,btohqsg
he change gear at 9k rpm,btohqsg
Better go ws n check it out,btohqsg
I think the ratio not really correct,btohqsg
but some tell me too big,btohqsg
EO temp 115..water temp 87 sound aledi way off,btohqsg
Wad did ah heng said on this issue,btohqsg
i missing 4 rowz at my block,btohqsg
to cool down the oil temp,btohqsg
but the thing is 19 row some say scared the oil pressure cannot handle,btohqsg
Go another ws n seek 2nd option,btohqsg
Yah that’s why wanna ask if there is any fd2r owners haha. Wanna ask for specialised workshop too.,btohqsg
Maybe your radiator fan died or thermostat stuck,btohqsg
My water temp at 80  oil at 90. But my radiator is changed  thermostat and fan switch both changed to Mugen. Before I did this change my oil would go around 100 to 105,btohqsg
Oh hmm got chance my thermostat I have yet to change too,btohqsg
Was thinking to change to spoon thermostat,btohqsg
Radiator fan I just changed like 6 months ago I think,btohqsg
The fan you saying is the switch ?,btohqsg
It's called a fan switch... Usually changed together with the thermostat,btohqsg
But I not sure fd2r have or not,btohqsg
These the parts I used but mine might differ a little to yours,btohqsg
U can follow my twitter that I js made,btohqsg
I like legit just made it,btohqsg
Everything on my profile is I make one,btohqsg
U can tell me what kind of charact uw I can churn out for u,btohqsg
Cos I using CMO and Python to code system,btohqsg
ik my tastes but idk how describe,btohqsg
Then can do commission next time,btohqsg
i give u idea for of,btohqsg
make me a irl rikka or hutao,btohqsg
I quite sure the feller I saw on stage don't look like this,btohqsg
HELLO this one is my stable diffusion code la,btohqsg
So basically I code my AI to be able to make anything,btohqsg
You make it sound like your ai is a 3d printer,btohqsg
I am not blessed in the English language,btohqsg
Like I code it w prompts and it give me women,btohqsg
That was such a bad explanation,btohqsg
I’m going to ask the ai to explain itself,btohqsg
But women is a good start,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure if I ask it to make a girl with a Euro r as it’s face it probably can,btohqsg
Wait this is giving me ideas,btohqsg

Surrounding ur engine got leaks? Got change ur valve cover gasket all?,btohqsg
I just did a full check and repaired everything,btohqsg
U currently on any oil cooler?,btohqsg
Skm ah Heng told me I need 19 row,btohqsg
Cause fd2r stock or cl7r stock no oil cooler nvr reach ur oil temp,btohqsg
Maybe u can try go somewhere for 2nd opinion,btohqsg
I think he just thermostat jam,btohqsg
From what ah Heng said is,btohqsg
My engine block less 4 water channels,btohqsg
To cool down the oil temp,btohqsg
My engine oil currently needed is 5.5litre haha,btohqsg
Lesser shouldnt reach that high temp le,btohqsg
U can consider ah heng opinion,btohqsg
Or u can go try 2nd opinion,btohqsg
Really ah? yah I going for 2nd opinion,btohqsg
Is ur fan running with aircon off?,btohqsg
Even water temp reach to a certain temp let say 90++ fan not running?,btohqsg
Yah apparently just now I was at idle my temp from 90 slowly increasing,btohqsg
Probably  ur thermostat or ur fan switch gone. Ur fan motor also might be gone. Thats why is not running even reach at certain temp.,btohqsg
Beforr cold start u check ur eo see low or not,btohqsg
If low  then probably ur engine eats ur oil,btohqsg
Base on what it i know that happen to me before,btohqsg
Hence u should get 2nd opinion before considering ah heng,btohqsg
Serious? Warh then they nvr mention. I just fix up everything 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
Cause k20 no oil cooler highest also 100+ max above is something wrong liao,btohqsg
And u not on track somemore,btohqsg
No harm lah getting 2nd opinion,btohqsg
Yah I will be getting second opinion,btohqsg
