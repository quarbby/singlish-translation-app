they would rather let you register 5 ferrari than 5 avante,btohqsg
But they park in their very nice landed houses which they paid for? Or pay for parking when they drive out their 1/10 cars just like the rest of us pay for parking?,btohqsg
Not a problem if they park in their own private property. I have not seen anyone or know anyone who has more than 3 cars parking on public road or public places,btohqsg
I agreed on the rights to tax on usage. More you use more you pay. Same idea as housing. Where got empty houses in little red dot?,btohqsg
They might just pay more by valeting too  therefore creating jobs,btohqsg
Its not about rich or poor here  its about usage.,btohqsg
Put in frankly  the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù who are driving  the government dont care about you,btohqsg
makes them even happier when you are angry and cannot afford,btohqsg
Just jow u say big difference  now u say little difference  make up ypur mind bro  im helping u here,btohqsg
And even if they do  they pay for parking......,btohqsg
I jusr wanna see everyone here happy,btohqsg
i just wanna wave my log card in malaysian face  and be happy that my depre is higher,btohqsg
Yep  so now we alr punnish those w high emissions right?,btohqsg
Just too many red and sore eye ppl around..,btohqsg
Car lite also means those rich should not hog the space right? üòÖ,btohqsg
Now how we punish those that drive alot?,btohqsg
Which is exactly what we are saying,btohqsg
No  car lite means more people use public transport,btohqsg
Yes  and give a free car to everyone who cant afford also,btohqsg
Then make people less desire on having cars right?,btohqsg
If the rich use 5 cars  he make 4 other families use bus and train,btohqsg
If they can afford it  why can't they buy? COE is the result of car lite and it has shot up so much yet people pay to buy the good. Like luxury handbag  gets expensive  isn't sustainable  yet people buy.Luxury goods not necessity.....,btohqsg
u have to understand  the government dont give a shit about whether you have a car anot  they only want to reduce car on the roads,btohqsg
they dont care the rich hog  only those tht cannot afford care (no offence),btohqsg
I like to take examples of japan. Almost every household have a car but they choose not to drive to work. So the reasons are obvious,btohqsg
Ok  each poor person get their own mrt,btohqsg
You need to understand and make up your mind. You can't say car lite then also say car too expensive,btohqsg
not too familiar  could you enlighten me please?,btohqsg
In SG if u are poor the gov still help u.. in fact is the sandwiched class which are suffering more than the poor..,btohqsg
Why? Big engine doesn't mean high emissions. Measure exact emissions instead?,btohqsg
Erm  most people in shenton way dont drive to work too.,btohqsg
so you lanlan have to workhard and get out of there lor,btohqsg
But not all own a car too right?,btohqsg
I also don‚Äôt drive to work and I got car,btohqsg
Ya because u are neither up or down,btohqsg
Yes people have less desire  but there's still people who can afford them  why stop them from buying something they can afford  unless you're proposing a C0MMUN15T society here?,btohqsg
Why not? How do u know the people in japan own a car?,btohqsg
bobian one la  thats why if u like driving cars  move out of SG. if not  buy shitboxes like imran do,btohqsg
If I say in my household I own 3-cars but we don‚Äôt use them to go work. So they are literally hogging just because I can afford,btohqsg
just fall into below category let the rich ppl do the work for you üòàüòà,btohqsg
The whole conversation is proposing a change sir. Please get with the program.....,btohqsg
i propose an increase in road tax and coe  what do you think,btohqsg
Parking space and the others to own a means of transport that they can have a better chance of a better life?,btohqsg
What's the issue with that  someday you will be outbid by someone else who can afford them and that's how life works. We live in a capitalist world  not a communist one.....,btohqsg
Or should we implement the old coe system,btohqsg
Coe should have additional stamp duty component if registered in same household address,btohqsg
Emissions over engine size.... There's 2.4s that have higher emissions than 4.0s now,btohqsg
So you want car lite and also want everyone to own a car. Nice....,btohqsg
i can rent a house for $1k and then reg the car there  no add stamp duty,btohqsg
Precisely too much money coming in from affluent channels that local citizens cannot control,btohqsg
