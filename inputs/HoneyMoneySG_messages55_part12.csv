Hi guys just an update about the IG inactive fees. They say the total fees is $1100 and they agreed to refund only 50% $550 as goodwill.I dont know if i should write letter to MAS or to small claims tribunal anot. I scared make things ugly until i cannot get back $550. Please let me know what should i do. Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
I will just don't waste the time and move on. Unless you really angry and want to fight back just for justice.,btohqsg
No lah. I not angry but i was hoping to get more back üò≠,btohqsg
Then don't waste time. The time wasted cost more than the $550.,btohqsg
actually i think it is a rather fair settlement..both side give in a bit liao loh,btohqsg
I guess it will be difficult. They wrote in the agreement clearly  but you forgot. You can estimate how much time to fight against IG and what is your time cost.,btohqsg
Actually their terms and conditions doesn‚Äôt doesnt indicate the fees. They put a website link and they never show or tell u the website. They didnt even mentioned about the fees.,btohqsg
Life will never be perfect. I also lost monies unnecessarily before. What we can do is just move on.,btohqsg
$25 per months? That is deep. I used to have IG a/c too but I closed it immediately when I not traded. So  never get any charges.,btohqsg

DBS corporate bank account can easily charge you $40 if falling below $10000 balance.,btohqsg
A quick google shows that by right you should be notified before the first fee is charged.Well since they have given you a discount. Just take it and move on ba,btohqsg

hi experts  can anyone reccommend credit cards to use to pay for MCC7032 transaction in foreign currency?,btohqsg
Try to explore if Amaze + Maybank FnF meet your requirements provided you are on right category n meet minimum spend. There is a cap on rewards you can get from each category.,btohqsg
Will I get 6%from Citibank if I use amaze + Citibank cashback card for overseas dining?,btohqsg
U need to make sure the mcc is 5812 or 5814,btohqsg
May i ask what the benefit using amaze except overseas spending?,btohqsg

Hihi Gurus! Can advice how to check MCC code under digitbot?,btohqsg
Can I use SP Bills or Travel to hit Maybank's $800 minimum spend (even if I don't get cashback on those)?,btohqsg
Can check if xnap paired with amaze+crc earn you 10x points?,btohqsg
converts offline transactions to online transactions for local spend,btohqsg
It doesn't change the underlying MCC code so ur Lady's card will still be only for the category u have chosen to gain the bonus points.Amaze is good for overseas spending to have better xchange rates  otherwise locally  so far only citibank rewards card see e benefit of changing offline to online as online spending will get bonus points for citi rewards card,btohqsg
Ooo I just rmbed.. for UOB If tagged with Amaze for local spending at UNI$ merchants  it helps to reward u on bonus points from the card instead of giving u UNI$  which is a better route than receiving UNI$ for spending at UNI merchants,btohqsg
