top sch got better connections and resources,btohqsg
neighbourhood sch u only got ahbengs and ahlians,btohqsg
Yea but alot of people say ri good mah,btohqsg
this yr those P6s who kena quarantine yesterday lucky,btohqsg
ri is the best according to me,btohqsg
like if people say oh i‚Äôm from [name sch] ppl immediately have better impression,btohqsg
no such thing as top sch rly,btohqsg
most of us here from neighbourhood sch,btohqsg
Same but teachers hit and miss,btohqsg
Cuz normally if teachers stay long in neighbourhood schs,btohqsg
Those are the ones who are really dedicated,btohqsg
yeah i‚Äôve heard abt the express students bullying NA NT students in neighbourhood schools/looking down on them,btohqsg
Unless you get those waiting to retire,btohqsg
thank god this kind of bullying doesn't happen in raffles,btohqsg
Raffles no na nt and express,btohqsg
For my sch we mingle alot,btohqsg
have you went to the school of stfu,btohqsg
Can be hard to differentiate nt na and exp,btohqsg
ü§° but its harder for NA/NT ppl to go uni because you are judged for your intellectual abilities at 12 year old,btohqsg
people should just respect each other‚Äôs background,btohqsg
4/5 years u study in an easier stream,btohqsg
their forte might not be in academics,btohqsg
its a culture problem not a problem with the exam paper,btohqsg
like your education doesn‚Äôt define you at all,btohqsg
is much better than the ones that criticise them,btohqsg
i mean sch and academics is only one kind of talent,btohqsg
Like NA ppl  4 years study easy stuff then less than 1 year study O level standard,btohqsg
Sec 5 ppl have it harder,btohqsg
Defines what job u can get thou so fuck,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not trying to perpetuate anything okay but like it‚Äôs not like people from top IP/IB schools shit on express kids,btohqsg
so i don‚Äôt see how those express bullies see they have the right,btohqsg
Draw model. There's no need for assumption,btohqsg
but not necessarily a confirm better job if u come from a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù stream,btohqsg
the reality is being smart is easier for u to succeed in sg,btohqsg
I mean stream doesnt matter jc does not matter but uni course does matter,btohqsg
U have all the scholrships for u,btohqsg
And the personality morals and ethics can fake fake a bit,btohqsg
cos sg is a meritocratic society where success is based on academic achievement,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see why ppl say ‚Äúgrades dont define u‚Äù when they are literally obstructing you from doing certain professions/courses,btohqsg
grades don‚Äôt define you is very subjective,btohqsg
It doesnt define you but it defines ur career paths,btohqsg
depends what you want to be defined by,btohqsg
if u want to be defined by the job u get and the course you go to,btohqsg
A person‚Äôs societal role is heavily influenced by one‚Äôs career,btohqsg
if you want to be defined by your personality and how you come off to others,btohqsg
don‚Äôt rly wanna say la hahha,btohqsg
but some people have the talent,btohqsg
Eh anyone O‚Äôs taking pure phys?,btohqsg
but academic wise is not so good,btohqsg
But getting into ip or raffles or acs or whatever significantly removes obstacles to success compared to without,btohqsg
