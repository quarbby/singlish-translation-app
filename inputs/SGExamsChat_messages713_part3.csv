Ite and RP is a dumping ground no matter what,btohqsg
i heard of ppl not even getting accepted to ite,btohqsg
U can say the same for uni lmao,btohqsg
yeah all those stories on reddit,btohqsg
if u cant even qualify for rp,btohqsg
U climb up one step and u have ppl saying NTU is a dumping ground for NUS,btohqsg
im like how tf u cnnt get accepted in ite,btohqsg
Which I mean yeah there is truth to that,btohqsg
okay my friends call hc a dumping ground for ri ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Yeah so everything is relative lmao,btohqsg
mustve actually gotten raw 54  since the lowest cop for any ite course (according to jae booklet) is like 40 r4,btohqsg
NUS is a dumping ground for Ivy rejects,btohqsg
not exp the one i saw on reddit was a NA student,btohqsg
i mean on the jae booklet it even says the requirements are 1-8  so like A1-E8,btohqsg
how tf u get raw 54,btohqsg
Actual it depends the aggregate doesn't paint the full picture lmao,btohqsg
like that time someone said that the lowest for psle was 40 or something,btohqsg
Some get F9 for English or any maths and sci. Auto cannot qualify for poly,btohqsg
are there ppl who can go poly but chose ite after olvls,btohqsg
how is the NA aggregate counted? like what format? what is the max and minimum cop?,btohqsg
Minimum subject entry requirements almost all polys require either a c6 or d7 for your English Maths and Science,btohqsg
ite entry requirements and NT points is diff,btohqsg
meanwhile ours is language 1 relevant 4/5,btohqsg
Got especially if the poly COP is high for their desired course,btohqsg
very few ppl ever want to go rp..if they can help it they wont,btohqsg
I had many when I was in ITE under applied sci,btohqsg
rather go ite than rp..cause at least got chance at other poly's,btohqsg
ite is 4 best subjsNT is EMB1,btohqsg
Cuz the COP for all the applied science courses are at least <20,btohqsg
you go rp..you are sucked to rp,btohqsg
what kind of subjects are offered in NT?,btohqsg
dang you really hate your school huh,btohqsg
not hate..its been a fun school,btohqsg
in sp and np itÊ¼s a single digit r4 course too,btohqsg
U can go seabs website and check it out but the general ones lor,btohqsg
NA and NT have smaller amt of offered subjects,btohqsg
Simply cuz not as much demand,btohqsg
how could i have forgotten that google exists,btohqsg
el math general sci mt computer applications ss(non examinable) and a choice of dnt nfs art music ebs(elements of business skills),btohqsg
but i think now diff alr,btohqsg
weÊ¼re just talking about express NA NT streaming things. how their aggregate are counted. and this@Ryannnnnnnnnnjust loves talking about the funny shit in rp,btohqsg
because theres no way they would teach you triple pure science like o levels lol,btohqsg
the nt students in my school were shortchanged,btohqsg
i somehow have a pic of the tb in my phone. gimme awhile,btohqsg
Just the thought of it made me laugh,btohqsg
bro how u get all this data one,btohqsg
ooo sure iÊ¼d like to see,btohqsg
NTs direct pathway is to Nitec and maybe Hnitec,btohqsg
Idk about the new reformed ite system lmao but back in my day was just nitec,btohqsg
now got 3yr hn courses alr,btohqsg
