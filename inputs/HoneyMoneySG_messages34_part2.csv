Hi gurus  WWMC can earn 4mpd if used to pay for streaming services?,btohqsg
if we do ega promo now and they release new promo say in June  referencing may... how to make sure we qualify for next promo if our money all the while in ega?,btohqsg
Hi guys HSBC EGA 5 transaction per month  can I just fund transfer to spouse 5 times?,btohqsg
you can FAST out 5 x $1,btohqsg
maybe can just keep 1 month just $2K before going back again ?,btohqsg
but how you know which mth will be the reference mth,btohqsg
normally is 1 month before the cycle ?,btohqsg
so the last mth of cycle must reduce to 2k huh,btohqsg
not necessary  for example i in Feb-May cycle  after 31 May I just keep $2K till fulfilment date  then I can go to July cycle already,btohqsg
the new cycle won't start in June de ah,btohqsg
based on records  almost every month has 1 x 4 month cycle,btohqsg
you mean there's Feb-may  another Mar-Jun  another Apr-Jul?,btohqsg
I also just join HSBC EGA this month  but yes seems like almost every month has 1,btohqsg
Yes  there's always a new cycle every month. Been like that for years already. In the past  it's 3 month cycles  now it's 4 months.once you've started a cycle  you can't restart one midway until your current cycle is completed.,btohqsg
but every time the promo is above market ave?,btohqsg
yes all along HSBC EGA is above the market rate  but the downside is you have to wait long long for the interest to come,btohqsg
what card u all get w ega?,btohqsg
for me still waiting for the hsbc debit card first   still haven come despite registering almost 1 month already lol,btohqsg
Can I check I just opened my HSBC ega acct...have to do dep before mar or can do it 1mar?,btohqsg
Will they charge penalty in Feb if didn't dep,btohqsg
up to you but i get EGA first for me,btohqsg
Hi Guys  just check with u on hsbc revolution. The 4mpd apply to travel related expense?,btohqsg
you mean the FBF ? I dont think so  if yes might want call them to request for waiver ?,btohqsg
might well go for March promo since Feb ending soon  just a suggestion,btohqsg
Yes intended to trf from rhb to hsbc,btohqsg
haha understood  I transferred from RHB HYSA to HSBC EGA 1st Feb also :),btohqsg
i finding new place for my rhb after 28th,btohqsg
Oh but do you know if they mention this explicitly in the T&Cs  or was this info from their CSOD? Doesnâ€™t seem like they had mentioned this in their T&Cs,btohqsg
need 5 business days to review,btohqsg
Anyone knows whether possible to check the reference deposit amount for HSBC for Jan?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know what CC are optimal to purchase air tickets (two $300 air tickets and two $600 air tickets)?Looking at1) DBS Takashimaya cards  as existing cardholders of other DBS/POSB cards qualify $150 cashback with a minimum spend of $250 as well as2) HSBC Revolution Credit Card for a Samsonite Prestige 69cm Spinner Exp with built-in scale (worth S$670) or S$200 cashback with a min spend of S$500What do you think? Advice is much appreciated. I currently hold Amex  Citibank  UOB  and DBS cards.,btohqsg
DBS Women CCâ€™ll b a wise choice,btohqsg
Hi gurus  DBS Altitude - does the online 3mpd for hotel and flights include all online type spend from all websites/apps or is it one of those dbs/Expedia type websites only?,btohqsg
Yeah mainly hotels and flights  I don't think car rentals and cruises are included,btohqsg
Yup hotels and flights.  Just need confirmation itâ€™s not a dbs x Expedia/agoda/kaligo type of website only,btohqsg
Did u submit the form in Jan or Feb?,btohqsg
Hi  this is a little off topic  do you guys like apple product like macbook pro would have discount in IT show like the upcoming COMEX? I know right theres citibank credit card 100 off promo  trying to weigh my options,btohqsg
Apple products are quite controlled pricing. So donâ€™t expect much promotion on their products. Especially newer released,btohqsg
Merchants probably just discount a little bit only. Even ShopBack also excludes many newest devices as part of TnC.If you've some connections that can gain access to student discounts  you're better off doing that.Or use the Shopee Apple Flagship store during 3/3. No guarantees it'll be cheaper though  especially when vouchers are being controlled iirc.,btohqsg
Checking with experts here. Uob one account interest. Criteria for level one interest unlock is $500 spend on eligible card.. does payment to insurance count towards part of this $500 spend?,btohqsg
If you apply through SingSaver promo in Jan  do take note that you need to complete 2 consecutive fresh fund deposit by 31 March to entitle for the $350 free gift.,btohqsg
Using uob Evo on XNAP consider online transaction?,btohqsg
Was informed by uob cso that my statement date is every 31st. For this coming statement  will the statement date be 28th feb or early March? Thanks!,btohqsg
Airbnb counted a not ah? Under travel related,btohqsg
I think should be counted. But can't confirm because I always use wwmc ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi  when after I deposit must I keep the money in the account or can withdraw?,btohqsg
Hi  how do i ensure that i will receive sms everytime i did a transaction on my UOB One CC?,btohqsg
online > Account Services > Manage Alerts > Credit Card > set the triggers,btohqsg
Why not transfer to DBS multi currency account in USD. No suffer in exchange loss. Then  invest in DBS USD FD at 4.86% p.a.,btohqsg
I remember insurance not included but please check T&Cs again.,btohqsg
