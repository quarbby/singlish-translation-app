This is Uob one saving AC right? Why need to update income?,btohqsg
Ocbc 365 for restaurant food. Uob one for 2k per month expenditure. Absolute cashback amex for 1.7% tru cashback for 1.5%. I already cut off many other cards. I dont need miles since most casinos overseas offer me free flights as long as i visit them when i go overseas.,btohqsg
Thats why cashback vs miles i always vote cashback üòÇ,btohqsg
Wah you brave to go casino gamble,btohqsg

Hi Chris  may I know where is your video talking about your own valuation of miles 1.25 cents per miles?,btohqsg
Actually at yew tee cc cuz at the time of sign up  it was discounted and $100 voucher for selected stores. Great deal cuz i went to IMM UA and got myself 50% on all items. Shopped for $200 worth of clothes.,btohqsg
Did you reach the last step? Seems need to wait 48 hours?,btohqsg
Then why did you stop your business just because you have maxed your cpf (FRS I assume)? You could have continue to build up your OA & SA and you won't have these income proof issues now...Or you could also tell them the truth and offer to place a FD with the banks to continue using their credit cards. If you place 100k FD with the bank  I don't think they will reject giving you a credit limit of 60k. Lol,btohqsg
I just realised something... If you only have saving account with a bank w/o credit card  they most likely won't bother asking you for proof of income out of a sudden... You kept mentioning about heavy reliance on credit cards  and showed us the 50k+ outstanding amount on your Amex card... Have you been paying min amount every mth or using advance cash withdrawal from your cards? If you are a good customer who paid the entire sum every month  I think the banks will love you and won't ask for your income for no reason...,btohqsg
Hi all! Was reading about the HSBC Revolution T&Cs which state ‚Äî‚ÄúReward points shall be calculated based on the total amount of Eligible Transaction posted into HSBC's credit card system within each qualifying calendar month  rounded down to the nearest SD1. Bonus Points are subject to a cap of 9 000 Bonus Points per calendar month  while Base Points are not subject to any cap.‚ÄùDoes this mean the $1k spend cap follows the calendar month for transactions posted within that month? e.g. if I made a purchase on the last day  of  the month  the transaction is still pending in app and would only be posted the next month - so this transaction would eat into next months $1k spend?,btohqsg
For those not have $ hold in uob1  do you withdraw today?,btohqsg
Yes. Before 10am to be safe. Don‚Äôt ask me why not 1pm 5pm 6pm.Just do it as early as possible to be safe.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure there is fishy business involved which triggered the initial enhanced due diligence by the bank which op ignored.The account closure is certainly not triggered by moving money out from the bank purely for monthly or periodic rotation basis.,btohqsg
Totally agree. And he sounds like a money mule to me. üôä Haha...,btohqsg
To be fair he may indeed be a financially successful individual but if u are moving huge amounts of money to and fro frequently without being able to easily prove your source of wealth  no banks will take u anymore after Fujian Gang saga.,btohqsg
Ohh is it like that for the UOB lady‚Äôs card too? Where the cap is on the calendar month but the transactions must be posted within that calendar month?,btohqsg
yea  nv received the qualifying sms for HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme. Mine end on 31 May,btohqsg
They might have stopped sending. As long as do as per tnc. Should not be an issue,btohqsg
Hsbc ega Jun promotion is out.... lower interest rates again ... sign,btohqsg

Hi just checking for TRUST supersize saving account 3.5%  the salary deposit is only via Giro and fast transfer with Sala will not work? Thanks,btohqsg
Yeaa sounds like some AML flagged out by the bank and also the previous request for income documents and not providing it but still have large cash flows in the account just seems suspicious to the bank,btohqsg
The thing I don't like hsbc ega is the interest payment is only far away and no clear way to get the daily average balance unless u ask the customer service check for 2-3days,btohqsg
My consultant xris told me it‚Äôs higher and I trust him 100% without doubting.,btohqsg
Last month gave two tiers one. One less then 500k and one higher then 500k. Make it so complicated even their own customer service also cannot handle already but if u ask me I think small change if anything.If the scb esaver is 3.55%  t bills 3.65%  feel like all very similar already. I am putting some into stashaway 3.75% 3 months,btohqsg
