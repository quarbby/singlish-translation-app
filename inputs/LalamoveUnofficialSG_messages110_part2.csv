I like Atout cos they are always on time. Their customers are mostly atas.,btohqsg
beware of this order fking scammer,btohqsg
Ah yes I took once b4. Tot I reach early liao. Then see the long q. Their setup very lousy. Very slow distribute. 1st and last time,btohqsg

Kena those pickup 6pm. Reach there they say kitchen open at 6pmü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Yes I remember. The job was Amici at Food Exchange Admiralty. Mine was worse as the staff could not find my order. Asked me to deliver another location which was not even in my app! First and last too for me too.,btohqsg
Think he may have been referring to marriot tang. The 1 I took was at marriot tang. Like what he said got alot of drivers queuing up very slow distribution etc,btohqsg
Oh I thought Marriott has always been efficient. Different drivers diff encounters and experiences. Good to share and we all learn and be aware of.,btohqsg
And marriott tang allow u to park @ front lobby. If i rmb correctly. Tat a good plus point.,btohqsg
I kena pickup timing 1 hour b4 their opening hour. Lan lan waited for nothing n pay parking.,btohqsg
Maybe for small number of orders. That time it was a super big bulk bah.,btohqsg
