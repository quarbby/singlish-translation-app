hi guys need some advice...anyone here knows like what kind of things will void hyundai warrenty,btohqsg
cos im thinking of installing ambient lighting but im not sure about the warrenty part,btohqsg
Do not give dealers a reason to void,btohqsg
If never touch the main system  should be fine. Call them and ask. Ambient lighting with Bluetooth control is pretty normal le,btohqsg
What ambient light u refer to? If require dismantle and replacement of the interior of the car  that is questionable,btohqsg
If just add on led light strip  nothing to worry la,btohqsg
like this kind  took this from one of the insta pages i was querying,btohqsg
Anything nt stock is liable to void warranty,btohqsg

If it is just paste on. Looks fine. Better call and ask. Need to know how to power the light,btohqsg
Ya la. Because replacing original part ma.,btohqsg
Hi all  riding on the topic of ambient lights  are the cables for ambient lights? I dunno what‚Äôs these in my car. It‚Äôs a second hand. Dealer dunno too,btohqsg
Not sure if it‚Äôs aftermarket ambient lights or just some sound dampening thing. If it‚Äôs the former  I dunno where is the switch lol,btohqsg
I did this to my old car. Even worse  replaced the audi air vent with Mercedes. Technician did say no warranty for body part. But as long as don't touch the main system  audi is alright.,btohqsg
Hope can get some insights üôèüèº,btohqsg
Ya the cable is for the light.,btohqsg
everything just ask back the ad you buy from,btohqsg
General rule is anything not stock is liable,btohqsg
Ya I don‚Äôt mind keeping it but gotta be a way to switch it on lol,btohqsg
Its nt on when engine start?,btohqsg
No leh since the day I took over from dealer,btohqsg
maybe there is a kill switch somewhere?,btohqsg
Ya dealer ask me to see if anything below glove box etc,btohqsg
