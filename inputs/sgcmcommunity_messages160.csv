My job can't take their in house,btohqsg
Wa shit i suddenly forget my friend de dealer name,btohqsg
Yesterday I went to see Alfa   also almost buy,btohqsg
But the SA is an aunty,btohqsg
Oh  just curious  what kind of job doesn't permit to take car in-house loans?,btohqsg
Work under gov  they quite particular on the list of vendors who I can borrow money from and how the contract is drafted. My HR told me to get bank loan  and don't get those high loan / full loan etc,btohqsg
She told me  if I no money pay deposit means I got no money to buy car 🤔,btohqsg
I rmb govt sector gt smth called,btohqsg
So many people do 0 down/driveaway but after a few months cannot pay,btohqsg
Cus u sell car at a loss,btohqsg
Then they sell ur car to someone else,btohqsg
0down is really too much . But still many people love them,btohqsg
How much is the interest accumulation for those 0% down ?*Examplecar 100kEnd up whole tenure need pay 130k .,btohqsg
Recently in FB got one advertise a car that cost around 150-160k for like $75 a day for the full loan for 10 years. If calculate 30 days a month for 10 years is like 270k by the end of the 10 years,btohqsg
Wah  maybe the 75 a day doesn’t look too much,btohqsg
i did car rental for one day 55 bucks chor as hell alr,btohqsg

But his one is like hitch kind? So he say illegal,btohqsg
Cause he don't want to be unde phv scheme cause insurance ezpensive,btohqsg
His one is the telegram hitch kind lol  I think by right cannot,btohqsg
I think $75 a day quite cheap .1 hr only 3.125,btohqsg
If want to make yourself feel better   1 min only = $0.05,btohqsg
But then reality doesn’t work this way. But there are some really buy it . Just need to say   Oei   you cannot afford 0.05 per minute meh ….,btohqsg
Cannot la  like that can't even relax. Every time want to sleep or just chill will keep thinking bleeding money,btohqsg
Some people is because of ego   they will die die make it happen 1,btohqsg
You rich mah that’s why cheap for yoy,btohqsg
No la ; I also very poor,btohqsg
At the end of the day see ur needs and wants,btohqsg
