I just stay at home and cook ramen,btohqsg
oh right while u noobs here,btohqsg
But if to pick between the 2 above  singtel has better coverage & stability,btohqsg
Myrepublic all that gaming routing bs not worth it,btohqsg
if you have tv or mobile lines then singtel better can bundle,btohqsg
but myrepublic is much more widespread right,btohqsg
how did u know im going for this ahaha,btohqsg
Singtel is one of the main 3,btohqsg
Singtel more stable and you won't be stuck waiting on call if they mess up cause they have a chat,btohqsg
If not which gen z want to pick myrepublic over one of the main 3 telco,btohqsg
myrepublic is nonsense  they just have more trendy marketing only,btohqsg
It’s been a while since we hears from you,btohqsg
but don't get played with their 2 gbps stuff,btohqsg
since u have more experience ill just ask,btohqsg
it's the same as a 1 gbps connection,btohqsg
do you want clout or a good chair?,btohqsg
viewqwest definitely the best la  cheapest broadband for 1gbps and only had it go down once in 4 years i've been using it,btohqsg
but no wear and tear issues?,btohqsg
Bro  aesthetic for what use when it’ll have wear and tear over time,btohqsg
gaming chairs not good for posture,btohqsg
I have my old one in my other room now,btohqsg
When u are older u will understand,btohqsg
Gaming chair look comfortable but really not,btohqsg
wear and tear  and singapore so hot,btohqsg
i have 2gbps but from a different network,btohqsg
Even if u on aircon 24/7,btohqsg
This is the most comfortable thing ever,btohqsg
I threw out my secretlab for this,btohqsg
Alot ppl dont understand this but,btohqsg
No point for 10gbps when half ur devices u own dont support it,btohqsg
connection stability and routing is king,btohqsg
carrot is also full of fibre,btohqsg
only came around to poke HoM cause he never jio,btohqsg
this fella really easy to carrot,btohqsg
After 3 years of using secretlab,btohqsg
U may think it looks empty,btohqsg
But it does wonders for ur posture and back,btohqsg
And its comfortable since its mesh and cooling,btohqsg
get a used herman miller on carousell,btohqsg
The only thing I can afford from this picture is the octopus toy,btohqsg
isnt secretlab good for posture though,btohqsg
even if you get a corporate 10gbps  unless you live in mandai with your own optical cable running to you  you'd get a max of 1gbps real time download with all the interference around,btohqsg
i went to ask them and they said its good for posture etc,btohqsg
pick up from the street use 5 years liao,btohqsg
Salesman will tell u anyth to get u to buy,btohqsg
You ask salesman from maserati also they will say it’s a very reliable car,btohqsg
learning alot just from this group,btohqsg
Get a ergonomic chair trust me,btohqsg
secretlab is a marketing story itself  products arent horrible but,btohqsg
Your future you will thank you,btohqsg
certaintly overpriced for what it offers,btohqsg
The buldge here what helps your posture,btohqsg
If you getting a secretlab chair,btohqsg
Secretlab the back so flat confirm pain,btohqsg
Might as well get a razer laptop,btohqsg
When u young and all confirm no difference,btohqsg
But when u get older really u understand the diff,btohqsg
Oh so it's just angry forever,btohqsg
i wanted to match it with my pc,btohqsg
Oooo this buldge help but when that time at mrt people scold me for my buldge,btohqsg
Get a matching g string while you’re at it,btohqsg
what do u think of it,btohqsg
I use prism  not the best but it was cheap,btohqsg
it’s good enough to watch the news,btohqsg
The ultrawide used was 600+ brand new 1500+,btohqsg
Can get prism for cheaper if you source yourself,btohqsg
also i paid someone $150 to fix my ssd cables welp,btohqsg
They're just good at white labelling,btohqsg
is it that hard to replace it manually if its not sata,btohqsg
Clearly you're too gen z and lazy to do anything,btohqsg
Was waiting for someone to say this,btohqsg
dont take this as a offence but,btohqsg
Well it's even better coming from me,btohqsg
The generation right after me  in school,btohqsg
it will take hours though to figure aaa,btohqsg
Students dont even know what is thumbdrive,btohqsg
Because brings down the image of the whole generation,btohqsg
Wah you talk like you 40 years old leh calm down,btohqsg
Most are hands on  just hands on different things only,btohqsg
I not much older than u all only,btohqsg
yeah buttt i dont understand which screw is which,btohqsg
Borderline gen z alr  feel old compared to the kids now,btohqsg
@carrot_cxnsaid 20 years old is old….,btohqsg
My childhood was either at playground or computer,btohqsg
I never had an iPad  I'm proud to say,btohqsg
Pre iPad gen z still good,btohqsg

I ownd 3  always end up selling cos never use,btohqsg
Computer also not so fast like today,btohqsg
Not sure if ur generation know,btohqsg

Y'all never had to witness Lara croft triangle bewbs,btohqsg
Bro… i prestige master in that game on ps3,btohqsg
I bought it with my ps3 on 17 nov 2012,btohqsg
You know what's the best game though,btohqsg
Why so early got people bid COE already,btohqsg
myrepublic offering monthly installments for items hmm,btohqsg
Btw heres a tip for u,btohqsg
U may think 0% installment good,btohqsg
The moment u miss a payment,btohqsg
if ur late on payment lets say,btohqsg
Don't get into a debt trap...,btohqsg
That time I hungry I buy nasty cookies with atome,btohqsg
i have none except student debt,btohqsg
Its really a bad thing to encourage the generation to take on debt unnecessarily,btohqsg
If you're at a point that you're paying installments for your basic Internet,btohqsg
Debt good  debt trap no good,btohqsg
4 months of $149.99 vs $600 upfront sounds more enticing,btohqsg
Sometimes a bit ridiculous where they rollout,btohqsg
149.99 per month anytime time of the week,btohqsg
If u are a working adult then ya sure but,btohqsg
Fully max out your grabpay and atome for points 🥰,btohqsg
When u dont have a lot of cash on hand,btohqsg
Awhile ago i went to see this burger place in orchard  $15 for 1 meal also got atome,btohqsg
Walan eh need to finance my fast food meal,btohqsg
when i bought a game while i was in school i had to eat biscuits for 2 weeks,btohqsg
Personally i only ever used atome when they had that promo for $15 off or smth,btohqsg
was that $70 game worth it,btohqsg
Then i just pay off 1 shot the next day,btohqsg
but if that game lasted u years,btohqsg
I had a period of time i ate nth but food at home for a month  to buy a nintendo 3ds,btohqsg
To play pokemon x&y when it came out,btohqsg
Atleast you grew up with nintendo,btohqsg
Bank will give you loan 1 to fiancé a car or use their in-house finance for the car,btohqsg
I genuinely doubt u are 20 tbh,btohqsg
20 but mind of a 10,btohqsg
are u like really sheltered type or,btohqsg
except im out of touch with things,btohqsg
We dont need to get started on this,btohqsg
it's a must when talking to gen Z s,btohqsg
i doubt i can get a degree its too difficult,btohqsg
U have student loans already for,btohqsg
You can’t get it with that attitude,btohqsg
okay so i dont know if tuition loan is considered as debt,btohqsg
but its the one which u can apply for,btohqsg
How come yall need to pay for poly,btohqsg
$1k per sem need tke loan meh,btohqsg
Ur PSEA acc so much meh,btohqsg
Even witb gov topup cannot cover all,btohqsg
nope i need financial assist LOL,btohqsg
Like the food voucher in sch canteen,btohqsg
Yall kids rmb it as edusave,btohqsg
PSEA is post secondary edusave essentially,btohqsg
then uh things happened so its like eternal debt almost,btohqsg
I used most of mine during a sch trip to hong kong when i was in poly in 2018,btohqsg
But “essentially” starts with an ‘e’,btohqsg
Why not give your parents money instead of thinking of buying a car,btohqsg
like what they earn goes to paying off debt,btohqsg
dont think its smart also when,btohqsg
Ur familt isnt doing well to,btohqsg
Spend lavishly when ur starting pay wont be like,btohqsg
yeah but i see having a car as convenience,btohqsg
Find 2 jobs to finance the debts,btohqsg
Let me put this into ur head,btohqsg
How much are you saving per month,btohqsg
And those costs if u are a average person,btohqsg
Wont be able to afford until ur 30 midway onto ur. Career,btohqsg
you don't save money with a car you lose money,btohqsg
$200 probably wont make it out alive,btohqsg
Unless u in tech and earn 6k with fresh gead,btohqsg
Car is out of the picture then,btohqsg
Technically grab everyday 2x a day is way cheaper than owning a car,btohqsg
Unless you are a developer or a software architect,btohqsg
Cannot share pw  cannot use overseas,btohqsg
Theres more than that but those are the easier ways,btohqsg
i dont like the name of this LOL,btohqsg
They very work life balance   my friends inside,btohqsg
all either have some odd names attached to it,btohqsg
👻👻👻👻 tulang merah 👻👻👻👻 nasi padang 👻👻👻👻,btohqsg
idk what that is but sounds delicious,btohqsg
or the food doesnt look appetising,btohqsg
Did u grow up in a chinese only school,btohqsg
Go gov tech lor also good,btohqsg
i just dont like those traditional food that much welp welp,btohqsg
so more of the atas cafe kind,btohqsg
So i assume  Western  Japanese ur favourite,btohqsg
But gov tech   you need to get a place to park your car   expensive carpark,btohqsg
Do u know what a game boy is,btohqsg
yes i know those but if u refer me to the games aaaa,btohqsg
What was the first pokemon u played@carrot_cxn,btohqsg
but really i prefer fire emblem,btohqsg
Wa where did you find this?,btohqsg
This is the nintendo switch before the switch,btohqsg
but diablo like whats that LOL,btohqsg
Bargained down to 22.3 i believe,btohqsg
You need to appreciate local food leh,btohqsg
eh patapon developers making a new game called ratatan  i backed it on kickstarterhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ratata-arts/ratatan,btohqsg

Eh i need to try sia,btohqsg
You can have just rice and chicken there too,btohqsg
I always eat the chicken rice or the caifan cos the nasi padang sell out early+long queue,btohqsg
The fish soup stall also good,btohqsg
And drop a message here when you go,btohqsg
Ya!! I think quite a handful ate there already,btohqsg

Good food must always share one!,btohqsg
You message here when you there  get fast track,btohqsg
