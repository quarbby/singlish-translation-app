H2 math is too diluted tbh,btohqsg
Hahaha. Just make it university style! The way to go!,btohqsg
It does more harm only when it is so diluted,btohqsg
Makes h2 math seems like an ant,btohqsg
No  makes it seem like a complete joke that people even have the audacity to teach incorrect stuff,btohqsg
There isnt rly any incorrect stuff taught,btohqsg
The incorrect stuff taught is in chem,btohqsg
So you're telling me that horizontal line test to prove injectivity is correct?,btohqsg
Eh i nvr learn that so i cant comment,btohqsg
No  anything not pure  we say it is something else. Corrupted hahaha,btohqsg
Why they cant teach completely correct,btohqsg
Pure math is easier than the above tbh,btohqsg
Of course. Then why did you choose not to do pure mathematics? It's your choice,btohqsg
Not everyone as smart as you,btohqsg
Don't just think from your own point of view,btohqsg
How I wish I was as clever asV. The reality is that I am not clever. ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
h2 math is like the o lvl equivalent of emaths,btohqsg
H2 math is more computation than theory,btohqsg
Then what was the O level equivalent of A maths for examination years2007-2016?,btohqsg
I hated amathsBut found h2 maths relatively manageable,btohqsg
But still screw up part of my p1 in the end ðŸ¤§,btohqsg
H2 math cant help you much in uni math for sure.,btohqsg
I think only the H3 university modules may be able help  at least initially,btohqsg
f maths  come on  what a joke,btohqsg
Idk man  idk how uni math looks like...,btohqsg
Let's do some field extensions! Hahaha,btohqsg
U shld get some friends and go outside,btohqsg
So far how many rp has everyone managed to collect,btohqsg
given the difficulty of yesterday's GP I'm probably around 27.5rp  26.25 if I'm pessimistic,btohqsg
time to see how far I can bring my H2s,btohqsg
Usually people underestimate how they do for A levels,btohqsg
hahah those are realistic estimates but idk if cambridge is lenient  who knows,btohqsg
Given my prelims my 3H2s probably can get BBC assuming I don't study like mad,btohqsg
Moderate amount of studying  not burning midnight oil,btohqsg
H2 FMath is adequate if you are planning to do applied math  stats or engineering,btohqsg
But not if u want to do pure math,btohqsg
But H3 math also not very helpful in uni pure math. Besides number theory and combinatories  nothing else,btohqsg
Analysis  Basics of Abstract Algebra all not in A lvl syllabus. The most fundamental of pure maths,btohqsg
D first poem gay no cap,btohqsg
I did the first poem lol,btohqsg
Do send the chem p2 too if u have it on thurs,btohqsg
But i doubt any1 will have,btohqsg
I know math tutor who will have the paper.,btohqsg
A math tutor send it to me.,btohqsg
The one who post the ans online?,btohqsg
History paper gonna be hard too,btohqsg
hi does anyone know what's the usual a level bell curve score for A in H2 math,btohqsg
Anyways chill P2 isn't over yet,btohqsg
The ap gp qn is a joke lol,btohqsg
Yes normally its application qns tested,btohqsg
