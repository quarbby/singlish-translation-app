Not sure if Atome works for Citi Rewards Master Card or not,btohqsg
Awww  thanks. Guess Oct was the last mth then,btohqsg
It's a rewards cap  not a top-up cap,btohqsg

So if I want to swap 100USD back to sgd   how much will I get in sgd@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Amex  or rather Amex  seems not so technical friendly and not so inviting in easing consumer to use it. Can't add in to Google Play  and Can't link to Amaze Cards. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I dont think is amex issue  amaze work with mastercard,btohqsg
If it was that easy to exploit  trust me you won't be getting the 1.7% unlimited with little to no exclusions,btohqsg
True but I think it helps if Amex can gain partnership with Google and Nium (Amaze Company?) to accept their card?,btohqsg
Partnership is not that easy as u think,btohqsg
Uob amex does not fall under amex  uob control it,btohqsg
Maybe  but I guess Master Card and Visa Card market share much bigger?  So gaining the partnership AND giving good cash back rate may help? ü§î,btohqsg
Amex does not depend on reward  they depend on service provided,btohqsg
Mmmm.. strong supporter of Amex? üëç,btohqsg
U need to understand how reward is been given and how co brand card reward is given to know the flow of such collabration between company,btohqsg
If Amex gotten acceptance as partner  guess UOB Amex get it too? ü§î,btohqsg
With some spread will be 138-139,btohqsg
Have exact breakdown? Want to do big amount with your method,btohqsg
Bank are the one who give out reward for co brand credit card  (except amex issue card),btohqsg
Bank earn from terminal usage from merchant and rental of terminal,btohqsg
I thought there is a Amex Cashback Carl similar to UOB Absolute Amex?,btohqsg
Which is why u see terminal with uob citibank dbs etc at merchant,btohqsg
Amex true cashback can be added to samsung pay,btohqsg
Must not only see Singapore leh  to most multinational companies Singapore mkt is not even relevant. AMEX is huge in US,btohqsg
Like certain offer is only to amex issue charge and not to bank issue amex,btohqsg
It is too simple to just brush it off saying amex not working with google or other payment system. It is 2 way traffic  if it doesnt benefit google why does they want amex on board,btohqsg
So amex need to entice google or other company to work with them,btohqsg
This is business point of view  so if u see from consumer point of view u wont see it,btohqsg
Truth is  banks are not here to look after your interest  but their own KPI,btohqsg
Scb Damm fast same as Amex not the uob amex,btohqsg
If u applying from Amex u can add to mobile payment app like apple pay Samsung pay example but not the uob Amex,btohqsg
"Correct.  If Amex think easing usage is part of good service  then probably they need to think of ways to get into more ""mobile payment ecosystem"". ü§î",btohqsg
U can always write in to amex to feedback,btohqsg
Does Amex works in Google Pay?,btohqsg
I use samsung pay  google pay i rarely use. I am happy with the reward by samsung pay,btohqsg
Just gotten the UOB Amex and just sharing what I encountered.  Card which ease my usage I use.  If don't  not a big deal to me. üòä,btohqsg
Ppl bundle amex with grab pay mastercard,btohqsg
is there a whitelist that i need to do?,btohqsg
Guess who is the 3rd largest investor in FTX,btohqsg
I thibk grab here refers to grab services. Not top up,btohqsg
No if u using uob amex,btohqsg
Hello gurus  there's some refund in my credit card from airline due to price difference. Can I withdraw the $  FOC using ATM without additional charge? I.e. cash advance fee  ATM fee etc.,btohqsg
The proper way is to call bank and ask them credit back to bank accoubt  if u withdraw from atm it will still count as cash advance with fee and charges,btohqsg
If u dont have a bank account with the bank  u can request them to issue cheque,btohqsg
Amex pay $1 deduct promo Is damn good üëçüòä,btohqsg
Sorry won't be support by uob amex user,btohqsg
You mean by scanning the Amex QR code at merchant?,btohqsg
Something like this u see amex logo,btohqsg
