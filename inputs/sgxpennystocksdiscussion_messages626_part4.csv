I recall there was a company named SINJIA...Announced RTO valued at 2 billion?Market didn't believe the lofty  unsustainable  valuation  and the share price was  sold down after RTO was announced...,btohqsg
1B I also don't believe 🤣,btohqsg
Sinjia was fried up from $0.02x to $0.17x though before the announcement I believe,btohqsg
Sinjia Land's S$2b RTO price tag may be revised with new valuation report  Companies & Markets - THE BUSINESS TIMEShttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sinjia-lands-s2b-rto-price-tag-may-be-revised-with-new-valuation-report,btohqsg
Need to do deep dive into the valuation and not believe the numbers as it is...,btohqsg
Personally  do you really think it is reasonable for moneysmart to be valued at more than 160m?I doubt so bro...,btohqsg
Also  there are so many shares outstanding..  wonder if they would need to do a share consolidation?,btohqsg
Mr Oei's wife is ex-SBC actress?,btohqsg
The valuation   not sure how they derived but they are in 4 countries now.The growth potential is what they are selling. For stocks   it’s all about future potential.,btohqsg
Yup best to run during the fry up before consolidation,btohqsg

APS Market Depth very stacked. Should be game on.$0.002 is an add for those who can keep this one should be an easy 50-100% win when in play.,btohqsg
Might get interesting. Calling all BBs on the APS to lead pennies sentiments,btohqsg
Those who can hold  APS $0.002 is the price to get since new shares would be based on $0.003 issuance,btohqsg
Might be an easy 50% gain if buy $0.002,btohqsg
