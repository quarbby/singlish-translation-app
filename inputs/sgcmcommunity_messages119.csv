What's next for better  cleaner energy? A quick rundown of everything we should watch out for in 2023 ü§îEVs are becoming more commonplace  but the journey to clean up the auto industry (with better technology too) is just starting.

Go back to electric tram days üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Not necessarily in terms of refuelling,btohqsg
EV hard to sell once old...,btohqsg
hybrid is still the better as of now,btohqsg
EV now is not much cars fighting for charging,btohqsg
wait till the population change to 50% then can see the effect,btohqsg
imagine each charge give u the fastest charge 15min  how many lots do the kiosk need to cater for,btohqsg
Sing song lah. Infrastructure not there yet.,btohqsg
unless they adopt china style  all car makers follow a common standard for car battery,btohqsg
drop and swop then maybe it works,btohqsg
at times we do see snake Q at kiosk for petrol already,btohqsg
not to mention EV were to happen,btohqsg
EV takes time to charge leh. Unlike petrol. Pump and go,btohqsg
EV charging at malls or other places except kiosk  you are paying parking too,btohqsg
which idiots say charging is cheap,btohqsg
not so straight forward to install charging stations at every lots,btohqsg
got fire safety rules to follow,btohqsg
at max power drawn capacity whether will have fire hazard or not,btohqsg
lamp post all LED light draw min electric power,btohqsg
euro the land and roads are largely than our little island lol,btohqsg
our roads not much left  under could be hollow haha,btohqsg
that is the possible future. for now is just see and wait  no point to dive in to be early adopter,btohqsg
cars not free and % is high now.,btohqsg
that provide they make it here in sg but sg market too small for them to sell here,btohqsg
here sell cars need to see the COE number  other countries sell cars no need see quota. the local ADs can only log in forcast limited units,btohqsg
see the total cars sold yearly versus japan or taiwan or hk,btohqsg
Just plug out the double AA battery from the tesla then just replace,btohqsg
that is the end of road  before reaching to that still a long road to go,btohqsg
I‚Äôd rather keep my C63 thank you,btohqsg
vintage plate lo but somehow they will find a way to make u give up lol,btohqsg
^ yeap. They plan to phase out ICE cars by 2040 no?,btohqsg
Unless they stop allowing petrol cars to renew,btohqsg
Not sure iirc but i think it was being pushed forward too,btohqsg
now u can say just renew  no problem i got money. what if the policy changes  cannot renew anymore,btohqsg
Vintage plate also vintage plate lor,btohqsg
only the engine potion no more fixing,btohqsg
they talking about environment friendly mah,btohqsg
Lol ev batteries aren‚Äôt environmentally friendly,btohqsg
You got see and read up where they get them from anot,btohqsg
Then we have lithium battery fires too,btohqsg
See if USA wanna play punk or not lo. Force other countries to adopt ICE cars for as long as possible. EVs are to the advantage of PRC. So maybe this Trade War with ChinaÔºåBiden and his gang might force nations otherwise till a new invention comes along to USA advantage ?,btohqsg

Budget 2023: From Mercs to Maseratis  luxury cars to get more expensive still as ARF system heavily revised üìàLuxury cars are set to become more expensive in Singapore.To make vehicle taxes 'more progressive'  cars with an OMV upwards of $40 000 are set to be saddled with substantially higher additional registration fees.‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!üëâüèª Comment and share (nicely) your thoughts on this revision of the ARF system!,btohqsg
With the new system implemented  is it that they want people not to able to change car often?,btohqsg
Best country for car enthusiasts ü•∞,btohqsg
What‚Äôs not to like? The one country where you can flex owning aPriusattrage.,btohqsg
100k in sg for an attrage is like a mercs in other country,btohqsg
100k in sg  can buy E53 in US,btohqsg
The land mass here is super expensive to put a car on the road. No choice.,btohqsg
By right COE is considered an additional Income cus other country dont have. So shudnt raise GST,btohqsg
Mrt and bus still the best,btohqsg
I actually like the bus rides,btohqsg
Digging into our reserves. Need to top up,btohqsg
Wah rain even more shiok sia,btohqsg
I walked in the rain today cus so heavy,btohqsg
Ikea has a nice wide umbrella,btohqsg
Used car sales will be better you think? - J,btohqsg
it will cause used car market increase 20 30k minimum,btohqsg
still cheaper than paying 40k for ARF  capped at 60k back,btohqsg
there is no end to greed and profiteering,btohqsg
I actually missed the 60k cap earlier,btohqsg
Civic will go up buy 20k?,btohqsg
im referring to bentley and the supercars. the used ones lo,btohqsg
unless civic omv suddenly > 50k,btohqsg
What is 20k to a million dollars anyways,btohqsg
that's the most important part we discussed yesterday in this grp.,btohqsg
nothing ah. the rich will just feel more exclusive,btohqsg
I PAID MORE TAXES SO U MUST GIVE WAY TO ME,btohqsg
People will buy entry tier instead,btohqsg
Type R omv is above 40k‚Ä¶,btohqsg
U see the chart  first 40k not really affected,btohqsg
same as the other tax brackets also... the % increase only affect the bracket  itself,btohqsg
Doesnt matter. Market gna have a kneejerk reaction,btohqsg
If signed a luxury car right before budget = earn money?,btohqsg
If my old car arf 57k will have any visible ‚Äúprofits‚Äù?,btohqsg
See ur car in demand anot lo,btohqsg
If u buy a high arf car that nobody wants.. which dealer/buyer wanna buy LOL,btohqsg
If the ‚Äúnew‚Äù aft feb15 version is 10k more ex den mine may up by 5k,btohqsg
not affected by the cap as such,btohqsg
and the arf increase not so high also,btohqsg
so your paper roughly the same,btohqsg
Well aware. Just that its more expensive to buy new so ppl willing pay more for the old :) if new one +20k then old one at least +5k,btohqsg
china ultra rich dun care a hoots abt expensive coeü§£,btohqsg
People rushing to buy special allocation cars now  drive for a year then hope the price goes up coz would be buyers won‚Äôt be able to stomach the additional pricing from the new measures.,btohqsg
Actually is the mid tier cars that we need to be concerned about,btohqsg
Like those just floating above 40k,btohqsg
I think that one folks will bite the bullet and still go for them.,btohqsg
Probably a few k the AD may absorb?,btohqsg
At most get smaller engine models,btohqsg
That one not likely I feel,btohqsg
Would more people be funnel to bid for smaller engine cars if they choose not to pay higher taxes for bigger engine cars? Will that affect the overall COE pricing?,btohqsg
cat B will likely continue to be in demand.. but what do I know.. üò¨,btohqsg
They can afford to pay. What is 200k to them? Just chump change sia,btohqsg
Maybe more will start to look at cat A car ?,btohqsg
I worried that they might change to 20k next year .,btohqsg
He says there will be more room for tax in the upcoming year . So this yr the change is used as a test on the market just like last year. There is a shift in the purchasing power ‚Ä¶ if people continue to look at range of 20 001 - 40 000,btohqsg

Yupp  just that a small section might move from the mid level Merc/Audi/BMWs and go into japanese alternatives that have lower omv and therefore lower ARF but they'll still be taking up Cat B COE,btohqsg
Cat B will stay in demand still,btohqsg
Just that we'll start seeing even more bogo spec contis so as to fall under lower omv brackets such as c160s  e180s etc. üòîüòîüòî,btohqsg
One must remember that the new changes don't target engine size but omv,btohqsg
You have Mazdas with 2.5s with lower omv than contis with 2.0s,btohqsg
And there's high omv 1.6s in contis as well,btohqsg
So it's not a direct relation for the lower end of the market that brings in most volume  i.e the c class'  a4s  e class'  3 series,btohqsg
Year of make also play a part.,btohqsg
Pete will say  no need to waste money‚Ä¶ can still drive on the road,btohqsg
Not quite  omv is simply the price of the vehicle when brought in  i.e. purchase price+shipping+insurance and logistics expenses,btohqsg
And purchase price is not settled by LTA,btohqsg
But by the manufacturer or the AD bringing in,btohqsg

driving is only stressful if you let it stress you,btohqsg
Me like driving. My spatial sense not good only,btohqsg
avante  is very small already how small you wanna get? ride bicycle better,btohqsg

I very fussy. I dun like hatchback,btohqsg
My concept is if I start off with a small car  I won‚Äôt be able to handle bigger ones either,btohqsg
that's why you shouldn't repair the scratches until you get used to it,btohqsg
So‚Ä¶ya. Elantra is mid sized right?,btohqsg

this cbk fail to poison me to change car come here poison others,btohqsg
Btw  after the budget  stinger now considered as luxury car or not?,btohqsg
if you have problem parking elantra forget about stinger,btohqsg
stinger is about the size of a 5series,btohqsg
I mean the Lawrence Wong budget,btohqsg
Stinger is kind of luxury performance car,btohqsg
stinger is 32k OMV  so not affected... but anyway kia discontinued it already,btohqsg
Maybe Under quote. Too cheap already,btohqsg
Depends what you're talking about  hydrogen combustion or hydrogen cell,btohqsg
Most cars being released are hydrogen cell,btohqsg
How much than consider luxury car?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs based on the OMV and ARF right?,btohqsg
There is no definitive classification of luxury cars,btohqsg
It's whatever you want them to be,btohqsg
But it's usually based on size of car or the brand,btohqsg
Tend to be one of the classifications,btohqsg

No harm mixing but why would u HAHHA,btohqsg
petrol is not engine oil bruh,btohqsg
Can get better discount why not .,btohqsg
Unless u pump 95 in sg then u go Msia pump 97 yeah by all means go ahead,btohqsg
If not u will stay same grade no?,btohqsg
Oh WAIT mixing means diff brand oh Just do it,btohqsg
Ron 97 give the best milleage per dollarüòõ,btohqsg

I just pumped  12% for one card and 5% shell discount +$3,btohqsg

No wor. I not fierce driver . How to complete,btohqsg
I got no sense of direction,btohqsg
In Singapore I also can lost my way lor,btohqsg
Wa bro cant help u le,btohqsg
Hahahaha  sometimes i use gps also can lost my way   dunnoe drive till where,btohqsg
Any car wash recommendations around ubi? Walk in kind  like petrol station or garage?,btohqsg
Even different RON can mix  just that your Ron becomes an average level of what you've put in and how much you had,btohqsg
A lot of people who require high octane fuels in the States have to do this because they cannot find the desired octane everywhere,btohqsg
So averaging it out as best as they can is the only way of preventing knocking,btohqsg
8 dollars after 8pm I think,btohqsg
touch less will clean meh? I still trust the good old rubbing to get rid marks. esp mine is a black car,btohqsg
Got use gps . But sometime is personal issue -> stubborn,btohqsg
By the way   how long do you check the air pressure in the tyre?,btohqsg
Just fill it up w air regularly,btohqsg
Won't be 100% but if ure car coated it does clean alot,btohqsg
I usually check every other fuel fill up,btohqsg
If have then just use the tpms to see if you need to top up,btohqsg
I did pump caltex but like no diff,btohqsg
Not very clean esp for rims covered in brake dust but it is cheap so good alternative if u just need a quick simple wash,btohqsg
Spray iron remover first lo hahaha,btohqsg
Bro everytime you go fuel up  go check,btohqsg
Machine will never beat bare hands,btohqsg
But I would rather go the machine than petrol kiosk car wash ü§£,btohqsg
I see my wheel stick   it indicated 280 but the SA ask me to pump 240,btohqsg
So which 1 I follow ?,btohqsg
Usually when you open the door can see the sticker,btohqsg

Not dangerous meh   really is omg,btohqsg
People like to do stupid and crazy things,btohqsg
We can advice but end of the day  they‚Äôre adults and they know what they‚Äôre doing,btohqsg
Custom alr say cannot alr at the signboard,btohqsg
Pretty sure the signs at the petrol stn also dont allow,btohqsg
And pls petrol is flammable. If someone hits him from behind  and leak + spark,btohqsg
For rims you need to go spray first,btohqsg
I mean  it‚Äôs illegal to carry petrol but illegal to cross border with it,btohqsg
U see mileage. To actually let ur ecu give u proper mileage u shud pump 3 full tanks consecutively of the same brand,btohqsg
When custom officer ask u open boot,btohqsg
He sure ask u go white box liao lah,btohqsg

Any thoughts on Volvo xc40 ev for a first time car owner? AD selling at 244k,btohqsg
If you paying this much  get the Model Y. Model Y is bigger and sells for 245k. Both same segment but mOdel Y is more spacious. Has access to Superchargers.,btohqsg
I prefer volvo cus solid chassis,btohqsg
Wife is primary driver. Likes the safety for the kids. Shall look at model Y but more my kinda ride üòÜ,btohqsg
Ya model Y is more ‚Äúvalue for money‚Äù,btohqsg
Becoz the road tax is about 2.2k also.,btohqsg
why must go for EV leh,btohqsg
Tesla safer lol. Becoz ÊûóÂøóÈ¢ñ survived a fire from that crash in Taiwan.Another Tesla survived a 50m cliff crash when the driver purposely drove it down a cliff to kill hmself + family. End up all survived. Just happened in the US not long ago,btohqsg
Less fun but running cost cheaper as new charger at our place,btohqsg
Granted yes you don‚Äôt get the nice stuff like FSD here  you can don‚Äôt buy the software update here in Singapore first until it‚Äôs mature.,btohqsg
Ya then I recommend you get the Model Y.,btohqsg
Having access to supercharger very big difference in charging routine,btohqsg
Now they willing to absorb GsT for you so better get while it‚Äôs still there,btohqsg
Space wise better than XC40 Recharge,btohqsg
Eh so other EV cannot use the supercharger ah,btohqsg
Not for now. But in the US  they opening up 7500 of them for other EV users alr.,btohqsg
But if you see the grand scheme of things right,btohqsg
What they want is to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù other EV users to a Tesla. ‚ÄúFree marketing‚Äù,btohqsg
Becoz they won‚Äôt be charging at the 250KW speed where the Teslas will be. Capped at whatever the car is designed for  like 150kW or 120kW,btohqsg
Most EV competitors cap their charging rate for 150kW. Even the Ioniq 5 for example. Fastest is 120kW,btohqsg
About 30-45 mins for a 0-80%.,btohqsg
Decent but not as fast as 15 mins for sure.,btohqsg
In the US Tesla are getting sued if they dont open up superchargers to other makes. So maybe will open up eventually in SG,btohqsg
Heard from ioniq 5 dealer the pricing will be out soon. Revised after recent ARF valentines Day gift üòÜ,btohqsg
Funny that in korea ioniq is like their everyday car,btohqsg
To us it‚Äôs a luxury car,btohqsg
Yeah apparently ioniq is a regular rental car for them,btohqsg
our reality is gov wants only the richest to drive,btohqsg
They'd rather you pay for public transport,btohqsg
Also it's them recovering lost revenue from low income taxes,btohqsg
Other countries have lower cost of cars,btohqsg
But their income tax can be 50%,btohqsg
So it can balance out in an ideal world,btohqsg
If you buying petrol in local petrol kiosks  you need to produce IC for recording purposes by the pump attendant. Singapore is pretty tough and harsh on this aspect.,btohqsg

Looking at a used stonic from used car.. anyone have experience n feel of stonic ?,btohqsg
Advice please .. :) txs in advance,btohqsg
From a friend:Enough d2d torque but not the most exciting.,btohqsg
Ya the torque is sufficient for day to day driving use,btohqsg
But of coz not the most exciting,btohqsg
Quite decent  that powertrain has been used in many kia-hyundai cars,btohqsg
1 litre turbo. Can go genting?,btohqsg
Otherwise the car is pretty basic not much to worry about apart from basic maintenance,btohqsg
But you will definitely stick to the slow lane and feel the power loss as you climb,btohqsg
Thanks thanks.. even bread n butter car cost so much,btohqsg
For better performance drive in manual  keep it in the powerband,btohqsg
But for wear and tear you better PPI first,btohqsg
Any better car in stonic range? 12k dep per yr,btohqsg
Why the plate is yellow or is that orange?,btohqsg
Registration to business can get the car cheaper?,btohqsg
Like Civic all these should be around there,btohqsg
If not the new Cerato actually using the  new Avante engine and CVT.,btohqsg
But more ex. I don‚Äôt know why,btohqsg
White and yellow plate actually no difference,btohqsg
White/yellow plate is just a choice. No diff from black,btohqsg
That's way out the range of his 12k depre sir,btohqsg
Kia cerato is a good bet,btohqsg
Yeah the older gen within his 12k mark,btohqsg
I love Kia  do not lose much to jdm,btohqsg
Really meh? I thought cerato cheaper now,btohqsg
13.5-14k and very new so higher depre,btohqsg
From what I last see. If compare Avante Elite to their GT Line,btohqsg
Last I checkedCerato smartstream 1.6 SX is 141kAvante Elite 1.6 148k,btohqsg
Kia driving experience is good for day to day,btohqsg
No more GT line liao since the smartstream engine. Replaced by SX,btohqsg
If you buy a used cn7  can get at about 13.5,btohqsg
A lot of used. If interested in the group I have some selling.,btohqsg
I mean whoever is buying the Stonic,btohqsg
Smart stream not as fun to drive but they pump in a lot of features for the d2d driver,btohqsg
No. Happened to be in the CN7 group as I‚Äôm driving one now.,btohqsg
If there was CN7N I would totally get it üëÄ,btohqsg
N by the time come here the ONV > 30k,btohqsg
Icic   i think D2D quite ok,btohqsg
Poor thing üòÇ type so long then kena report üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Watch Chelsea lose very boring right,btohqsg

but the guy who wash my rim didnt do a very good job,btohqsg
Ya not bad  my soft top also quite clean with no soap residue,btohqsg
u waited for how many cars?,btohqsg
i waited 1 car only when i went arnd 1pm,btohqsg
did they charge u for parking ah  i tot got 1hr grace period sia,btohqsg
I think I exceeded 1 hr,btohqsg
:) the washpass seems really tempting,btohqsg
i less than 1hr i think i got charged,btohqsg
i tot they say soft top not recommended for auto wash tho,btohqsg
If the seal not good will leak,btohqsg
But mine ok la manual wash and heavy rain both no leak,btohqsg

some soft top rain leak liao :),btohqsg
Oh I shelter parking at home and in office so almost no exposure to elements hahaha,btohqsg
Got buy. I tried. Not bad. Can clear bird stain.,btohqsg
Not bad la definitely better than petrol station,btohqsg
ya it clear some shit stain on my car,btohqsg
petrol stn now jack up also.. now abt 12 dollars,btohqsg
wash once per wk alr 624 liao,btohqsg
Haha never leh. I don't see myself going so often. Only when I too busy to wash then I go there,btohqsg
If clean then no need to wash,btohqsg
Compare to petrol kiosk.  I think this one better üòÇ,btohqsg
Write to mp ask them to build,btohqsg
My parent house also the same .Many yr back I wrote to mp then they build. Pick near election period   very fast reply . This yr got presidential elections . Can write in and try request .,btohqsg
If not is open air carpark,btohqsg
Ya. Cause petrol kiosk more risk to swirls from their cloths or mops,btohqsg
My hse here no space le,btohqsg
But wa election year really action,btohqsg
Not even a small 1 ?,btohqsg
My parent there   they build a small car park   initially only 2 lvl . Less than 30 car lot . Then after that many people complain   they extended upwards,btohqsg
The closest mscp to my hse need walk abt 5 to 10mins,btohqsg
Same . Last time when I stay with my parent   I need to park 2 street away ‚Ä¶zzzzz,btohqsg
Doesnt make sense for me lah cus my hse come down straight is carpark alr,btohqsg
If i park mscp just to protect the car,btohqsg
Then I ownself sweat and kena drenched,btohqsg
Defeats the purpose of having the car in the first place,btohqsg
Recently i keep oneservice lta report all the pot holes,btohqsg
But your estate   no other people complain   good leh,btohqsg
They lived here since 1980s sia,btohqsg
In Taiwan  you can start to see a few ioniq 5 used as Yellow Taxisüòù,btohqsg
Tbf.. most cars r luxury to us alr..,btohqsg
