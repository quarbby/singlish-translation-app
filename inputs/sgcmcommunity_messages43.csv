Well said.. Creativity plays an important part! I ever got pple come comment boring photos. No sports cars,btohqsg
I said that cos I am so lazy to bring my gears around. Maybe I should sell my lens away 😅,btohqsg
Hi  I’m driving an old 2009 Honda Civic FD4 CVT. Lately my gearbox tends to be slipping a bit  especially after a cold start. Usually within first 5 minutes or so until vehicle is warmed up  I don’t accelerate past 3000rpm. Mostly quite light-footed. Can anyone advise me if I should get a gearbox overhaul?,btohqsg
Recently got my ATF fluid changed.,btohqsg
Let’s start on when we should overhaul our gearbox,btohqsg
Mostly I am suspecting a gear slip. Tried to flush my ATF fluid as well.,btohqsg
2) Weird noises in your engine,btohqsg
I guess I would say yes a little bit more draggy to accelerate,btohqsg
However nil other symptoms apart from that.,btohqsg
Nil difficulty in shifting gears as well.,btohqsg
Noted. Thank you for sharing the advice!,btohqsg
I’m still learning so take my advice with a pinch of salt 🤣,btohqsg
Can I request support too? Mine oso using mobile phone to shoot of cos not as good as pro shotshttps://www.instagram.com/p/CfTsH8UPv_5/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=,btohqsg
CVT can be a nightmare to repair.,btohqsg
Somemore now fd depre going up hehe,btohqsg
You really love the car? Go repair. Ask Dr Gearbox to check and quote,btohqsg
Apparently dr gearbox got mixed reviews,btohqsg
I am not an FD expert but I think you could get more specialized answers herehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/401461110048828/,btohqsg
Anyone knows a workshop that provides hood pins installation?,btohqsg
Hmm. Actually I have been getting multiple quotes  some from my own trusted workshops that I’ve been visiting for years  so my rough quote is about 1800 or so..,btohqsg
I’m waiting till the car’s time is up  which is in a couple years from now so I guess I’ll still be holding on for a while.,btohqsg
Thanks very much for all your inputs. Not the best at cars so pardon me if I misunderstood anything.,btohqsg
Now it’s in its 13th year and going strong still. Except for this issue that came up recently,btohqsg
Why 15 years.. well. Actually because I was saving for my marriage so I decided to continue for another 5 years  by then I should have finished my wedding and have a bit of savings so I can buy a brand new car.,btohqsg
No. It is fully stock from day 1 :),btohqsg
What’s on your mind for the next ride,btohqsg
Probably a Hyundai avante or a Corolla Altis :),btohqsg
Looking for a car with minimal maintenance,btohqsg
Would probably want a harrier but it’s a tad too expensive. I’m in my mid 20s!,btohqsg
Who knows along the way you get a huge blessing,btohqsg
Haha I’ll be thankful for that!,btohqsg
Bro u pay in full cash?,btohqsg
Cause you blacked out perhaps the best part of the Avante...,btohqsg
Will do a bigger down payment and monthly instalment. I’m not wealthy hahaha,btohqsg
gotta say that merc still looks better imo haha,btohqsg
Largely I think I’m looking for a fuss-free and minimal maintenance ride. Not super into the Brands or anything unless I’m super wealthy  would just buy a Rolls Royce instead.,btohqsg
u get a smoother engine and better system,btohqsg
but other wise the cn7 still a great car!,btohqsg
But because I travel a lot for leisure  the car will mostly just be more basic transport to work/etc haha,btohqsg
Japanese car is the way to go  cn7 advantage is on their Technology,btohqsg
Yup. Am really just considering the new Altis/Avante,btohqsg
Hyundai have really stepped up on their games these last few years.,btohqsg
but their interior ok la  if uw interior go for the koreans,btohqsg
kia is on top of the game,btohqsg
I have a CN7  I'm impressed by the car Technology.... None of Japanese entry level come close.,btohqsg
Altis drive sucks. avante better. tried both b4,btohqsg
Kia is old base plate  old technology... That's the old hyundai  lousier engine or inefficient engine for latest Kia vs Hyundai Avante.,btohqsg
They are different class of vehicle.,btohqsg
u put Benz logo on Hyundai. it will look premium instantly😂,btohqsg
It's all about branding  but take out brand and compare just appearance  maybe we have a different poll results 😂,btohqsg
Hmm. I think driving characteristics may be quite subjective.,btohqsg
But largely my concerns would be> ease of maintenance> cost of maintenance> driving comfort,btohqsg
I’m in my mid 20s  but I feel old for not being into the racey sporty car life anymore hahaha,btohqsg
Hmm.. if I’m in for this game  I would easily pick a Hyundai > Kia,btohqsg
Not sure why I would  but I guess I’m just a bigger fan of Hyundai.,btohqsg
Ah I see you’re an owner of a stinger hahaha. Whoops,btohqsg
Oh then Hyundai. Honeestly the difference between the two is quite minor  mostly the looks and cabin feels now,btohqsg
But I mean.. if I’m looking for a sporty handling car with good driving characteristics  I wouldn’t be looking at a Toyota/Honda etc. Probably would just save straight and go for a Porsche,btohqsg
But then again like I said  it’s subjective  so to each its own!,btohqsg
I think what matters most is how you look at yourself and what you desire :),btohqsg
still got  Genesis. will kill off the Benz beside immediately,btohqsg
Hyundai parts seems a lot easier to get in SG than Kia. Correct me if I’m wrong,btohqsg
As much as what people say.. Honestly Hyundai and Kia parts are reeally the same. They share tons of parts cause they are under Hyundai anyways,btohqsg
I drive a lot overseas.. or at least I think I do(?)  may be wrong  but I think driving is about it being relaxing after all these years of driving. Unless I’m at a track  of course.,btohqsg
So not a super huge fan of sporty cars haha. Maybe I’m getting older..,btohqsg
My friends around me drives sporty cars,btohqsg
But then they look at me and say erm.. hahaha so I guess it’s just me.,btohqsg
Cerato and Avante can't go wrong. They are the same class of vehicle  same target audience just targets different look.,btohqsg
Am waiting for the new Niro Hybrid to be in SG,btohqsg
So far C&C don’t carry them yet,btohqsg
But will probably go for a hybrid if I can afford one in the near future,btohqsg
If you wait a little longer.. EV6,btohqsg
But I think within the next 10 years at least  I won’t be looking to get a full EV.,btohqsg
Best I will do is a hybrid,btohqsg
From 2030 onwards  maybe I’ll be considering an EV  but then it’ll depend on the situation of the near future.,btohqsg
Of course  EV is the way to go in the future  but maybe not now.,btohqsg
But yes the EV6 looks absolutely gorgeous.,btohqsg
I drove the Niro EV last month around Jeju for a week! Loved it.,btohqsg
I couldn’t stop looking at it on roads and carparks,btohqsg
maintenance wise is still fairly okay because the E200/230 has many parts lying around. As long as you dont get a lemon  all should be fine,btohqsg
Only downside would be the fuel consumption which is marginal if you  ask me. Even with the increase in fuel prices  when you calculate it as a whole its abt 1-2k diff.,btohqsg
W204 would be better choice 😂,btohqsg
i like to believe anybody that wants to upgrade to conti should get a bulletproof conti first,btohqsg
yeah but so many are abused,btohqsg
how many yp u see driving W211,btohqsg
most are all uncle cars which are well taken care of,btohqsg
W212  W204 onwards tend to have electrical issues,btohqsg
u have 96% chance of spotting a yp when u look into an F10 window,btohqsg
I would rather a w211 than a f10 😂,btohqsg
same haha  W211 are cool imo,btohqsg
E230 is better if you have abit more cash,btohqsg
F10 should be compared to w212,btohqsg
if you are even richer can get E280,btohqsg
Yeah but Pre FL w212 does not come close to F10,btohqsg
if you want sporty there is alot of mods for the E55 which can be put on the E200,btohqsg
even the M5 V10 era also better,btohqsg
moral of the story  buy W211@deliciousweiming,btohqsg
for now  lets fix ur FD and enjoy it till the end of COE,btohqsg
if u say W140 S600 maybe haha,btohqsg
the car not even big enough,btohqsg
Pre FL E63 was 6.2L M156,btohqsg
FL E63 was 5.5L TT M157,btohqsg
Engine compartment no space for extra 4 cylinders,btohqsg
Ever thought of asking carwow to do a race with w211 and 212 e200 comparision,btohqsg
i can try that for you. W124  W210  W211 and W212,btohqsg
i will tell u with confidence W212 will win HAHA,btohqsg
Wanted compare the engine specs and the performance,btohqsg
yeah w212 really has a much better gearbox too and lighter,btohqsg
yeah W212 chassis is much much better,btohqsg
but i love the retro style of W211 and the quirks and features,btohqsg
interior in w211 is really good too for that era,btohqsg
swap out head unit and really is a bargain,btohqsg
Loved the one with the navi,btohqsg
haha yeah was better then idrive imo but since it’s 2022  abit out of date,btohqsg
haha but wei ming  if u want a modern car  go for CN7,btohqsg
Probably can ask you for help on my car 😂,btohqsg
haha why leh  what car do you drive?,btohqsg
this is true tank leh HAHA,btohqsg
If got money gonna tune it,btohqsg
Polester only have tuning for Drive-E engines tho,btohqsg
share a pic of ur ride leh haha,btohqsg
my dad used to have one too in red,btohqsg
been trying to find a S40 2.0T to work on as a project car tbh but its quite hard to find in SG,btohqsg
more common tunning company for volvo wld be BSR and Celtic,btohqsg
wah i like ur car sir! 🫡,btohqsg
Or maybe go for ac schnitzer?,btohqsg
Where got yp so rich one,btohqsg
"no offense to anyone but isn't the f10 more like uncle car?  you see yp driving one  first thought would be ''so nice father lend the yp his car to drive""",btohqsg

3.7L road tax + FC will discourage them,btohqsg
No problem leh. For the Ultimate Cool YP woot woot.,btohqsg
anyways  yeah i wanted an S40 because its probably the cheapest to work on. For example stage 3 + manual swap. Manual swap is much easier on this P2 cars because most S40 with the 2.0T overseas come with a manual gearbox  so parts are easily accesible.Plus the 2.0T shares the same engine block as the 2.3 2.4 and 2.5L  so the engine block is actually durable unlike the 2.5L S60r/V70r or the more commonly seen XC90 2.5T. The 2.5L tend to have a crack engine block because Volvo decided to cut cost and just bore the cylinders without stroking hence the cylinder walls are actually very thin. Modding the 2.0T would therefore probably be the most reliable in making large amounts of power at its limit.Also P2 generation is much easier to work on compared to P3.,btohqsg
that’s a lot to digest  Mr Volvo,btohqsg
ya sia. but that’s why JX is Mr Volvo for a reason😉,btohqsg

yeah mann  i will tell you the secret next time😉😉,btohqsg
You’re probably gonna tell me it’s good looks  good genes or good brains. None of the above I have 🤣🤣,btohqsg
haha i saw one on SGCM but its an NA  i wld prefer turbo so that i can zhng hehe,btohqsg
But tht 2.4L in the V50 is actually very sought after overseas. Most S60r/V70r will swap to the more durable 2.4L after their 2.5L engine block crack.,btohqsg
Where got Mr Anwo! You are smart  handsome and hardworking... THATS THE SECRET!,btohqsg
Honestly the 2.0T is strong enough. Just hybrid turbo and do supporting mods  easy 350hp,btohqsg
Obviously manual swap too cos the auto gb is dog💩,btohqsg
For our Mr Volvo. Super cool leh this ride.,btohqsg
that made my day (even though we both know that's not true)!!!,btohqsg
I shan't even pretend to understand what the two of you are talking about 😉,btohqsg
LOL haha just upgrade to 16T,btohqsg
i see many people upgrade to 19T but the engine definitely cant handle the power,btohqsg
19T is rated for 500hp which the engine block will never make😂😂,btohqsg

Interior is different! Based on what some members have shared  I will pick the 86😁,btohqsg
better save some extra $ for the ws trips,btohqsg

You get a piece of begedil,btohqsg
bro u like NA is it@awj_mood,btohqsg
Instead of the air intake facing the front (like the image above)  your air intake is facing the driver/front passenger. Am I right?,btohqsg
You sit one corner for 10mins,btohqsg
eh sgcm donated $10 to ur funds for ur next car,btohqsg
Yes BUT nothing wrong with it facing anywhere,btohqsg
But its just that he’s blocking the open pod from getting cold air,btohqsg
Which defeats the purpose of getting an open pod,btohqsg
yasss that’s right. Idk eh may have to seek the opinion of some experts here HAHAHA,btohqsg
see what they recommend you to do,btohqsg
Either flip it or install a pipe to direct the air,btohqsg
Any other things that don’t make sense?😂,btohqsg
But you also directed the air towards the pod,btohqsg
I need to emphasise on it doesn’t matter  to a certain extend  where the pod is facing.,btohqsg
Just as long as you let it do its job well,btohqsg

Spc more ex than esso sia 😱,btohqsg
tmr all will drop . shell is the leading indicator,btohqsg
Im still waiting for Sinopec to drop  despite it dropping less than 12hrs ago🙂,btohqsg
Make the switch to esso ?,btohqsg
Yup I may just go to Esso if I need to😆,btohqsg
actual octane closer to indicated octane,btohqsg
Anyway  do yall feel a difference in the petrol quality across the various brands? (Eg. Esso 95 Vs Sinopec 95 Vs Shell 95)Pls share some insights and knowledge on it!!,btohqsg
Wah you read my mind Mr Volvo,btohqsg
Esso > shell > caltex/spc > sinopec,btohqsg
esso 98 is better than v power,btohqsg
Wah Sinopec got so jialat meh?😩,btohqsg
im sorry sinopec users  tried it once and it was quite dog💩,btohqsg
idk who is even buying the premium from them haha,btohqsg
I pump both Sinopec and Esso 95. TBH  I can hardly tell the difference leh…,btohqsg
i used to buy form a store in ubi. but he is not longer there. then there is also a store in genting lane but not sure which. prefer a box  of 6 quartz american style of packing. do you know?,btohqsg
there is at most 1-2% difference... people say one petrol is worse than another is all in the mind,btohqsg
if you are stock you cannot feel the diff,btohqsg
Yes sir! I can’t help but agree🤭,btohqsg
but if you are on a tune  difference is noticeable,btohqsg
my stock cars are always on SPC 95,btohqsg
Stock with a good set of performance tyres is the best,btohqsg
Changing any components means not stock liao,btohqsg
itchy backside mod until 7km/l  change coilovers  end up backside pain  wallet pain,btohqsg
Wah this one debatable🤭 Stock have different meaning to different ppl hahaha,btohqsg
i mod my tire cap is it modded?,btohqsg
i change from black to polestar gold,btohqsg
now i'm a public transport peasant,btohqsg
Yay!!! I zhng for the community,btohqsg
I see…actly coilovers aren’t as uncomfortable as ppl think it is eh,btohqsg
sometimes the best setup might not be the stiffest!,btohqsg
no offence to the other cheryls here,btohqsg
Sinopec buy from Shell 😅Their X-Power is V-Power 😅,btohqsg
This one I don't wanna really rely on,btohqsg
Then the only way is to try yourself lol,btohqsg
So just asking anyone who knows or drives it,btohqsg
Haha that's not what I actually looking to buy that car but idk anyone who drives that,btohqsg
But avante dk how it's built,btohqsg
Do take note it wasn’t stock,btohqsg
It’s good  cheap  reliable and good fuel consumption,btohqsg
Kia can't afford haha new ones especially,btohqsg
I buy coe cars just full cash buy,btohqsg
yeah find a clean zc31 and ur set haha,btohqsg
but fuel is very marginal imo haha,btohqsg
if u travel 20k a year  the diff maybe $1-2k diff,btohqsg
i rather spend 30k less on a coe car and spend 1-2k on fuel...,btohqsg
Sinopac OEM shell leh  you sure?,btohqsg
tried on diff tuned cars but still had knocking,btohqsg
i believe the additives are different,btohqsg
shell v power not so bad,btohqsg
Day 123 of waiting for picture of Mr Pete's aventador with hud,btohqsg
Sinopac usually many people especially those who knew about sinopac and shell,btohqsg
You guys really feel the difference ah between oetrols,btohqsg
I can't. Slow car is slow. 😂,btohqsg
my car goes by mood not petrol,btohqsg
- every boxer and rotary owners,btohqsg
Talking about it  does our fuel have ethanol?,btohqsg
next time we meet i jio a few friends and we try with empty tanks haha,btohqsg
i can feel an insult coming by seeing you type@Jingxunn,btohqsg
but when u tune the car  it needs the pure high octane.,btohqsg
you are goes through head gaskets too,btohqsg
lol I seen malaysians detune their car to take Ron95 HAHA,btohqsg
shell v power is 97 in msia,btohqsg
v power racing then is premium,btohqsg
I love loud cars but there’s a time and place for everything,btohqsg
Walao eh got this car keep revving and whack at my MSCP,btohqsg

nope  but they have 2 grades of diesel,btohqsg

Anyone saw the van that was on fire?,btohqsg
And the fella on fire too?,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admincan we have an article about what could cause this and how can we avoid this,btohqsg
We have an article about that!,btohqsg
Back earlier this year  there is a beetle on fire as well.,btohqsg
I stopped using Shell after I found rust inside my fuel tank  that was many years ago. Have been using Caltex on one car and Esso on the other. Both Conti  and both using 92. Never considered others besides BP. In Malaysia Petronas is still the best choice for me.... Support my customer so they can pay me😜😜😜,btohqsg
Regular b&b car here  I getBetter mileage with essoBetter smoothness with caltexBetter generally better power and mileage with shellSpc and sinopec I will never pump. Feels thin and the consumption feels high.,btohqsg
Safra discount also 22%. One week. Too bad i foreigner,btohqsg
Old but still gold sir. As with many things in life. 👍🏼,btohqsg
Key takeaways for me would be: good to keep an in car fire extinguisher (not just for yourself but may also save another car)  use approved components  don’t mess with electricals unless one really has to  be religious on maintenance and don’t sit on visible fluid leakages 😁,btohqsg
One of your helpers went to help you retrieve something from your car? 😉😉,btohqsg
Which is a smart move sir. Otherwise one can only take 97-98 100% of the time.,btohqsg
Not sure about Singapore but fairly common in the US to have off pumps. this excludes any introduced from fuel additives.,btohqsg
Maybe the acceleration stuck like mine 😂,btohqsg
Shell V-Power@98 returns this JulyThe Shell 'V-Power@98' promotion is returning once again from today until 31 July 2022 at 10:00pm!👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you pump Shell V-Power!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Correct me if I’m wrong but if you drive an everyday car  it’s a waste of money to pump v power right,btohqsg
is going to jb pump really worth it? I see savings not alot. somemore so jam these days...unless can pump their Ron 95 at 2RM then midnite go aso worth😂,btohqsg
V power is soul of the car   music to the engine,btohqsg
If it runs well I think don’t need to use V Power la,btohqsg
Can hear motors whirring sound also,btohqsg
