You went to the branch sign up ?,btohqsg
Oh this sms means i have signed up for it?Another question i have. does hsbc compare the july balance with my may or june balance when calculating the july interest?,btohqsg
If you registered in Jun then reference month is May. If you registered in Jul then reference month is Jun.Everyday+ Rewards is always 1 month before.,btohqsg
It means they received your SMS liao.,btohqsg
I see online have 10% off for residents  will get the same onsite?,btohqsg
Cant buy online when u onsite?,btohqsg
I already say in the group yesterday. Those having hsbc cards can't sign up online. Need to go branch sign up EGA,btohqsg
Read more talk less ‚ùåTalk more don‚Äôt read ‚úÖ,btohqsg
This is signing up for the promotion not signing up for the EGA account. You really should read what they are referring to before making any comments,btohqsg
A daily dose of commenting without understanding,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt have to GO DOWN to the branch to register for the promotion. Just sms will do. Imagine everybody went down to branch just to tell the bank they want sign up  bank very free meh,btohqsg
I understand... I going to the branch soon for EGA acc,btohqsg
Ok thanks for updating us on what you are going to do,btohqsg
Make sure you go down branch to register every month‚Ä¶Get your queue number.Send the SMS in front of the CSO.This is the confirm sure way you will be registered.,btohqsg
No. Go branch is to get EGA done..,btohqsg
You bring whole family go? One time do all.,btohqsg
Don't understand why hsbc still operate until 5pm... scb already open until 7pm,btohqsg
Ya I also dont understand why some mcd 24 hours but my nearby mcd close at 11pm,btohqsg
lol first time I encountered. Uob credit card statement generated on Sunday 9th June.,btohqsg
Operating 24 hrs are open when there is higher crowds,btohqsg
Saturday your house key cannot work?,btohqsg
Maybe auto generated  so work 24hrs  where there is higher crowds,btohqsg
Hi  like to know is there any to get cashback or miles if merchant only accept paynow,btohqsg
Perhaps search chat history ‚ÄúPaynow cashback‚Äù?,btohqsg
4% + Extra 2% that is ‚Äúpossible‚Äù once a year doesn‚Äôt make the EIR 6% . !!,btohqsg
2 accounts makes it possible for a whole year. But depending on the promo's cash reward also.,btohqsg
via grabpay but need to topup. Commonly known is topup with uob absolute for 0.3%,btohqsg
Hi all  like to ask for big item on sealy mattress with kris+ beside using uob krisflyer  what alternative credit card gives best cashback . Best it helps to meet $500 spend for ocbc/uob one savings account (not a must),btohqsg
Hi. May I ask. If use healthhub app to pay hospital bill. Using Citi reward card need pair with amaze? Or use directly will do? Thanks,btohqsg
Need 3 accounts to make it work  AND if UOB change interest rates shortly after your fund is locked  nothing you can do.,btohqsg
Maybe he include the non-UOB bank account as part of the 3 ü§™,btohqsg
Why need 3 accounts? And the information is correct as of now  who knows when the interest rate will change and what the promo amount is,btohqsg
Userzavis.‚Äãhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:do not send unrelated links without context,btohqsg
HSBC EGA got 1% more from Everyday+ rewards  how is it equally good?,btohqsg
Maybe his gf in this chat  then his gf know got extra % for hsbc will ask him xfer money,btohqsg
Like that I won't take esaver. Take EGA,btohqsg
The gf knows can eat him 750 but eat him 350 only. So no need worry ü§£,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt take both? Rotate your funds around,btohqsg
I'm overwhelmed with messages in Honey Money that I have stop reading.Is there a tool to help skip all the Terry messages or hide from view. sometimes more than 1/2 the messages generated or replied to his post that is not useful and really affecting the quality of this chatgroup.Not sure how admin can help on this.,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone here have tried the loopholes on ocbc360 account(e.g credit your ocbc 360 account from your other bank accounts as salary) with success?,btohqsg
There are some data points  you can also try and let us know,btohqsg
I feel the same too. This was exactly why he was banned in other groups because he was always flooding the chat with useless comments.,btohqsg
I tried last month but it doesn't seem to work. Ocbc360 doesn't credit the interests that I should be getting,btohqsg
From another bank with another name?,btohqsg
From another bank but same name,btohqsg
You could use the search function in Telegram  use keywords of the topic and questions you have in mind :),btohqsg
Shhh... quiet now.MutedTerry .‚Äãfor 30 days.Reason:Please take your time and read to learn from others during this period before you provide your own comment,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I will try for the next month if this really works,btohqsg
Does the app not tell you whether you have met the criteria or not? You can try this month and check if it has met if the app can tell you if you met or not.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not necessary to read through every single messages. You can just search what you want to find thru searchI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to blame those that replied to him as we did answer to his question but he still doesn‚Äôt understand it after multiple times,btohqsg
