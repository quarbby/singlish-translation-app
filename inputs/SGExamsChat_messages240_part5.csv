You‚Äôre like a bus that comes every 1h,btohqsg
There are 2 major types of intermolecular forces  one of which depends on the size of the molecule/atom  another which depends on the charges in the molecule,btohqsg
Nth else I zao alr ah,btohqsg
Gg sry haha I didn't receive notif,btohqsg
Noble gases are monoatomic so it doesn't have a large electron cloud,btohqsg
So you don't get strong forces from the first type,btohqsg
Noble gases are also electrically neutral,btohqsg
So you also don't get much of the second type,btohqsg
Electron cloud size increases down the group  boiling points increase,btohqsg
But they are all stil gases at rt,btohqsg
Net result is that there's just not much intermolecular forces of attraction for noble gases,btohqsg
Mhm I think I get it,btohqsg
You'll learn the names of these types of attraction later on,btohqsg

If there's no physical lessons then it's almost pointless to go like university orientations or RC/hall/hostels,btohqsg
Eh anybody from IP here heard of something called the bilingual scholarship,btohqsg
I heard that some Hwa Chong students were offered it but I‚Äôve never heard of it,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the closest one that I heard of,btohqsg
But if it‚Äôs BSP why would they call it bilingual,btohqsg
Or is BSP just too long to pronounce,btohqsg
btw if any1 is in NUS,btohqsg
double counting mods means if a 4 mc mod overlaps with my grad requirements  means it becomes 8 mc total?,btohqsg
or the 8 mcs worth of mods is taken up by the 4 mc mod  freeing up 4 free mcs that i can use for a UE/mod etc?,btohqsg
uhh if ddp you include it inside both major's gpa calc,btohqsg
but it's just worth a flat 4mc,btohqsg
It means it's worth 4 MCs for each degree seperately,btohqsg
There's also a max to double counting so yep,btohqsg
but if your majors not very similar then shouldn't hit the limit,btohqsg
Is anyone able to access the polyclinic appointment page,btohqsg
No. I mentioned you just out of jest because Nitrate ion was asking about noble gases and your username has ‚Äúneon‚Äù in it lol,btohqsg
hi guys! anyone here studies computer science / intends to study computer science and won't mind being interviewed for a school assignment?,btohqsg
hi anyone has either o lvl higher chinese marking scheme for composition or for h1 chinese,btohqsg
they don't disclose the marking scheme tho :_,btohqsg
If anyone needs help with proofreading or feedback for your uni appeals (if/when the appeal portal is open)  feel free to msg me!(for free ofc) :),btohqsg
