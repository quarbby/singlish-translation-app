Ya it‚Äôs M3 competitor. Same space.,btohqsg
Kind of. 19‚Äù wheels but it has to have that big becoz of the weight. The whole car felt very heavy.,btohqsg
19‚Äù is good enough. Single motor is good enough too.,btohqsg
Volvo always make heavy cars haha,btohqsg
I would at the single motor long range is the best. But to add driver assistance features is 7.2k to top up from what you see at the price tag.,btohqsg
7.2k for the additional features? Does it worth that much? Its the upgraded brakes etc right,btohqsg
No no. It‚Äôs 7.2k for the driver assistance pack or pilot pack.. The upgraded brakes is called performance pack another top up of 16 000 which is only for the dual motor.For your reference._*COST OPTIONS*_1. Wall Box Charger - $5 0002. Upgrade from 19‚Äô rims to 20‚Äô rims - $2 3003. Nappa Leather with Ventilated Seats - $9 000- - - - -*Pilot Pack* - $7 200(only for Single Motors)1. LED front fog lamp2. 360 degree camera3.

Auto dimmed wing mirror8. Park Assist Side- - - - -*Performance Pack* - $16 000(Only for Dual motor)1. Ohlins Dual Flow Valve dampers with 22 suspension settings2. Gold Brembo 4 piston Front brakes3. 20‚Äô 4Y Spoke Polished Forged Alloy Wheels with Swedish Gold Valve Caps4. Performance Tyres5. Swedish Gold Seat Belts6. High Gloss Roof segment- - - - -*Plus Pack*(Standard for all 3 variants)e,btohqsg
Wall box charger doesnt work on hdb right lol,btohqsg
No.. only for landed private properties,btohqsg
I ever seen a unit at tiong bahru pull his cable down frm lvl 2 unit down to charge the tesla,btohqsg
For me the pilot pack is a must to get if you get a Polestar. Otherwise it‚Äôs barebones with no driver assistance tech is a bit dumb. To cost 227k.,btohqsg
I only need the 360cam. The rest pretty much useless for daily Driving,btohqsg
Blindspot monitoring shld come as standard for all cars.,btohqsg
I think no 3  4  5  6 and 8 are quite useful. Enough to justify the 7.2k.,btohqsg
Ya unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt. So this was the main reason I feel Polestar is out alr. Unless they can throw it in for free.,btohqsg
Haha  these are the options that i wont use and will Turn it off. Except 5,btohqsg
The current Avante I‚Äôm driving has these. It‚Äôs very good to help me avoid those hazardous drivers.,btohqsg
True.. but sometimes too much tech it takes over the joy of driving and i dont like to be too reliant on the tech too,btohqsg
there a 40-4k arf rebate when u purchase car  it straight deduction off the total car price,btohqsg
I‚Äôm paying $130/mth for fuel. Each tank 700-800km,btohqsg
So it possible $200/mth for fuel,btohqsg
Good mileage u have there. What model u‚Äôre on,btohqsg
I heard some people with same model can go up 1000km per tank. I Nvr manage to achieve tat,btohqsg
Alot of talks abt 3cyl cars.,btohqsg
Stock tire is 16‚Äù  I upgraded to 18‚Äù. Maybe tat explain the poor fc,btohqsg
Yes  higher vib. Idling at 950rpm.,btohqsg
Is it noisy? The taxi idling sound,btohqsg
Vib damper  belt and tensioner need to replace more often,btohqsg
For mine nope. Only cold start. After warm up it sound like typical BMW Eng noise,btohqsg
I also work in cbd  park at Tanjong pagar  then take mrt,btohqsg
Cheapest is marina sq season or chinatown point hdb parking,btohqsg
Or the road side parking at amoy area but open carpark i dont park. Lol,btohqsg
There was one period  Marina one had free parking at certain office hours,btohqsg
Tesla don‚Äôt have dealer margin like polestar and higher omv and got super charger network and better tech .If interior is an issue maybe try see the white seats that will make it way nicer   model y is coming soon also,btohqsg
Yes tesla is very good price as there is no dealer margin   look at the cheapest model 3 standard the omv is already at 60 k and that is like an e300,btohqsg
You can find the survey in our pinned msgs,btohqsg
Correct. With no dealer margin it‚Äôs considered good alr.,btohqsg
Yes as it is cheaper in terms of buying price   but with a higher omv   someDealer margin is higher then the omvJust look at the agent asking price vs the total basic costhttps://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/onemotoring/Buying/Car_Cost_Update/M032-Car_Cost_Update.pdf,btohqsg
Ya. Totally agree. I think if we do such homework more  we will make more informed choices.,btohqsg
If you are not staying in landed the package dealer give for ev is just pointless like free wall charger   that you can‚Äôt install   free servicing   that ev don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
Would taking the 5 year charging by Hyundai for example make sense then?,btohqsg
No super charging network   tesla is charging for free and the super charger is only for tesla   like water way point tesla got 3 charger and charge plus got 1Tesla can use charge plus charger but Hyundai can‚Äôt use tesla charger   and tesla charger is faster,btohqsg
So no matter what it still isn‚Äôt too attractive. To consider even other EV Brand‚Äôs.,btohqsg
Yes I got 500 kwh sp free charging tilll now I only use 200 after 3 month   as it is very tough to go to a specific charging location   there might be like 8 cars waiting infront of you,btohqsg
I see.. you are using Which EV at the moment?,btohqsg
Hopefully COE is more reasonable in time to come,btohqsg
Ioniq 5 shld be in cat b right,btohqsg
But I believe even after their 90 kWh < PR < 130 KWh rating it may be not be significantly reduced ya?Since battery capacity is the measure for road tax for EVs.,btohqsg
Ya Cat B. Becoz of the Power of about 137kW. The battery is about 58 KWH,btohqsg
110kw is only about 140bhp plus,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs why all those Cat A EVs are so short in range. Becoz of smaller battery = smaller power.,btohqsg
Yeah but my road tax is 5300 a year then increase to 5600 next year   as a no emission car kinda too much,btohqsg
Yup ev is different from ice as the high end model got much better battery also,btohqsg
Not sure how to find a decently priced one in future. To be frank I feel Tesla‚Äôs entry model is still positioned as a luxury car in Singapore‚Äôs context.,btohqsg
Yeah but sg carmart put them under Normal sedan,btohqsg
Hang on sir! We're publishing it in 2 minutes,btohqsg

Obviously that‚Äôs per month rightMy car costs are about the same. Petrol 300-400.Insurance $200 a month is already considered exp. I know people who pay less than 1k a yearYou don‚Äôt seem like you drive anyway,btohqsg
I spend about $500-600 per mth on petrol,btohqsg
In recent months I drive lesser  about 120L per month. Used to pump about 200L per month  several months ago when 95 was about $2.50 per L. I travel east to west  fuel about 12km/L. One month about 2k+ km. I wun consider it as Low tho,btohqsg
If you spend about 600 per month on petrol. Before the Russia war  95 is about $2.70  about $2.3/L after discounts. Every month about 260L? Assume only 10km/L  you average travel 85-90km per day leh. You travel east to north to west back to east every single day ah.,btohqsg

Yes but my agent can give unbeatable prices due to special deals with the principal insurers üòâ,btohqsg
Not sure if allowed to share here or not though so didn't share,btohqsg
Oh i see...I heard its low insurance upfront cost means higher excess and vice versa...,btohqsg
Might also be PHV. Their insurance very high,btohqsg
Got $7 off $70 voucher to get,btohqsg
Other ways of lowering would be to use certain companies which are scheme agents...these have the freedom to use their own underwriter..and have special exclusive deals with the principal insurers..so can bring your premiums really low. Also the benefit is they are not tagged to one insurer so each time renew will always get the lowest price one,btohqsg
I try to lower but is only for named driver only,btohqsg
you can try contact my insurer @86558558  just say Jay recommended  then will get special deals,btohqsg

If u haven‚Äôt gotten the bikes  can consider foldable bikes instead which will fit into most suvs,btohqsg
I have SUV. Outlander. But cargo area is not high enough. So low loading MPV configuration is best,btohqsg
Serena works v well with bikes. But is very narrow and odd looking and i dont like the drivetrain: the petrol engine runs at relatively high rpm and is a bit annoying. Some owners have their Serena interior stripped out and install more sounds insulation. Nissan should do that at the factory.,btohqsg
Haha. Mountain Biking is our hobby.,btohqsg
I think there are a lot of give and take. Mpv will have higher roof  but a lot of drivers prefer suv for the drive,btohqsg
Cannot do this on a foldy üòÑ,btohqsg
The C4  is brilliantly efficient given it's external dimensions. Roof height a bit low for 2 full sized bikes but might squeeze in. Ive inspected it but need to actually try a bike fit.,btohqsg

Can Car dealers in cahoot to purposely bid higher price? Lack of transparency leh,btohqsg
New vezel is now cat a??,btohqsg
Not sure but possible explanations (for Cat B)1. Tesla bidding 15% above the PQP to secure for their customers. It‚Äôs stated in their contract they can bid from 5-15% from the PQP.2. Event cars from Lexus  Volvo  BMW. For Airshow  OCBC Cycling   HSBC Women Golf Tour. Need to register them then can use.3. Last min sales of Cat B > Cat A EVs,btohqsg
Yes quite a number of tesla owner bided plus 15% as they will not charge you the difference even if it is below 15% increment,btohqsg
Tesla‚Äôs model of sale really disrupting  our AD car sales landscape.,btohqsg
Why so if the coe is 100 k it will bid max to 115 k   but if it stop at 105 k   the customer only been charge 105 k,btohqsg
Old Vezel is Cat B due to BHP?,btohqsg
Actuallt I typo  it was disrupting.,btohqsg
I was taken surprised when the new Vezel is not Cat A  as if previously it isn't haha,btohqsg
I mean the ADs really have to match their bidding style alr.,btohqsg
And in turn forcing upward bidding pressure for everyone else.,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs a good change though  it‚Äôs really no frills   zero markups.,btohqsg
I would wish for all ADs to do this.,btohqsg
Cause tesla got no dealer   is the buyer bid themself haha,btohqsg
I would prefer this but I think everyone must collude üòÜ,btohqsg
All the Tesla Buyers don‚Äôt spoil market pls.,btohqsg
The sales just give you the coe form and you fill it up and go bid,btohqsg
How‚Äôs the financing arrangement if you don‚Äôt mind sharing,btohqsg
They will prefer you to pay in full,btohqsg
Like we have to source our own and let them know or?,btohqsg
If you want to loan they will just give u a few bank contact   and you go and contact them yourself,btohqsg
No tie up   so you choose anything you want,btohqsg
Or if you alr secured one yourself you just need to let them know?,btohqsg
Go them is straight forward   they don‚Äôt warn u dealer margin u settle yourself   you want loan 3 years 5 years or 7 years not their buisness,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt want to know haha they just ask u when u pay,btohqsg
They tell u the phone when can deliver   and the paper work required you settle yourself,btohqsg
Even for the pricing is from the website   but they willl sent you a final invoice before car collection,btohqsg
If you expect fancy show room with food and ppl service you   then tesla is not for you   if you want transparent and just get the car and do your own thing it is the best purchase experience you will ever have,btohqsg
I ok with the transparent part. Definitely,btohqsg
I just need to find out more on the financing paperwork.,btohqsg
No ppl will hard sell you on the loan   insurance   overtrade   all these,btohqsg
Best ever. Can find own insurance  loan,btohqsg
Yes cause they don‚Äôt do tie up,btohqsg
But retaining car plate is troublesome as you will need to go and retain your self in lta website and go to shop that do car plate,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt do such service for you if you want to retain car plate   so you need to diy,btohqsg
Wait so getting a Tesla is just simply placing the order for the car on the website then bidding for a cat B COE?,btohqsg
What about all the extra stuff like ARF and all that,btohqsg
You go the showroom and click yourself at the Mac,btohqsg
Got so many fees have to pay to the Govt,btohqsg
It‚Äôs alr priced in alr. The 113k is alr factored.,btohqsg
I see the model 3 at 97k nw eh,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the CoE that‚Äôs variable. I believe they will help you go thru the paperwork,btohqsg
It‚Äôs kWH battery. Not kW power.,btohqsg
Dafuq they dropped the base price?,btohqsg
Oh or maybe the website is in USD ah,btohqsg
Ya USD. You follow this. Accurate.,btohqsg
113 245 is alr factoring all your ARF or whatever .,btohqsg
Then you add your CoE. So now is Cat B right   98 010.,btohqsg

Becoz of the road tax quote hefty o,btohqsg
314 saving is for the past 31 days,btohqsg
Ya 5300 for first year is hefty,btohqsg
The petrol savings vs the car price and tax,btohqsg
but you get to show off the tesla,btohqsg
can‚Äôt put a price on that,btohqsg
There an arf reduction of 45 k upon purchase,btohqsg
I‚Äôm low ses.. no need to show off,btohqsg
It not like a model s plaid   nothing to show off,btohqsg
Haven't come yet lah u should wait till model x comes,btohqsg
Maybe the price will be like x7  xc90,btohqsg
Got a model x for sale 6 seater,btohqsg
I can buy two large seven seater ice suvs  still got left over,btohqsg
Ya omv is over 130 k,btohqsg
But how to open when u are in a cramped carpark lot,btohqsg
I feel the experience of owning one will kinda make up for it but isn't bmw ix same price,btohqsg
Can open one sensors will detect close proximity with a vehicle and the doors will open at a more vertical angle,btohqsg
It required just little space to open u can go and google it,btohqsg
Ok‚Ä¶ wait till I strike toto‚Ä¶ else it won‚Äôt be on my list,btohqsg
Model x is much more expensive at 130 k omv compare ix 90 k omv,btohqsg
Thats why I will personally take the ix over model x any day but it's not available in seven seater so I guess for now Tesla model x is the only viable 7 seater,btohqsg
But isn't the EQB releasing in Singapore soon,btohqsg
So if you want to house kids in the third row then u should wait for the EQB should be more affordable than a model x,btohqsg
This is quite funny. Nice share@Cxspeed,btohqsg
Not that practical for normal MSCPs...,btohqsg
i mean for most cars u got to trade some practicality for looks and style like for example the scirocco and golf,btohqsg

So I choose to wear masks  and gradually see how,btohqsg
I hope this good sense prevails with the masses,btohqsg
When the daily infected rate goes up‚Ä¶ ppl will continue to wear,btohqsg
Just hope that it goes down  then gradually  ppl can go without masks voluntarily,btohqsg

Hi guys wanna ask..Lancer Ex GT 2.0 how's the fc..,btohqsg
2.0 and it a old car,btohqsg
How good will the fc be,btohqsg
It based on the older mivec glxi engine. The car is heavy. 6 speed cvt. You will be getting a Honda fit or Prius if you worried about fuel economy,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say 9km/l. Most 2.0 NA gets this fc,btohqsg
On highway maybe 11-12km/l; city drive defensively 9-10km/l,btohqsg
City driving be prepared 8.5-9/l and highway 11-12/l,btohqsg
I was getting 11.5km/l when new back in 2008. Now need to factor in wear and tear...9-10km/l my guess,btohqsg
My old 2.5 litre when new was about 9km/L and when past 10 years about 8.5km/L. I expect slightly better for 2.0,btohqsg
BMW E90 318i 2 Litre 4 cylinders averages at 8.6km/lData collected over 10 years  8x xxx km,btohqsg
Any civic 1.5T 2018 model driver here?,btohqsg
Oh coz driving 2008 civic 1.6..quite bad also the fc now..not sure whether i need to wait for service mileage/date then go..not sure if servicing part plays a part for the fc,btohqsg
Maybe u wan to consider to do walnut blasting to clean the intake/exhaust valve  intake manifold and clean the throttle body too,btohqsg
It will help restore some performance Reduce fc as well,btohqsg
Honda engine generally very solid seldom break down at high mileage,btohqsg
How bad is quite bad. If its really bad there might be other issues at play,btohqsg
What are the simple affordable 'basic procedures' to do at the workshop if the car has bad FC?,btohqsg
what is your definition of affordable?,btohqsg
Bad FC?Heavy legAir filterPlugTyreHeavy loadsCity usage,btohqsg
Say  not above $300 per 'procedure'.,btohqsg
tyre air - free from petrol station,btohqsg
each item above are below $300,btohqsg
My friend did this  but the workshop did not remove the TB  they just removed the air box  sprayed cleaning solution into the TB and cleaned wherever they can reach with a cloth on their finger. Is it correct?,btohqsg
different price different type of workmanship,btohqsg
ok. did he feel any improvement? i am guessing not.,btohqsg
This seems to be the ‚Äúusual‚Äù method:),btohqsg
Yes this is very true‚Ä¶. U have to be quite lucky to see a Honda break down,btohqsg
He said the rpm does not fluctuate 'so much' now. Its more stable. This is the improvement.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the purpose of cleaning the TB:),btohqsg
Cos it can be very ‚Äúelaborate ‚Äú too,btohqsg
Cos I saw on YouTube  the TB is removed for cleaning...üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
That‚Äôs more elaborate and will prob cost more,btohqsg
Normally to remove TB for cleaning will cost $80-$100.,btohqsg
Engine deficient could be caused by  carbon deposit  valve clearance  piston ring worn out  catalytic converter partial clogged etc. too many possibility,btohqsg
Oh I see. Thanks for the info.,btohqsg

Btw Telegram has a video call function that is like ‚ÄúZoom‚Äù or ‚ÄúTeams‚Äù call  is the SGCM team looking to have occasional Q&A or AMA with the group members as part of publicity and interactions?,btohqsg

Electric vehicle owners can now locate a charging point and compare rates on a unified app.The service is available as a new module on theMyTransport.SGmobile app.https://str.sg/whou,btohqsg
LoL got one video on using ev to make delivery  after one morning the power left is 40% üòÇ,btohqsg
Best is  after charging during lunch time  increased to 60% only.,btohqsg
doesnt seem so bad? Can tahan until 6pm,btohqsg
quite surprised it didnt last so long. maybe he could do more deliveries with better route optimisation,btohqsg
If diesel or petrol  not that high consumption rite? Based on my experience I pump after a day and half,btohqsg
no idea  not an EV user  wont be for a very long while lol,btohqsg
That's rite! I wonder what's the incentive if we adopt EVs and have to spend more time charging our vehicle than charging our phones üòÇ,btohqsg
IMO electric car technology is in the high growth phase  like mobile phones 15 years ago. Every 1-2 years the tech improves dramatically. Eventually like the way phones are now  tech will plateau and 1-2 years old cars wont look like dinosaur tech,btohqsg
thats when i will go to EVs. too much early adopter pains to do so right now IMO,btohqsg
This only applies to Malaysian car going into Singapore correct,btohqsg
We Singapore plated car dun need do anything right,btohqsg
Yes this is only for malaysia car,btohqsg
But if I not wrong  sg car if want to enter malaysia  need to apply vep also,btohqsg
COE premiums are constantly increasing and petrol prices are at its highest. But Singaporeans are still buying cars????ü§Øhttps://www.sgcarmart.com/news/events_features.php?AID=4096&fbclid=IwAR3OvpXXE7LOvVONtxQKvgu336fhENnR7WR32izZvtnXptFJg_TkJRUUy0M,btohqsg
I am very curious what cars these people are buying,btohqsg
I think should be PHVs and they‚Äôre typical cars,btohqsg
It's those taxi companies and phv companies,btohqsg
Especially now the government has clear category for the COE type for evs,btohqsg
