It is too obvious  one big trolley with 8 boxes,btohqsg
Mine was $40 plus also 4 drop off.,btohqsg
but your one i think need van la this one,btohqsg
walao eh Jurong Port some more,btohqsg
Jurong Port Rd need pass to go in.,btohqsg
Will probably take a few days break and see if the situation still the same.,btohqsg
If no improvements just go get a permanent job with CPF,btohqsg
You do full time or PT,btohqsg
Today LLM rates v v low,btohqsg
20 dollars round trip Jurong east to Sim lim square,btohqsg
Don't deliver if prices ridiculous low,btohqsg
I stayed home and spent time with family.,btohqsg
Im transitioning into full time soon. Kena retrenched by my company,btohqsg
Maybe because of the 9% GST that already started ,btohqsg
I think things will pick up in the net few days,btohqsg
December was all the Xmas and NY deliveries,btohqsg
I think better to do PT while finding a FT job that comes with CPF,btohqsg
ya that is what i doing,btohqsg
I saw online people doing grab food deliveries also can earn 8000 a month why are we even doing llm sia wtf,btohqsg
HAHAHA! Itâ€™s our own choice mahh Bro?  We choose to do it on our own terms and conditions. If you think GrabFood can do better  donâ€™t wait.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m reconsidering why Iâ€™m still doing Lalamove,btohqsg
If even riding bicycle sending food can earn more,btohqsg
Grabfood low overhead and running cost. No need petrol and almost zero maintenance cost,btohqsg
LLM also collab with QExpress for parcel deliveries FYI. So every now and then they will offer this project to us. Can earn $300 per day someting like that,btohqsg
Bicycle $8000 a month confirm cannotU try riding 5 hours a day under sun and rain$8000 a month grabfood illegal ebike mod maybe,btohqsg
Think be careful of QExpress. Seems like they got way too many orders to meet delivery timeframe. You see the Google reviews... I also kena from them as a customer when I never receive parcel / they lied they deliver but actually never  and many times,btohqsg
Guys has the express project started?,btohqsg
They had 1 just last week but ended already. But they say the app will prompt again if anyone interested,btohqsg
Notice that for the price breakdown for long journeys. Sometimes LLM include everything as Delivery Fee. While sometimes it is Base Fare + Distance Fee,btohqsg
Hahahah it's like low peak fare,btohqsg
Worth it mehh? Slog so hard?,btohqsg
But mostly all rhe orders I did today bike,btohqsg
I was on for 4 hours I got $180 on UParcel. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I did stack with short Roo trips along the way. So about $240 thereabouts. ðŸ˜‚ cannot always depend on LLM or just one platform.,btohqsg
Uparcel delivery is same as llm?,btohqsg
Like one pick up one drop?,btohqsg
Depends on the sender sometimes can be more than 1.,btohqsg
On paper it says 20%  but it varies between 18%-20% when I calculate back.,btohqsg
I go take a look haua,btohqsg
True ah more platforms more options,btohqsg
yup uParcel take 20% comm but food delivery is ridiculous only $7 ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Cluster job not bad  all Tampines,btohqsg
This means 11 drops at the same block?,btohqsg
I can PM you contact person,btohqsg
Hi goodmorning  I just registered for an bike account  how long does it take to process? Is 1-3days? Is the delivery by zone like FP or islandwide,btohqsg
Process can be fast can be slow also. Depend.,btohqsg
Delivery you can setting in the app if you want islandwide or specific area like north  south etc.,btohqsg
No auto assign one. Need to choose job and choose fast,btohqsg
price keep coming down but loads is getting up  ridiculous here,btohqsg
Use car use bicycle confirm cannot after minus costMaybe motorbike and illegal bike can,btohqsg
