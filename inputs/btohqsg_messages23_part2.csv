Hi! Anyone know the locations for BTO October release?,btohqsg
Hfe has resolved the issue. All eligibility criteria are detailed in the letter.,btohqsg
Have you found any greenrise group?,btohqsg
But wouldn't HLE also have settled the loan eligibility?To me  HLE is loan only... Other components were assessed separatelyWhereas HFE is like a one stop service but shows the breakdown,btohqsg
Can check if tampines greenspring sbf out before?,btohqsg
Hi if additional info/doc required for HFE  will we be informed via sms,btohqsg
I logged in but they didn't tell me what documents I need to upload  anyone faced this issue?,btohqsg
Use the efeedback and ask HDB what docs you need to provide,btohqsg
Did u go thru the whole step..,btohqsg
Did you get any email that tells you which additional docs to upload?,btohqsg
i just saw it  seems like nid payslip  is there anyway i can replace payslip since i dont have it  i don't have april and may 2023 and december payslip lol,btohqsg
changed company and didnt download all of them,btohqsg
Say  if you first applied for HFE in April  documents for income assessment should be submit until February ones,btohqsg
they wanted april 2023 to march 2024,btohqsg
can't use bank statement ah? contacting previous company may take a while,btohqsg
That was what i didEmailed my HR although i left them more than a year agoI mentioned that i needed the payslips for HDB,btohqsg
HDB also had my CPF statement but they also asked for payslipsOtherwise  letter from company with their stamp etc  to certify that you were working with them when  paid how much etc,btohqsg
You have until 4 JuneIf really slow response  try asking your manager there to expedite?My HR replied quite fast back then,btohqsg
No problemHwaiting! Hope all goes well for you!,btohqsg

Any one know of this   I thinking of apply 2nd BTO forming a family nucleus with my son as an occupier  I am sole owner currently for my 1st BTO. Wondering if my 2nd BTO  I not selling   would I be able to remove my son name as occupier if in future he wants to apply BTO with his partner,btohqsg
I wondering if I remove his name in future I might need to sell my flat cos Oct the plus flat is 10 years MOP,btohqsg
Removing son = Non family nucleusThus  can forget about 10 MOP,btohqsg
I think you should write to HDB to clarify first before applying for the BTO,btohqsg
if key not collected hv to return with penalty depending on stage completed,btohqsg
alt continue with his spouse as additional occupier. After completing the MOP  they can apply for their own flat as first-time applicants  which IMO isn't a good option.,btohqsg
I first time same issues   after a few weeks later I apply again and it was successful. I think is because of the cpf,btohqsg
Anyway just wanna know if my partner has applied for HFE but without loan . And he intends to change another job  due to the company ways of treating the employee   will it affect the HFE if we haven book flat or must wait until we book flat ?,btohqsg
HFE approved? Change of job shouldn’t affect your HFE…,btohqsg
Yes it's approved but haven apply for flat . Cause waiting for June bto out. But scared if now change job will affect the HFE .,btohqsg
It won’t. Cause HFE already gave you the loan amount upfront.,btohqsg
Oh okay cause we not intending to get loan.,btohqsg
Ya then should be fine also,btohqsg
Nope just scared that if my partner suddenly change job will affect the HFE cause of income.,btohqsg
If you are not taking loan and do not really require the grant (since that is not a concern)  not sure why source of income in HFE will be a concern...Probably HDB will expect you guys to pay everything using CPF and/or cash?,btohqsg
Full cash or cpf nothing link to income aka job,btohqsg
If no loan needed than change of job will not affect anything,btohqsg
2rm flexi short lease owners and occupiers age eligibility.  All must be 55 and abv.,btohqsg
If the lease is 99y and the occupier is the only child abv 21  the child may apply a Letter of Admin or Probate to transfer the HDB flat to him/her  subject to meeting HDB's ownership eligibility. If not met  selling in the open market is mandatory. However do note this does not apply to Muslim family as distribution of assets falls under Faraid.,btohqsg
Anyone of adult age can buy 2 room flexi of any locations if they form a family groupFor such case best ask HDB1. If the parents left a Will which say that the house are left to the child than no issue2. If no Will by right still left to the child just the process are longer,btohqsg
Starting July 2024Oct 2024 BTO single of age 35 can buy 2 room flexi of any locations on it own,btohqsg
Question now is short leaseDoes having a will still work in this case?,btohqsg
