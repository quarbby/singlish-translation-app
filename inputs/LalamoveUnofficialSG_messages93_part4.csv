Tmr must ban parents from stepping out house. My company aready got 2 colleague Kena cobid. Getting out of hand,btohqsg
That's our national pledge mah so as to achieve happiness  *prosperity* and progress for our nation.,btohqsg
I also hope there is a official lock down. But on 2nd thought  not sure how will it impact the economy of Singapore.,btohqsg
"Ppl aready dying still huan lo what economy.ü§£ There's a saying ""‰∫∫Âú®Â§©Â†ÇÈí±Âú®Èì∂Ë°å‚Äù",btohqsg
That true la. But dying percentage is still low. Anyway SG always like that nothing happen  no action taken.,btohqsg
Can see Sg Gov also shaking liao. When on TV their hair looks messy liao. Haha,btohqsg
No lah they purposely. Must look like they working. White hair aso dun dye liao. Must show stress lol. Every year earn few millions. Must act stressü§£,btohqsg
anyone notice that the order value is dropping ?,btohqsg
Sydney and Melbourne coming to 4 months full lockdown. Yesterday Sydney had 15 deaths.At the end of the day.. no system is 100% full-proof;Full lockdown  heightened Alert or open fully (Europe)..We have been living with this COVID for coming to 2 years and we are adults... i believe we can make our own decision regarding social distancing etc etc without having Govt come up with rules and regulations..Do what u think is right for your family and not when someone tell u to do it..,btohqsg
Got meh? Have to calculate the distance fare lor,btohqsg
It's something we have to live with,btohqsg
I don't think SG is ready to live with it leh  those ppl live as though Covid doesn't exists  which is more frightening.,btohqsg
I don't think it's abt living as though it doesn't exist. In the long run  pple have to still go out n work to make a living. Not everyone can wfh. We can only do our best to stay safe by wearing masks n cleaning hands etc. If when outside having meals in btw work also have to remove mask  if unlucky kena also not by choice. Eventually have to go back to normal day to day living outside.,btohqsg
Like for us delivery personnel  how can we stay hm? Just do whatever we can. This virus is not going to disappear,btohqsg
Its all about dining in. U dine in u need take off mask open mouth,btohqsg
In the long run  if ban dine in  restos also will buey tahan one. Even if let's say lockdown now  cases drop to zero  when reopen n dine in allowed again  who is to say cases won't go up again? When that happens  issit go back to same thing again. Its never ending cycle at this rate.,btohqsg
Close liao  economy jialat  pple buey tahan  also jialat,btohqsg
Any one got problem with app today,btohqsg
Cannot just look at fnb itself. Lots of linked sectors to fnb,btohqsg
Mine got no  pickup/upload pics/drop off option to click today,btohqsg
Big fnb employ alot of ft  the smaller ones don't. Then the smaller ones will likely close first cos they don't have the financial power. Also jialat cos alot r locals,btohqsg
The problem is ppl are not that disciplined and generally social animal  slowly spreading the virus all over the island when the healthcare doesn't have enough capacity and seeing daily death cases even for vaccinated seniors. The vulnerable one sacrifice for the economy good?,btohqsg
If they are vulnerable person.. then they shouldn't be out right..??When i say we are all adults means we have our own responsibility to decide how we need to social distance ourselves.. if restaurant too many ppl dun go if u are vulnerable.. ntuc packed  go shop midnight.. u have a choice.If u are vulnerable  get vaccinated stay at home.If u are risk taker.. then go out and have fun and accept whatever comes with the fun.The point is.. no system is full proof.. life has to move on.. it is just at what risk level each individual can live and accept..,btohqsg
some vulnerable person stay alone with no next to kin   they have difficulties in walking. when they went out to buy food  they rather eat outside first then go down and pack food home. they cant order food online cuz delivery fee to them is quite expensive or they dont know how to use the application.,btohqsg
a non vulnerable person also will get sick. death/virus dont choose people,btohqsg
The society/govt will have to find ways to reach out to then and help them.We cannot be a state of perpetual lockdown  or even a cyclical open and close. We need to ease back into normal life  gradually if need be.In wars  there would always be deaths and injuries  and have no doubt we are in a war  one not man made but given by nature.,btohqsg
Well if the pharma can't create a better vaccine or find a cure  this war likely never ends,btohqsg
As long as we have to wear mask  the war is ongoing,btohqsg
it not society/govt didnt find ways. some people dont like to burden others. if they can do by themself  they do.try to be in their shoes. not everyone is the sam not everyone is perfect.as long as wearing mask  trace together is still ongoing  there wont be easing back into normal life.if you say we need to ease back to normal life  do accept vulnerable person  out of their home cuz before covid vulnerable person also going everywhere.what is back to normal life/live with covid. it mean there wont be trace together and wearing mask. sick   see doctor   take medication   eat medicine.,btohqsg
Then it's up to them to make a choice  like someone just say above. Base on ur own situation  choose the option best suited for urself.You are going to get cases every year going forward  like with dengue and flu. The fatalities and injuries will likely happen when we open up  regardless of when  as infections increase. But when it sweeps through  the population 's body get used  the fatalities and injuries numbers come down  so is just something we have to get used to.And not see the numbers abit high and ask why govt nv go into lockdown modeMasks wearing and tray returns are good habits that this pandemic has put into us  so should be seem as a normal thing.As human  we want to evolve  keep the good from things we experienced and move on.Age  sickness and death is a cycle of life  and EVERYONE will go thru it,btohqsg
"have you been in their situation? we cant just pin point our fingers to them. one day u will grow old. one day u might be like them then younger generation will start to pin point to you saying u are vulnerable. stay home.do u know gov is slapping their own face? Case increase no lock down. but when hospital facilty is full   oh go heightening. then tell people they doing this is to improve their healthcare facility. this is totally bullshit. if u wan us to live with it. open up border. open up everything. dont control crowds. dont do only ""2 person dine in""so why i dont see even after SARs period. people wearing mask?so ya move on. everyone will go. so accept everything including vulnerable person outside. they are humans after all",btohqsg
"It's easy to say ""life moves on"" if you got no loved ones die from covid.  Last time I aso hack care yaya papaya till my 60 yo relative pass away last month due to covid.",btohqsg
most important is stay happy can liao. you dunno next min u kena covid not,btohqsg
"Gahmen is sacrificing the ""old ones "" now for greater prosperity of the rich elites",btohqsg
because old people say no go no come. so one must go another will come,btohqsg
my fam fell scam to a jnt cod delivery.,btohqsg
And we managed to get the money back.,btohqsg
You already rightly said not everyone is in the same situation.For 10% of vulnerable the 90% have to suffer some sort of restriction..??If no one to buy food.. go at 11am b4 lunch crowd.Fyi..every year the normal flu kills more than covid.. why are is covid different..?? Because covid is more transmissible compared to the normal flu...,btohqsg
Sacrficing for the rich elite...??I think the normal ppl like me also not much savings left.. üòÇüòÇüòÇAlot of Restaurants  tourist related businesses and event companies etc etc etc also cannot tahan anymore le..,btohqsg
then u be the good guy lor. find those vulnerable people. buy food for them. u telling people virus appear when there is full crowd? when theres no crowd there wont be virus?  is the same thing like 1m apart. virus still within 1m range. who says virus stay within 1m only?,btohqsg
If they can go out and buy lunch for themselves whether lockdown or no lockdown.. since they dunno how to use app.. why must ppl buy for them..??Whether go out at 11am or peak period is also them going out right??I dun get it.,btohqsg
I sry for the death of ur relative  I have no similar experience with my closed one  I had a bad bike accident in my 20s and was in coma for a few days  and could easily passed on then.What I saying is  even if I were to die then  i would want my family to move on with their life and not kp to govt to ban motorcycle or transport just because i die in a bike accident.,btohqsg
"Gahmen is subsidising them with millions pump in every month. ""Too big to fail "" like SIAü§£ü§£. My fren own a restaurant n he's still surviving thanks to Zheng hu",btohqsg
so virus appear   during peak period??????,btohqsg
Then if we shut down.. how does the old ppl buy food then..??,btohqsg
i never even say shut down. even lock down people still can go down and buy food what. dont tell me lock down u 2 mths 24/7 at home meh,btohqsg
My place kopitiam everyday still long q üëç,btohqsg
ya lor. lock down doesnt mean cnt go down and buy food,btohqsg
Infact their business now even better since alot wfh need dabao from neighborhood.,btohqsg
Hence.. there is still a chance of infection as u said.. coz virus dun appear peak period only ma..So.. whether it is 2 dine in  5 dine in  no dine in or fully open also the vulnerable will be at risk.. correct..??,btohqsg
