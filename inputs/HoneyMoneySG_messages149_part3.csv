Employee contribution is capped means employers contribution is cap too  right ? Eg. 20% vs 17%.,btohqsg
If i use my card to directly pay the Spaylater bill does it count as eligible spend? OCBC rewards or Citi Rewards. Or top up using UOB Absolute AMEX will i get 0.3%? or full 1.7%?,btohqsg
we talking about multiple jobs (multiple employers)we already know (quite confirmed) that if you work 3 jobs EACH earning $8k... all 3 employers have to pay the current CAP EACHbut i not sure how it gels with the global CPF contribution ceiling of Employer + Employee... got suggestion it is also x 3... i am not sure about this,btohqsg
What I understand is Not EACH. All are added up to OW ceiling.,btohqsg
Maybe sing investment go savers account. At least protect by SDIC. Interest rate is 2.6% for up to $300k,btohqsg
after 55  after RA formed e.g. to FRS. anything above that will go to OA?,btohqsg
this actually shows it EXCEEDS OW ceiling on monthly basis per employeryou see Employer A and Employer B BOTH have to pay employer contribution..only employee contribution is cappedwhat i am UNSURE is whether all the employer + employee must add up WITHIN $37 400,btohqsg
the interest in RA is from 55-65 goes towards the CPF life pool?,btohqsg
RA interests stays in RA until CPF life payout starts (RA depleted as CPF life premium)  whereafter interest earned on CPF life will go to CPF life payout pool.,btohqsg
If i do not have cardup?,btohqsg
Do you mean shopee pay later?,btohqsg
Beside Maybank which other cards worth to sign up for card up Citi card?,btohqsg
we must determined FRS/EHS at 55 or can do it by 65 b4 CPF life start?,btohqsg
am thinking if can pump RA to ERS  then at 65 b4 CPF life start  down grade to FRS. So we can get the remaining money out from RA with the 4% interest earned from 55-65?,btohqsg
ERS is just a limit. Not an option.,btohqsg
My sensing is this $37 400 cap is per human basis. The multiple employer only allow us to bypass the $8k/month contribution but not the global cap.1 example to back my idea is (based on $6k cap previously)  if u have 18 month salary  ur employer only needs to pay cpf for 17months √ó $6k (the $102 000 cap). Ur 18th month will not attract any mandatory cpf contribution from either u or employer. So it stands to reason it doesnt matter the number of employer,btohqsg
i agree with useems nightmare to track.... and excess will get bounce back.. what a waste?,btohqsg
There's a possibility that employer may have the ability to access cpf system to see how far away you are from global cap  and pay accordingly.Not certain on this though. Could be this excess bounce back method is being employed today if such scenario occurs,btohqsg
Once you transfer/top-up to RA  it will be purely used for CPF life.,btohqsg
then the SMART multiple employer will purposely be the last to pay.. so the bounce back goes to him,btohqsg
Possible. I notice our cpf contribution is usually later than our salary payday. Perharps the gap in this timing is for cpf to work out the numbers and inform employers?Otherwise no reason to make cpf contribution later than payday,btohqsg

I tried Spaylater for the first time. This is the first instalment. I can‚Äôt confirm if there will be bonus  I can only wait for next month to know. But looking at the mcc  seems like it‚Äôs okay for earning rewards. This is for HSBC Revo.,btohqsg
Hi experts  if I pay insurance in FCY using Maybank Horizon Visa  am I eligible for 3.2 mpd (till 31 Jan 2025)?Wondering if the FCY spend will take credit over the insurance MCC,btohqsg

OCBC 360 account? With salary credit  save and spend criteria.,btohqsg
Hi can I ask if you can still hit the ‚Äúsave‚Äù bonus interest if you have 100k in the acct and don‚Äôt increase the bank balance by $500/month? Since the max interest for ocbc360 balances is only $100k correct?,btohqsg
No. Must increase MAB by $500.,btohqsg
Hi everyone and happy new year I have invested in Amundi prime USA fund. I understand there is witholding tax involvedHow do I calculate how much witholding tax will be imposed?Is the tax imposed on the total amount invested or the tax is imposed on the profits?,btohqsg
Yes thanks. saw from one of the videos.  But was wondering in real life who have done and if the returns are worth,btohqsg
Just an example:1. $500 insurance + $509.25 ($500 insurance through CardUp with 1.85% fee) = $1009.252. $1009.25 √ó 3 (months of premiums) = $3027.753. $100 (cashback) √∑ $3027.75 = 3.3% cashback4. 1% (cashback from HSBC EGA GIRO) √ó $1009.25 = $10.095. $10.09 √ó 3 (months) = $30.276. $100 + $30.27 = $130.37 (total cashback for 3 months  might be lesser by $1 due to cashback offset)7. 3.3% + 1% = 4.3% cashback (similarly if calculate with $130.37 √∑ $3027.75)Best if you can stay at least and as close to $300/$1000/$2000 each month.,btohqsg
Means the amount above $100k eg the $500 of $100 500 would not receive the higher interest since it‚Äôs capped at balances of $100k?,btohqsg
Yes. Can check this calc for ocbc 360 reset monthhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/205369,btohqsg
Which card still can earn miles for pregnancy delivery  or hospital?,btohqsg
Hello  for Citi rewards card  there is a minimum annual income of 30k  does that mean gross income or net income?My gross annual income is more than 30k  and have been working for about 6 months since the last time they rejected my application. Called the bank for a reason and they told me to apply again and try.But during the application my assesable income is slightly below 30k. What does that mean?,btohqsg
Should be gross income. I think don‚Äôt worry and just apply.If you get rejected you should also get a free credit report and see if there‚Äôs any wrong.,btohqsg
yea since its my first credit card the credit report is basically nothing,btohqsg
Ok  I think if Citi rejects you again  just apply for another credit card with a bank you have savings account with.Should be easier that way and it can help you build your credit history. After a few months can apply for Citi,btohqsg
Oh makes sense  but for me Citi rewards is the most suitable for my daily life  will look into the other banks and see which matches more closely next. Thanks!,btohqsg
they told me to submit my payslip documents in the application page but i dont see any where to upload themü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Ask them again. They may give u email to send.,btohqsg

Can I still use krisflyer UOB with amaze combo to earn 3mpd?,btohqsg
maybank platinum visa  insurance count to max 150/500/1000 of the 300/1000/2000spending requirement in each on the 3 months of a quarter to get30/100/200quarterly rebate,btohqsg
Do you earn a fixed salary per month or variable income?They generally give more weight to fixed income vs variable. (If variable  probably that‚Äôs why they hinted it is below $30k during assessment),btohqsg
