"""The official reason for the establishment of GRCs was to ensure that Singapore's parliament would always be multiracial in composition and representation. This is stipulated by the compulsory inclusion of at least one member in the team of candidates representing the GRC to be from a minority racial group.""",btohqsg
at this day and age anything is racist,btohqsg
these people have no clue how SAP schs even started lol,btohqsg
ok wait this goes against the woke narrative,btohqsg
this is systemic racism against the majority,btohqsg
the way a woke person wld debate it,btohqsg
most (NOT ALL)of the single gender schs were set up by missionaries,btohqsg
ya but u cant just say systemic racism doesnt even exist...,btohqsg
I believe that we need more racism so that there is more racial harmony,btohqsg
"The issue about racial harmony in SG right now from my perspective  is that everyone is damn scared of being offensive towards another race. The issue with this is that the reason why someone is offensive unintentionally is normally due to their preconceived mental schema towards these races. If we continue to ""cancel"" and refuse to have constructive dialogue about what racism is and how it looks like  effectively it becomes very difficult to create a racially harmonious society",btohqsg
People need to be more openly racist for this kind of dialogue to even thrive,btohqsg
this also stems from the fact that Singaporeans and Singapore's policy making is not really about constructing racial harmony but racial blindness. So if you wanna be like really technical abt it  it is very hard to envision how racial harmony in SG actually looks like cause no one even knows how to start,btohqsg
TLDR The problem with racism in SG rn is that it threatens a shift from equality in opportunity to an equity in outcome,btohqsg
but ig no one is ready to have this convo yet cuz if i talk abt this in wusg i will get shut down (Happened to me before :(,btohqsg
isnt that the whole problem with woke,btohqsg
they want equality of outcomes rather than equality of opportunities,btohqsg
and stereotype u based on ur race,btohqsg
but woke people in general i mean,btohqsg
okay i dont rly have any issue with them,btohqsg
which is the whole problem with dei/esg,btohqsg
imo most woke people are all talk no action,btohqsg

@chemcerdo you think is advised to ckw halfway or no,btohqsg
Ok suppose you are stuck in this social situation that you dont want to attend but kinda have to. You leaving wont actually impact anyone concretely(maybe ur friend will be a bit sad but thats it) and wont have any effect on anyones academic or school record. You feel very uncomfortable halfway during the event due to some things you are requested to do,btohqsg
In this case is it ok to just leave,btohqsg
