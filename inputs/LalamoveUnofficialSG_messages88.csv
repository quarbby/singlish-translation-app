So whether we dine in or nt they also nvr checküòÖ,btohqsg
So yesterday I bothered CS to check and then they hack care me liao. Yesterday night I send email also hope they do something lol,btohqsg
Happened to me before. 58 blocked customers. CS eventually called me and told me is they blocked me  i have only done about 40+ orders so I questioned back even if 100% of them blocked me cannot be 58 right? They removed 50 lol still got 8 blocked.Another possible explanation could be Oddle blocked you and all their customers are lumped in  its a huge group. Can you see oddle orders now?,btohqsg
Possible leh cause I like no see oddle le,btohqsg
Yesterday I counted my takes  like also lesser than the blocked numbers. I also don‚Äôt think every orders I took they blocked me bah hahaha,btohqsg
The CS also not helpful they just leave it as it is,btohqsg
Wendihappened to me in June. Just pm cs until a local guy call u ba haha,btohqsg
Lol. I still can't find the block # in my profile. Oh well üòÖ,btohqsg

Need to wait until llm clear  should be by today,btohqsg
How do you see how many have blocked you?,btohqsg
Previously I haven‚Äôt got it then they suspend the account and asked me get after that they reactivated,btohqsg

Ask me to just try get more 5 star,btohqsg
I said they are sabotaging the delivery agents,btohqsg
But I usually got use lalabag liao la. When walking,btohqsg
Cause they did not mentioned it immediately have to get the bag,btohqsg
The bag very big leh how you carry?,btohqsg
Yeah. It was recommended to have. Then suddenly the walker accounts kena hold immediately on one morning,btohqsg
Exactly then two weeks later they come and give bad rating,btohqsg

Already posted by our superbike.. yet still got people here take,btohqsg
Not everyone in here. LLM got 50000 coolie. Here only 1k plus,btohqsg
Lesson learnt lor. Not all good pay job is good,btohqsg
Well the person who took it is here,btohqsg
FNB winter still not over yet,btohqsg
Majority who kena cobid had already done 2 jabüòÖ,btohqsg
Jab liao no 101% guaranteed won't tio.,btohqsg
Jab or no jab still will Dio according to that chart numba,btohqsg
Yes  it's correct. Just that how jialat on the symptoms depend on individual.,btohqsg
#15 includes all food n courier delivery. after 1oct  either vaccinate or take regular covid test.,btohqsg
actually from the list  looks like any job with daily contact with the public is included.,btohqsg
Got wat job no need contact with ppl?,btohqsg
no daily contact w public at large,btohqsg
Office also need go bk office leh. Not all can wfh daily,btohqsg
how many strangers u contact on a daily basis,btohqsg
Guess only unemployed n those no need go out house job can exempt liao,btohqsg
no lah a lot of ppl not on the list.,btohqsg
the entire manufacturing industry  for eg.,btohqsg
Sales office no need to vac,btohqsg
they going to need a metric to decide who needs to be tested. llm definitely doesnt have 20000 active drivers.,btohqsg
prob at least half inactive or minimally active,btohqsg
Maybe not vaccinated can't even do LLM after oct,btohqsg
they cant say that up front  obviously.,btohqsg
Ya lor ... Unless one is willing to get their nose poked twice a weeküò¢,btohqsg
im more concerned with who's paying for these regular tests.,btohqsg
garmen wont pick up that tab indefinitely.,btohqsg
There's definitely some who cant vac for health reasons. Imagine twice a week they need go some centre to test... üòÖ,btohqsg
Good days guys .wanna ask shifus with car and above account..where do you guys park for ION?,btohqsg
Also can we park at any loading bays to collect our orders? Especially at shopping malls,btohqsg
park level 5 - that's for me cos i only choose ION pickup if the pickup location is Level 4. so if your pickup point is B4  find the lift.another possible way is the open air URA carpark at wheelock place  then use the underpass to ION.,btohqsg
Wisma  until 31St  lunch n dinner time free parking  enter n exit within timing.Ion used to have 1St hr free  now dunno. So wheelock open space,btohqsg
Wah u guys very good leh,btohqsg
Still park wisman n open space,btohqsg
No 1hr free parking i see not level 4 job i all dont take,btohqsg
Also if you notice the order needs 2 person to carry and transport however when you see the fare breakdown there is no plus helper $30. So we will not take the job or update to CS?,btohqsg

Yea magnetic one strong and space saving,btohqsg
Where to get this type ? I see the construction.,btohqsg
This kind can giap Aircon vent,btohqsg

My car no Apple Carplay and Android Auto. Only factory double din player.,btohqsg
But then  have u use LLM app over Apple Carplay ?,btohqsg

So far worst condo is Highland Residences. Delivery is via another entrance. Then their comm most of the time spoil wan. Need to wait outgoing resident to open door  then can go in.,btohqsg
I dun like condo. Do 1 condo can sometimes do 2 hdb,btohqsg
Landed best if not too ulu like some Bukit timah type,btohqsg
Yes  landed. Just deliver and go. No need to care further.,btohqsg

this tactic most important for City Square Residences. No deliveries on Sun/PH and after 8pm on other days. those GF/FP people on bike/e-bike/bicycle all part outside/nearby then walk in with the makan.,btohqsg
City Square Residence.. Mostly CECA stay there.,btohqsg
Wow ystd 380 today 400 liao.. another driver bit the bait,btohqsg
yeah. wonder their MC mostly made up of them then impose this kind of ruling,btohqsg
That whole condo look very rundown too,btohqsg
But the price there is good lol,btohqsg
Won't be surprise Melville Park also like this. I haven't been there ever since I last drove PHV few years ago.,btohqsg
PHV most hate places. City Square Residence  Tanjong Rhu whole row of condo especially The Waterside and Melville Park.,btohqsg
Cause the security guard very anal?,btohqsg
Or the demographics of the population there,btohqsg
Resident  if deliver food okay. U try Amazon. Call until phone bomb also no one pickup.,btohqsg
Amazon delivery abit knn wan. They put delivery slot  then when deliver they purposely not at home.,btohqsg

Top of the world. Noone can touch them,btohqsg
They and Umbreage Ng no difference.,btohqsg
i think the Sun/PH ban is because of its proximity to Little India. dont want the foreign workers come in,btohqsg
cos i dunno how long that rule was there for,btohqsg
Maybe since City Square Residence TOP ?,btohqsg
They look down their own countrymen,btohqsg
Caste system Those hang around Little India are lowest caste or untouchable. Cannot chiong with them.,btohqsg
All those sg companies head by scholar seems like all will bankrupt sooner or later,btohqsg

U asking about multiply stops.Multiply stops is 1 Job with 2 or more location. This is counted as 1 jobIf you go to 2 shop in same mall is counted as stack. This is count as 2 job,btohqsg
I will tell him I don't have so much money now. Tell him just transfer me $300 first  so I can use the $300 as deposit and borrow $400 from my friend to help him transfer. After job done I will pay him back the $300üòÇ,btohqsg
later play with him he go rate u 1star,btohqsg
Ok thx. But my mission count as 1! I‚Äôll go ask the CS thx haha,btohqsg
LLM counts extra pickups n drops the same way  as multiple stops  and are charged per stop. It's only a new mission if the customer actually pays the base fare again. The food-delivery-platform way is different bcoz the vendors pays full commission for each pickup.,btohqsg
=> if going for LLM mission count  dont pick multiple stops.,btohqsg
Mutlistop in mission counted as 1. No meh?Stack order then count as 1 order each.,btohqsg
I mean I stack order but LLM mission still count as 1,btohqsg
Multistop job is still 1 job order  just have many stops.,btohqsg
Every job u swipe is counted as 1 job order  be it multistop or single stop,btohqsg
Did u swipe both same timing  or one was advance? Maybe advance job was swiped before mission effective time  so dun count to order completed even if you complete during your MET,btohqsg
If not  just go make noise w CS. Today Mon blue  all Sian Sian. Find smth entertainment. Lol,btohqsg
