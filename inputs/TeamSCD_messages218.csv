no no i want the alert but i don’t want it to say bullshit like this,btohqsg
just the normal ‘red light camera ahead’ can alr HAHA,btohqsg
you're not understanding what they mean,btohqsg
switch to the generic voices with alerts only  else do a complete reset and choose English (US) Ben,btohqsg
sometimes a complete reset *should* help,btohqsg
don't need to be so aggressive lol,btohqsg
yes bro i switch to generic alr but still give the special voice line i wanna kill myself alr HAHAHA,btohqsg

'Over $9 000 for 2 broken vehicle plates': Man complains about 'unfair' BlueSG bill  Singapore News - AsiaOnehttps://www.asiaone.com/singapore/over-9000-2-broken-vehicle-plates-man-complains-about-unfair-bluesg-bill?utm_source=a1home&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=A1+trending&utm_content=c1,btohqsg
that's part of their rental clauses and excesses,btohqsg
got a client similar like this  but much much worse  these rental company cars if u crash  ur fucks,btohqsg
That's how they earn big money.,btohqsg
Is all about the excess which rental must always bring upfront before renting,btohqsg
8k is from the third party leh. Meaning the rider went to see doc get mc report police and engage lawyer thru reporting centre,btohqsg
Cos it cannot be his bike repair 8k,btohqsg
yeah but if the article is correct and the driver barely hit him with super little damages  say he's okay all  the damages should be only max 2-5k eh  so still a bit sus,btohqsg
Loss of income can inflate very high one,btohqsg
“Oh no my back cek tio  doctor say dont ride bike for 2 months”,btohqsg
Cost shld be ard 3 5k excess bill to the rental company for young/elderly/inexperienced driver   the rest is rental company de pocket money hahahah,btohqsg
Funny thing is if the 3rd pt nvr insurance claim   the rental company also will collect the excess 🤣 then profit is theirs 🤣 so rental company earn from repairs and excess de,btohqsg
Is it legal to say u incur third party claim when there is not any?,btohqsg
They will just say collect from you in d event third party claims,btohqsg
And upfront company will say shld there be any accidents,btohqsg
Yes I understand this. Thing is they put in writing to this fella that they have third party claim of 8 000.,btohqsg
But if there actually isnt and he engage lawyer to demand GIA docs,btohqsg
I mean at 9k… at this point i wont mind to spend a few hundred engage a litigator for letter of demand,btohqsg
Esp if he got settle with the biker,btohqsg
But they confirm playing with the system   then engage lawyer liao   fight liao then come conclusion that the company will accept the repairs works cover by the hirer   then case close,btohqsg
Better than paying 8k for a 3rd party claim that dont exist,btohqsg
Play the system lor sure got ah gong pay de 🤣,btohqsg
1200 still pain but better than 9.2,btohqsg
And the administration fee is bullshit de 🤣,btohqsg
But if my lawyer send demand letter and no GIA record can be produced i think i will be dulan enough to make police report,btohqsg
Hahahhahaa need make report to GIA,btohqsg
They can only make on their side ma,btohqsg
How they going to produce a third party claim letter from the other insurer,btohqsg
as in report to gia   request them to investigate on this,btohqsg
IF GIA have to step in,btohqsg
The dai ji is worst then police report liao,btohqsg
Police report waste time de 🤣,btohqsg
But this kind of fraud case in SG if im not wrong  our police work very fast de,btohqsg
Ez some more. Got black and white stating charging excess against third party claim. GIA have no record of any claim. GG case close,btohqsg
Must make till super big hooha,btohqsg
Need to fight with bluesg black and white also,btohqsg
Company sure say he didnt read the FAQ,btohqsg
I dont think there is an FAQ that can cover outright fraud,btohqsg
The IO ask one simple question “how did you derive 8 000 without a claim report” they can self BJ liao,btohqsg
The best part is. Once SPF know u commit fraud. They will pull ur books,btohqsg
See how many third party collections done without third party pay out,btohqsg
Ouch hahahhaha thats why before things worsen   confirm they will nego,btohqsg
Jiak ba eng one really waste time waste money,btohqsg
eh weird question anyone know hows to rename their headphones like if i rename on my phone n other ppl connect they will see the new name? ccause when i rename is for my phone only not renaming the actual device name itself,btohqsg
