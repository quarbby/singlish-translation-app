"Pika World Update- 3 September 2021Focus on Jobs FridayYes  today is an important day  and the stakes are high. As we know  the extra unemployment benefits had ended for about 11 million Americans. So what we expect to say is more workers returning to work. This could then fill up the massive job vacancy and meet demand  with the hope to cool down inflation.However  there are some headwinds given Delta variant is pushing more infections and hospitalization. This means a reduced hope on office reopenings and dampens consumer sentiments mood.A Pivotal PointThe Fed will keenly view the August job reports as it will be one of the signals on the degree and pace of tapering. After all  the Fed is searching for ""substantial further progress"" before making any significant move.If hiring starts to slow  then the Fed will maintain a more patient stance.Bad News Good for Stocks?The logic seems to ring again among investors. If hiring disappoints  then there is perhaps more reason to maintain the emergency bond purchase. However  if it does slow down drastically  it may weigh on growth concerns and dampen the market mood.As such  both ends appears to swing till a market consensus is reached.Higher Wages PerhapsWith the labour shortage  there is the expectation for wage inflation to continue. However  the reduced demand attributed by Covid that affects consumers may cap on wage inflation.Nevertheless  economists generally still expect to see a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings from July. Moreover  the growth is likely to come from lower-income jobs as the current recovery appears to push demand for workers in such sectors.What's on the Menu Today?Finally  the moment will arrive.At 8.30 pm  we will receive the much anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls  which we expect at 750K  a drop from 943K in the prior period.The unemployment rate is expected to drop further from 5.4% to 5.2%.At 10 pm  the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI set to moderate from 64.1 to 61.5.It is 3 September  Wednesday  7.45 am in Singapore and 7.45 pm in New York. It is the last trading day  and let's hope for a splendid US market!",btohqsg
