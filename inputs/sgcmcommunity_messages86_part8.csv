Noooo  they're going to take up all the lots close to the lift lobbies,btohqsg
Ok question time  do you think micro hybrids and mild hybrids should be allowed to park in green lots  when all they offer is a slightly more sophisticated start/stop system,btohqsg
And do you think plug in hybrid vehicles should be allowed to use EV charging lots for a long term at places where the EV charger is free. Althey barely need to charge and they leave their car there for a long time blocking off the lot from EV users,btohqsg
Ev charging lot is a charging station not a lot,btohqsg
Green lot is totally redundant now as   only charging lot matter,btohqsg
Even you are ev you park at charging lot without charging is also like this,btohqsg
As in they're charging there but there is no penalty on staying there for a longer time than needed as yet,btohqsg
Because they spend the same time at the place,btohqsg
But their car doesn't need as much time to charge and can still run if it doesn't get to charge,btohqsg
Yes that why needed to have penalty,btohqsg
That have supercharger in mall is just funny if the person leave the car,btohqsg
Best is to have power to tow the car away,btohqsg
Unclamp also got good fee to pay mah,btohqsg
Collect tow fee and realease fee better,btohqsg
The towing fees are:Regular Tow fee: $185.00. Heavy Duty Tow fee: $370.00. Overnight Storage fee: $20.00.,btohqsg
Is the inconvenience that ppl scare,btohqsg
Question  do you think traffic like this is acceptable or should kids learn to walk 1-2 blocks for traffic free pickup,btohqsg
When you have kids u know,btohqsg
Kids should not take PHV at all,btohqsg
My kids are walking around the block so I don’t have to sit in traffic man,btohqsg
I think maybe cause red light district,btohqsg
I did not work hard so I get stuck in traffic for my child,btohqsg
So must die die send/fetch infront of gate,btohqsg
Red light is further down and it’s Singapore..,btohqsg
