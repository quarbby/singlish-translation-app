"""you must activate the physical version of the Eligible Card within 30 days of the card approval date. For the avoidance of doubt  a digital version of the Eligible Card is not eligible for this Promotion; and the Eligible Card account must  within three (3) months of the Eligible Card account opening date  be valid (i.e. the Eligible Card account must not be suspended  cancelled and/or terminated)  in good standing  and conducted in a proper and satisfactory manner as determined by Standard Chartered in its sole and absolute discretion.""In this case i cannot use apple pay? cannot use the virtual card ? Does online payment with the PHYSICAL card not count into the eligible spend or is it just contactless payment? sorry for dumb question   just dont really understand",btohqsg
Lmao. This is for people whose company pays for the plan la,btohqsg
Hi wz  strange  i dont have the option for one time payment.Either I choose to add CC for recurring or payment through axs.Can you show me ur option in your M1+ app?,btohqsg
Digital card means you are using the virtual card number before the physical card arrive. To answer your question  you may use the physical card number to make online payments,btohqsg

https://theindependent.sg/posb-everyday-card-reduces-cash-rebates-from-3-to-0-3-at-watsons/Saw this article..... Idk if it's true or not...,btohqsg
Poems MMF  the returns need to wait up to 30 business days for the 5.8% NDP promo to be credited. Its abit slow unlike moomoo maximum 7 business days.Also poems take a cut around 0.45% off the regular returns as management fee  so not very idea. If withdrawal made on Friday or weekends  no returns. Best to wait Tuesday before 10am to submit withdrawal to maximise returns.,btohqsg
Hey guys not sure if anyone has the accor plus account  mine renews in October but I need 2 nights to upgrade to gold status. Do i stay 2 more nights before my renewal or after to retain the gold for one year?,btohqsg
Fyi.My 5.8% moomoo promo during MoomooFest @ Suntec in Jul 2023 still not in. They are still investigating. Do monitor your 5.8% returns is credited to your account or not.,btohqsg
Can try GxS   Maribank   CIMB Fastsaver,btohqsg
Yea  I didnt sign up for moomoo yet due to the crediting issue  even their part time staff face same thing when they tried to ask me to sign up. In the end for 5.8% promo i went with POEMS as they are more creditable.,btohqsg
For poems  my balance will fluctuate on a daily basis in line with their Money Market like stock market but i can see it increasing not drop. The 5.8% dont come in right away.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if I purchase a phone plan from Singtel or starhub  which card can earn miles on paying the phone price itself? Thank you.,btohqsg
Most of the moomoo customers did get it. Just that each individual needs to closely monitor if the 5.8% is credited in or not. If you can participate the 5.8%pa for 1 month respectively n back to back  that will be a good return for 2 months.,btohqsg
Last i checked yesterday poems MMF balance increased by like 3.1% per annum. This does not include the 5.8%  returns. So the effective rate seems like 8% if it continues till end of my 30 days . I joined their National day promo 31 August,btohqsg
My Lady Card category is under Dining.However  I don‚Äôt see the extra bonus reflected.How is this bonus reflected may I ask? Computed tgt with the base reward of $5 for $UNI1?,btohqsg
1st working day of next month,btohqsg
it's next month. please read TnC or watch Chris' video,btohqsg
Ya  after months le. Previous month transactions.,btohqsg
wah then something wrong already.. did you select Dining accurately?how did you select?,btohqsg
Reflected on statement I mean.. how is it reflected  within the transaction or a separate line item (bonus),btohqsg
under Rewards section of UOB appunder Rewards section of statement,btohqsg
During the application  I contacted the UOB live chat to clarify as well.,btohqsg
Understand.I am asking if bonus is a separate bonus item (compiled tgt) or it‚Äôs given tgt with the spend item?,btohqsg
If in UOB App  you can see the lumped breakdown by DINING 5x and DINING 9xIf in UOB Statement  you can only see the increase of UNI$ with everything lumped in. Maybe 1-2 lines of UOB Lady card comments.,btohqsg
Hi someone introduced me to this bigfundr investment which is offering a higher interest rate (depending on the period of investment) as compared to fd/ssb. From the website  it indicated your principal and interest are fully guaranteed by a legally binding contract between BigFundr and Maxi-Cash*. Like to seek your views and opinions on the risk for this bigfundr investment.,btohqsg
Hmm do you know how to see what is your current category?,btohqsg
NoüòÖ. Previously I checked through UOB chat.Is there any other way to check this?,btohqsg
Hey MT & Sylv & L  thanks for assisting,btohqsg
"From the website  it say ""BigFundr holds a Capital Markets Services License (CMS: 101098) and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).""",btohqsg
https://www.bigfundr.com/how_bigfundr_worksFrom my brief reading  your main risk is Maxi-Cash. How much do you believe in Maxi-Cash  because when anything happens  Maxi-Cash is the one that is guaranteeing your investment. If Maxi-Cash goes bust  so does your money. There is no SDIC guarantee.,btohqsg
