Too many naive retail investors who fail to consider the downside. Always remember  bb have the speed of information edge over retailers  the necesary holding power and capital to trap retailers to buy high sell low. The odds are especially stacked against retail day traders who doesnt know what they are doing.,btohqsg
Any good brokerage recommendations for short selling?,btohqsg

Everyday my morning greeting already talk about cut loss. Advise to new players  cut loss is the most important tool in this game,btohqsg
Ya no easy investing. I read somewhereFA analysis includes go agm and speak to the CEO and management team. üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeah... agree... its always difficult to come to decisive action to cut loss...,btohqsg
I‚Äôve learnt the hard way  many have learnt it too. You can learn from our past mistakes or You can choose to learn and pay for it but whether really necessary.,btohqsg
Many lost on medical honestly because of FOMO  blind following and not understanding ‚Äòvalue‚Äô of counters,btohqsg
"Haha... whenever I thinking of cutting loss there always this devil whispering... ""maybe"" ......",btohqsg
Now I try to be hard on myself to determine both target and stop loss price before entering....,btohqsg

Asking the shortist here. Is it able to short sell if i have outstanding shares ? Or do i need to sell off all my long positions first before i can short sell,btohqsg
"Cutting loss sucks for sure..But instead of thinking ""maybe there's a chance la I see how"" why not appreciate the feeling of ""lucky I cut alr  the price now no eye see sia"" after u cutIt's like sunshine after the rain & u can sleep well at night afterwardsRmb at the end of a storm there's a golden sky  diligent cutting of losses will lead to long term profits with the right trading strategy.Don't just look at the short term realised loss but look to protect your profits over the long term.",btohqsg
Market is mostly right but occasionally market has been wrong too in underestimating performance. Take MT 2nd quarter market never expected such a result so quickly gave better valuation.It is just typical of SGX investors behaviour to sell off anything after results or after dividend and buyback before results.There is no evidence that MT results will not be better this quarter. Just the typical rinse repeat until results are closer.Mean while the merry go round will go on.,btohqsg
Yea because who likes to lose. Every trade when we play  we plan to win. But we can‚Äôt win all the time. That‚Äôs why lose less is better than lose big.,btohqsg
Retailers cutting / selling off MT won‚Äôt really affect the price honestly.It‚Äôs the BBs game.,btohqsg
Experienced trader Rayner Teo says:1. Big win2. Small win3. Breakeven4. Small loss5. Big lossRemove option 5 and you have just taken a huge step towards being a profitable trader,btohqsg
The golden words I abide by everyday,btohqsg
Ya nowadays i dont blame retailer shortists anymore. Doubt they are the ppl that cause price to go down.,btohqsg
Nice share... I more kiasee.... so I remove item 1 and 5....,btohqsg
Yea if you really wanna trade   gotta learn how not to lose big guys.It‚Äôs just a matter of time you are going to make a big loss,btohqsg
Yes but typical retailers are weak and add to the frenzy of fear and greed aggravating the situation,btohqsg
Go with your game plan.. Cut loss when it reaches your cut loss price.. This is generally a good advice... So i agree with you guys on this extend.. But dont over exaggerate things with no basis...,btohqsg
This one if want must blame PAP.  Haha. National culture cannot be shaped by individuals. üôÉ,btohqsg
Honestly  to a very very small extend. That‚Äôs all.,btohqsg
"@MysticDaxshoutout to owner Dax with his morning ""nagging"" about SL btw  good reminder to stay grounded üëç",btohqsg
I‚Äôve sustained 6 figures losses back then so I understand how important having stop loss can be.Painful times. But I am back   brand new,btohqsg
On a single trade. Which was very unnecessary now that I think back. But had no one to guide me then.,btohqsg
I don't know but looking at volume of small lots selling and buying it does feel retail fear and greed has good influence. You can say small lots cmay not all be retail but who knows for sure.,btohqsg
Many thanks for sharing your experiences with us.  Very timely message for us.  Salute you!,btohqsg
What good news..? Review non diluted financing..?,btohqsg
Bonds issue to finance yuma operations. If the bond offering is successful  then consider a good news,btohqsg
To all experts   samko timber still can go in,btohqsg
Not trying to brag or anything  but I didn‚Äôt play any medical counters since Mar2020. If I can get back up from a painful time  many can. Just need to hone and find what does well for yourself. Also  some accusations  saying that I try to earn 1-2 pips off you guys is totally horse shit. You can see for yourself from this Amplefield trade. I always try to go for big win / home run . There are others who make much more  congrats too. Ultimately  just want to say that the quicker you get discipline and equip yourself with skills  the better you should get  provided you have stop loss plan on every trading plan.,btohqsg
Good message for all the folks dax,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt be bothered to defend myself honestly all these while but I have seen and heard too much allegations.So at least you guys know that my intention is to try to help those new comers especially.üôèüèª,btohqsg
I think ur trading style is actually alot more FA than the many so called FA MT investors here,btohqsg
We can tell your sincerity in guiding us. Never doubted that. After all thousands of messages everyday and after so long  surely we can judge for ourselves who are the big brothers trying to protect and guide us.  Never get a chance to thank you properly but I respect you a lot. Cheers!,btohqsg
Sell at market? How come the price 0.0447 one,btohqsg
Also  Amplefield insights was given to me by@furion07when we met.@furion07is straightforward person who for one  doesn‚Äôt like unrealistic calls.He‚Äôs a full time trader whom we have met recently and I do have respect for him for the person he is too.You guys can learn a lot from him   and be entertained at the same time.We are all still learning and should never stop learning to get better each day,btohqsg
Sold at a few prices   42  45  46 if I recalled right   they just took average .,btohqsg
