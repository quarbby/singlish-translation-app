but poly depends on ur schedule,btohqsg
like i can only one lesson,btohqsg
Honestly morning classes are the best,btohqsg
go sch 12 go home at 2,btohqsg
Once u finish them u have the rest of the day to do ur shit,btohqsg
but poly u have alot of projects as well,btohqsg
so u may have to stay in sch/ meet up to finish them,btohqsg
will there be the case where u have to come at like 7+ and then only leave at 5 or smth,btohqsg
Sometimes attending classes isn't very good use of time. Often studying by yourself is more effective,btohqsg
Imagine u stay in punggol but school at jurong,btohqsg
Or just go home and tank the whole thing urself,btohqsg
thats me la LOLOL only me :‚Äù send help,btohqsg
u may end at even 8,btohqsg
Like what do you even do on a computer,btohqsg
CCA is generally a waste of time in JC  unless you are applying for certain things then maybe,btohqsg
Why would you not want a CCA,btohqsg
we talking abt poly but ok,btohqsg
I was forced. In university I don't join any activities at all.,btohqsg
like writing proposals  reports   for me data sheets (science) and i spend lots of time going through slides and doing practice questions~,btohqsg
It‚Äôs rare that someone is paying for you to do fun things,btohqsg
assignments some may be graded some not,btohqsg
online quizzes r a thing as well,btohqsg
But diff courses are different or most courses are like this,btohqsg
theres also a mid-sem exam and end-sem exam,btohqsg
depends la  if mayb design they have 1 exams mostly just projects and artworks to hand up,btohqsg
for engineering p similar to sci as well id say,btohqsg
for business more focused on proposals  reports and presentations  and have exams as well,btohqsg
Isn't CCA and all the activities u join the fun part,btohqsg
Teachers in charge can ruin it,btohqsg
Sports CCA 3 times CCA  in a week hahaha,btohqsg
Some ppl also find this to be too time consuming,btohqsg
A waste of time. I might as well use the time to get higher marks or more importantly  read my mathematics books,btohqsg
Can spend time doing other stuff,btohqsg
That's the bare minimum liao  sports is like 3hour plus and at least twice a week,btohqsg
My CCA was v educational and fun,btohqsg
my cca was also v educational,btohqsg
Yea that's why they dont join,btohqsg
I would not be half the same person I am today without it,btohqsg
but i think cca is subjective,btohqsg
Perhaps because if this mindset  you find cca a waste of time,btohqsg
When I was in JC there was this 'learning experience'. Quite interesting to prove complex numbers using linear algebra,btohqsg
if ur humanities gd then can la,btohqsg
I took damn Alot of activities üòÇMy CCA science and tech  and I join all sorts of science competition and forumns,btohqsg
what is your combi for arts,btohqsg
Unless there is a mathematics club  but people will probably not indulge in real mathematics so I might as well not join,btohqsg
i working and i have external cca,btohqsg
If u like to hang out with people  ACJC is the place to go,btohqsg
People here tend to be more extroverted,btohqsg
