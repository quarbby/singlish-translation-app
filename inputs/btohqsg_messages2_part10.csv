Ya we're doing this listing my son as occupier so we can form a family cluster,btohqsg
as long as your son is not co-owner,btohqsg
Confirm no. Need at least 18 or 21 years.,btohqsg
public scheme which you can apply for any size of BTO,btohqsg
You may not need to be restricted to the Non-Citizen Spouse Scheme if you have a child with your foreign spouse. If the child is Singaporean or SPR  you can form a family nucleus (including your foreign spouse) with your Singaporean or SPR child and apply under the HDB Public Scheme which allows you to purchase BTOs that are larger than the 2-room flexi flats.,btohqsg
Yeah a friend in the banking industry is helping to look into this now but bank loan has its own challenge with the higher downpayment and all. Stress 😂,btohqsg
Yeah we SBF for a 5-room but now worried cannot get sufficient loan amount,btohqsg
If you have a child from the marriage and the child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident  you can buy a flat under the Public Scheme.,btohqsg
Im afraid its not possible for new flats irregardless BTO/SBF. It should remain status quo as the point of application till key collection,btohqsg
see how much the bank can loan you.... otherwise  either you wait or you sacrifice for a smaller size,btohqsg
But right  <$200k can get what sia hahaha,btohqsg
4rm near orchid country club on the ulu side,btohqsg
I mean have to shell out cash lah,btohqsg
if the bank can loan higher  that'd be great,btohqsg
Cannot too ulu have a kid hahaha the worst case scenario is to wait for my PR then apply again liao if all else fails 😔,btohqsg
basically combined pay multiply by 65 to aga aga know the loan amount,btohqsg
Then confirm enough if it's so simple haha. Household is 5-figure just wish HDB/bank/whoever would kindly consider this and not just 1 income,btohqsg
Earn how many X more also no use if cannot get mortgage loan to cover the SBF price 😔I consider myself a HENRY (high income not rich yet) so many people ask us to get private property instead but that's really not sustainable as we also have a child.,btohqsg
I read it somewhere dont remember d,btohqsg
xw:anyway the day the accrued interest starts on the principle amount is upon signing the LOA aka 2nd appointmentexample if you made $40k down-payment via OA  the AI starts to compound,btohqsg
First year of AI $1k  2nd year $1025,btohqsg
for $60k payment  the AI would be $6k on the 4th year before your house is ready,btohqsg

Hi guysWhat is the maximum years that HDB gives loan for aged 26 ? Does our age really matter ? 🤔,btohqsg
Anyidea what's the max they can offer ?,btohqsg
The maximum loan repayment period for HDB loans is 65 years minus buyer's age or 30 years  whichever is shorter. The maximum loan repayment period for loans taken through financial institutions is 35 years. 5. The maximum age at which the loan must be repaid is 65 years old *.,btohqsg
The maximum age at which the loan must be repaid is 65 years old *.6. For users aged 21-54  the program assumes the loan is repaid by 55. For users aged 55-64  the loan is assumed to be repaid by 65 *.,btohqsg

@ CY Chung:  for 2-room apts  should try Henderson or Boon Keng..... heard there's still vacancies...worth checking again......if you r keen on downtown BTOs....,btohqsg
