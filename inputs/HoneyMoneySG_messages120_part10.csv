MCC for SIA should be 3075 based onHeymax.ai,btohqsg

Hi gurus  may I check which cc is the best for jb petrol & spendings? Thanks in advance. Appreciate it.,btohqsg
Depend what u spending on. My favorite is maybank fnf with amaze (800 min spend) for cashback and amaze with crmc for miles (no min spend up to 1k),btohqsg
we are all in unchartered territory loh... haha..,btohqsg
"actually STRICTLY SPEAKING  you need to keep AT ALL TIMESreference MAB + earmark amount.But this is another one of those ""how are they going to monitor/enforce""Easy to say in TNC  but whether they really CAN or WILL... nobody knows",btohqsg
but what i know is ... i heard DPsomeone signup for earmark promo on say 2nd of the month... moved in $100k.backside itchy go and move out the $100k for 1 day on 20th of the month  21st of the month put back the $100kFAILED to kenna earmark.,btohqsg
Anyone had their cash credit clawed back before ?,btohqsg
What i understand from UOB is if you accidentally sign up for the promo  this is what you can do so that the system won‚Äôt automatically earnark your deposit,btohqsg
Hi May I know how many days does UOB take from the day I submitted my application to the date account account opened for UOB ladies saving account ?,btohqsg
most of us with existing UOB relationship / singpass open  is instant like 10 minutes,btohqsg
From immediate to as long as 3 weeks actually,btohqsg
"I haven't encounter any account opening that took more than 5 mins  except for that one time I answer qn ""wrongly"" for HSBC EGA.",btohqsg
My account always need 1/2 working day before i receive the sms that it is approved,btohqsg
my very first application was immediate.,btohqsg
Not really half a working day.. half day.. i applied on Sunday morning 1am before and approved in the morning around 9-10am,btohqsg
It differs from profile to profile i guess,btohqsg
are you US PERSON: Yes (immediate failure),btohqsg
Are you expecting big amounts of transfers from other accounts: yes (fail),btohqsg
3.43% p.a. EIR for 2 years. Can use CPF-OA also.,btohqsg
EH this might be VIABLE for those who worried 6 months Tbills might drop and/or roll over month lose 2 weeks interest,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGable to do any tieup / promo code with AIA? I think will have people keen.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
I heard now it‚Äôs 50% sold out since 930am,btohqsg
Hey guys I have a question about amaze card. I have a uob lady‚Äôs card right. Den if I pair with amaze card 1. Does this mean any card spend on any category will earn 4 miles per dollar (1k capped)2. Do I have to pick certain category on my lady‚Äôs card  if so  which category?,btohqsg
Fairly decent rate given that 2y SGS is around 3.3+% and local retail doesn‚Äôt assign much risk premium to endowments,btohqsg
You only earn 4mpd for the category you chose  other wise it's 0.4mpd.  Which category depends on what you mostly spend on.,btohqsg
Yea more like another avenue to park your spare cash without any risk,btohqsg
Oh So the only benefits  lady‚Äôs card by itself vs pairing with amaze will be1. Foreign currency spend (lower fees)?2. Maybe some instarem points ?,btohqsg
i believe him.. because they usually have 'pre sale' briefing to the kiasu agents..and also the 'priority' clients who will get allocation before it opens,btohqsg
often  insurers use such 'hot products' as a marketing campaign to drum up interest in their products / brand name..most people will end up with 'sorry no more liao',btohqsg
so ask your agent backif there are no priority clients  how can 50% be sold before email came out?,btohqsg
Yea it moves very fast! Last tranche it sold out quite fast too,btohqsg
i am telling you.. there are reserved/priority tranches.if don't know of such things.. means not in the inner circle.,btohqsg
They have their own inside info first before the email is sent out  to every agents,btohqsg
Not really this time move faster cause got both OA + cash  last time my agent told me only cash,btohqsg
Yes  same happens for things like IPO and hot condo launches. Certain groups gets first dibs.,btohqsg
as i already explained  if the FIRST EMAIL blast to all agents came out.. and it is already 50% SOLD..What does that tell u,btohqsg
yes some people just don't get it... and with such evidence already displayed.. what can i say,btohqsg
my agent already sent this 2 weeks ago haha,btohqsg
The point is not the info...It is WHY when it opens to public  it is already 50% sold.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have prepaid all my outstanding bill with IRAS in Jun for July due.. but this morning realised there was giro done by iras. Anyone encounter this issue before?,btohqsg
U use cardup? It might occur if u schedule cardup too near to giro date. Giro is initiate a few work day before so always best to pay at least 1 week earlier,btohqsg
AIA agents received information about Wealth Savvy (III) last month  so some agents have already been sending this information to their clients since then to gather interest.It was announced only on July 5th (Friday) that the guaranteed returns would be 3.38%.The product was launched this morning at 9:30 am. Agents would have sent their links to all parties who expressed interest by that time to sign up as soon as possible. This explains why it was already 50% sold by 10:30 am  just 2 hours after launch,btohqsg
If double pay  iras will refund the extra amt pay,btohqsg
Thanks queenie.. curious if iras will take it as next month payment then no refund?,btohqsg
Is it fine to put my amazecard in google wallet for contactless payment?,btohqsg
