Dear Juniors A word of advice: JC itself is useless in the grand scheme of things  it just serves as a ticket to get to Uni. Instead of sulking about which JC you are stuck in  the time couldâ€™ve been better spent to ensure you make it to your desired course in your desired Uni. It might feel shitty not getting in your desired JC  but if you do not get into your desired course in Uni  that will not just feel shitty  but pave the way to a future that you may not like.Make of it what you will Peace out,btohqsg
