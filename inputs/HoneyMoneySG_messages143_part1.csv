I really don‚Äôt care to pay AF on credit cards if it will pay off,btohqsg
I prefer to use DBS/HSBC/Citi/Standard Chartered.But if you say they can‚Äôt provide me what I want so I might consider to open an account in other bank.,btohqsg
Still haven't gotten answers for the other 2 qns  the highest interest rates with just the lack of info would usually be HSBC EGA and SCB eSaver. As long monthly you rotate the monies around.,btohqsg
Guys  what are the best way to invest s&p500 using srs?,btohqsg
Have you checked out this video?https://youtu.be/lvnuh3Ituqw?si=x-exK3qCAB6CbUlo,btohqsg
Endowus got recurring fee every year right?,btohqsg
To answer your questions I‚Äôll say that for the first amount of money I‚Äôll park 5000  then my salary which is 5500 (1700 saving out from the salary every month).I don‚Äôt care to change my credit card strategy if I‚Äôll get what I want which is the best way to increase my money by saving approximately 1700 every month.,btohqsg
Is there a way to buy with only 1 time fee?,btohqsg
I wanted to save money with cash back  but rewards or miles will do the job the same If their conversion value is higher than points for anything else I want (miles or money),btohqsg
With just 5000 then HSBC EGA and SCB eSaver would be the only way to go. Don't need to change your credit card strategy as well.,btohqsg
If you can suggest me any other bank accounts (DBS/HSBC/Citi/SCB) plus a good credit card which has the best rewards/miles plan I‚Äôll consider it.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt care of annual fees if I‚Äôll have to pay,btohqsg
Melvyn literally just suggested the bank accounts (HSBC + SCB in combination). You can use any cc you feel like.,btohqsg
With the latest news on youtrip with Apple Pay  does anyone know if I use amaze + Citi or UOB preferred visa platinum  would it give me miles on Apple Pay top-up?,btohqsg
Ok thank you guysHave a good day,btohqsg
Not for SRS. Anyway  forgot that there is an video update for this topic.https://youtu.be/lrfqPsoyj2A,btohqsg
This is confusing. You mean YouTrip top-up? I recall no cards give rewards for topping up YouTrip.,btohqsg
If you park 100k  OCBC 360 account with an eligible OCBC miles/cashback card.If you park 150k  UOB One account with eligible UOB miles/cashback card.,btohqsg
Hello experts  just to check if I use citipayall  the amount does not contribute to the 1k credit card spend right  if I have crmc. Thanks in advance,btohqsg

Wa $450 cash is damn high siah  should have waited haha. Thot $400 was v high Liao$450 can buy brand new ipad 10th gen with change leftover and also miles from credit card lol. Reward is only 9th gen,btohqsg
yeah  just got the notice 30 min ago and updated ithttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/250178,btohqsg
Back in my day it was like 250$ I think. üòÖ,btohqsg
Yea haha same  should have renewed NTB after then and get another set of rewards now. Cos last time HSBC revo and UOB lady‚Äôs can easily cover CRMC‚Äôs miles categories. And last time OCBC 365 still got 3% travel cashback de which was good haha.Now CRMC hard to even find replacement for it,btohqsg
Ya these days I can't reset my new to bank status with Citi. After so many nerfs  crmc is like last man standing.,btohqsg
anyone experienced issues getting cc rewards for paying singtel bill thru app recently cuz i realised they started using AXS platform,btohqsg
They changed for few weeks already. Probably will be excluded for a lot of cards.,btohqsg
FYI  I managed to xfer funds out from my HSBC EGA to my another bank acc with same name successfully.,btohqsg
Pay on website  until they changed to AXS also lol,btohqsg
ok nice thank you  will try next month,btohqsg
may I confirm  in-app payment (eg. shopback  shopee  fairprice apps) paired with CRMC is considered as online? dont need amaze + CRMC?,btohqsg
Enter credit card details is online and okay to use CRMC direct. Just don‚Äôt use in-app Apple Pay.,btohqsg
I remember in previous videos and discussions  it was said that once the MA reaches the BHS  excess MA contributions will overflow to the SA (supercharge SA)  and once the SA reaches the FRS  any excess SA contributions will overflow to the OA (supercharge OA). Is this not the case anymore? In this video you mentioned that any SA contributions above FRS will not overflow but will be retained in the SA  while only the MA contributions will overflow to the OA.,btohqsg
what if my CRMC card is saved in those apps and I pay by card within the app?,btohqsg
Yes can  as long as not paying through Apple Pay.,btohqsg
"It has never been ""any excess SA contributions will overflow to OA"". Only MA contributions above BHS will supercharge SA  then supercharge OA if FRS reached for SA.",btohqsg
I never said that. But if you found  please point me to the specific video,btohqsg
@MelvynEzi@ChrisHMSGAhhh ok thanks! I guess this has been my longest misconception. üòÇ,btohqsg
wanna check with the community and see which one will you all pick:1/ spend $500 on CS fresh  foodpanda  gojek with the DBS yuu card (i know u need to hit $600 for the bonus but i can‚Äôt üòÇ)or2/ spend $500 on grab with the dbswwmc (4mpd),btohqsg
Go with the path of least pain and suffering,btohqsg
best advice ü§£ least pain of calculating and estimating,btohqsg
why not meet 600 on yuu?,btohqsg
of cos not affect 1k spend for 10x points,btohqsg
Which card can easy trace the Cashback thru app?,btohqsg
Hi what‚Äôs the best cards pairing for miles for everyday expenses if I‚Äôm quite new to this ‚Äòcredit card game‚Äô. Is it still citirewards + amaze?,btohqsg
I max out the Cashback on trust. Need a secondary card. Haha,btohqsg
UOB one Cashback not trackable so looking for other option,btohqsg
Why not just keep an excel sheet?,btohqsg
The trust one better good to track  max 2 day can see the Cashback if eligible,btohqsg
