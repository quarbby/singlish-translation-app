How fast u can go doesn't matter in sg when some cpf-eligible person in a crossover hugs the first lane,btohqsg
mobile speed traps are a thing.,btohqsg
@asura1404can name a few quiet fast cars?,btohqsg

blessed fella to have sit all the fast fast cars in sg 250kmh + ones,btohqsg

I think relativly any car >400++ whp is considered fast,btohqsg
i think any car can be fast,btohqsg
not if the car is like 3t though,btohqsg
so pls name some quiet cars with 400 or more hp,btohqsg
those were crazy fast back in the day,btohqsg
but not loud doesnt mean quiet le,btohqsg
Isn't hp a measure of power and not speed,btohqsg
