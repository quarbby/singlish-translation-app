🚀Pika World Equity Market Update- 4 July 2023🚀It was a short trading day as the market closed at 1 am Singapore time.Today is the US Independence Day  so many traders probably took an extended weekend.📖Weak ISM reading on a dull trading day🎲Our only data was from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM)  which registered a reading of 46  a downbeat from 46.9 in the prior period. A reading below reflects contraction  which is a negative sign. Yet  that does not move the market  given the general acceptance that the lagging effect of monetary policy is slowly feeding into the economy.🧰FOMC Minutes on Thursday🔦While FOMC minutes will be released at 2 am Singapore time on Thursday  we expect large movements if there are new insights. This is mainly due to the release of recent PCE data  which have even strengthened the possibility of the Fed reducing rate hikes. Hence  the latest FOMC minutes may be less relevant  given the new light shed on the inflation narrative with the PCE data.🚘Labour data in focus on Friday📤We are generally more inclined towards Friday's employment data. We have heard Uncle Powell's warning about more interest rate hikes as he directed to the resilient labour market.Weaker-than-expected job figures may not dent hope or create inertia for the Fed to raise interest rates. Instead  the hawkish tone remains  and it will take a few more months of weak job data for the Fed to consider taking their pedal off the interest rate foot.Happy Independence Day 🗽to our friends from the US  and I shall catch up with you.Pss.. the US future market is still open. We are making tiny trades in our trading channel. 🍣🍜🫕🌻,btohqsg
