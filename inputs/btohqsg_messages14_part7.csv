So do as much homework as u need,btohqsg
Dont let other people tell u otherwise.There is no such thing as too much research.,btohqsg
Is there anything else other than what‚Äôs on HDB‚Äôs website to look out for especially as a first time applicant?,btohqsg
Calculate ur cpf money + potential future cpf money together,btohqsg
Nothing much at the gallery. It is just to see the space. But if you have been to friend's new houses. It looks the same,btohqsg
Is there any balance flat for kovan wellspring,btohqsg
Can hle for resale be used for bto purchase? Or need to apply hle again,btohqsg
I think there‚Äôs a time period for HLE,btohqsg
Yea but still within usable time period  but different purpose,btohqsg
What are these ratio all about? For first timer and 2nd timer?,btohqsg
how do you calculate what flats you can afford? my HLE is currently inaccurate and i‚Äôm not sure how loan i‚Äôll be able to get in the futureeverything else not covered by loan/grants have to be paid upfront before key collection? i assume it‚Äôs in a few hundred Ks,btohqsg
Before u even apply for a flat  u should have made some simple calculations on which estate  floor u can afford.Then u can project how much cpf money u have in the next maybe 3 - 5 years before key collection.With the salary of 2 people  u should also know how much grant u are getting because grant is based on point of application.Under-estimate it by 5k. Meaning to say if the chart on HDB says combine salary will get lets say 30k grant  u take into consideration u get 25k.,btohqsg
All these are numbers which can effectively tell u what kind of flat u can get.,btohqsg
Typically its a math equation:Flat price - CPF OA - grant = amount of money to be paidtypically amount of money to be paid = HLE minimum amount,btohqsg
This calculator is actually very helpful.,btohqsg
It will also help let you know how much you will need to have for each payment milestone,btohqsg
9.8 people fighting for 1 unit  first timer get 95% of the total units while second timer get 5% of the unit.,btohqsg
if me and my gf are not married yet  can we apply MARRIED CHILD PRIORITY SCHEME if our bto site is very close to my parent's flat?,btohqsg
Yes  just need to submit ROM cert within 6 months of key collection,btohqsg
Gg well played. Clementi northarc. Don't think it's wise to consider that if lookin at resale the in the future.,btohqsg
Hi anyone. Any link for canberra vista ?,btohqsg
Hello! Im currently working part time and studying in Uni at the same time now but previously I did work full time job before Uni starts. So I would like to ask if I want to apply for the august bto. What should I apply under! Should it be studying or part time or whatüòÖ cause my bf is in army now also,btohqsg
Also is there any grp for amk Aug bto?,btohqsg
Hello are you talking about central weave?https://t.me/angmokioAug2022bto,btohqsg
Are you studying part time or full time?,btohqsg
Studying full time Uni for 2 years,btohqsg
My partner will ORD next year Sep then start working,btohqsg
Then u should be under studying applying under fianc√©e/fiance scheme? U will not be able to apply for EHG yet though as that will require one of your to have at least 12mths of employment.,btohqsg
i think when you apply  you will have to enter your working/studying status and it will automatically determine the type of application,btohqsg
about the 12 months of employment  I started working last year September 13 2021. If I want to apply now for August BTO launch  am I still eligible for EHG?,btohqsg
you should be under the deferred income scheme then!,btohqsg
"this one is abit on the fence  if i recall correctly  they'll be counting 12 months prior to the flat application. because of how late in the month the sales launch was  they may use aug 2021-aug 2022 as the ""12 months"" for ehg. so you'll likely have to appeal",btohqsg
Not sure of part time job can be used tbh.. but it will be in ur cpf also,btohqsg
I have cpf for July and August  but its from my intern. Then September for my first full time job then followed by August for my second full time job all the way till now,btohqsg
Then how about the downpayment side?,btohqsg
Yes I know  that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm debating like should I apply saying I got work part one or should I just say studying,btohqsg
Pls correct me if I‚Äôm wrong!The EHG is supposedly applied on the first appointment at HDB right! Then it will be approved before your second appointment and it can be used to pay for the downpayment right?But if let‚Äôs say we are nt able to apply for the EHG since we are both in NS and studying then we applied for the staggered payment and all  how does everything actually works?üòÖ,btohqsg
I think if I'm not wrong  u will be able to apply for EHG at a later date (3mths before completion). However  this mean that you will need to pay out 5% of the downpayment.,btohqsg
Yeah  what Zoe said. if you're under the deferred income scheme  your income will be assessed for grants and loans payment close to the project completion/key collection date (HDB told me before that its 1-2 months prior).,btohqsg
I am assuming your are below the age of 29? Which means u only need to pay 5% downpayment instead of 10%.Your EHG grant will also prob be lesser as by 3mths before completion  your combine income will be prob be higher after working full time for awhile n therefore lesser grant.,btohqsg
Part time job is counted as long as you have cpf contributions cause i've just asked the HDB stuff recently during my appt!,btohqsg
oo that's great...if PT job counts  then intern can be counted since I have CPF contributions,btohqsg
not sure about the eventual income assessment but for the initial balloting form  if you are applying as 'unemployed (student)'  the application form will not allow you to put anything except 0 in your income,btohqsg
oic...i have been working full time since September 2021 hahaha,btohqsg
Hmm. So should I put part time or studentü§£,btohqsg
Think best is to call HDB to double check! Cause it can be quite confusing üòÖü•≤,btohqsg
Is there any group for jurong west jewel for confirmed buyers ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  may I know when SBF will open for booking? Sept or November? Thank you,btohqsg
Hi guys just checking anyone got their emails for May BTO application where HDB will send us an email to come down for the first appointment? Cause in the email that states our ballot number they told us that by 1st week of September we are expected to come down. But until now no email leh?Anyone facing the same issue?Thanks‚úåÔ∏èüòÖ,btohqsg
Are you considered full time or part time student by the school?,btohqsg
