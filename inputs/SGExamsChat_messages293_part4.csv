I walked for like 5 mins from bus stop to MOELC and I got a headache,btohqsg
Then after the paper I walked back I got a bigger headache  what is this bs,btohqsg
Really? I feel today it's more cooling alr. First time in probably 1-2 weeks I can stand at the bus stop in the morning without sweating. Anyway next month onwards it's gonna be the wet season so don't have to worry so much alr haha...,btohqsg

This yr paper is rly ok,btohqsg
All cuz of the Huang question,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why people say 71/80 isnâ€™t good-,btohqsg

At least no need study much ig haha,btohqsg
Can just relax and panic over smth other than math,btohqsg

Not only because of that...there were a lot of 4m qns and some unusual qns in paper 1 also,btohqsg
Yikes how did y'all cope with that?,btohqsg

I have to be honest compared to 2017  this year paper is relatively harder for maths :/,btohqsg
Likeee uk ermm Steve jobs all tt,btohqsg
Argumentative and narrative are my best but narrative I tend to have a boring tedious plot,btohqsg
