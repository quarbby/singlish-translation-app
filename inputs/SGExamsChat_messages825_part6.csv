Sry i not that familiar with US colleges,btohqsg
If im not wrong UC berkley is damn gud,btohqsg
Omg i have so many qns,btohqsg
did she get any help for application like paid services?,btohqsg
oh just saying she’s like American born and raised so different circumstances but when answering the app questions she’d know,btohqsg
UCLA sounds btr tho BAHAHAGDUD ik the brooke went thr,btohqsg
I see so many students around the world accomplishing so kuch at such a young age,btohqsg
I have a fellow project head thats 13 years old from london,btohqsg
we go through life at our own pace,btohqsg
i’ll be almost 30 when i finish my phd,btohqsg
Its ok my brother is 32 and only just started on his phd,btohqsg
We all go through life differently,btohqsg
But u earning momey so its technically a job,btohqsg
Think ofmit as a career switch,btohqsg
it’s a bit tricky in terms of job hunting afterwards so idk,btohqsg
Come to MI and teach phys,btohqsg
I heard the MI phys dept is actly dam jialat,btohqsg
I can tell you for a fact it is,btohqsg
crash coursefA(B) = is just subt x in equation A as equation BFor example A= ax^2+ bx+cB= x+2fA(B)= a(x+2)^2+ b(x+2)+cDomain is domain of ADomain of A must be a subset of range of B,btohqsg
A lot of us relied on physics tuition to get through H2 physics because our teachers were bad af,btohqsg
I dont get the domain and range inverse thingy eh HAHAHA,btohqsg
btw are you a guy or girl? just asking bc it seems like you won’t have NS buffer period to apply more times?,btohqsg
my retirement job is gonna be lecturing in poly,btohqsg
Im planning to use NS to get internships and join more comps and volunteer,btohqsg
Earn money just to yap about what you like,btohqsg
If fB(A) it is = ax^2+ bx +c+2Domain will be domain of B,btohqsg
I recently talked to NUS students and he said that i shld be starting my research now to complete it by the end of NS,btohqsg
tbh it’s more of idw to teach jc material and lower,btohqsg
it’s too rigid for my taste,btohqsg
So domain will be the first,btohqsg
Why not devote your life to spms,btohqsg
the emphasis on just spam practice to score,btohqsg
Finish doctorate then come back as a lecturer,btohqsg
Avtly he said dont do it cause i prolly dk what im getting myself into it but i told him YOLO and left the room,btohqsg
but like i’d kinda need my current prof to retire bc he’s a lecturer and our research fields overlap obv,btohqsg
Jk for obv reasons admin dont ban me,btohqsg
only way you can get him to retire is by doing so poorly in his mod,btohqsg
Wait is it a grad level mod,btohqsg
i can send you the notes at most lmao,btohqsg
Ok on second thought nvm ty,btohqsg
do you want the qm 2 notes from my year,btohqsg
idk if prof changed them yet,btohqsg
I wouldnt mind if its not any trouble,btohqsg
If it is then its ok,btohqsg
but anyway ideally i can be involved in a uni or like astar those kind after i graduate,btohqsg
not gonna touch jc level or o level if possible,btohqsg
nah its fine i’ll send tmr,btohqsg
Actually im quite fascinated by your prof,btohqsg
He went into MOE first then came out to do a doctorate?,btohqsg
Like i dont see a lot of teachers furthering their education,btohqsg
