If you're looking at the r56 generation,btohqsg
It is notorious for reliability issues,btohqsg
Most r56 ones on the market the powertrain is pre bmw takeover,btohqsg
So they're on a different type of engine that wasn't very reliable,btohqsg
Switched to bmw engines with the 2.0 being the b48 which is super reliable and a great platform as long as you maintain it right and don't slap on cheap mods,btohqsg
There's enough BMWs out there which were cheaply modded and poorly maintained and then the owners could not afford to fix issues they caused/could not keep up with wear and tear that happened quicker as they poorly modded the car,btohqsg
And they end up selling in the half arsed state,btohqsg
Ooh. That’s good to know. just curious with regards to such knowledge is it just follow car news frequently or can Google one. Cause when I try search online hard to see,btohqsg
Not bad also but harder to find clean units,btohqsg
can help teach me what does clean mean?,btohqsg
Especially if you're looking at the f10 520i or f30 320i,btohqsg
Well maintained  good health of powertrain and unmolested,btohqsg
Some owners like to add alot interior mods.. then wire never do properly,btohqsg

Can post or not is for admin to decide lmao. I got 72 pc games for dirt cheap and helped turkey/Syria in the process.... No need for you to be bitter over it,btohqsg
That day he was unhappy coz we were talking about music 🎶,btohqsg

Maybe he can go apply at SGCM and join the admin team,btohqsg
Sure way to get into more financial difficulties.,btohqsg

Ahhh that’s why you can withdraw $55k from Harris Isabella scammer’s platform mah,btohqsg
But first you need to inject $10 000 so that your money can magically grow and then disappear!!!!! 💨,btohqsg

Get lost and never come back,btohqsg
those who really trade with and know China  will know that China like everywhere else factually has a range of suppliers with different quality standards .. too many often habitually use a broad brush to paint products from China to be inferior .. which isn't the case today .. hence for those who get carbon fiber hoods from China  preferably to know people on the ground who knows which are the ones that have quality and are reliable ..,btohqsg
SG workshops boh pian  even with 90% or even 100% of their mechanics from Msia  they still have cost to contend with  notwithstanding some do obviously attempt to abuse with their charges for basic services ..,btohqsg
