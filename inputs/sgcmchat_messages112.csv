For once they are contributing to our car culture,btohqsg

"""it's hard to tell which DC5s are Type Rs or not. Because they probably aren't.""",btohqsg

How do you tell apart a fd2 from a fd2r,btohqsg
I know a guy who convert his 1.6 civic to FD2R so nowadays q hard to say what is what ü§£,btohqsg
">sideskirts are giveaways (ish)>type r sticker on the rear door if the car hasn't been resprayed and/or loved by their owners>rear trunk has no lock. FD2Rs are the only ones with remote locking. normal Civics have a keylock on the boot.>Center console has Type R badge>""HUD"" instrument cluster has i-VTEC rev lights on the left side  rev counter says Type R",btohqsg
