This is for sr flip flop,btohqsg
wait until u learn circuit designing using ICs,btohqsg
This looks like some graph I would see when I learnt audio engineering,btohqsg
then your project is like some game and u need to use like 8 to 12 ICs to power it,btohqsg
Basically it shows that the output q only goes to 1 when either s or r input is opposite(1 or 0 ),btohqsg

U see after 1 wk i throw back everything i learn,btohqsg
not too hard  but all return to teacher alr,btohqsg
They want u to apply it,btohqsg
Like how to use flipflop to design a circuit,btohqsg

no this is sg nasi lemak,btohqsg
yes  click group description for the links to the other sgexams chats,btohqsg

But currently in SG thatâ€™s pocket change,btohqsg
Why? They are earning quite little itâ€™s a known fact,btohqsg
Not in H2 math syllabus anymore,btohqsg
Compound interest meaning like A = P(..) ?,btohqsg
I did TYS and saw it in 2014 or smth,btohqsg
Never came out aft 2014 paper alr,btohqsg
I rmbr they covered it in O level E math tho,btohqsg
Sorry maybe itâ€™s 2017 or smth  but last 3 or 4 years donâ€™t have ?,btohqsg
You can check the syllabus doc lol,btohqsg
The closest thing to money in H2 math is the one where the dude borrows money from the bank and then thereâ€™s a geometric progression with the interest rates or smth like that,btohqsg
But we donâ€™t learn any formula for it tho. Itâ€™s literally just APGP  not the one with A = P(1+ blah blah)^n,btohqsg
Exactly donâ€™t need MOE to teach,btohqsg
