sorry as a singaporean  singapore not that hot lol,btohqsg
i suffer when i go to cold countries,btohqsg
try sit in traffic on bike,btohqsg
you wait i turn off air con when we go drive,btohqsg
you are in the presence of the best racist and greatest racist.,btohqsg
dont worry la. not in full gear still not that hot,btohqsg
i was there till like 10,btohqsg
most ducati owners i’ve talked to all hate riding their bikes on the daily because of the heat,btohqsg
first gear for legit 20 mins,btohqsg
brother why are YOU NOT IN NEUTRAL,btohqsg
cfm the fucking roundabout at bishan right,btohqsg
eh but i tell u now,btohqsg
if u think ur R15 is bad,btohqsg
just don’t say sg not hot pls,btohqsg
i mean rn sg relatively not hot,btohqsg
but once this whole abnormal climate is over,btohqsg
it’s not even the bike bruh,btohqsg
sg gone be hot as heck,btohqsg
oh u mean the sg heat,btohqsg
Can confirm. Theres one or two models that are less hot (naked models) but the sportbikes are pure torture,btohqsg
naked will always retain less heat,btohqsg
the one that i’m surprised about is i haven’t really heard anyone complain of heat on a H2 before,btohqsg
Yup  the fairing is basically a chimney diverting hot air to your balls,btohqsg
I think its too rare  not enough owners,btohqsg
his one is H2R but he play track only,btohqsg
also i just want to say i find it damn retarded people saying they want a H2R as a dream bike but want it to be able to corner faster than a MotoGP spec bike.,btohqsg
i cycle and saw before but idk it was a r33 till my frn told me is aorund novena and orchard,btohqsg
you'll need to fix your run on sentences before your results fixes them 😂,btohqsg
stop it before i say@a_junnis hot,btohqsg
singapore is hot because im in it 😎,btohqsg
I mean dec-jan always rain a lot,btohqsg
Only the hypermotard can tahan maybe,btohqsg
The rest so packed the heat dissipation gg,btohqsg
This is why even if you're from SG you still need to pass IELTS for many unis,btohqsg
it’s decent but idt as good as hypermotard,btohqsg
personally this is why i went for an r15 instead,btohqsg
I think you should get nmax,btohqsg
i’d rather eat my own shit,btohqsg
So they never pack so much,btohqsg
Try sitting on them in traffic or standstill with shorts on,btohqsg
Ducati heat dissipation is good if you're moving,btohqsg
Inb4 the shave gets your skin also,btohqsg
