Hello! And hello to everyone here as well! 🥰- E,btohqsg
good morning y’all! can I ask if anyone has 2x F1 Pit Lane Experience tickets to spare / that you are willing to sell at decent pricing? 🥹 would be super grateful if you do 🥲 thank you  🫶🏻,btohqsg
I’m 25  male  at Joo Koon.,btohqsg
I tried to ballot for it but didn't get it - J,btohqsg
Joo Koon not very appealing tho. Need passport to go there - J,btohqsg
they said that it wasn't transferrable!,btohqsg
ahh but people have been selling them for a few hundred already 🥺,btohqsg
this fella still trying so hard to get free packet of nasi padang,btohqsg
ah i see! bc initially they stated in their ballot t&c's that it's not transferrable  but in my successful ballot email  they just said they'll be sending the unique qr code closer to date - but not sure if they'll be checking id to the names,btohqsg
You’ll reach here in no time in your Wish lor!,btohqsg
Wait.. i didn’t even get the chance to report!,btohqsg
Wow you managed to get it! Congrats! - J,btohqsg
You should come here some time. It’s actually quite a cool hip place now ^^,btohqsg
yeah I was worried about that too  so I’m hoping that I can buy 2 tickets at decent prices.. just in case they check ID and i end up not being able to use the tickets (if I manage to get them) 🙁 pretty sure no one will refund because they only balloted to sell off the tickets in the first place 💔,btohqsg
but so excited for you! congrats 🥳! ✨,btohqsg
thank you!! and yeah it sucks that there are a lot of ppl out there who aren't actual fans that only balloted just to make a profit and there's less out there for all of us fans,btohqsg
My hopes and dreams of synthetic fuels replacing EV and hydrogen cell powered EVs come crashing,btohqsg
They say the same thing regarding the tickets as well but they're still on sale now aren't they?,btohqsg
Don't have pit lane experience  that one I also unsuccessful ballot,btohqsg
hope you have the best time! what a way to start off F1 weekend 👻yess I was so gutted bc my brother & I have been big fans since we were in primary school  so I was hoping to get the tickets - especially after getting him a ticket for the race that he can’t go to now because he got called back for IPPT 😩 such bad luck 🆘,btohqsg
I think a lot of non-fans joined the ballot at the F1 trucks that went around SG.. don’t think they were aware of it but they seemed to join in whenever they saw someone scan the QR code on the trucks 🙁,btohqsg
yeah  and you don't have to point out the obvious or be not nice about it. i'm just saying regarding the ballots because as much as people like to break the rules  i just don't want people to get scammed especially when this pit experience thing is limited compared to the tickets  if they can help it.,btohqsg
ahhhh :( will you be going for the grand prix though!,btohqsg
yeah HAHAH i saw it too when i went for the screenings,btohqsg
they just went up to the front to scan it,btohqsg
Wasn't trying to be rude  just trying to say that those terms are mentioned for all event tickets but they are still for sale and if you find the right seller you wouldn't get scammed :),btohqsg
I'm not too sure if this year's pit lane experience has a driver meet and greet like past years with all the drivers,btohqsg
yeah I was a lil frustrated about it bc I realised that hordes of people just joined in and a lot are prolly not gna use their tickets / gna sell them off.. what a waste if some don’t even show up 😭,btohqsg
Since they're doing a format similar to European races and having them come out on stage on one of the days one by one,btohqsg
The same thing with the grand prix tickets too  many buy just to sell on for profits. Just the sad reality now with events  can't do much about it,btohqsg
Well there might be some scammers around but most are selling at 10 to 30% markups on the tickets and negotiating,btohqsg
I think the pit lane experience won’t have the drivers meet & greet since it’s late at night & they’re prolly preparing/resting up for practice the next day! and there’s alr a drivers meet & greet on Saturday in Zone 1 😃,btohqsg
"And although it ""isn't allowed"" every event like this has tickets on sale for those who are willing to buy",btohqsg
Yupp  until 2019 the driver's meet and greet was with the pit lane experience,btohqsg
Same timings as now for the pit lane experience,btohqsg
The zone 1 meet and greet for Saturday is new to Singapore and is more of a drivers coming out on stage and speaking format,btohqsg
yupp I never managed to ballot successfully / never went for it before ever since I got back to SG in 2017 🥲,btohqsg
Well at least you have tickets to the grand prix and can visit zone 1 and try to stand near the driver swipe gates to get some autographs or pictures for yourrl brother,btohqsg
ahh do u know where those gates are? never tried to catch them in person like that before!,btohqsg
Might be hard getting a refund from the F1 team for your other ticket  would be best to sell it at list price to someone else who might not have been able to snag them up when they were first released,btohqsg
They're right next to gate 1a for patron entrance,btohqsg
There's usually metal barriers separating the areas but it is possible to stand there and get some autographs as some drivers usually stop to meet fans,btohqsg
One driver who never stops is Lewis Hamilton so if you're a fan  that's one you'll probably miss out on,btohqsg
I’ll try to track down where that is,btohqsg
this is exactly why I’ve never been a fan of him 😂,btohqsg
my all-time favs are Michael Schumacher  Kimi Raikkonen & Max 🧡,btohqsg
He hides in the backseat of whatever car he drives to the circuit usually,btohqsg
And gets dropped off as close to the swipe gates as possible,btohqsg
he was literally lying down and napping/sleeping in the backseat of one recently 😂,btohqsg
is anyone going to Amber Lounge btw? after the race - the drivers show up at times 👀,btohqsg
