so if you accidentally put in too much money and you realise before month end  you can transfer out to try to bring down the average to 100K.,btohqsg
Are there any methods to withdraw foreign currency from ATM with youtrip without having to pay such high fees. Previously their fee was $5 per withdrawal. Now is at 2%.Only idea is to get multiple account under youtrip and make use of their fee free first $400 withdrawal per month.,btohqsg
Has anyone received the email from prosperus for reward redemption?,btohqsg
Issue being I have already dump 2k inside tha card back in Feb when the rate was supposedly high at 104jpy,btohqsg
Then just withdraw $400 and swipe card for the rest of ur 1.6kMastercard shld be widely accepted in JP,btohqsg
Is $400 cash enough? One issue with the need for cash is for transportation. With the IC card discontinued for Tokyo. And the digital IC only available for iPhone and top-up only available for cards on apple pay. Youtrip does not support apple pay currently. So for transportation the IC card need to be top up with cash at the kiosk. I do have a physical IC card from when I last visited in 2015.,btohqsg
This is why dont use youtrip your money stuck inside unless u willing to just withdraw with the extra charges. Other card can store foreign currencies are better since u can withdraw or transfer out also. If not use trust or amaze with good cc will be the best,btohqsg
Now some transport can tap visa or mastercard in japan like simplygo in sg. Alot of have change in jap since covid. Card acceptance is so much more after covid,btohqsg
My 1st n 2nd mth with uob one. As i deposited fund at different days of the month  my interest is pro rated according to the interest tiers and number of days. I roughly calculated and total received is rather closed.,btohqsg
This is news to me. I guess I just have to try it out on my trip.,btohqsg
Any credit card that gives rewards to Apple instalment plan. Can anyone help me on this ? Thanks,btohqsg
Installment plan on card make the amt excluded from reward,btohqsg
If use atome or shopback these kind still can get rewards. But if card installment direct sorry no rewards,btohqsg
Before corvi19 already can tap using iphone u just need to setup and add suica bit only work on iphone not android unles your android is a Japan region,btohqsg
I mean use cc directly tap on tap off and go,btohqsg
Op is asking about youtrip card,btohqsg
Use Revolut card to top up. It has Apple Pay.,btohqsg
Ok but can I transfer money from youtrip to revolut?,btohqsg
I booked a hotel on agoda last night and used shopback 11% cashback  however the actualy payment of the hotel will only be made in october. will shopback trigger the cashback calculation based on the booking date (11%) or payment date (in OCT  prob lower amount)?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think you can. Need same platform  ie YouTrip to YouTrip  Revolut to Revolut. Japan IC card is much more convenient than CC. Some machine still need to slot in. Not all machine accept paywave.,btohqsg
hi is there any recommendation re which uob privi card variant to get? ie visa  Mastercard or amex. or not much difference? (probably not amex since not as commonly accepted compared to visa/mastercard?),btohqsg
actually what u using uob prvi for?,btohqsg
probably just to get the sign up bonus. After that.. will probably get the uob ladys solitaire and another 4mpd card so wont rly have much use for the prvi after that,btohqsg
think get mastercard in case want to use with Amaze for foreign/cross border spend,btohqsg
For UOB stash account  do you folks withdraw the interests the same day it's credited?This is to prevent the interests amount from being included in the day's closing balance  and thus affects the MAB.,btohqsg
on UOB National Day Savings promotion - after we submit the participation form  we have to wait for confirmation from UOB before transfering in the funds right?,btohqsg
u should have received an email with instructions,btohqsg
same as me.. im using prvi now in the second month for this exact purpose. im using MC for the prvi so that i can easily pair with amaze and switch around once i hit the 1k requirement,btohqsg
did you get that email on a Friday?,btohqsg
i only got an email stating that the email is an acknowledgement but not a confirmation of my participation,btohqsg
thanks trazora and Joshua.i understand that for the prvi card  there's 2.4 mpd for overseas spending. i suppose if you use amaze to convert the spending into sgd  it will be considered local spending and clock the usual 1.4 mpd rate?,btohqsg
yes that email will also state what you should do next.. Just follow that email and you should be all good.second paragraph is what u should look at,btohqsg
My first official Substack post (Do subscribe):Explaining Moomoo Cash Plus 5.8%* p.a. Guaranteed Returns Promohttps://honeymoneysg.substack.com/p/explaining-moomoo-cash-plus-58-pa,btohqsg
so we have to deposit the money first  then hopefully we will be chosen for the promotion?,btohqsg
you could say that. But you are already earning interest when u deposit the funds  so there is no loss even 'if you are not successful'i don't believe there is any reason for UOB not to allow you to participate unless you key in wrong details or what.the easiest way to know if you are 'successful' is when u see your available balance drop by the earmarked amount.remember the time frames  the earlier u take part  the earlier your earmark ends..,btohqsg
No more video on moomoo 5.8%  changed to article form. But if any questions  feel free to comment,btohqsg
uob stash gives me 3% but stanchart esaver gives me 3.4% at the moment,btohqsg
without the promotion - there's no reason to be deposit into stash,btohqsg
