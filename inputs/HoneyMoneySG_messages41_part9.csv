What is the best credit card to apply and use if I want to buy two Lenovo laptop each about $2400,btohqsg
it depends on what you are looking for in terms of rewards (cashback or miles)I think you have more options with milesOCBC Titanium Rewards (either the Blue or Pink card)- can just charge the entire S$2400 to one cardIf you really want to go full into this miles game and you happen to buy from Challenger or Harvey Norman  then you can pay via Kris+ with OCBC TR as the payment method7 miles per dollar x2400 = 16800 miles - decent business class within SEA?,btohqsg
Challenger or harvey norman on kris+ is reducing miles earn from May. Need to be fast though 😊,btohqsg

Where are you buying it   if you’re buying from online store mcc 5405 or electronic store like courts Harvey Norman etc   OCBC titanium will be good choice as it’s limit is $13335 per card ( blue or pink ) per card year,btohqsg

Hi all  I just gotten my UOB Prvimiles card yesterday and would like to clarify something  since the UNI will only be given for every $5 spend  what if I make $4 for first transaction and $1 for 2nd transaction  will I be awarded the UNI? Or must I spend at least $5 in a single transaction then only eligible for getting the UNI  thanks all for your information in advance!,btohqsg

Hi all  wonder how can I get credit card with no salary crediting - got stipend from school and other part time jobs?,btohqsg
Deposit $ with them lor. Secured credit card.,btohqsg
I think the amount you give them will be equivalent to your credit limit,btohqsg
Anyone familiar with setting up citi payall? Seems like only option is 6 months scheduled. How to fit a payment schedule before August like that? 😅,btohqsg
Usually 10k. Hopefully u get a good FD rate,btohqsg
No need to do anything. The money will be deposited back to the original bank account used to sign up T bill.,btohqsg
Yea   some months less than 500,btohqsg
If your spend is inconsistent  it's best to go with flat cashback cards like HSBC Revolution  Citi Rewards + Amaze  Maybank Platinum Visa,btohqsg
aint those all miles cards 😂,btohqsg
Citi rewards got x10 on dining?,btohqsg
but i think the idea is to go for those  then change them to credits anyway,btohqsg
They all can be used as cashback cards too. Just convert points into cashback instead of miles lah,btohqsg
I thiguht dining mcc not eligible for x10,btohqsg
Dining mcc isn't in the blacklist. Citi rewards works on a blacklist for online transactions or when paired with amaze,btohqsg
catering mcc might be blacklisted though  not too sure about that one myself,btohqsg
Oooo do I get 4mpd if spending in dining for ocbc titanium?,btohqsg
This one I not sure. But should be okay  u can go try,btohqsg
For new RHB customer  do I have to head down the branch for account opening for fixed dep promo ? or can just do it online?,btohqsg
https://rhbgroup.com.sg/rhb/personal/fixed-deposit-campaignIf you are talking about this promo  its through their MOBILE APP ONLY,btohqsg
ah yes  saw the terms. thanks a lot,btohqsg
Another suggestion:If you are not very comfortable or confident with the t&cs of miles/rewards card  OCBC 360 account can pair with OCBC NXT card to earn bonus interest in the months that you spend >$500.But yes the cashback rate is lowwwww (0.5% when <$1k spending),btohqsg
I would recommend you go for those 1.5% unlimited cashback kind if cashback cards is more comfortable for you,btohqsg
