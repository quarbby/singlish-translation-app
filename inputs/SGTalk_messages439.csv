isnt Purtier that MLM Riway product ?,btohqsg
the so called deer placenta taht can cure everything on earth,btohqsg
Someone gave me their 'half portion' for my medical issues.,btohqsg
Correct … damn fake made a lot cancer sufferers false hope,btohqsg
If deer placenta so powerful then why aren’t deers immortal,btohqsg
When people are desperate  they will believe anything. Like eating poop or send money to India to buy cows or build temples,btohqsg
Sometimes not the person who suffer desperate . It’s their family members.I know the feeling . If I can sell my soul or even my hand or leg if I can save my dad that time I would . But the reality is times up means times up .,btohqsg
Every possible ways.. just like my leg now to get well,btohqsg
That’s why those who so call ‘medicine’ can cure cancer or whatever if have don’t need doctors or hospitals.This and so call magic powers all prey on ppl desperate attempts,btohqsg
Yo mei Mei . What happened to ya leg ?,btohqsg
Wah then how? Got any follow up therapy?,btohqsg
Went tcm twice liao. Much better,btohqsg
Tmr onwards  can wfh 3 days a wk..,btohqsg
Everyday take grab.. i want to cry liao 😅,btohqsg
So... Now then we out for breakfast? Lunch? Dinner?,btohqsg
Ikr damn xiong.. my bus fare per day only $2-3,btohqsg
IDK which meal go call this now,btohqsg
Use tada .. each trip $10 to office,btohqsg
That day I went JB  grab also more ex there 😭,btohqsg
I think was the ride from hiap joo to Mount Austin was rm35?,btohqsg
But I remembered usually 20+ only,btohqsg
I rem from mid valley to city square like sgd 6,btohqsg
No matter what still cheaper than sg grab,btohqsg
Sg grab is kill ppl put fire one,btohqsg
But go there eat is really shiok,btohqsg
No complains. Only toilets selection quite depressed 😂,btohqsg
Must know go where got nicer toilets,btohqsg
New cafes also quite ok 1,btohqsg
Some of them smoke inside toilet de,btohqsg
U go in see the seat got pee n 💩,btohqsg
I cannot stand too erxin toilet,btohqsg
Malls like mid valley should be ok la,btohqsg
Unless u go like holiday plaza,btohqsg
The mall a bit run down,btohqsg
I remember can smoke inside the mall,btohqsg
I just follow and smoke nia,btohqsg
Its like sg de lucky plaza 🤣,btohqsg
I think that mall going bite the dust soon,btohqsg
I used to go holiday plaza.. there got 1 土场 wholesale,btohqsg
I tot at there do mani or pedi cheap?,btohqsg
My friend’s mum kena robbed at ksl,btohqsg
I use to take bus from ksl back to city square,btohqsg
The city square downstairs got bus interchange le,btohqsg
IM17 the bus no. If i rem correctly,btohqsg
I take was rm 1.50 🤣,btohqsg
That bus interchange got lots of bus to everywhere,btohqsg
Even Ikea if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
See where u want to go,btohqsg
I drop my ezlink pass somewhere or kenna rob i oso dunno lol,btohqsg
When i go bck  i cant find my ezlink,btohqsg
The whole pass holder missing lo 😢,btohqsg
Depends on timing also  towards 4-6pm costs more,btohqsg
Maybe was morning timing.. hmm 🤔 but I remembered last time cheaper,btohqsg
Anyways can't help if they increased 😅,btohqsg
Like our chicken rice now also increase. Want to eat then LL also have to buy,btohqsg
Austin area from JB central area usually 20++ RM at least.,btohqsg
Ya I remembered was 20+ but that day 30+ near 40,btohqsg
So I was shock for a moment 😅,btohqsg
Peak hours usually more.. so near 40 is understandable,btohqsg
I saw robbery happened in front of me before. That fellow ran n behind shouting robbery help help but yet no 1 helped,btohqsg
But it was ironic that robbery was running towards ciq 😅,btohqsg
In JB or most part of Malaysia no one will.Coz they don’t want trouble and most likely they know it’s a Singaporen kena rob .,btohqsg
Even own local kena also may not help,btohqsg
Actually we are to used to Singapore safety so usually we are targeted .,btohqsg
Even fake gold looking jewellery also don't wear go Malaysia liao 🤣,btohqsg
Sad but true. The local more cautious also will,btohqsg
U try leave ur hp  wallet or whatever on a table outside SG see,btohqsg
U can still see it there in the next 5 mins I also say u r protected by someone up there,btohqsg
Kena robbed or car window smash bopian LL .As long not injured okay .Or what worst is must keep your children safe . The worst is kidnapping,btohqsg
I was there n the mcd next to my Airbnb got 2 guys fight over umbrella n that fellow took out a weapon n the other fellow went to heaven liao,btohqsg
I remember my friend told me got a sg guy refused to let them snatch his phone  his hand kena chopped off,btohqsg
And probably they on drugs too,btohqsg
Last time got 1 news ma,btohqsg
Ya high on drugs liao so anything also might do 😢,btohqsg
Got someone kena chopped at petrol station,btohqsg
That one is revenge act i think,btohqsg
Nowadays more common is even u go supermarket suddenly some crazy ass came n random shooting,btohqsg
Almost like every day in USA it's happening,btohqsg
In Malaysia 1 right? That 1 is revenge,btohqsg
So it's different if no revenge then no chopping 😅,btohqsg
Recently i saw a video from other group,btohqsg
Got a guy tio beaten up and slashed,btohqsg
1 whole group assaulting 1 guy,btohqsg
I think max I go 1 corner hide then call mata,btohqsg
I'm not master ye  I can't fight 10,btohqsg
When I was young  I remember got 1 phrase was 英雄变狗熊,btohqsg
Just light up a fire at the rubbish nearby and shout fire  sure a lot of people will come out,btohqsg
I think the police also dun dare intervene,btohqsg
It's just to make them run,btohqsg
If you really not scared of dying just take a fire extinguisher spray at them,btohqsg
The powder will attack their eyes and you can grab the victim and run,btohqsg
Like machiam in a movie scene,btohqsg
Must make sure can use leh,btohqsg
Scarli become dry liao   cant use,btohqsg
"U don't suggest. Later 1 day we see news headlines is ""1 sg lang tries to use fire extinguisher to spray at gangsters at JB kena wacked into 狗熊""",btohqsg
Even if you use insect repellent and spray  the smell and burning sensation on the skin will fend off most people,btohqsg
Ya especially overseas 1.. sakli all Alibaba fire extinguisher 😂,btohqsg
Not 狗熊，  maybe can sell salted egg,btohqsg
Especially if you spray on their faces,btohqsg
I trying not to think till so bad lah 😂,btohqsg
Though it might be that case,btohqsg
Like I said  if you are not afraid of dying,btohqsg
But at least now sell salted eggs  means u towkay liao. Got own business 😝😝,btohqsg
If u r ip man u can la,btohqsg
Or if it's your loved one getting attacked,btohqsg
Swing the fire extinguisher at them if spray doesn't work 🤣,btohqsg
I think still can swing lah,btohqsg
At least before u sell salted eggs  u bring 1 along to 垫背,btohqsg
If you get chased by a gang just run and yell fire fire fire,btohqsg
Sure a lot of people will come out to see,btohqsg
Because people all afraid the fire burn their property will come out and see,btohqsg
If cannot outrun them then gg,btohqsg
Now u only can hop with 1 foot,btohqsg
Minions!! They roll down the slope 🤣,btohqsg
U think u got that 欠打 face meh? Go out will have people want to wack u?😅,btohqsg
In case got ppl want to whack me i just run,btohqsg
Just train to keep your mouth shut  usually people get chased is because mouth itchy 😂😂. I trained very hard to keep quiet,btohqsg
That's how u usually kena wack by me too...,btohqsg
Like the sim lim square fight,btohqsg
Then end up I learn 铁砂掌,btohqsg
Uturn n roll down n hit them like wrecking ball,btohqsg
I didn't feel pain leh 😂,btohqsg
That's y now uncle now also guai guai eat his srooms 🤣,btohqsg
That's not the actual picture  real picture in Facebook  but you get the idea,btohqsg
Then uncle should train to reflect damage,btohqsg
“When damage taken  returns all damage to attacker”,btohqsg
He needs skills books like 金箍照? 😂,btohqsg
This 1 can not learn 😒,btohqsg
He can't find the actual pic. So now no more evidence liao,btohqsg
Probably if need  I can do a fresh 1 on the spot 😇😇,btohqsg
Need to practise skill   if not rusty liao,btohqsg
U know is like arcade those punching game,btohqsg
Lol scammer.. that one with 0 post,btohqsg
Isit you fall down on Some Body's hands accidentally?,btohqsg
Ya my hand was just like there n he suddenly appear n it just happens,btohqsg
Did he apologise to you? Must have hurt your palm,btohqsg
Sounds like the caseWhere the guy accidentally slips and fall and penetrated the girl’s vajayjay,btohqsg
huh that was a statement a man made in court,btohqsg
Shoes buy those no brand oneEasier to slip and fall,btohqsg
If u say u wear Nike and buak tohHarder to believe,btohqsg
That one doctors and kitchen helpers wear to not buak toh on wet floors,btohqsg
Crocs will come out and defend themselves,btohqsg
So many cases crocs stuck on escalators 😂😂,btohqsg
That day saw my wife colleagues all wearing crocs,btohqsg
Don’t know is it user problem or what,btohqsg
I tot crocs very cheap nia,btohqsg
They say $100+ i was like wtf,btohqsg
Classic crocs not expensive  $40 can buy.,btohqsg
Expensive ones are the high platforms,btohqsg
But they still fall down wor,btohqsg
Means they don’t know how to walk properly,btohqsg
Either she dragged her feet then tripped or she not used to high platform,btohqsg
I don't find crocs comfortable leh,btohqsg
Buy from tb almost the same n cheaper at 10,btohqsg
They went to the shop to buy ba,btohqsg
Saw on tiktok someone tripped wearing platform crocs and broke her shin bone,btohqsg
Cannot sia  if I wear crocs  I feel weird,btohqsg
Nowadays got brand also not necessarily good,btohqsg
If wet  the crocs will make the clown shoe sound leh,btohqsg
Like my flip flop  tmd... Half year only slippery liao,btohqsg
Confirmed is tripped on her own legs,btohqsg
But recently he changed to adidas foam slipper,btohqsg
I live in fitflops too! But now theor design v  v v v v ugly,btohqsg
I influence him to get foam slippers,btohqsg
I'm lazy  to wear all the covered shoes,btohqsg
I only wear nike foam slides now,btohqsg
Tiagong here got pple wear ah pek white and blue slipper,btohqsg
But the possibility of tripping still there.,btohqsg
Some people walk like to drag their feet,btohqsg
Then the rubber bend  and tripped,btohqsg
The rubber is thick n gao gao 1,btohqsg
No! The Y will drop out deCuz base too heavy,btohqsg
"Have leh.. Those ""closing down sale' slip",btohqsg
Wet marketInside those shops should have,btohqsg
Previously i bought a few from jb but never wear liao,btohqsg
Got a few pairs still brand new,btohqsg
I can’t get used to the platform crocs HAHAUA,btohqsg
Ever since i bought the nike one,btohqsg
I got 1 slippers from JB I got like rm5 or so n I wore it for years. Damn good,btohqsg

@millionaire664you do not have permission text me,btohqsg
I actually got it from some supermarket 😂🤣 but ok for wearing downstairs lah,btohqsg
I think 1 pair less than $10 sgd,btohqsg
I got a few buy le never wear before,btohqsg
U must go there find n try yourself cause shoes honestly very subjective. For some wear ok but some wear will blisters etc,btohqsg
But nowsdays shoes not as cheap as compare to the past,btohqsg
Last time any small shop houses also can find good buys. Nowadays shoes like only those malls or particular brands,btohqsg
Everlast used to have birkinstocks dupe but no more alr,btohqsg
my colleague bought $800 hermès sandals… she had many $8 blisters,btohqsg
Had it for about a year or two,btohqsg
But problem is that cannot be in touch with water or it’ll spoil,btohqsg
I remembered I was young young I got my shoes at 1 of the shop houses at bedok interchange behind the ntuc. Got rows of shop houses there n got over 3 shoes all selling different shoes,btohqsg
N comfy. Can wear 1 year also ok ok 1,btohqsg
Last time i force myself to wear that  flipflop,btohqsg
I very into NUM last time,btohqsg
Older uncles aunties said before u must bite the shoes so the shoes won't bite u.. is it true?🤭,btohqsg
I didn’t bite my heels and it bit me,btohqsg
I got my heels from Steve Madden,btohqsg
I was at Prague n then I saw their own country brand shoes which many people will buy but I didn't.. hmm,btohqsg

Tbh  I don't buy Birkenstock. I saw them at Germany  they have them in a big box selling like lelong..,btohqsg
Coz the guy on the phone,btohqsg

My dad just went out  don’t know they still around not,btohqsg
I don't think I can tahan wear 1 month of pain.. probably the shoes will end up collecting dust somewhere 😅,btohqsg
I wear until i season the flip flop,btohqsg
Painful cos the flip flop got the rubber thingy at the back,btohqsg
So it kinda force your feet to bua the sides of the cross,btohqsg
but quite comfortable leh this one,btohqsg
Idk.. their shoes looks hard imo,btohqsg
