Some peeps in class thought next week is ss,btohqsg
I thought ss is 2272/1   2273/1   2274/1  ?,btohqsg
Yea   but combined humanities code also rhe same,btohqsg
No it says 2272/2  2273/2  2274/2,btohqsg
Next week day 3 have   say 4 is pure humanities,btohqsg
Why does this give me an impression that you don’t know ..,btohqsg
Chill   i haven’t stated on my combined humanities 👍👍,btohqsg
I started on all my humanities,btohqsg
Then you are good to go,btohqsg
then my Cher text me ask to text the class I was sleeping,btohqsg
I know that before the first paper   tecaber always said must sleep 8 hours,btohqsg
But I legit cannot fall sleep untill 1-2,btohqsg
While my peers want to got out,btohqsg
I use to run from 6-8,btohqsg
I got this aesthetic   like in the dead middle of the night,btohqsg
Sleep until next day 8 Sia,btohqsg
mine will start this wed  very late sianz,btohqsg
what the heck LOL o’s alr start zz,btohqsg
I can feel my face when I'm with you  Ammonia (:,btohqsg
Mans smelled the ammonia and woke up in the weekend,btohqsg
Interested My daughter next year is o level have filled the form,btohqsg
GOOD LUCK FOR BIOLOGY O'S TMR :> AHHHH,btohqsg
anyone can predict the theory qn for bio tmr?,btohqsg
yalor :/ but idk maybe my sch loves us 120 ppl to bits to the extent they dw let us go hehe,btohqsg
its 2nd last day they're still stuffing stuff down our throats,btohqsg
HUH?! I THOUGHT IT'S LATER EH IDK IT WAS NEXT WEEK,btohqsg
@crying_over_social_studieshow do you study for pure geog?,btohqsg
Eh better pass math and eng hor,btohqsg
y’all got any tips for bio,btohqsg
Hello pure/combined bio students! Your practical exams are coming real soon  so I came out with this Practical Notes for you. Hope it helps you in your revision! :),btohqsg
For bio  use ur past experience to carry out ur observations accurately. Cambridge may give ez specimen like onions and potato  but if they wan bamboozle the cohort  they can set random shitz,btohqsg
Ya really need to pass math.,btohqsg
If not can't even go poly,btohqsg
I only take E math and A math while in ITE.,btohqsg
Huh then why u take EA math In ite,btohqsg
As a private candidate you mean? or as a module in ITE,btohqsg
I was a former ITE student too. I failed my EL  only ITE accepts me,btohqsg
The reason why i in ITE. Is cos i am from NT.,btohqsg
I have a classmate from NT to NA and to sec5 then poly,btohqsg
I almost get into NA in Sec 2 once.,btohqsg
And the rest was all A.,btohqsg
hihi  I was from NT too  totally can relate,btohqsg
There is not much opportunity for us to just,btohqsg
I mean there is not much route for us.,btohqsg
The only route for us is,btohqsg
So 4 years ITE? But now you must be in poly rn no?,btohqsg
NT -> nitec -> polyOrNT -> nitec -> Hnitec -> poly,btohqsg
Life in Higher Nitec to me pointless.,btohqsg
But the gov is removing the streaming thingy in a couple of years that’s good,btohqsg
Wait how do you cope with EA math when you're in NT tho,btohqsg
Yea I mean EM shud be ok but,btohqsg
then why not go to poly after nitec ?,btohqsg
Gpa to go poly after nitec 3.5,btohqsg
I take NA math at Sec 3,btohqsg
And took A math at Sec 4.,btohqsg
It very rare for NT student to take A math,btohqsg
Bruh then u never promote to NA,btohqsg
Last time I NA I took combined science in O level syllabus,btohqsg
you got the opportunity to choose,btohqsg
Tbh i been self studying A math at sec 3,btohqsg
Then my E math teacher know that i been self studying A math,btohqsg
And he let the HOD know about it.,btohqsg
And HOD want to see my EOY for E math first.,btohqsg
That was how i take A math at NA,btohqsg
Cause’ like time I died in AM so badly,btohqsg
my amath cher was pretty gd,btohqsg
I am the type can read solution,btohqsg
Anyone know that app where u can do like task for someone and get paid,btohqsg
Idk I seen in on tiktok,btohqsg
Oh I went the NA then O level route after the GCE NT exam,btohqsg
u plan to do that in future? Or was it like a course u chose randomly,btohqsg
I plan to be a math tutor ah bro,btohqsg
It works that way wtv u described,btohqsg
wah quite diff from what u study  lol,btohqsg
actually why didn’t u continue the secondary path to O level?  Ur results q good what lol,btohqsg
where the heck u get fe2 HAHAHA,btohqsg
But then people said that Fe2 came aft the solution got oxidases which means it wasn’t present bef in the sol right,btohqsg
Aaaa so frustrating. I wrote Fe2 as well but then everyone said it’s wrong,btohqsg
My Cher was the one who did the experiment when we were doing,btohqsg
For English paper 1 compo rite  Is it advisable to write descriptive and narrative . ( ps   I am really trash at writing agrumentive ones  because I don’t have global example to use ),btohqsg
I hardly read the news ;/,btohqsg
descriptive and narrative are good if you have a lot of content  but u need a lot of good descriptors and flow to the story,btohqsg
so ur lang need to be good,btohqsg
descriptive writing is easy to score in,btohqsg
argumentative dont have to use news per se  hypotheticals work as well (though ofc using news would be good)  also dont rly hae to use current affairs  i think relevant example are good enough,btohqsg
So   are you planning to write descriptive ones ?,btohqsg
Do you know the format for it ?,btohqsg
My school trains is argumentative  so I don’t anything about descriptive,btohqsg
honestly none of them are easier than the other  best is to train n practice for all   in the case ur banking for descriptive essay but then they come up with some confusing ass thing to describe also difficult,btohqsg
uh i think the format is more flexible. for example  last year O level section C tested smth along the lines of  what you’d do to de stress? i j wrote an intro and 3 different activities  then conclusion. actually a lot like argumentative except it’s less dependent on hardcore longing :),btohqsg
it straight up said describe no?,btohqsg
i personally j go for the descriptive one regardless of if it’s hybrid because i find it easiest to smoke HAHA,btohqsg
argumentative is a hit or miss,btohqsg
Last year the qn‘ there is. I place like home ) DYA,btohqsg
Yea I am scared if Cambridge decides to give a hard qn on argumentative,btohqsg
So in this case I would write narrative for the first time 🤡🤡,btohqsg
I am trying to be flexible,btohqsg
for narrative  your language doesn’t have to be stellar. just try to pace yourself well  don’t drag on the preamble or the conclusion.,btohqsg
more than the actual plot  make sure ur grammar is good,btohqsg
Does descriptive need really - atas descriptive words to write ?,btohqsg
uh i honestly don’t know what’s considered atas in terms of vocab,btohqsg
but if ur asking if u need to have five syllable words  then the answer is no,btohqsg
Basically   I need to expand on the five senses,btohqsg
Thanks for clarifying my doubts tho,btohqsg
Anyone took bio prac for Os?,btohqsg
What in the world was that😭,btohqsg
I think for most people its easier,btohqsg
I mean i feel argumentative much more hit and miss than descriptive,btohqsg
But harder to make argumentative stand out,btohqsg
U need to if u want to grt A1,btohqsg
eng and gp is literally abt being smooth and not messing up,btohqsg
How do u do well for EL paper 2,btohqsg
One of the easier ways to do so is to bring in multiple perspectives of ur point  not just the people for/against  but also the ones who abstained,btohqsg
What do u hope to get for el?,btohqsg
Identify qn type  use ur compre skills to find points  then answer the qn,btohqsg
At least B3 but my grade is like C5 because I always fail paper 2,btohqsg
Err u can pm me abt eng p2 bah,btohqsg
I can try to help as much as i can,btohqsg
A whiteboard is like a physical ipad?,btohqsg
Is it tremendously beneficial for studying,btohqsg
You need like so much of it,btohqsg
whiteboard tbh not v useful (personal thought ),btohqsg
just get one stack from popular the normal paper,btohqsg
and u can look back when u wan to,btohqsg
Plus writing on paper isn’t as smooth as a whiteboard from what I’ve heard,btohqsg
For whiteboard you can just screenshot,btohqsg
When you’re done writing on the whiteboard,btohqsg
Personal preferences   whatever works for u Will be the best,btohqsg
whiteboard useful for diagrams  maps  etc,btohqsg
if ur just gonna write words  dun bother,btohqsg
Blowing $100 on a whiteboard then discovering it’s useless,btohqsg
U mean the big ones ???,btohqsg
theres online apps which help u with mindmapping and such,btohqsg
u gonna stick it to ur wall or smth?,btohqsg
or u can always get mindmap templates,btohqsg
Writing on paper personally helps me to rmb better,btohqsg
But ofc it varies for others,btohqsg
I dun like the smooth writing leh,btohqsg
It can’t get in my head,btohqsg
What's the bio mitosis ans HAHAHAH,btohqsg
does doing mind maps help with studying pure geog?,btohqsg
idk what really works for me  and p geog paper is v soon,btohqsg
anyone know where to buy a large fencing mask,btohqsg
idk bro they just tell us draw anaphase which is like 1 line ??? LOL,btohqsg
means theres something else i guess,btohqsg
1 line 3m is very pepega,btohqsg
Can I check with y’all if for pure chem prac is more or less titration + QA,btohqsg
Does QA come out every year,btohqsg
coz i bought it with my coach,btohqsg
sooo yeah but there are stores that sell it iirc,btohqsg
if anyone's interested in parkour u can check this out ^,btohqsg

hii for chem pract rgt  when u wanna record timing in seconds is it nearest second  1 dp or 2 dp?,btohqsg
No one cares bout dp cuz of human reaction time,btohqsg
Unless you tell me you flash or smt then sure,btohqsg
if its quick reactions then its 1dp. if its long reactions  then its nearest second,btohqsg
They give the first 0. smt if you need record time,btohqsg
Include 0s in your table or smt,btohqsg
No way they’ll ask for 2dp,btohqsg
so who's up for going to sch and destroying the chem lab early tmr?,btohqsg
How does one let one sibling leave one's rook,btohqsg
My sis camping in my room,btohqsg
I see. Take out fake cockroach,btohqsg
I’ve never seen girls not afraid of cockroaches,btohqsg
Atb to your chem practical tmr,btohqsg
is anyone here afraid of getting screwed over by emaths/amats moderation :’),btohqsg
Yah i scared i kena F9 for both,btohqsg
I take that Ur telling my sis instead,btohqsg
u guys will be finefor emath it will be challenging to get A's   most fall within B3for amath pray to bellcurve gods,btohqsg
Don't worry too much...national distinction rate for both maths is about 55% for express stream students. National pass rate in 2017 is 93.3% for E Math  95.2% for A Math,btohqsg
"Hi everyone  can you guys help give me a letter grade (A+  B-  etc) for this introduction? I'm struggling to pass but I've been working on introductions. Would really appreciate the feedback. TIA! ^_^Question: ""Can fear be good?"" Discuss.For many people  whenever the word ‘fear’ is mentioned  they would think of something supernatural that they are scared of. Most would think that fear is bad. They may think that way because fear makes them open to people’s judgement or criticism. However  fear can be positive. The positivity of fear can help a person to progress and grow into someone better.",btohqsg
that's a very big assumption in the first sentence,btohqsg
Oh. Thanks for your reply. Could you share how I could improve it?,btohqsg
dont associate fear with supernatural immediately,btohqsg
because most people don’t necessarily think of the supernatural,btohqsg
I see. What's a better association?,btohqsg
you could improve it by just associating it with the idea of being scared,btohqsg
or you could do a rhetoric,btohqsg
asking the reader what their fears are,btohqsg
and then elaborating on your own,btohqsg
then u could go into the general idea of fear,btohqsg
Wow thanks! Can I check if you mean this would be in the introduction or do you mean in the body?,btohqsg
i think the introduction should mainly be your thesis/stance + a hook if you wish  but i think what fear means to you/what fear is defined as should also be in the introduction  but briefly  since the question is whether fear can be good,btohqsg
Right... I get it now. Thanks for your time and help! ^_^,btohqsg
Btw those taking chem prac today   jiayouuu!!,btohqsg
No one storming the labs yet?,btohqsg
All the best to people who are taking Chemistry practical today!!!,btohqsg
Hi guys how was chem practical? Anyone drank kopi o?,btohqsg
I forgot to tell you guys something,btohqsg
Idk which is the instrument that you put a red blob on it,btohqsg
I think your chem teacher told you to hit the tip of the pipette against the beaker or sth to extract the last drop of liquid in the pipette,btohqsg
Help u suck fluid for pipette,btohqsg
Is anyone here from NUS or SMU business admin? if there is could i ask u a question or 2 in PM? im looking to go to either one of them,btohqsg
But instead you should use the pipette filler to help you extract the liquid out,btohqsg
Exit means to let air gtfo,btohqsg
Need to inflate the shaped like balloon thingy and just squeeze it really hard,btohqsg
Idk if I correct cos I had 2 hours of sleep b4 practical,btohqsg
HAHAHA yea sia it legit looks like coffee,btohqsg
Since when titration so many steps broo,btohqsg
The red blob is called pipette filler,btohqsg
I'm a sec 4 na student I take exp el sbb,btohqsg
Is b3 good enough for poly,btohqsg
Is there a certain requirement for poly for olvl el?,btohqsg
I planning go sec 5 and drop English if I score good enough this year,btohqsg
But ya min req is d7,btohqsg
English + math for most course is D7,btohqsg
Why cannot go sec 5 sia?,btohqsg
Uhh schools dislike taking Sec 5s,btohqsg
like how my sch chase me out,btohqsg
unless if it’s an exceptional one,btohqsg
like thats why I go priv,btohqsg
Lol you learn some useful stuff,btohqsg
But the main issue is the community,btohqsg
ITE has a ton of negative influence,btohqsg
Some of it is actually cool,btohqsg
Like you learn zbrush and all that,btohqsg
Wth why didn’t I take it,btohqsg
I paid $200 for 8 subs,btohqsg
oops i forgot reply but yes this is the main issue@khairyfarhan,btohqsg
then y u nvr go private Os then go poly,btohqsg
Wait then is it possible to take IB privately??,btohqsg
Or is it 100% self directed learning,btohqsg
u can jst take likeengemath amath poachi?,btohqsg
Plus NT science is so much different than O level science.,btohqsg
if not na then go pfp lor,btohqsg
@sefffzite offer general studies which gives tution + free Os,btohqsg
general studies is like a 3hrs of tuition and it's once a week.,btohqsg
I really don't encourage NA students to go ITE.,btohqsg
most of my bestfriends all come from  ITE,btohqsg
I paid 1.4K for the same,btohqsg
tats cuz u didnt go to ur course,btohqsg
tbh u shud jst go early childhood in ite,btohqsg
I thot u talking ant tuition,btohqsg

Crap why didn’t I go to ITE,btohqsg
But still need to pay a sum of money,btohqsg
I thot u made it into ur dream course,btohqsg
Trash score with trash subject combination,btohqsg
At least is cheaper than private O level,btohqsg
But I’m still not happy with my score,btohqsg
Oh then wots the pt of retaking?,btohqsg
I dont think it matters rite?,btohqsg
Focus the ego on ur gpa,btohqsg
If there’s an A level version,btohqsg
Lol first time i heard someone want to take Os for fun,btohqsg
I took O level maths for fun too,btohqsg
I know someone in SJIB who’s taking O levels privately this year because she wants raw 6 instead of her raw 8,btohqsg
u cannot take private Os while being in a sch,btohqsg
Wait so u cant take it in jc or poly?,btohqsg
I mean whats the pt if ur already in jc,btohqsg
oki bai bai I go cook,btohqsg
So technically if I this year get like b4 or b3 is considered v good for most courses?,btohqsg
Does this apply to eae in sec 5?,btohqsg
U eae just pass math n eng and under 26 can alr,btohqsg
Like how my friend's mid yr + prelim 39 & 42,btohqsg
@aceberriesI only recommend to go sec5 if U confident to get in eae / wan go jc,btohqsg
Or extremely confident getting to the course u wan to go in,btohqsg
Yes  Madamé Meow with the fishes!,btohqsg
Eat with oats  nuts and soy milk,btohqsg

Even with Chinese I still will fail,btohqsg
Normally ss is pull my humans de,btohqsg
My geog don't pull ss leh but now need pull,btohqsg
My students said it was do-able,btohqsg
Cuz if u find ss now hard in sec 5 got more chaps,btohqsg
But I like ss  ss is cool,btohqsg
And my math roughly b4  counting marks then ik comfirm score and maybe abit method marks that ik,btohqsg
I count count abit roughy 64.,btohqsg
