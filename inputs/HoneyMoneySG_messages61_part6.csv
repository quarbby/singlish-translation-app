Please read T and C carefully  my view is that it is not as difficult as HSBC EGA üëçüèª,btohqsg
Hi all. Slightly confused with the current 5mpd fcy promotion for UOB KF CC. If I pair with amaze  then it's not consider FCY  right? So  I should just use the KFCC directly abroad  right?,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm thinking to cancel my dbs altitude card since my annual fee waiver is rejected (don't use that much anymore since started using citirewards + amaze combo)Should I cancel right away thru digibot?,btohqsg
must pay the 3.25% FX fee to be under this promo...,btohqsg
So deposit 10k into cimb  10k will earn 3.5 percent every month till 31jan24?,btohqsg
So  it's not worth the 3.25% for the 5MPD?,btohqsg
depends on your valuation of a mile.For me  i feel it is VERY WORTH paying the 3.25% to get 5mpd for General Spending.,btohqsg

need to redeem points before u cancel the card if not the points will just disappear,btohqsg
Amaze with lady (category restriction) or Citi (1k limit) seems much better6/4 mpd respectively at ~1% feeUnless the caveats are an issue,btohqsg
yeah 5mpd paying 3.25% fee is more for General Spending... i.e. outside of the UOB Lady 6mpd categories paired with Amazeunless of course.. another category (which was discussed in another chat coincidentally)... if company reimbursed...,btohqsg
Feel bad for you man legit hope you got your money back,btohqsg
Kind of an eye opener to lock / cancel unnecessary card,btohqsg

AYO ONE MORE MEMBER WE HIT 9K,btohqsg
u know will have 24% p.a. interest hor,btohqsg
That one I know other than revolut I don't know which one should I do,btohqsg
If sg gov collapses  your greatest worry is unlikely to be the status of your funds in uob (or whatever sg bank),btohqsg
I'd like to confirm the interest calculation scenario: If I have a remaining balance of 1 000 SGD in July and make a deposit of 10 000 SGD on Aug  would the interest be calculated as follows? 10 000 SGD multiplied by 1.5% plus 1 000 SGD multiplied by 2.0%?For the subsequent month  if I again deposit 10 000 SGD  would the interest be computed as: 20 000 SGD multiplied by 1.5% plus 1 000 SGD multiplied by 2.0%?,btohqsg
Should be according to the following calculations:Aug interest: 11k x 1.5% x (31/365) + 10k x 2% x (31/365)Sep interest: 21k x 1.5% x (30/365) + 20k x 2% x (30/365),btohqsg
Is this for new or existing user?,btohqsg

I have no idea sorryJust see also,btohqsg
Hi anyone bought funds from OCBC to get extra interest on OCBC 360? Is there any holding period on the fund?,btohqsg

Only things guaranteed in life are death and taxes,btohqsg
I would be worried if anyone guaranteed returns ala Bernie madoff,btohqsg
Lol. Do they say that it's guaranteed,btohqsg
quick question if you pair UOB lady and citi rewards card with the amaze card and pay using the amaze card  does it mean that both will be credited? or how does it work?,btohqsg
u have to choose the CURRENT LINKED CARD,btohqsg
ahh okok so i can just keep switching between those 2 card with the app whenever?,btohqsg
You can try and see üòÇ,btohqsg
They just try to gain popularity by burning investor money.,btohqsg
So on their part they'll guarantee the interest rates. Wonder how sustainable this is,btohqsg
0.7% different compared to mmf. [if they use it to Fullerton funds],btohqsg
Just like gxs type. Maybe one month or 2 month. Because they smaller.,btohqsg
Wonder if they'll start charging for managing money in time to come. After all  they're a fund manager,btohqsg
Are there any advantages/perks to choosing Amex Ascend KrisFlyer over other cards like Citi + Amaze? Feel like cancelling my Amex now that the exclusions are similar to others,btohqsg
Nothing. It's good for sign up bonuses only,btohqsg
So possible to cancel after we receive the bonus right,btohqsg
Plus is there a reason to believe that Citi won‚Äôt nerf the amaze route?,btohqsg
*Hi all*I would like to ask you a few questions regarding *money market fund*.1. Which broker is the easiest/better to use in your view ?2. Does the interest paid daily ?3. Can I withdraw it all anytime without penalty?,btohqsg
There would be clawback clause if close immediately after getting the bonus,btohqsg
