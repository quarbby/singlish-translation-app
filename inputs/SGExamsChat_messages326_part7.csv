"later crash then say ""oops! im a capricorn so""",btohqsg
I donâ€™t think it â€˜s scam. It â€˜s from FastJobs,btohqsg
The one that me and my friends do were all based on the package we deliver,btohqsg
Small parcel 1 dollar   medium were 1.50 and large were 2.50,btohqsg
Wait let me ask my friend,btohqsg
I know Pickupp is a low-ball service.,btohqsg
He found the work from fast jobs too btw,btohqsg
I do GrabExpress for part time. Not very ideal.,btohqsg
And he had to send one small parcel from sengkang atw to jurong,btohqsg
Just to earn 1.50   he quit on the spot lol,btohqsg
Sounds like Pickupp or something worse.,btohqsg
Yeah maybe is just the company he worked for ah,btohqsg
But I mean minimum 4k just for delivering is a lil sus already so...,btohqsg
Even GrabExpress pays you like $5+ for one package.,btohqsg
Just do Foodpanda if you want part time   actually good money if you are consistent ( for students),btohqsg
I saw a lot of people joining today.,btohqsg
The more you work  the higher your pay,btohqsg
The number of orders you get will dilute downwardsâ€¦,btohqsg
My friend manage to earn 1k a week at one point of time ( bicycle btw ),btohqsg
I saw a lot of Foodpanda riders today.,btohqsg
Maybe cuz the app advertise their recruitment programme..,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong there is incentives also,btohqsg
No matter how shag is the journey to the destination.,btohqsg
I mean alot of of Foodpanda riders are getting their account suspended too,btohqsg
Because even though they uses motorcycle to deliver the food  the register their way of delivery as cycling ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Cuz the radius to deliver is smaller.,btohqsg
Idk how it works ah ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
