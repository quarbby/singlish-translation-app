si yan you got any tips for me my h2 physics is tmr,btohqsg
you can take the man away from SAF but you shall never take SAF away from the man,btohqsg
ya thats what i thought also,btohqsg
maybe i uppes to sign on,btohqsg
but real i know 1 guy who did that,btohqsg
he kena posted to CDO  down pes to get out of it then he wanna sign with SPF to become some specialist IO,btohqsg
he went NYP then NS then SIM then up pes then sign,btohqsg
i mean if you know your definitions and understand your concepts and how they relate to the equations (or just what do the equations mean physically),btohqsg
A level physics isn’t that deep,btohqsg
and i think i won't get 70/80,btohqsg
i think i'm gonna get B,btohqsg
also I heard it is because the h2 math syllabus cannot catch up if they make H2 physics tougher,btohqsg
yea i mean H2 physics is massively simple bc the math they can use is limited,btohqsg
i love it when the math has no numbers 🌚,btohqsg
my prelims phys p3 i diffrentiated 2 times for 1 mark,btohqsg
and i love it even more when the letters are not even english letters,btohqsg
but fr like if you feel lost  just step back and see what they’re asking you to find  what you need in order to find it  and how to get there from what they’ve given you,btohqsg
or explore what the info given to you can be used for,btohqsg
im more scared of bell curve honestly,btohqsg
like this is all just general exam conditions things la bc content wise you’re fine i’m sure,btohqsg
you get 80/80 for p2 also means you should target full marks for others,btohqsg

@chemcerpops his veins out by going gym,btohqsg
im saying whats the point of getting the voucher for it to be expired,btohqsg
its basically just surrendering urself to the police,btohqsg
I assume this is like a,btohqsg
there’s alr people giving interviews for straits times on it,btohqsg
the more i think about it,btohqsg
the more i find that it could be real,btohqsg
I FINISHED MY LAST DAY OF D2D FLYER DISTRIBUTOR,btohqsg
I have done a total of 4 days,btohqsg
Used to be 50 for 10 blocks i think,btohqsg
Simi nee soon u at east side what,btohqsg
where the 6th one is me,btohqsg
u can have no pulse for a variety of other reasons ie ventricular fibrillation (which you can shock)  pulseless electrical activity (cardiac monitor got rhythm but no pulse),btohqsg
when u have ventricular fibrillation the heart rhythm is just squiggly lines  u can imagine it as a like a computer having blue screen,btohqsg
so defillibration to the heart is essentially resetting the computer by turning it off and on again and gets the heart to be organised  which is why you are taught in CPR class to immediately resume compressions after delivering a shock with an AED/defib,btohqsg
when u have asystole u don’t shock because the compyter has no more batter so even if u press the off and on switch the computer will still not turn in,btohqsg
currently i spend all my money on sephora and thrifting alr,btohqsg
Whats yall expected salary per hour ah guys,btohqsg
why is the foundation you buy so ex,btohqsg
idk it’s always ex for all brands,btohqsg
idts cuz the one my friends use arent,btohqsg
R u pulling another all nighter,btohqsg
i’ll sleep at midnight and wake up early to study some more,btohqsg
is it normal to feel like,btohqsg
like it feels way too chill rn,btohqsg
im doing close to nothing anymore,btohqsg
tbf u only have bio paper 3 and 2 mcq papers so its understandable,btohqsg
nah its felt this way since chem p3,btohqsg
if it was me last yr at this stage i needed to sit through 2 mcqs and 2 geog papers :/,btohqsg
Maybe cuz all the harder subjects are gone,btohqsg
i had to listen to the current geog cher rant to me abt ej geog students,btohqsg
all the HELM kids finished As already,btohqsg
he bought me coffee just so we can talk abt why this yr j2 geog students not gonna do well,btohqsg
ur so close with our chers,btohqsg
uhh I think he just say alot of them are shaky,btohqsg
its cuz i taught ur batch,btohqsg
and alot of the gp chers from ur batch were from my batch,btohqsg
anyways he was just saying like this yr j2 geog students 0% distinction rate for prelims,btohqsg
then got alot of people like also not rly studying or motivated,btohqsg
but imo this is just smth I noticed abt ur whole batch in general,btohqsg
i had one of my students give up on studying in March and sat down to talk to me during consult about how he shud drop out of ej and start working cuz he doesnt feel like studying anymore,btohqsg
shock is usually for 'non rhythmic pusle' like ventricular fibrillation,btohqsg
where the heart is beating but not regularly,btohqsg
for the patient that i got he was under PEA  or pulseless electrical activity,btohqsg
where on the ecg machine it shows a pulse but when checking for pulse manually there isn't any,btohqsg
but normally if u don’t have machine and u feel manually u won’t feel a pulse though,btohqsg
i did a mr case with vf and shock prompted by AED but initially couldn’t feel a pulse during my ABCs,btohqsg
Don’t mind me asking Qualifications required?,btohqsg
Yeah  6 hours a day and already made a 100,btohqsg
prolly not lol she just completed her o levels,btohqsg
he couldnt have been too upset tho  ej got 100% A/B for pw my batch,btohqsg
so he got either A or B,btohqsg
hey yall does anyone know what is next after a levels? do i apply an internship in the courses im interested in taking in uni or will just normal admin assistant jobs be good enough?,btohqsg
its very hard to get C or D,btohqsg
i only know one student who got D and thats cuz she fainted halfway through her OP and the sch considered it as not finishing her OP :/,btohqsg
my moms like pressuring me to do sth alr,btohqsg
I would recommend if u have money to go solo travelling,btohqsg
😭 idk how to apply admin jobs  i’ve been working fnb my whole life bruh,btohqsg
Wait don’t admin jobs pay like $10 an hour or smth? Like the date entry ones,btohqsg
do u know where to find internships? like is there like a fastjobs app for internships or sth,btohqsg
idk how do data entry even …,btohqsg
Don’t bother man  Low pay only if it’s internship,btohqsg
i want to do aerospace engineering,btohqsg
anyways if u rly rly want it for the practicality try and make it relevant to ur uni degree,btohqsg
wtf type of internship do i even take 😭,btohqsg
my friend got into aerospace engineering with 70RP,btohqsg
apparantly he worked in an engineering firm somewhr,btohqsg
i can ask him what he did,btohqsg
I thought u were talking about some IT degree,btohqsg
he keep flexing his 15 Point ABA,btohqsg
aba?? anime battle arena from roblox???,btohqsg
huh omg drop his @ plz,btohqsg
hes retaking a levels rn ah,btohqsg
And jus saying  dont DONT go aerospace engineering if u planning to go poly,btohqsg
i alr finish A levels alr,btohqsg
Its jus mechanical eng but u learning things in plane context,btohqsg
And u gonna be the only girl,btohqsg
i hope they didnt get 90RP,btohqsg
huh i’ve been dead set since like i was 15,btohqsg
U can get in boeing with mechanical eng degree,btohqsg
lol apparantly my fren just did some random tech internship at dso,btohqsg
so should i js get a random engineering internship …,btohqsg
Just my 2 cents coming from a aerospace diploma,btohqsg
u not uni student quite hard for ppl to hire u tbh. maybe govt sector may be more willing,btohqsg
I wanna do some tech internship but idk my RP will cut it for CS  already won some shitty local hackathons here and there,btohqsg
U are in poly but u are being prep for uni stuff,btohqsg
huh 😭 what else am i supposed to take in uni then 😭😭,btohqsg
Mechanical eng if u love to visualise,btohqsg
Electrical eng if u love wires,btohqsg
Can but people will ask u in interview lor,btohqsg
How come u aero but join random eng coy,btohqsg
But then again if u got connections,btohqsg
ya my sch ecg counsellor also ask me do mech,btohqsg
but iw high paying job sial,btohqsg
Eng hard to get intern for a lvls i think,btohqsg
i managed to get an internship at URA when i was a jc student,btohqsg
But then whats your type of engineering,btohqsg
My friend published 2 research papers when he was a JC student,btohqsg
do i ownself go find the internship,btohqsg
Computer eng also can be engineering,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask how realistic it is to be working part time  in jc,btohqsg
why my sch never help me find,btohqsg
u can try dsta lor. they always got post a-level internship. but quite hard to get in lor. depends on how many places they have that year also,btohqsg
my sis is sec 4 and now shes doing an internship at dso,btohqsg
don’t try plz i retained HAHAHHA,btohqsg
I literally worked 8 hrs during sat/sun whole of J1  possible,btohqsg
then weekends whole day until night,btohqsg
Did y'all have energy bars or smth 💀 I mean where does the energy come from,btohqsg
How?? Don’t u end at like 5 or 6,btohqsg
I generally just dont get tired,btohqsg
i couldnt commit to a proper internship,btohqsg
I only did internships during holidays,btohqsg
Holy  one match green tea ice blended pls thx,btohqsg
like j1 dec i was at URA,btohqsg
i’m gonna apply dsta internship now thanks sm,btohqsg
Still very impressive regardless  I know of no one who did that,btohqsg
Do you have to memorize the recipes when making the drinks,btohqsg
any internship tips? i never intern before,btohqsg
go in with an open mind,btohqsg
govtech also got internships but programming knowledge is a must for most roles,btohqsg
just whack more alcohol and make sure they don't come back,btohqsg
do a lot of people intern after a level?,btohqsg
cos i’m from a china sch ,btohqsg
Do you rmb the recipe for match green tea ice blended ? Can share,btohqsg
u are one of the few people ik who intern,btohqsg
nobody taught me what to do after As LOL,btohqsg
I did a teaching stint in EJC after my A Levels,btohqsg
and it was for gp which isnt even my fav subject,btohqsg
ohhh so actly i can js play until uni??,btohqsg
then wtf do ppl intern for,btohqsg
to seem more impressive when applying for uni,btohqsg
I think the main qn is the one which is like,btohqsg
Was the pay that good or what,btohqsg
Eh got one person wan join aero,btohqsg
that is relevant to ur degree,btohqsg
yeah. there are like a few govt agencies who offer scholarships  or skip selected screening stages  for interns who do very well in the internships (but must be with very good academic results),btohqsg
why my sch never mention portfolio,btohqsg
see if u can get anything plane related,btohqsg
U can see f16 if u stay in keat hong camp,btohqsg
Why not just get internship during first year of uni? You have a “legit” qualification so most likely won’t get $0,btohqsg
oh so i can js wait til uni?,btohqsg
so i go to a company,btohqsg
u must do internship in uni lol. just whether u want to do more anot,btohqsg
i take out my resume and portfolio,btohqsg
and show them and see if they accept,btohqsg
do i make this portfolio myself,btohqsg
uni usually 1 sem is dedicated for internship which will be graded actually. then some do more during summer breaks to gain more work experience. after grad when u look for work  employers  especially in certain sectors  do value work experience,btohqsg
oohhh so actly idk stress rn,btohqsg
my mom got me so stressed fr,btohqsg
I WANT WORK FOR BMW WTF,btohqsg
actly i wanted work in car workshop,btohqsg

Speaking of which my sch invited some air force officer to give my sch a talk and he showed some  latest air force advertisement about signing on💀 LOL,btohqsg
my father asked me sign on too,btohqsg
doesn't make a diff for some majors,btohqsg
I think it helps for the fin bros,btohqsg
engi hmm I'd say enjoy ur holiday,btohqsg
can i ask if i intern now,btohqsg
and my score can’t make it to ntu slightly,btohqsg
can i use it to my advantage,btohqsg
Get to fix leopard 2 sg,btohqsg
I managed to appeal into ntu accountancy and biz with my intern,btohqsg
i scared my chemistry pull me down,btohqsg
I only had like 70+ rp so couldn't make it the usual way,btohqsg
i wanted continue work bbt 😭,btohqsg
and i’m a retainee and drop out,btohqsg
hard time gg into ntu lol,btohqsg
idk but I'm around all the 90ers,btohqsg
so the range I see is around 85+?,btohqsg
actually got a scarier batch than acbs sia,btohqsg
I mean u register for an undergrad course,btohqsg
I was once an innocent person who wanted to go into accounting,btohqsg
i talked to a prof who taught one mod (or class i cant rmb) with all the bcg students  cutoff for A- is 96 💀,btohqsg
consider applying to start-ups if u wanna intern,btohqsg
they pay peanuts but it reflects well on you and you learn a lot,btohqsg
any of yall know what i shld select,btohqsg
Wow so there's no way to skip uni internship ?,btohqsg
In that case   won't poly ppl somewhat have an advantage,btohqsg
is there a way to skip it?,btohqsg
i think jc and poly separate admission right,btohqsg
like they got their own cutoffs,btohqsg
U need minimum 3.4 to get into ntu/nus,btohqsg
And its not easy maintaining the gpa,btohqsg
Im only talking abt eng course coz im from it ah,btohqsg
For me is Singapore youth flying club,btohqsg
Most likely u wont touch it during your lesson time,btohqsg
I rmb  for tp open house  I tried the flight simulator and slayed it  the person was like aye u can join aerospace course sia 💀,btohqsg
Ntu quite low barrier for mech eng related one,btohqsg
Nvm if u say this means u nvr join,btohqsg
Nah my cut off didn't make it and now I'm in mi LOL,btohqsg
Tbh I did consider joining Singapore youth flying club,btohqsg
also i hv one last qns.. if my alvl not good but i can go china uni (ranking 200+) should i js go or shld i retake and try NTU again…?,btohqsg
I cannot tell whether this is sarcasm but I chose to believe otherwise 💀 cause I'm gullible,btohqsg
ntu ofc but my mom is china citizen she 中国第一☝️,btohqsg
But the thing is I wear specs cos of my short-sightedness,btohqsg
she’ll support me gg to china for sure,btohqsg
I can't recognize someone from afar like Ur facial features is smudged in my pupils,btohqsg
Ik alot fail after they go aussie,btohqsg
i alr 20 and js finish a levels,btohqsg
idk if retaking is it man 😭,btohqsg
I not v tall also 💀 I only 160-163,btohqsg
I have 3 more papers wtf,btohqsg
Also I heard that there's this thing where they spin u ard for dk how long,btohqsg
You go inside that thing and the machine spins,btohqsg
i swear i also thought the same,btohqsg
That's if ah lol  it's very risky also,btohqsg
signing on as pilot requires what???,btohqsg
Also I heard that if Ur eye degrees exceed dk how much and idk maybe certain eye condition? Also cannot,btohqsg
intl has a lot more content than sg,btohqsg
but the qns are more straight forward,btohqsg
that’s why ppl say intl easier,btohqsg
so maybe i can’t go ntu :(,btohqsg
I see the intl a level physics papers bef...the grade thresholds are like ridiculously low. got one paper 48/100 is A lol,btohqsg
and the paper is not even that hard,btohqsg
yea i tutored someone for it before,btohqsg
wtf yall making me feel dumb 😭,btohqsg
This one way out of our sg league,btohqsg
cos i found it mad hard,btohqsg
A level cert can buy chicken rice anot?,btohqsg
it’s legit comparable to nyjc papers eh…,btohqsg
cos i was in nyjc before,btohqsg
it’s like equally hard fr me,btohqsg
maybe my brain rusted over the years,btohqsg
i think liddat don’t need do internship alr,btohqsg
also anybody father mother uncle auntie got car workshop can let me work i can work for free tysm‼️,btohqsg
Nvm as long as ord can rdy,btohqsg
eh guys if i sign on do i go uni first or NS,btohqsg
best book to help u in life,btohqsg
minimum clear your ocs den wait for uni start,btohqsg
but u do realise that those asking u to sign on is just joking right,btohqsg
it ‘s v useful tho for data analytics,btohqsg
no matter how bad it seems,btohqsg
no matter what when u choose to sign on means u gonna go tekong,btohqsg
so like assuming if i do sign on,btohqsg
i only go to uni 2 years later ?,btohqsg
and do the infantry stuff first,btohqsg
depending on when your bmt start,btohqsg
u roughly gauge 3 month bmt + 9 month ocs,btohqsg
and waiting time for bmt to start,btohqsg
after that need wait for uni also,btohqsg
probably the most tiring part would be outfield coz 5d4n no shower,btohqsg
first time touch grass for most ppl,btohqsg
i just asking to see how the timeline works,btohqsg
come find me i sign on and left service can give u insight,btohqsg
is pulau ubin an option tho,btohqsg
Is there a guaranteed golden parachute LOL,btohqsg
dun sign on is a scam,btohqsg
my dad glorifies signing on sm it made me consider it 😂😂,btohqsg
u wont kena sack from gov unless u fk up big time,btohqsg
like appearing in the news for bad reason,btohqsg
have u sign on as SAF Scholar,btohqsg
heard u scholar  got people plan your future for u,btohqsg
just need u to be there and do certain stuff,btohqsg
coz gov invest shit ton in u,btohqsg
u legit train through yr postings,btohqsg
ik scholars by 37 they LTC / SLTC,btohqsg
before i ord he went ME5-1,btohqsg
So those ppl don't get to have a say in that LOL,btohqsg
u can say they choose this life?,btohqsg
is it normal to be that high?,btohqsg
cuz saf officer max 50 for career roadmap,btohqsg
coz my CO was 35 and ME5-2,btohqsg
technically by 47 u need be cdf alr to serve any time as cdf,btohqsg
prob now gonna be ME6 after she get her posting,btohqsg
getting promoted within 1 and half year,btohqsg
No wonder u guys joke abt signing on,btohqsg
when your rank is high enough everything is possible,btohqsg
