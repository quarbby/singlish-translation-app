This is worse than i thought. My era was 50% of all premiums paid for first 2 years  subsequent years supposed to be like 2-5% only.,btohqsg
I'd rather one take time to understand the financial markets and its structures first. Once you understand the foundations  you'll understandtheprofit motivations of each player in the marketand how each entity (e.g. broker  banks  insurance  hedge funds) earn their dough. Knowing the structure means you know where to reduce your investment costs.I'll give you a starting point: ILPs rely heavily on consumer ignorance.,btohqsg
Yup. Last time is upfront they take from first few years  from that premium itselfonly. Now is take for 10 years  and worse is based onpolicy values.,btohqsg
i really hate it when Insurance Agents:1. try to upsell they are financial experts to be able to help you manage funds well when they are not even experienced in trading themselves.2. give you fake testimonial that so and so make loads of money in ILPs. Even if that is true  i guarantee you that so and so person would have made much more doing it DIY compared to ILP vehicle.,btohqsg
@TC1688it is every single day end amount cannot drop below but not MAB or ADB.,btohqsg
I would recommend every second amount don't drop ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥² I don't even remember t&c state anything on this  become guessing game only,btohqsg
Hi everyone  was wondering if you use XNAP (paying via Apple Pay) to pay at hawker/coffee shops  does it count as an in-app payment or contactless payment? I was thinking if I should use my UOB Visa Signature card. Thank you!,btohqsg
From the messages above  Iâ€™ll avoid all ILPs from now onwards. I didnâ€™t expect to be educated by lurking here. ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Welcome to the group bro. This is what the group is for  learning process.,btohqsg
Do you have a whole list of tele permalinks for repeated qns? ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Yeah agree with Point 1 and 2. If product is so good   rather keep for myself. Lol,btohqsg
Use search chat history is the easiest. ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Hahaha I use that.. then I just forward the whole message so ppl won't need to click ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
there is some 'withdrawn and redeposited' mentioned in the TNC.so if your 30th Sep balance is say $1000 in UOB ONE account and $3000 in TOTAL UOB RELATIONSHIP  and you are earmarking $100 000i would recommend you ensure:UOB One account > $101 000 at all times until earmark endsTOTAL UOB > $103 000 at all times until earmark endsThis is mainly to satisfy clauses 1.6 (iii) and 1.6 (a),btohqsg
and AIA eat more cake from you#AIAproachiever,btohqsg
Oh have state Liao!! Account day end balance. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ under 1.6. Note (a). That time keep search for it but can't find.,btohqsg
To blow a bit of my own trumpet  I have been taking part in UOB Earmark promo since their very first  and yes you can say I am using Conservative and Kiasi interpretation of their TNC.But I have never had any problems receiving the promised Cash Rewards and being earmarked before deadline and released from earmark upon expiry date.,btohqsg
Ya APA1.0 have lesser supp fees  APA2.0 onwards is 3.9% ðŸ¤®,btohqsg
haha the comms not so high n wtv job u do u also get paid 5-6k a month it gets priced into the product,btohqsg
Wonder why Singapore regulatory MAS allowed insurance agents to become financial advisors  in the ancient past  things were simpler when they just sell insurance. All these fees are actually unfair to consumers  particularly those who are less financially savvy.,btohqsg
Anyone can suddenly be a financial advisorâ€¦ surely we all have at least 1 friend that is working as one. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Maybe people like Felicia could chime in on their experiences....,btohqsg
You imagine ur the agent. Will u tell ur client how much they will be charged for the fund annually / monthly? ðŸ˜‚ not all will. Or most will not.,btohqsg
I don't have and I was looking for one recently because I wanted to buy integrated shield plans. I have finance background but still have to spend some effort to understand the whole insurance thingy. Of course no financial advisor dare to sell any investment products to me although initially they did try.,btohqsg
You have to sift through all the technical jargon and interpretations in tnc,btohqsg
Alot of the time people dont even know what insurance they buy to be honest.,btohqsg
On point 1 I would like to just add onHow can any insurance agent be good in active Investing if he/she is spending so much time on non- trading related activities?Also just to point out that your retail investor which includes these agents have no access to flow information.Even Sophisticated investors who have access to more information that cannot be googled find Mr Market to be challenging  itâ€™s a joke that agents claim they can be delivering outsized returns with their limited product shelf and limited information access.,btohqsg
Which is why important to review annually or whenever big events in life e.g to make sure ur adequately covered at different life stages imo ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
that's the one who quarreled with Seth in youtube comments right?,btohqsg
"You can just tell them upfront""you can forget about selling to me anything other than ISP and level-term insurance""",btohqsg
When insurance agent start to tell u can loan from policy when u cant make payment in future  i know is bullshit liao. What they dont tell u is u pay interest on your own money to insurance when u loan from policy,btohqsg
ðŸ˜¬ the money comes from somewhere.,btohqsg
Orâ€¦ maybe she is the agent? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
yes this reminds me 3-4 years ago  when interest rates were still rock bottom..MANY INSURANCE AGENTS were pushing clients to borrow at 1% p.a. loan rates to buy '4 to 4.5%' paying Whole Life policies.Now loan rates are probably 4-5% p.a.... i wonder how many got conned and are dying now.,btohqsg
I think the most important is to get a reliable FA. I buy whole life limited pay myself coz i dont think term suit every one need. Buy term invest the rest might suit those financial savy but it dont suit everyone,btohqsg
No idea. I don't read youtube comments  it's a cesspool. Anyway  I was referring to this Feliciahttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/152823,btohqsg
Reliable or not   still must dyodd,btohqsg
If the agents are too open and honest  they wonâ€™t have clientsâ€¦ â€˜wokeâ€™ clients are bad for business.,btohqsg
Haha ya i was one of those FA before,btohqsg
I would like to point out that last sentence is actually not right.In fact itâ€™s the financially less savvy people who should practice buy term invest the rest in DCA methodology.Itâ€™s a disciplined approach which the irony is that the masses donâ€™t have that discipline to stick to the course.I would even argue that 95% of the population should do that,btohqsg
In the first place less savvy ppl wont even know dca  how can u do something u dont know right,btohqsg
yeah i sort of agree with this proposition1. savvy then u can do active investment using discount brokers etc..2. if you have NO TIME  or NO KNOWLEDGE how to invest  you can at least do low cost DCA using even simple platforms like Interactive Brokers or POEMS (every month just consistently buy a diversified fund you like). Heck it could even be our local banks.,btohqsg
If u are a ex FA  you realise that alot of people u talk u have very little financial knowledge  even my good friend she dont want to listen cause she dont understand when i explain to her. She just ask what is good then get,btohqsg
haha.. can la.. i have a friend who doesn't care about what card to use.. don't know how to invest..he setup a $x amount regular purchase mechanism with DBS to STI fund every month. The cost is reasonable/low.,btohqsg
In the first place  people in this forum are concerned abt finance which is why they are here  u cant expect everyone to be likeminded,btohqsg
Which is why top 20 is rich and 80 percent remain the average. Even when i share credit card with my friends they dont care for sign up promo etc.,btohqsg
"you have less savvy people joining insurance companies because they are pitched a money dream  and selling costly products to fellow un-savvy people. it's a sad reality but it is what it is.it is only when one learns about the monetary construct then do they realise""I am x years into ABC ILP  should I surrender?""",btohqsg
I never believe in ilp even when i join FA industry before cause of the structure of the ilp. Investment should be seperate with insurance is what i believe in. But it cant be deny for a fact that ilp commission is very lucrative which is why when i review my friend  i told them about their ilp sold by their agent and the downside but did not recommend any replacement product cos i dont want them to think i just want to sell only.,btohqsg
DCA works over 3 basic premises1) committed disciplined investing month on month over a period of 20 years minimum. The longer this period is  the better the results2) monies committed for dca should be left alone to compound over as above (rem the premise is that this monies invested is to stay invested to compound  the time to draw down is ONLY during your retirement years)3) rebalancing of equities vs fixed income % exposure through life stage (this means a basic 2-3 broad based ETFs). Some formula that people use is 100 or 110 minus current age. Example age 30= 70 or 80% equities n 20-30% FIThe problem imo with masses is not about knowledge but discipline in sticking to the plan over the course of,btohqsg
First they need to know there is option of dca  we are privilege to be born in sg whereby there is stable job and ready info  but like i say if u total dont know there is something call dca or interest in finance  u wont do it right,btohqsg
