If the route is katong - pasir ris - farrer park - Robertson quay. Possible to deliver to farrer park Robertson  then tampines last?,btohqsg
I don't see any specific instructions say cannot change route,btohqsg
I was thinking is a bit weird cos the nearest from katong should be farrer then Robertson quay then tamp,btohqsg
But when you reach the place had to unload then get signature or pic.,btohqsg
So dunno if allow to change route anot,btohqsg
What happen when you change route,btohqsg
How to change route in the app,btohqsg
Taken after I posted here for 15mins,btohqsg
Always ask the customer when u pick up if you have to follow the route or can plan your own. Let them know that if u change route is faster or smoother etc. If customer say can go according to your plan then go ahd. Sometimes they plan all over maybe cos there is a certain time they need to deliver the item to certain location.,btohqsg
Not all multi stop can. U can see via the app. Whether there is a change next destination choice or not. If there isn't  but the customer let's u plan ur own route  u can still deliver according to where u want first,btohqsg
But make sure u don't exceed the time given for the delivery  and also if u stack don't overdo it. Customer give u free rein  but don't take advantage  then everything will be ok,btohqsg
Hmm actually will be faster to complete the whole order if deliver to the nearest addr and the furthest addr last,btohqsg
U make ur own call lor  depends on  individualðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Just make sure delivery done in time n proper. Even if stack don't stack too far away 1. Cos if customer track u  if not happy can complain then give u bad rating,btohqsg
How does this Change look like? Iâ€™ve done a fair bit of multi stops but never seem to have found any,btohqsg
It's on top of the screen  just under the address of the next drop off pt,btohqsg
Nxt time if I ever do any i screenshot show uðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
