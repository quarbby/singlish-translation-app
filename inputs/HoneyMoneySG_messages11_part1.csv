my chinese super bad so i rely on google translate,btohqsg
Desktop I’m not sure. I buy using app. The prices reflected are all in Chinese yuan. But when I confirm my purchase  the app bring me to a page where they first list the prices in yuan. Then when you scroll all the way down  there will be a figure in sgd as well as a service fee (also in sgd).,btohqsg
So i suppose it was in Chinese yuan first and the bank converts the amount to sgd and charge to my credit card.,btohqsg
