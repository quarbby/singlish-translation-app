hey anyone here know of anyone/ have attended nyp's common it programme's interview and test? mines tmr and im v worried 😭,btohqsg
Posted on Behalf of EduHope SGEduHope SG (eduhopesg.wordpress.com) was first started when we saw how the cheapest tuition rates go for tens of dollars per hour  which means that many are left out by virtue of their inability to pay. This put it out of reach of many groups in society  such as students from underprivileged backgrounds. Is that really fair? Is that how it should be?That thought sparked our journey to create a more affordable option for students. And it led us to believe that free peer-to-peer consults can provide equal or greater help than private tuition.Since then  what we have found so fulfilling is that tutees describe to us how much they have benefitted. It is possible because tutors selflessly give up their time to make a difference in a tutee's life  something very heartwarming to see.Currently  we are steadily growing and are looking for more people to join us as admin staff and volunteer liaisons. By joining us  you make the operations of this programme possible  and allow many more tutees to receive valuable academic help.Sign up link:https://forms.gle/C9pYmZW59MvWTced9,btohqsg
