Am i correct that the red portion is producer surplus and the dark blue portion is dwl when there is a binding price floor (above the equilibrium price) being set,btohqsg
"""want to stay awake longer? Don't sleep""",btohqsg
Or is the producer surplus the big triangle to the qs supplied (600),btohqsg
The dwl is which triangle ah  the one pointing downwards to the price or the one pointing rightwards to the price,btohqsg
even tho i got A for econs,btohqsg
i can do anything except the fking diagrams,btohqsg
which is quite annoying bc econs pays very well,btohqsg
Yes I think. Idk if there’s anything you may have learnt in Uni that’s different from a levels,btohqsg
Ite seems like whole year round in scdf,btohqsg
It doesnt make sense to be the big triangle to q=600 right coz the stuff wun even be sold  like a price floor essentially results in a shortage,btohqsg
The one bounded by supply demand curve and 200,btohqsg
