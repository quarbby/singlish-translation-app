Guys are the young ones or older officers more better,btohqsg
I feel like the young ones eh,btohqsg
Cause gen z...and you know what gen z is well known for right?,btohqsg
Gen z is known for being lawless,btohqsg
Everything do just to satisfy one‚Äôs own desire,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs play a game  Guess the youngest gen a,btohqsg
Y'all don say got a lot toxic ppl I also agree,btohqsg
I wonder how the  generation after us will take on ns,btohqsg
Gen alpha is the fked up gen I feel,btohqsg
13 is the age of the oldest gen Alpha,btohqsg
Sg xmm and xdd rate is rising incredibly fast,btohqsg
Gen alpha only makes up 2.5 million of the us population,btohqsg
I think if got gen alpha kena commando they gg,btohqsg
Generation beta will come to the world in 2025,btohqsg
Generation alpha is also coined the ‚Äúglass generation‚Äù. They are the first generation of humans in the world to solely go through their whole life with technology,btohqsg
Guys I got a controversial take,btohqsg
In what instances can we allow natural selection to take place,btohqsg
When someone is doing something just for attention and injures/kills their own being?,btohqsg
Right  but what would you say that would make someone a ‚Äúfit‚Äù person,btohqsg
The one that most dominant ig,btohqsg
Is it being mentally fit  physically fit or emotionally fit??? Or is it all of the above,btohqsg
Then if somebody lacks just one  what would you call that person?,btohqsg
Remember it‚Äôs controversial for a reason,btohqsg
Of he lacks mentality then the person is physical fit lor,btohqsg
This is moral dilemma question  would you allow natural selection to take place who lacks just one quality  whether emotionally/mentally or physically fit,btohqsg
A train conductor stalling his train and causes a death  should he be liable for the person‚Äôs death,btohqsg
But he wan to self sabo for what,btohqsg
Honestly I know all them answers will vastly differ,btohqsg
Shared liability existsPerson at fault for intentionally putting themselves in dangerConductor for not trying his best to prevent the death,btohqsg
Not just suicide but general self sabotageIe. boasting about a crime to a police officer,btohqsg
Basically every problem in this world is shared liability,btohqsg
Because we are good. We even manage find and report the names of the OCTs digging that fire trench,btohqsg
Our laws on negligence are very clear on how the conductor cannot be exempt from liabilityBut also recognise that the person would have to trespass & willingly stand in front of the trainDe latest change is that this person can only be ‚Äòexempt‚Äô if deemed mentally unfit,btohqsg
If y‚Äôall actually read every single word  you will realise...someone who is physically unfit but mentally/emotionally fit could be a con-artist  someone who is mentally unfit but emotionally/physically fit could be a bomber and someone who is emotionally unfit but physically and mentally fit could be a killer,btohqsg
oh ya@chemceri took the 5 day MC more for chao keng than feeling unwell but i had a runny nose and cough the whole day tfy üíÄ,btohqsg
So you won‚Äôt allow natural selection to take place on a con-artist  bomber and a killer?,btohqsg
Cause the desc  describe all three of these ppl,btohqsg
That don‚Äôt apply to the roads tho,btohqsg
If a bus captain stops his bus suddenly and a passengers get injured...the one at fault would be the bus captain,btohqsg
Tekong ferry captain stops his boat suddenly  recruit gets injured. Who is to blame?,btohqsg
That is a whole different scenario entirelyIn this situation the driver also has a duty of care to protect the passengers from harm (his job is to ‚Äòsafely deliver passengers to their destination on time‚Äô)Therefore harm brought to the passengers are directly due to the driver‚Äôs failure of careUnless a ‚Äòfrustrating event‚Äô occurs whereby another party causes the harm instead,btohqsg
Yea I see your point but what differentiates a con-artist  bomber or killer from a mentally/physically or emotionally challenged individual?,btohqsg
open jio:anyone want night cycle tmr night?,btohqsg
why is there so many pocoyos here,btohqsg
‚ÄúSafely deliver passengers‚Äù I don‚Äôt think so,btohqsg
we were only full marks brother,btohqsg
So in this scenario  you can‚Äôt actually tell if a bus driver is sabotaging or not can you?,btohqsg
I believe the only difference is action,btohqsg
A bus driver‚Äôs duty of care is well established;- maintain bus cleanliness- maintain bus functionality- respect road safety practices- operate the vehicle in a safe & responsible manner,btohqsg
But in sg law  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a crime?,btohqsg
For all passenger injuries the default is that the driver is liableOnly in exceptions (which is most of the time) where a frustrating event occurs  then blame is shifted,btohqsg
See; duty of care & negligence,btohqsg
That‚Äôs their job in their certification to drive a bus,btohqsg
In this instance  nobody is at fault,btohqsg
A bus jam break cause of a car  passengers injured than dies days later.,btohqsg
And death is due to a misadventure,btohqsg
Hence why I conclude the difference is action,btohqsg
The Driver of the car is at fault?,btohqsg
The fact they even found a second occurnece,btohqsg
Basically bro decided to turn the moment he has his turn signal on,btohqsg
Left  they found out the Driver of the car could have safely turned but choose not to,btohqsg
On that base  the car Driver was still not found at fault,btohqsg
This was the final conclusion of the  state coroner,btohqsg
Ain‚Äôt turning without checking for traffic a offence?,btohqsg
The answer is actually very simpleRoad safety code is very clear on what turning is considered safe and dangerousDangerous is defined as actions that would intentionally cause harm to othersIn hindsight the driver could have been ‚Äòsafer‚Äô  but his turn was adequately safe enoughThe bus also adequately reacted by brakingNeither party could have known that the person was medically weakened after dialysisFurthermore  patients are often recommended to take a taxi home or have accompaniment to prevent such incidents  which the person unfortunately met,btohqsg
To turn the moment you use your turn signal I don‚Äôt think will fly in any other developed countries in the world,btohqsg
Only in Singapore can one do that and is not a crime,btohqsg
No that is negligent/reckless drivingHighway code 74 clearly states that one must signal adequately before making a turn,btohqsg
Adequate would mean;Driver signalled left turn Bus driver had enough time to react & reduce speed (brake) [albeit a bit harsh]No car accident occurred,btohqsg
What is written is that the driver could have signalled earlier or turned earlier to completely avoid the bus but had not done soHowever  driver had not done so maliciously  ie;- gps said go first lane - unfamiliar with road - etc.,btohqsg
What I can gather is that  the driver of he car misjudge/miscalculated the speed of the bus and took a chance,btohqsg
Bus was Less than 20m to the junction and he decides to turn into said junction,btohqsg
If that is not reckless driving  idk what is,btohqsg
I saw the dash cam as well and it was not any clearer,btohqsg
In this instance  I think it‚Äôs safe to assume if anything similar happens again. Someone will be held liable  this was a unique case and will set a precedent for future cases,btohqsg
Again that still follows highway code to the letter cos its 1 car length per 16kmph so ~30kmph before coming to a stop at the junction,btohqsg
This case wouldn‚Äôt set precedent for driving tho because the head trauma from the braking is only partially responsible for the death  the victim unfortunately was already weakened,btohqsg
I see folks  thanks for the insights,btohqsg
Dat one clear cut alr xD,btohqsg
literally had to say your name,btohqsg
now thats only what OG pocoyo knows SIUUUU,btohqsg
