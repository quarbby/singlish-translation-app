You got to calculate actual. Fill up to the brim. Reset and measure and then full up to take file user.,btohqsg
I don’t. I only recommend great car. Really. The fuel economy for a luxury car is considered fantastic,btohqsg
U mean u measure a full tank mileage?,btohqsg
Then ard 700+  but actual mileage is lower,btohqsg
When it reaches 0 range on the gauge I go on to drive another 40km. Then I refuel. And it only takes 57 liters!!!,btohqsg
So the fuel warning gives you ample range to refuel. I suspect 80 to go still,btohqsg
So my measurement is very accurate.,btohqsg
Wah… fierce… every time  left 150km  I will go and pump,btohqsg
My fuel consumption never falls below 12.5 km a liter,btohqsg
After I refuel  it immediately shows 760-780km range approximately. Sometimes 810.,btohqsg

I trust ur words  mazda is the best,btohqsg
Big car a challenge to park,btohqsg
Since he’s also a bmw fan  you can believe what he says about Mazda.,btohqsg
Curious what made you switch to this brand? From Audi?,btohqsg
Not really… cx9 may be difficult… but cx8 is not,btohqsg
Cx8 is the same width as mazda6,btohqsg
Probably@SGCM_Admincan remind members this is a generic car interest chatgroup and not a particular car make chatgroup? Correct me if I’m wrong.,btohqsg
Yea  seems like VW and Audi people like me are left out of the conversation. I actually particular with any make of cars but my inking is towards the Germans,btohqsg
Enough years of driving. No car is best car. No brand is best brand. If really like this  whole world only one type can sell Liao. Also seldom see Hyundai and Kia folks. New Tucson also very modern. Good space  drive train stays on electric a lot  can do almost 1k km per tank.,btohqsg
Audi quite pricy amongst the big 4. Ad showroom too fierce. Need to sell more exp to cover cost.,btohqsg
Yeah you can chat whatever brands you like. Just talk. Don’t keep quiet.,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminthis kind of chat is definitely out! SPAM!,btohqsg
Lol. Got code to prevent word filtering 🤭,btohqsg
