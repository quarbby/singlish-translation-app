Hi all!  Got a question on HSBC 5.2% everyday global account promotion.  How to achieve 5.2%.  Based on website - 0.05 + 3.45 + 1 = 4.45%.  Where is additional 0.75% from??,btohqsg
No. You need to spend 6500 within 2 months to get desire reward points. This is worse than spending for dbs attitude card to get about 42k miles,btohqsg
I always have e impression Maldives=5 digit expenses (for two). Can only afford Bintan. If spend 6.5k and can save 10k quite good leh.,btohqsg
DBS points can transfer to Marriott Bonvoy?,btohqsg
Haha with opportunity cost loh missing out the high miles/high cashback card,btohqsg
Yup. Miles is still best value.But for AMEX  I find Bonvoy has the best value of 1 MR to 1 Bonvoy. Will get a lot less in miles.,btohqsg
I dont qualify for those high end amex card haha. Not atas enough to enjoy amex benefit. Lol,btohqsg
I got it with $2.8k salary after getting the basic platinum credit card for 1 year plus. It was a barrage of invitations back during I think 2018 or 2019 year.A lot of people got it without meeting the salary part.,btohqsg

What should the strategy for ocbc360 be during reset month? $0 spending + $0 salary + $0 MAB? How much to transfer back during the next month?,btohqsg
Salary $0 a bit hard unless u own the company. Very paiseh to ask hr to change bank account for 1 month then change back the next. Based on Melvyn's spreadsheet  amt is 95 500 which is starting amount.,btohqsg
End of month for base interest.2nd business day for bonus interest.No bonus interest if you didn't meet the criteria.,btohqsg
"Ya I think you're right. There are several optional fees to pay (like commission and cable fees) but the agent bank's fees seem to be mandatory. I did a transfer from my OCBC USD acc to DBS USD acc via ""overseas transfer"" option. The commission and cable fees were waived  but need to pay the agent fees of about 15USD regardless of transfer amount.",btohqsg
did you ensure you hit the 500 min spending?,btohqsg
salary can be 0 if you self transfer,btohqsg
Yes but u need to have corporate account for ocbc then self transfer. Not sure if many ppl have that.,btohqsg
no dont need  based on the data point i saw. different name from a different name is recognised,btohqsg
ur HR allows u to have 2 bank accounts to split like that?,btohqsg
but why the need to split?,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt even matter in this case tho.,btohqsg
This i gotta ask. Not sure mine allows multiple saving accounts.,btohqsg

Reset month is to reset your MAB so you can satisfy the Save criteria again.,btohqsg
