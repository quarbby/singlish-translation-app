Importantly is it have to do all 3 criterias to make it with it. Without spend criteria you'll need to reset twice a year just to be above 4% p.a.,btohqsg
I mean is it worth to do a reset if I hit 104k or can I wait till 106k etc. I understand I be losing interest on the 4 or 6k but ain't sure where can I be getting a better rewards on them,btohqsg
Because I am seeing I need to spend 500 to get 50 more per month thus I am spending it on my uob one account instead,btohqsg
None. Look at the excel I tagged you on.,btohqsg
Can spend with ocbc card too,btohqsg
I'm assuming because you have 150k and it's earmarked in UOB One for either 4.5% p.a. or 6% p.a.?,btohqsg
Did you see the excel table in#ocbc360eir? Why are you recommending someone to go below 4.5% p.a.?,btohqsg
And I can't hit 1k spending per month unfortunately,btohqsg
No  I use my own calculations ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Yup I did previously but too noob to understand it fully haha,btohqsg
Usually my monthly increase around 500.xx to 501.xx,btohqsg
I ran the number a few times and I dont see how reset at 106k will be optimal. And you reset every year?,btohqsg
Maybe you can look into other accounts with at least 4% p.a. without the spend category. Something like HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
My reset is simply withdraw to 100k,btohqsg
"That's why that number does not appear on the excel table. It's not even close to ""decent"".",btohqsg
Imagine having over 2k sitting in a bank earning 0.05% p.a.Put with Maribank also better rates.,btohqsg
When you reset  you should withdraw it below 100k. Anything above 100k is ocbc 360 only earns 0.05% pa. Like Melvyn said  that money can be put elsewhere for better interest.,btohqsg
4 or 5 items still 0.05%  what for?,btohqsg
Any comments on Endowus higher income portfolio? Div around 5.5 -6.5,btohqsg
How much money to put in uob to earn highest interest rate? 100k?,btohqsg
150k with spending of 500 on UOB card,btohqsg
Maybe you can use OCBC Rewards card and buy $500 worth of vouchers onHeymax.aito clock the spend. Then on alternate months  put the monies in HSBC EGA  and spend the vouchers.Would be great if your family members have spends that can use those vouchers as well  so that these vouchers don't accumulate.Bonus is you get to clock miles and max miles.,btohqsg
hello all  can double confirm if i cancel my citibank credit card  i have to wait another 12 months to be recognized as new customer?,btohqsg
Targeted* not guaranteed. Potential losses. Standard roboinvestment rules apply.,btohqsg
Yes because you areUNCLEARin your messages. Which will confuse people who are new to OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg
Why do u guys think so complicated lol  just open different bank to merry go round,btohqsg

Direct SQ website only. 3mpd.b). Etihad. only 1.2mpd unless buying via eligible OTA n meet $800 SQ spend  then 3mpd. Pls read TnC for details.,btohqsg
Thank you everyone for the reply,btohqsg
Yup. As recommended here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/213868Can hit 3 criteria  no need think how much more or less to put.,btohqsg
Anyone just got charged fall-below fee for ocbc 360 and balance became negative?,btohqsg
Seems like all the banks are starting to do negative balances. UOB got me last round.,btohqsg
Hi anyone in Australia right now? I am thinking what is the best card to use. Be it for insurance or car and home rentals?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Yea agree. It was still OK for ocbc last month  where they deduct to become 0 and not negative..,btohqsg
Oh ok I am actually waiting for my one year ntb to get an ocbc card.,btohqsg
Hi  I've been using amaze+crmc and HSBC Revo mostly but now looking for replacement of Revo.I'll now be using amaze+crmc for in-store payments and wwmc for online payments. Looking for another card to use tgt with the CRMC especially during months where I'm travelling.Thinking to either get the UOB PPV or UOB lady's (for dining). UOB PPV can use on more variety but there's the $5 block thing and I will only use in SG. UOB lady's for dining only but can also pair with amaze to share the spend with CRMC when overseas.What are your thoughts? PPV or ladys or maybe smth else?,btohqsg
Is ibkr a non custodial broker?,btohqsg
If not what the custodial broker to use in sg?,btohqsg
Hey guys! I am new to the miles game and am interested to apply UOB prvi miles card(I am new to UOB) and also the UOB solitaire card. However  there are some bigger ticket purchases coming up soon. So can I check if it's possible to apply for Prvi miles card at the same time (or maybe a few days lag for solitaire card). Will I still be eligible for the welcome offer (50k miles for Prvi miles card),btohqsg
Where everyone parking some Cash for July ? I opened SC Esaver 4th June and I saw today the interest coming in my account pro Rated to 26 days ( 4June-30 June). I only have EGA HSBC which I hope new campaign show upAlternatively waiting for UOB to come up with new Campaign for this second Half of the year â™¡,btohqsg
Iâ€™m spending $800 in krishop to qualify for the uncapped 3 miles/$ uncapped spend.If I spend today  when will the period of uncapped 3 miles/$ start and when will my full miles be credited?,btohqsg
I heard it takes time to validate you spend 800 on SIA   so usually it come later   but members of the group can confirm better â™¡,btohqsg
Iâ€™m thinking to spend furniture on Harvey Norman using amaze with uob krisflyer. This will earn me 4 miles/$?,btohqsg
get 3mpd (1.2 mpd base+1.8mpd bonus) for transactions under selected mccs in your current card membership year. Get bonus 1.8 mpd 2 months after the membership year.,btohqsg
Suppose this works for non-kris+ merchants as long as I pair amaze with uob krisflyer to count as online spending?,btohqsg
Yes assumed mcc is within online shopping for UOB KF.,btohqsg
Harvey Norman can use Kris+(without amaze). Can get 3mpd uncapped.,btohqsg
You should apply for prvi first and send sms to participate. After all that is done  you can apply UOB lady sol from uob app.,btohqsg
Took how many days for approval?,btohqsg
Got it  thank you and for the reminder of sms (I forgot to do it haha). For the sms  I should send it after the card is approved? Or immediate after the application?,btohqsg
