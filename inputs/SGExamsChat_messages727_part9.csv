but not like just hardcore study,btohqsg
Walao what the heck is dis,btohqsg
idk i just found a weird way that worked for me,btohqsg
it's like i insert intermediate breaks throughout my entire studying,btohqsg
i feel like im only productive when my brain knows im truly fked and if i dont start now i might as well dabao the mod,btohqsg
meaning i really don't take any breaks longer than 10 mins ever,btohqsg
i can eat in <5 mins,btohqsg
i hv been hving wandering thoughts while studying,btohqsg
I am productive if I am drugged up,btohqsg
ya even then im not 100% onto studying,btohqsg
i see one youtube video on my recommended,btohqsg
Usually like a lot of caffeine and stimulants,btohqsg
next thing i know 3 hours have past and im still on the same week 2 lecture out of week 7,btohqsg
anyway at this point im telling myself it is just 1.5mths to graduation,btohqsg
lol one of these days we should meet then you study while i work,btohqsg
maybe you'll see what i mean,btohqsg
there is no point giving up at this very moment,btohqsg
good chance you'll think i'm just slacking with youtube,btohqsg
you'll actually see what i mean too,btohqsg
ok but now for phd bc it's legit weekly updates to my prof,btohqsg
i have a more streamlined schedule,btohqsg
so siyan is actually working with youtube,btohqsg
i still work with youtube on tho,btohqsg
why is this chat at its peak at 12mn,btohqsg
thats why im coming to you for advice on how to actually study lmao,btohqsg
I just procrastinate with wendover videos,btohqsg
but i guess i wanna try forcing myself to change now first ig,btohqsg
it is not too late  there is still 1.5mths to final week,btohqsg
if i need stuff on my comp i split screen youtube and the other thing lmao,btohqsg
thats what i mean by procrastinating,btohqsg
i mean it helps to develop an interest in figuring it out,btohqsg
but it's hard to do that when you're in panic mode,btohqsg
eh i certainly cant get anything into my head if i do that,btohqsg
[Confession#C1780]How do you young adults deal w their strict n protective sgrean parents?Despite being of legal age like 22 yrs old  my parents still kept pestering me about my whereabouts when its 11pm+. Letting them know in advance / what i am doing still doesnt satisfy them as they claim they are worried and doesnt like it when their children is out late.But they dun understand the whole concept of spending time w ur friends late at night talking cock and js bonding.Should i even listen to them or js live my life and let them be angry cause honestly  i dun think what i am doing is wrong,btohqsg
in panic mode you just wanna not fail,btohqsg
siyan's experience w me in just 2 days,btohqsg
Who here have strict parents can relate,btohqsg
but i've actually never panicked over an exam ever before,btohqsg
Sometimes I hit a word block tho,btohqsg
hard to develop an interest for physics  im just a survivor in this course tbh,btohqsg
Like they don’t allow this don’t allow that,btohqsg
but i get what you mean,btohqsg
and to do that i probably need to start earlier,btohqsg
so i'm able to still sorta be chill and enjoy the figuring it out in a time crunch,btohqsg
now seems like a good time i guess  week 10,btohqsg
