But few lower end windows computers still uses a spinning hard drive ðŸ™„,btohqsg
Do they simuntaneously defragment during the update,btohqsg
how much does it usually cost if u break ur hard disk and u need to reinstall windows,btohqsg
Depends how old your laptop is,btohqsg
Samsung is a safe choice for SSDexcept for QVO,btohqsg
Or you can purchase your own SSD  disassemble the laptop and replace the storage  and install Windows on a USB flash drive for cheaper,btohqsg

Apple is known for artificially slowing down older devices,btohqsg
To get you to update/get new devices,btohqsg
For iPhone  they claim it is to protect already-deteriorated battery health,btohqsg
Yeah  while not supporting replacement of said batteries,btohqsg
But I don't like how they slow down without disclosure of reasoning,btohqsg
Or even give it as an option,btohqsg
Some people can use the phones for alternative reasons or have theirbphones pluged in most of the time,btohqsg
Though at the same time  they provide security patches,btohqsg

Nah the main point is to buy more of their products,btohqsg
Especially if they make it so the older phones can't update,btohqsg
Huh? Iâ€™ve never heard slowing devices down to get you to update  only installing mechanisms that would slow your device in an update down to force you to upgrade.,btohqsg
Hmm maybe I'm wrong about the updating part,btohqsg
Couldve sworn I read it somewhere but I can't find the source now,btohqsg
