NUS sch of design & env is,btohqsg
Can't wait to be labeledpolitically significant,btohqsg
Tele active tdy  havent seen this for quite some time,btohqsg
We're doing that viral psle question and he went silent for a long time and now he's explaining to me his thought process behind his answer,btohqsg
My answer is in the chat box HAHAHA,btohqsg
Ignore my bad math I forgot to add extra zeroes because I was crying,btohqsg
Now I scared of o lvl wtf,btohqsg
I donâ€™t weight 20 cent coins,btohqsg
My friend says its 2 marks and he took 2 steps to solve it lol,btohqsg
Its fine O level qns all standard one,btohqsg
If after the paper u feel depressed just read reddit. It will make u feel better,btohqsg
He's trying to explain how to do it but he has like 5 variables in his working and 20+ steps and I'm sitting here with like 4 steps,btohqsg
Let the number of 50 cent coins Helen have be X?,btohqsg
Ive seen some of the most graphic things ive ever seen on reddit,btohqsg
Formequation then solve for X ah,btohqsg
I tried not to do algebra because this is a question for 12 year olds,btohqsg
And also because I didn't want to confuse myself,btohqsg
i found the ans to the psle qn i think..,btohqsg
My batch was the famous ribbon question,btohqsg
U shouldnt worry abt cambridge. They set easy papers. U shd worry abt SEAB,btohqsg
Seems like SEAB got emotional trauma and trying to take it out this year,btohqsg
Last year they oso got trauma,btohqsg
What they thot abt my batch,btohqsg
I think this year idk what will come out alr,btohqsg
Then n lvl ss is that,btohqsg
Oh dont bother just go in and bullshit thru,btohqsg
My Cher say probably chapter 4,btohqsg
I feel like the ss paper u shd ignore and focus on the others tbh,btohqsg
Yea math u need like damn high for A1 apparently,btohqsg
yall realise that national papers are set 2 years in advance rite. so if u want spot topics  just check what major thing happened 2 yrs ago lor,btohqsg
My god i miss Os so badly,btohqsg
it took me half my brainpower to get the ans,btohqsg
If u took combined hist last year u wld be too scarred to do so,btohqsg
yeh  i had fingers crossed for 88% but nope  A2 for Os,btohqsg
I think they say usually need 90%+,btohqsg
i did hist elec for last yr Os,btohqsg
It's not tat bad. Yall just needed to read the qns properly and draw this model,btohqsg
^  it's the second one that's fucking people over. My friend is arguing with me over the first one,btohqsg
The friend who tried to solve it using simultanious equations,btohqsg
2nd one is same concept as first one,btohqsg
HHAHAAHA I PLAN TO DO THAT,btohqsg
u need to think the primary school methods. and in this case  literally Pri 2 models,btohqsg
Part 2 cannot be since we alr know how many coins,btohqsg
Yea I only solved it when I drew a model : ) : ),btohqsg
Even then  still hard for a 12 year old.,btohqsg
Then just use X(number of 50 cent coins ) + 2.7 = 1134g-64(20),btohqsg
its literally just helens masss - 40(2.7),btohqsg
can we get a 3 ppl matchy,btohqsg
i wanna match w my best friend too tho idt she watches,btohqsg
I fucking hated my o level maths paper,btohqsg
