just downloaded iChange after watching Chris’ vid - in view of the better rates vs banks  can we exchange SGD > USD then transfer back to our bank acc or directly to the platforms for trading/investment?,btohqsg
The only outflow is through Mastercard as iChange is not a bank account,btohqsg
"https://youtube.com/shorts/i-pSY1_6jMw💸 iChange Code chong268https://hmsg.link/ichangeI previously mentioned in a video that the counter money changer has to approve your iChange Digital exchange request  which is not correct. iChange has clarified the following:""The digital exchange is automatic and does not go through the money changer for approval unlike cash exchange.  Also the time taken for digital exchange has been improved to less than 5 minutes and it will be the same on weekends.""

Hi guru  can check for UOB one card if use more than 1k but never hit 2k  the expenses will not be able to have any cash rebate correct?,btohqsg
depends on ur tier also.if u are hitting 500 for your quarterly tier  beyond 500 u wont get rebate.,btohqsg
They only see if hit 500  1000  2000. And must be consecutive for 3 months.,btohqsg
Quick question  for overseas spending (so not including tickets and such)  would we be able to earn 4mpd with citi rewards + amaze? (foreign currency spend on things such like shopping),btohqsg
Got it  thanks a lot everyone  just got my card and hit 1k. Gotta spend 1k for two more months to receive the rebate full rebate for 1k tier correct? If not spend 500 on any month of the quarter will receive the 500 tier only.,btohqsg
Yes  looking for good dbs credit cards. Which one is the best? Tnx!,btohqsg
Does anyone know if buying travel insurance via Klook follows Klook mcc or is an excluded category for miles  say for UOB lady travel category?,btohqsg
No  you didn't answer the question  why dbs specifically? Difficult to say best card because it also depends on your spending habits,btohqsg
Because I have an account there and mostly use dbs. Spending around $800 per month. Interested in both cashback and miles,btohqsg
Let me know if anyone suggests any DBS credit cards,btohqsg
Personally think you should look beyond dbs. Many other cashback and miles cards.,btohqsg
No requirement to have account and credit card with same bank,btohqsg
You're limiting yourself to DBS for no good reason,btohqsg
For cashback  you could consider Citi Cashback/ UOB Evol/ DBS yuu (18%),btohqsg
For miles  Citi Rewards/ HSBC Revolution/ UOB Lady/ DBS WWMC,btohqsg
Pls do your own due diligence to see what is good for you. Esp for miles card  should also consider your value of a mile  conversion blocks  expiry etc,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh. $400 contactless and $400 online for $40 rebate per month.,btohqsg
highest credit card cashback for public transport ?,btohqsg
Dbs interest is one of the worse among the local banks. And their credit cards hardly make it to most of the top cashback or miles card list. Not to mention their frequent IT issues.,btohqsg
Which bank/ card you recommend ?,btohqsg
Hello FolksI read Kelvin YouTube  about WeBull.If the Moneybull idling funds turn to purchase MoneyMarket  is there any sales charges and redemption charges?And how long it takes to return funds to my bank? Pls guide,btohqsg
Is it worth it to get a standard charted smart credit card ? How will I get my cashback ? In cash or in points?,btohqsg
hi guys  i am on team cashback whole lifenow i doing renovation halfway  still got many things not yet buy and going to rack up many big purchasesi wanna go to “team Miles”what are the best recommendations for Miles card right now?,btohqsg
Really depend on what u are buying. U need to tell more such as what merchant and the amt u spending to get better advice. A generic one might not apply to ur case,btohqsg
buying sofa   dining table   water heatermore onto local and foreign currency spend,btohqsg
hi  any fees when Top-up via PayNow QR?,btohqsg
Can consider those that is foreign currency that give 4mpd (uob vs 2k) and paywave (uob ppv 1.11k  uob vs 2k) that give 4mpd. If online can consider dbs wwmc 4mpd 2k  citi reward 4mpd 1k.,btohqsg
can check is there a UOB CC equivalent to OCBC 365 CC?,btohqsg
What do u intend to spend on the card?,btohqsg
There is no equivalant for uob. More of citibank cashback card to ocbc 360,btohqsg
But uob have other option where by u can consider such as uob evol or uob one for cashback team,btohqsg
will take a look at evol. thanks.,btohqsg
If you're using uob one account  you can match it with uob one card for the above spending. If you can hit the minimum tier spending each month of course,btohqsg
Is there a way to know the list of items that got Cashback or qualified for the cashback for evol?,btohqsg
read the excluded list in term and condition  anything not inside excluded list is eligible  nobody can do the work for you and only yourself,btohqsg
Hm because I'm looking at some transaction that doesn't look like it went thru gpay but I used gpay,btohqsg
So I'm trying to see how they identify if it was an online transactions or direct card payment,btohqsg
Gpay most prob is clock as mobile contactless,btohqsg
Hi  does paying SingTel mobile monthly bill falls in the category of UOB evol CC?,btohqsg
sguob01 code really works. I think got some $50 off for a ticket. Not sure if there are any other way to get more discount for Emirates ticket,btohqsg
Amaze Card tagged to Citi Rewards Card.> If we top up Amaze Wallet using the same Citi Rewards Card  will we earn 10x Citi Rewards Points?,btohqsg
But I see some transaction will state gpay but some doesn't,btohqsg
Tap machine using card is contactless.Tap machine using phone is mobile contactless.Paid using gpay is online.Mobile contactless won't show as gpay  it will show up as how you do it using card to tap on machine.,btohqsg
Uh I know... But how does the system identify if where I tap using card or I tap using gpay looks the same in the statement? I hope my question not confusing 😅,btohqsg
It knows  just avoid using direct card if you're evol.,btohqsg
So there's no summary for the cashback in this sense?,btohqsg
