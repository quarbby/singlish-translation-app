I received my UOB Lady card in May but never received the bonus UNI$... just now the CSO told me that no bonus category was selected 😱 I remember I've selected the categories when I applied to the card.,btohqsg
Just to share... we might want to check to make sure. How do you check which category has been selected?,btohqsg
There is UOB chat assist. It's weird no category selected. I remember it's part of the form. Maybe can try appealing to uob.,btohqsg
Erm Melvyn  the second yuu card if under same pax should be auto link if it is a amex/visa 2 card scenario,btohqsg
The CSO helped me to appeal  they will contact me in 5~7 days.,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming.. so I remember correctly 😅 it's part of the form,btohqsg
Cuz he asked for linking of another card  I would assume he meant another name 😅,btohqsg
anyone know how the CB is credited? offset bill / points / cash into account,btohqsg
Should be credit to the cc card like any other cashback cc,btohqsg
Hi all! Would like to check for online purchase in foreign currency  is it better to pay using uob visa signature or amaze + crmc/ uob ladies  assuming MCC met and no issue with min/max spent. Am aware amaze need to be within $1k SGD  and uob vs fcy need to be above $1k,btohqsg
Using with amaze lowers the cost slightly  so I’ll go with amaze+crmc/lady’s first.,btohqsg
Wait  amaze $1k limit before fees is for local spend  not foreign currencyAmaze is 2% fee for your cards mpd (probably 4)Visa signature is 3.25% fee for 4mpd,btohqsg
Oh I thot amaze will convert foreign currency to sgd  so need to be within $1k sgd. So no need?,btohqsg
No need  cap applies to domestic spend only. But you are limited by CRMC’s 1k cap for 4mpd,btohqsg
Okok! So I can spend within $2k for amaze + uob ladies solitare for my selected category,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know how long for this card to get approved by the bank?,btohqsg
Scb esaver is higher and bank is safer. So…..,btohqsg
Btw don't use other people photo as profile....not sure why u want to pretend others......,btohqsg
Anyway don't think anyone stupid enough think I am a cat right. 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Ya The blue cat on YouTube,btohqsg
I always thought you were a cat,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA  if 2nd month no increment and balance lesser than 1st month  the MAB interest will base only 0.05% or 3.6%?,btohqsg
3.6% assuming u sms register for bonus interest in 1st month,btohqsg
I think the 3.6% promo lasts two months  increment from reference month MAB.But the bonus 1% from everyday rewards not eligible cause based on previous month.,btohqsg
I register on 29th May  when open the new AC  bank in fund on June.So I need to register again for July? Because I move some fund out for Uob but intend put some recess fund  in EGA.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know what is UOB one acct   interest for month June (with 150K deposit)? Thanks,btohqsg
Regarding UOB one  the bonus earnmarked interest  has it been consistently every quarter like this time July  Aug Sep referencing to June and the next one will be Oct Nov Dec referencing to Sep?,btohqsg
I join may-june  then July to join again (without increment  will clear my AC to zero on aug)  maybe Sept or Oct join again.,btohqsg
So if I have two UOB accounts it will work very well,btohqsg
And i have 150k spare cash for each,btohqsg
If i participate the max bonus  the interest works out to be 5.75% pa for that 5 month right?,btohqsg
I remembered the earmark was not so long before,btohqsg
This new one 5 months  previously was 4 months,btohqsg
But the bonus was the same at $1100?,btohqsg
1000 for 4 months is much more worth is than 1100 for 5,btohqsg
So basically i will just join one of the account for this roundThe other one will empty it for the month of Sep,btohqsg
Any idea When will they announce the promo usually?,btohqsg
So next one they will announce only on 1st Oct?,btohqsg
Most likely  based on past data points.,btohqsg
Wa… meaning they kind of dont even give time for people to prepare unless you have been following their promo all the time,btohqsg
Anyone work out before if it is worth to empty out a month to give up that one month 4% pa interest and then take part in the promo vs consistently just park 150k in the One account,btohqsg
Can always rotate to hsbc ega during empty out month,btohqsg
HSBC better of SC eSaver better,btohqsg
What i know if SC eSaver might be 1% lower than HSBC but they pay right after the month end,btohqsg
see if you want to endure more pain for the 1% more loh..i find it worth it.Every $360k x 1% = $300 more of interest per month,btohqsg
They only give one month but you are right la,btohqsg
As of now  i dont think any short term investments can beat all these high interest accounts,btohqsg
exactly.. so must take the max pain and make the max hay while it lasts..who knows.. another 1 year more.. u want to do also no more liao.,btohqsg
Have to add the word * low risk,btohqsg
