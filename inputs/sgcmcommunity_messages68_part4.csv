There was once a panda rider cut from lane 1 all the way to lane 3….scary,btohqsg
And then yesterday a group of cyclists did the same also,btohqsg
Eh! I thot they can only ride in a single file???,btohqsg
You think they care about u?,btohqsg
Yes and they never pay road tax,btohqsg
Many drivers and other road users don't follow road rules,btohqsg
So it's all about adjusting yourself to the situation and being safe,btohqsg
Can. If you get from Hew Motor. See his tiktok video.,btohqsg
Anyway it’s their biz lah… they like to take such risk… riding on the roads,btohqsg
Meet one ego driver   will send him to meet his ancestors,btohqsg
They can ride 2 by 2 and take up the whole left lane by law if it is a 2 lane road.,btohqsg
Which i think is fair  for the safety of all road users.,btohqsg
depends on which car you are getting,btohqsg
Never pay tax and want to use the roads ah?? Better apologise Lah,btohqsg
At least I cause accident I dun say sorry Is because I dun want to have insurance problems,btohqsg
Sorry ah but just cause we as drivers pay road tax and cyclists don't  doesn't mean we should be super entitled,btohqsg
Yes u r right.. it’s they should feel grateful,btohqsg
Everyone entitled to use the roads  public property,btohqsg
Just share and be safe and nice to all road users :),btohqsg
Dun really like the “professional “ cyclists,btohqsg
Yeah. Looking at options. By end of the year should be getting one,btohqsg
End of the year ah?  ….next time next time then say lh,btohqsg
"pls as much as i disagree w what some cyclist do  road tax doesnt give u more ""right"" to use the road",btohqsg
Road Tax is highly dependent on ur emissions...,btohqsg
Only emission i see from a cyclist is methane,btohqsg
If they polite   we should share the road,btohqsg
so u rather they cycle on the pavement and knock down young and even more reckless small kids and oblivious adults?,btohqsg
Let's be real  take out all the cyclists and two wheelers also,btohqsg
Still have 4 wheelers with drivers who are not polite,btohqsg
If they do it  at least it’s between them and the pedestrians,btohqsg
Some people dont even look where they are going when they are walking  even more dangerous,btohqsg
Human tendency for people to have ego and different personality,btohqsg
Like you also feel more entitled to be using the road compared to cyclists,btohqsg
They feel they have the right to use also,btohqsg
On the road  you will be the most safe. You have the upper hand  lets all be abit more courteous and forgiving. You dont want to get into the mess where a cyclist get knocks down.,btohqsg
so what is the best solution?,btohqsg
Govt to build PCNs and those cyclist tracks,btohqsg
And calmer drivers with no sense of entitlement and riders too,btohqsg
the pcn 25kmh  plus singaporeans cant even keep left on escalators.,btohqsg
They cant even observe basic etiquette,btohqsg
how do you expect the PCN to work efficiently,btohqsg
If have PCN and cyclist dun use  fine them,btohqsg
have u cycled on a pcn before?,btohqsg
pcn also will have dickheads one,btohqsg
have u seen stupid kids running in the middle?,btohqsg
okay so if i would like to cycle at 25kmh or higher leh,btohqsg
Knock into the kids ? And u get beaten up by their parents lor… better than being on the road and being sent to meet their maker plus cause trouble to the car,btohqsg
Do what u want…. 100km/h also can,btohqsg
its more of problem mitigation rather than damage limitation.,btohqsg
If u win gold medal for the country then u can do many things,btohqsg
