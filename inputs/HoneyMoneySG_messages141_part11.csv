With regards to the Moneysmart rewards  do I submit the rewards claim form after i fulfill the min spending or I can just submit after activating my card?,btohqsg
Should be same but careful not bursting 1k cap on citi rewards,btohqsg
And also the amaze cap right,btohqsg
Same number  but treated separately. People need to remember that. If you consistently spending 1k every month on CRMC+Amaze still ok.,btohqsg
CRMC = citi reward master card?,btohqsg
yes but amaze is by calendar month  citi rewards by statement month,btohqsg
can DCS Flex be used on cardup?,btohqsg
Not rushing. Just wondering if the 8% is not extended in Jan and I stop using the card  can I still cash out the cashback issue in feb 25.,btohqsg
I Haven receive yet even up till now. Is there any issue with it?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for Maybank cc apply and spend within 2mts to be eligible for the rewards. The starting first month would it be the full month like in Dec rather than Nov if I got it approved within this month? What would be the 1st starting month that they counted?,btohqsg

hi everyone  would like to enquire on 2 things here1 ) For those NSMen that has served their ICTs  how long did it take yall to received the  NS HOME award (the 5k CPF & $500 lifesg credits) from the day of completion of your milestone ICTs ? Enquiring as I intend to do a re-allocation of my CPF OA investment portfolio and would intend to include this NS Home portion into it2 ) For those that are investing their CPF OA into T-Bills   with the rate cuts expected to reduce the yields of  T-bills  what are yall intending to re-allocate these capital to once your current T-bills have matured ? Currently having a 65 % T-bill and 35 % equities allocation for my OA. Saw that Endowus offers some fixed income funds for OA investing and was wondering if they'll be a good option to re-allocate my current T-bill component into it once it matures .Thanks !,btohqsg
Oic. That means $45 + $20 = $65/per month and get xiaomi TV?,btohqsg
If both are maxed out  which is the next as I am looking for alternatives,btohqsg
Hsbc ega or standchart esaver need to rotate ard,btohqsg
Really depends on how much money you have and how much jumping around you want to do.,btohqsg
U will receive the $250 possibly 2 months after quarter ends.U can‚Äôt cash out. U have to spend the cashback.,btohqsg
For myself once t bills drop below 3% I would stop the CPF party and just transfer back everything into CPF OA and earn 2.5% pa until I have a need for next housing.,btohqsg
I see that the bonus interest for hsbc ega is only credited 2 months later? Range of 3% to 3.5% for bonus.Am not sure whether I have missed out  but is there a minimum mthly increment to hit in terms of MAB ?Is it as simple as meeting the incremental MAB for months  Nov and Dec and the bonus interest will be credited on 28 Feb 25 ?,btohqsg
Something simple and uncomplicated to track ü§îüôè,btohqsg
The 3rd NS Home Awards is given at completion of 10 ORNS years  so getting it before 10th ICT is possible. I received mine in June 2017 while last ICT/MR in Mar/Apr 2018.$5k is divided into $3k in Ordinary acc  $2k in Medisave. Commanders extra $500 in Ordinary acc.,btohqsg
No minimum u just need to empty out and do the 5 time requirement to get 3 plus 1 for ega for incremental balance. Go see chris video,btohqsg
Hsbc is a very useful acct if u go research. Alot of us is using it for 1 percent giro bill cashback,btohqsg
ah I see  have just completed my 5th so would likely be getting the 2nd batch,btohqsg
If you can hit 350k cash  ocbc premier's dividen+ saving acct.,btohqsg
Is it a monthly rotation between these two?,btohqsg
U can see chris video for explanation,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/lGvgw03KNxwShould be similar idea to this one. Using SC instead of ocbc 360.,btohqsg

Hi guys something unrelated to investment but may I ask where do you guys go to get winter clothings etc please? If taobao then how do you look for a reliable seller please? I am searching through safari but the filter doesn't seem to work i.e. I am always shown the same stuffs no matter what filter I applied.,btohqsg
Where are you going?I've been using Uniqlo üòÖ,btohqsg
Agreed! Their heat-tech is really good,btohqsg
For Personal Banking2 criterions are to deposit at least 2K and make 5 eligible transactions via eligible hsbc credit card or hsbc debit card. The incremental ADB will earn 3.05% in all eg  0 in Oct  10K in Nov  the diff of 10K will earn the 3.05%Fulfilling the 2 criterias will allow one to earn additional 1% cashback on all eligible spends on my hsbc debit card and another additional 1% bonus interest on the incremental ADB for eg 10K based on the abv example. Capped at 300 respectively.I can choose to opt out for the 1% cashback on all eligible spends on my hsbc debit card but will still be eligible for the 1% bonus interest on the increment ADB right ? Meaning The minimum interest is 4.05% based on the incremental ADB ?Is this right..? üòÇ,btohqsg
hi all! wanted some advice abt managing my finances - first jobber out of uni  currently holding dbs multiplier (salary crediting acc bc of company limitations unfortunately) and sc jumpstart (opened this before uni). im wondering if i shld:- keep my sc jumpstart acc and focus on accumulating emergency funds till i hit the 50k cap  then move onto smth else- apply for credit cards - avg spend will be around 1k-ish range  mostly on food  transport and membership/subscriptions (bft training etc) bc occasionally shop here and there. keen on the miles game for travel perks but was wondering if i wanna have 2 credit cards (1 miles and 1 cashback) to see what i prefer eventually. would love insights + card recommendations for this.thanks lots!,btohqsg
By the way  5 eligible transactions can be 5x fast transfer out too  don't need to be card transactions.üòÅI've been setting up standing instructions 2k in then 5x 400$ out every beginning of the month.,btohqsg
Thank u. Useful and smart tips.Their website can be confusing.,btohqsg
Can't comment much on saving acct.For credit card  better focus on 1 side  either cashback or miles. Straddle 2 sides and you may end up not getting enough miles to redeem within reasonable amt of time. üòÖCan consider something like Citi rewards + amaze to start first. It's capped at 1k and allow 4mpd on many things  excluding public transport and travel booking.,btohqsg
If cashback  UOB one saving acct + uob one cc can be a consideration.,btohqsg
I might have misunderstood.Your point of 2k in and then 2K out (5 transactions) is to zeroised the balance for month end so that the increment ADB remains at 2K right ?,btohqsg
I'm keeping mine at 2k minimum balance in case I need to do UOB promo or ocbc reset month.,btohqsg
