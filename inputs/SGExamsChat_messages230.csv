There are tutors charging 20k a month,btohqsg
"send them to ""good"" schools like raffles",btohqsg

ig thats why it generally becomes high no,btohqsg
i think for restaurants it cause certain courses need them to work at the restaurants,btohqsg

Morning people. If anyone has questions for NTU Chemistry & Biological Chemistry  do ping me. Personally I did internship  graduated last year and am starting a new position in the industry in 2 weeks lol. I should be able to answer some chemistry research and industry-related queries as well 😳,btohqsg
Will i remain financially poor in the research industry? :S,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  PhD pay can go up to about 8k if you become an old bird. Of course it depends on company 🤔,btohqsg
If financially poor means not being able to afford first-hand car  condo  etc then yea I don't think it will be able to sustain,btohqsg
Haha i dont intend to go research ba  cos i also have a condition that makes research hard too,btohqsg
PhD/Research is really not for everyone. It's really quite gruelling and not as glorious as most people think 🥲,btohqsg
Even if I have a chance  I probably won't consider either not because its gruelling/bad  but other reasons.,btohqsg
I think its fun though if you enjoy practicals! But the things that come after that is super sian/annoying,btohqsg
But research paper work is 😡,btohqsg
I feel you  I'm experiencing that right now LOL,btohqsg
hello idk if someone is able to answer this but I’m just curious if I take up CE in NTU/NUS  would I be able to branch into to the software side instead of the hardware ?,btohqsg
Actually if you check the course page you can roughly tell alr...?,btohqsg
Whatever the course may offer won't be as in-depth as a CS course  but there would be some amount that's helpful enough as a foundation. Even if the course doesnt have that many options  you personally confirm can pursue.,btohqsg
Anyone tried applying for a course with tenth percentiles about 5 points diff? And it worked out?,btohqsg
There's a lot that goes behind doing a research paper apart from doing the lab and gathering data,btohqsg
Depends on which courseUr luck is prob higher for engineering courses etc,btohqsg
You still need to do literature review  which usually ends up as a research group meeting topic  and to do that you need to research anyone who has done similar topics before as well as scrutinise their papers. After that you still need to maybe run simulations  plan your lab work (including how many and what kind of data  what material or reagents to use  what method  any adaptations that you have to do that won't affect the basic of your topic)  after getting data you still need to analyse them,btohqsg
Sadly that's only just one part of the entire research process lol,btohqsg
You have to really question why they need to add certain reagents  or see if there's any weird discrepancy,btohqsg
Like if they seem to be doing contradicting things  you need to know why,btohqsg
Only then you can plan your experiment properly,btohqsg
what if i like doing these things,btohqsg
You still need to plan your experiment  run simulation,btohqsg
Get data (if you can get any logical data you arw damn lucky),btohqsg
which is the most painful part for u?,btohqsg
Doing the lab and getting no data or weird data,btohqsg
"Basically the results are a big""? """,btohqsg
ok that one i can relate,btohqsg
And don't even know why it's like that,btohqsg
what about more social science research,btohqsg
That one I'm not sure but I think the data gathering would be things like asking them to come down and do test  random survey or questionnaire,btohqsg
SPSS will be your best friend,btohqsg
For NTU direct PhD rn it should still be available for 2nd upper honours and above  but to graduate you need to have a paper publication apart from passing QE and OD,btohqsg
for ppl who hv worked safeentry b4,btohqsg
if u see sus ppl not wearing mask properly or wtv do yall bother to tell them,btohqsg
Sounds like this is just up to your personal ethiks,btohqsg
which are the newest halls in ntu ah?,btohqsg
I guess saraca/tamarind side  not sure lul,btohqsg
There's quite a few undergoing reno I think,btohqsg
in the earlier stage you'll be learning the foundations of both hardware and software but you can eventually specialise in software yes,btohqsg
Lmao reminds me of my recent prac where we tried to separate out aspirin and caffeine from a solid  and some ppl got 0-0.003g of aspirin only.,btohqsg
