1 liter of beer I think,btohqsg
That's the limit for GST relief.,btohqsg
Actually can 2 liters limit for duty free if u just bring in beer.,btohqsg
Assuming you do not bring in any other liqours,btohqsg
Why did i even resist my temptation then,btohqsg
And it is so expensive in sg,btohqsg
But too bad i only saw that 6 cans one at a shopping mall and it was raining so too tired to carry back to hotel,btohqsg
U got space in your bag for that? I would save it for more value dense things imo,btohqsg

So idk how ppl shop till exceed weight limit,btohqsg
