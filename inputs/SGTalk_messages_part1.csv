Why always got this kind of pple want to say bad things about Singapura,btohqsg
Govt so good.... allows us to defer so Many kinds of loans,btohqsg
U still have to pay the interest accured during the defer period. In total  you pay more when u defer the loans.,btohqsg
What’s wrong with that? The problem is the payment of the Loan not the interest bah,btohqsg
Nothing is wrong with that. It is individual's decision.,btohqsg
Good I am just saying it must be a good thing to have this option.... it is never happened before on a blanket level,btohqsg
