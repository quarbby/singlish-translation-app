Hi gurus  I have been introduced to a thomson medical bond by my relative who is a ocbc banker. Yield is around 4.8% for 4 years  half yearly coupon payout. May I ask what should i look out for? Because i hear alot of stories about not buying investment from banks  so i am concerned...,btohqsg
Smart. You know already still asking ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
I hear the no to bank policies  but i dont know the reason why.. what shd i look out for  or just say no as long as its from banks?,btohqsg
Buying bonds from retail banks is a no no.,btohqsg
anyone has any advice on tiger vs moomoo vs ibkr? im looking to invest in etfs or cash funds  probably dip abit into US stocks like msft and google.still unsure which platform to go for,btohqsg
May I know yuu card is need clock $600 per statement month or calendar month? To gain the bonus cashback,btohqsg
i have just recently switched from ocbc360 to uob one account  should i wait till one year mark (of owning the ocbc365 card) then cancel? are there consequences for cancelling before the one year mark,btohqsg
$600 in calendar month based on transaction date,btohqsg
I don't think there is. Ppl sometimes just cancel immediately.,btohqsg
i think if you want to buy   should read the policy documents   tnc etc,btohqsg
cause like some ILP (investment linked plans) OR savings plan etc theres a lot of fees,btohqsg
So buying investments from banks  the main concern is the high fees involved right? So what % is considered high or normal? (Sorry i am very noob in investments  hope can have help from gurus here),btohqsg
Just think of it this way. Imagine you have a guaranteed returns of 4% p.a.  but the fees are 3.5% p.a.  you will end up only earning 0.5% p.a.Then imagine the returns are non-guaranteed. ðŸ¤¡The base advice is to read through the t&c  find out the fees  and see if it works for you.,btohqsg
ILPs are probably the best way to demonstrate this lol,btohqsg
"I do hear banks charge a higher fee than other platforms..So if my banker  who is my relative can reduce the fee to very low %  then it means its worth considering right?So its not a sure ""no no from banks"" like some people has answered?Or is there any other cons of taking from banks that i should also look out for?",btohqsg
Maribank or funds do they charge such high fees?,btohqsg
The very simple qn is  what does the tnc say?,btohqsg
There may be other terms that are disadvantage to you like early withdrawal. If the fund they recommend can be purchased through 3rd party platforms like poems or moomoo  you should consider using these platforms and you have flexibility how many  when and how to do it. Unless the fund is managed by the bank directly. Ex: United SG Fund by UOB where you can use their UOB Investapp to purchase direct their fund.,btohqsg
Currently what's the best place to invest?,btohqsg
Oh for now it's 0.125% pa as fees.,btohqsg
Maybe can start with this videohttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/176828,btohqsg
Which one is the Best place is depends on your risk appetite  amount of investment n expected return.If you expect to get a return of 5%  most of the members here prefer UOB One.,btohqsg
Which is a better trading broker to use? Ikbr or wellbull?,btohqsg

Hello all. New here. I've been trying to set up RSP in WeBull as per the YT video since January this year. Deductions keep failing from bank accounts. Anyone encountered same issue?,btohqsg
