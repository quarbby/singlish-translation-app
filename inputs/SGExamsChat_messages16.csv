u wanna get 3sd away pay then endure 3sd from mean away shit,btohqsg
But i not keen into finance,btohqsg
Guess ima stay in my underpaid science industry,btohqsg
no know whether theres anyhting that allows u to earn 10k plus othre than faang and finance,btohqsg
Tbh earning a lot of money is not hard one,btohqsg
Is whether we want to put that 50000% effort into it,btohqsg
Some ppl prefer to take life chill,btohqsg
theres places where they cap u in terms of effort,btohqsg
u cant even work more than 10 hrs a day if u want,btohqsg
And ya the fear of failing discourages risk taking,btohqsg
But some ppl are just comfortable earning a modest salary lor  and thats life,btohqsg
I dont think is healthy for a population of ppl to aim to be millionaires either,btohqsg
I went big  and went home,btohqsg
see whether u wanna go bankrupt or not,btohqsg
but if dk how play best to not touch,btohqsg
know how to play also dont touch,btohqsg
I think is best to find something that u invest inside has sure returns one,btohqsg
For me i just do carousell sales lor  fixed returns,btohqsg
stock is sure return in long term ma,btohqsg
I think i said for the 6th time here,btohqsg
Every $1k spent can get back $1.15k provided u can clear almost everything,btohqsg
Usually i can clear everything  but the new ppl who try selling these cards cant,btohqsg
Is the new carousellers that try to have a slice of this pie that face an issue clearing their stock,btohqsg
i mean i no want worry about that ma,btohqsg
Not rly worryingIs like a guaranteed earning actually,btohqsg
CLT doesn't state anything about rate of convergence but ok,btohqsg
:( sorry me bad at math,btohqsg
want to be a normal person then no need do extreme stuff,btohqsg
Ya lorBut i dont want to be normal,btohqsg
want to hustle and chiong then get chance get big bucks,btohqsg
Too normal life a bit too boring,btohqsg
Make full use of the time is the best option we have,btohqsg
poor people have high opp cost for experimentation,btohqsg
Like for u you have ur own plans,btohqsg
dont chiong if u dont need to is my advise,btohqsg
Is just the route we take to reach our end goals may seem unconventional/weird to some,btohqsg
if u dumb fuck like me bear heavy debt,btohqsg
Usually ppl go uk study comeback not so rabz one,btohqsg
Even if u work in uk also not too bad,btohqsg
"""Ok one la. Just margin call only. It's only market die wad""",btohqsg
my fwen top student in cs,btohqsg

Or else i today no energy for lesson,btohqsg
uk all about interview skills. meaning how well u tell stories,btohqsg

1 is enough for a lot of things. You die once only too,btohqsg
look how far i am from utter failure,btohqsg
Anyway interesting talk about stock market yall have,btohqsg
Both DOW and S&P opened below ytd closing  as expected  not sure how far down the deep dive will go,btohqsg
we never analyse the market at all also,btohqsg
And if DOW and S&P drop  STI only follow,btohqsg
just talk about how it fall and rise,btohqsg
dont try time the market la,btohqsg
thats why i say no need time the market,btohqsg
u no know where floor is so stick to original strat ma,btohqsg
If your strat is to follow upward momentum,btohqsg
ur strat depends on knowing where the floor is,btohqsg
you do need to time the market,btohqsg
then u more porably will fail,btohqsg
eh who time it consistently correctly,btohqsg
tell me i go become his tudi,btohqsg
If you can change market behaviour  no need to be anyone's tudi,btohqsg
change market behaviour u need to be soros,btohqsg
no initial capital how to change,btohqsg
got enough cash to crash the hk forex market then say ba,btohqsg
(ref to soros raid on hk,btohqsg
if i got then why i bother change the market sia- -,btohqsg
i just go home sleep and live a sleepy life,btohqsg
We are sitting through 4 more days of talks,btohqsg
Well rather have talks than what I have in BMT,btohqsg
The most stupid phase of NS,btohqsg
Theres 1 day some guy will talk about suicides in AFTCI never regretted once waking up from my slumber for thatThe guy just simply talked about every single death case related to Air Force  but he portrays it in such a comedic way that everyone laughs about it.,btohqsg
Wtf u said you’re not Air Force,btohqsg
Something to look forward to I guess,btohqsg
Well I thought it was the psychologist,btohqsg
But I guess there’s more suicide talk,btohqsg
I laughed until i nearly died,btohqsg
If u all have a chance  try the wanton mee at the canteen.Its fkin good,btohqsg
Cheers to another 8-5pm talks again,btohqsg
Wat kind of discrimination is this,btohqsg
So there’s 3 of us in this room,btohqsg
Poor John is B separated from me again,btohqsg
And we’re just talking through an online chat group,btohqsg
I can see him but he can’t see me,btohqsg
Come say hi to me if you know me,btohqsg
Dude has a scholarship interview and can leave now,btohqsg
The guy that just left :(,btohqsg
Welp I didn’t apply for scholarship yet lol,btohqsg
The only thing left is nth but nth,btohqsg
I feel lazy to do it,btohqsg
I missed the deadline by a lot,btohqsg
I-i dont even have the chance to get a scholarship,btohqsg
Imma just cry myself to nap now,btohqsg
Just realised the 3 of us have the 3 different vocations,btohqsg
We need diversity in this group chat !!,btohqsg
2 math gods in the same room,btohqsg
Wat if they picked me for AOS just because I take 3 maths,btohqsg
They didn’t even bother to ask what subjects I take,btohqsg
They just ask the RP lol,btohqsg
Meanwhile CMPB RHMC and aeromed all take my blood,btohqsg
Instead of asking from each other,btohqsg
Meanwhile avs is made up of 1 jc dude  1 fake jc dude and 2 guys who dont study,btohqsg
So im not sure what criteria they were even looking for here,btohqsg
I feel mine is more rng,btohqsg
They literally could’ve put me in combat unit,btohqsg
Oh wait you are the tekong guys that came?,btohqsg
3 of my section mates kena security trooper,btohqsg
But one is recourse so cancelled the posting,btohqsg
Well he’s not part of the recroots,btohqsg
Yea I think AFT are non-recruits,btohqsg
About half of us were AFT and half were AOS,btohqsg
I’m Tekong but like from Rocky Hill so like a further away camp,btohqsg
Do you have to take a bus or something,btohqsg
But at the start it was tonner,btohqsg
So book out timing is retarded,btohqsg
Appreciating the school v life now,btohqsg
U have to add 1.5hr to book out timing,btohqsg
To know when u reach there,btohqsg
Coz also have to wait for bus to PRBI,btohqsg
Its okay now that you are here,btohqsg
School 1-3 people have it easy,btohqsg
Well but at least we have a cookhouse to ourselves,btohqsg
Imagine 3 schools sharing a cookhouse,btohqsg
And the food is actually decent,btohqsg
Well my school’s food quite decent lol,btohqsg
Ok sometimes trash but can be decent at times,btohqsg
