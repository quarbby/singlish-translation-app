"Your Morning Quick Read ‚Äì 30 July 2021Markets were rosy in the trading session but declined after-hours  with Amazon leading the fall given a less robust guidance and earnings report. This is on top of Facebook lacklustre guidance the day before.So let's into the action.AMZN: The Giant Missed ExpectationThe e-commerce titan fell sharply in after-hours as it reported mixed results. In contrast  profits were significant  the sales drop below expectation.The miss lies in Amazon's e-commerce business which is the heart of the company. It had suffered a pretty hard deceleration in this growing trend. However  this is slightly compensated by the rosy cloud computing business and its advertising segment coupled with the third-party seller segments.The Figures that MattersSales came in at $113.1 billion  which is an increase of 27% from the year-ago  and that lies in the middle of its guidance. However  it is still shy of Wall Street's estimate of $115.4 billion.Profit per share hits $15.12 ahead of analyst's $12.28 forecast. Operating income was good as it reaches $7.7 billion  which is at the upper end of the company's guidance of $4.5 billion to $8 billion. However  Wall Street's had a high benchmark of $7.8 billion.Online StoresAs we dive into the core business  we can see its sales for the online stores by 16% from the previous year to $53.2 billion. However  while it remains on the growth trajectory  it still fell short of estimates at $57.3 billion.The growth of 16% appeared pale compared to the 41% growth seen in the March quarter and 49% a year ago. So that could be the rate of change that is moderating in its core business.Third-Party Services and Web ServicesThe segment saw revenue up by 38% to hit $25.1 billion  marginally above the consensus level of $24.8 billion. However  the growth of 38% is still weaker than the 60% seen in the March quarter and 53% in the prior year.The web service segment  a rising star of the business  saw a revenue of $14.8 billion which is ahead of the estimate at $14.3 billion. The growth is 37%  and that is an acceleration from 32% seen in the March quarter and 29% a year ago. So that's the bright spot in the result.Advertising RevenueThe ""Other"" revenue segment  which mainly encompasses the advertising business  was a pretty firm result. Revenue was $7.9 billion  an increase of a stunning 87%  and hit above estimates of $7 billion. This set of results is consistent with other Ads giants of Facebook and Alphabet.It was a tough day for Amazon as investors had expected them to exceed expectations on all fronts. But  as with other companies  the pandemic had brought many uncertainty and variables to the result  with Apple facing difficulty guiding its trajectory too.It is 30 July  Friday  8.15 am in Singapore and 8.15 pm in New York. It is the final trading day of the week and for July. It is a roller coaster ride indeed  and hopefully  we end with a  profitable month.Take care  stay safe  and we will be right with you for the next update.Cheers Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a larger audience.",btohqsg
