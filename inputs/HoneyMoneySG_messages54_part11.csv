Hi anyone know if I will be eligible for 4mpd for payment on Atome using DBS Woman World card? ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Hi. If I apply new credit card every month  is it harder that my credit card will be approved?,btohqsg
Spend transactions on the Grab mobile application are cumulative and combined for the purpose of calculating whether the S$200 threshold per calendar month has been met. Transactions made on the Grab mobile applicationexcludetop-up charges for GrabPay (with effect from 1st March 2020).So how do we clock this ah... is it debiting directly from grab instead of grabpay?,btohqsg
hi  does anyone know whether the Amaze Card + UOB KrisFlyer Miles Combo still works for the uncapped 3mpd through the online transactions?,btohqsg
i see. so if the MCC of the transaction is not within the eligible MCCs  I won't be eligible for 3mpd even though the transaction is converted to online transaction by Amaze? I mean technically I would not be able to use the 'online' workaround for the UOB KrisFlyer?,btohqsg
hi  anyone happen to know when i can start buy t-bill this month?,btohqsg
hi all   promos aside  any thoughts on moomoo cash plus vs tiger vault?,btohqsg
It is the same. No difference if it is same fund,btohqsg
My 3months EGA is almost over but haven't received HSBC revolution. Applied on the same day.They wanted me to save money not spend it. Like my mom haha,btohqsg
Anyone knows difference between entering card details vs using Apple Pay on the online Apple Store for Hsbc revolution? Does both earn 4mpd? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
they are all online transactions right? no difference,btohqsg
Yeah I assume so. I got worried because using Citi rewards and just entering card details  I didnâ€™t get 4mpd. Only pairing the crmc with Instarem does. Painful mistake ðŸ¥¹ so Iâ€™m worried if thereâ€™s anything to look out for with hsbc revolution.,btohqsg
Hihiâ€¦for d UOB One Account  if donâ€™t have salary credit how huhâ€¦?? Any other waysâ€¦?,btohqsg
strange.. it should have been eligible for 4mpd under crmc..,btohqsg
3x giro payments instead  but you wonâ€™t earn as high of a interest rate without Salary crediting.,btohqsg
Tried with two separate transactions  both times CRMC didnâ€™t give me 4PMD by using it on the apple online store. Only when paired with amaze then I get 4mpd.,btohqsg
Are there any referral codes for opening a digibank with DBS?,btohqsg
doesnt seem to fall under the exclusion mentioned inhttps://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdfdid u find out why?,btohqsg
Spent almost a month back and fourth with Citibank. It was not a pleasant experience. In the end their last response was:Upon review  the relevant have advised that the transaction on 17May2023 did not earn bonus points as it does not come in as an online transaction. This is information passed to Citi from the merchantâ€™s acquirer and Citi has no control over it.I would like to inform you that we base the qualified reward earnings on the Merchant Category Code (MCC).I gave up after that.,btohqsg
oh gosh... should have asked what the MCC is :/ i'm sure it was an unpleasant experience,btohqsg
Yeahâ€¦lost a lot of valuable miles.. Hence now I have this fear with hsbc revolution.. hopefully Iâ€™ll get the bonus points on the apple online store.,btohqsg
i am worried myself now.. i'm just starting my miles journey and am planning to use both uob lady's and crmc to earn miles.. am thinking if i should change to revo...,btohqsg
I think UOB ladys solitaire is great because of the 3k cap. Sadly for me  MCC 5732 for electronics is not eligible for 6mpd  and that happens to be most of my spending. However I still think itâ€™s a great card for everything else.I just recently applied for hsbc revo to supplement my crmc because crmc doesnâ€™t give 4mpd for travel. I just like that itâ€™s a no annual fee card and gives you 4mpd for contactless spend as well. All the best!,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s alright  but not for me because I prefer Citi and HSBCâ€™s earning block of $1  and their 3 and 5 year validity period for the miles. And itâ€™s just easier for me to manage my current cards- UOB Ladys solitaire  CRMC  premier miles and hsbc revolution. I do find the $13 355 cap per membership year for OCBC TR pretty useful for large purchases.,btohqsg
Have a question: letâ€™s say I have 70k krisflyer miles expiring soon  I donâ€™t intent to travel but when I check on the redemption catalog I canâ€™t redeem an iPad or mobile products to sell for cash. What do you all suggest to use the miles for?,btohqsg
For things closest to redeem and convert to cash or use,btohqsg
U can transfer from dbs to uob with salary as reference to qualify for salart,btohqsg
Convert to krispay point when there is promo and then use it to offset purchase at participating merchant,btohqsg
wow sounds like a good reason to always use Amaze with CRMC regardless whether the transaction is online or not then.,btohqsg
as long as you use Amaze + CRMC and not at travel related  you should be very safe,btohqsg
Thanks sounds like the only choice was thinking of doing that and purchase something from challenger ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If there is still time. I only convert during those promotion. Then u can use to redeem ntuc during miles back promo,btohqsg
U go to customer service counter tell them u like to redem ntuc voucher using krispay point,btohqsg
But do it during miles back promo to maximis the benefit,btohqsg
i just found out my citi rewards card is a visa card not mastercard ðŸ˜³ does that affect my 4mpd earning?,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t affect but canâ€™t pair with amaze,btohqsg
Oh so have to buy at the ntuc store itself right?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s the best method thanks for the info!,btohqsg
I thought it was closed n fully subscribed?,btohqsg
Is this covered under SDIC? Lol,btohqsg
iâ€™m using heymax to check mcc for anytime fitness but they have 2 mcc. how do i know which is the correct one?,btohqsg
Can still apply through OCBC portal.,btohqsg
But seems like only if you have srs with ocbc then can  mines with dbs so cannot,btohqsg
No . Buy Fullerton fund better. Can take out anytime.,btohqsg
citi rewards excludes mobile online/in-app. E.g. Using citi rewards via googlepay/applepay on website/apps like Kris+  Xnap  apple etc.Workaround is using Amaze+crmc to route via Amaze so no longer mobile online/in-app,btohqsg
does hsbc revo be eligible? or also excluded?,btohqsg
hsbc revolution dun exclude mobile online/in-app  treat it as online and get 10x points so if mcc is on whitelist,btohqsg
Please advise which is the best platform to purchase from atm,btohqsg
Hi  Can we pair Kris+ with uob lady card ?Do we earn miles from it ?,btohqsg
yes  earn bonus points so long mcc under chosen category,btohqsg
