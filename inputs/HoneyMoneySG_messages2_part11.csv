should be TDA/IBKR  these two more common I think,btohqsg
Sit through the 3 hour long Options training for beginner video on youtube. I know it's really long but  really it's worth your time and you don't need to find high and low for other information,btohqsg
haha can do a video on ibkr,btohqsg
I've been watching Kevin learns investing but I really don't even understand 10% of what he says. What covered call cash covered put hear already going to collaspe,btohqsg
Thats why i say watch the 3 hr video. It will be crystal clear,btohqsg
remember to do paper trade first.,btohqsg
is cgs using the same options methods?,btohqsg
Lacking motivation and no incentive lolll,btohqsg
Is doing options really a must? How about just longing the stock for capital gains? More simplier that way and don't have to monitor the options until go mentally insane,btohqsg
Take a look at another youtuber Ziet invests. He does a lot of videos on Ibkr  nice guy too,btohqsg
haha whats the current promo ah?,btohqsg
Every $100 u put in Ibkr  u get $1 worth of IBKR shares,btohqsg
wow   haah up to how much,btohqsg
But need 100 shares to do options right,btohqsg
Isn't options = like shorting or day trading alr???,btohqsg
No and no. Trust me I watched CGS and Kelvins video i still dont understand options fully until i watch the 3 hour video,btohqsg
are they using same type of options strategy?,btohqsg
I've seen those wall Street bets YOLO ppl do what naked option or very close to expiration date then what 150K become 4M. Got so easy?,btohqsg
can share the 3 hrs video? or do a 20 mins video to summarise hahahah,btohqsg
This is the 3 hour option video@Kennytkw94,btohqsg
Just block 3 hour of your time. Throw away your mobile phone and focus. You will save more time instead of searching for other sources,btohqsg
haha what he covers is all the types of options already ah?,btohqsg
Is there a less risky way to do options first? Like with 1 share. Why need 100 ah. Feels like a bomb that going to Xplode,btohqsg
Yes  it's called paper trading. Just try out,btohqsg
Yes all the basics sell put  sell call  buy put  buy call,btohqsg
For those who missed the poll,btohqsg
it has gotten a lot better to be honest. compared to 2017,btohqsg
and it's really not advisable to do SGD for crypto for two main reasons:(1) SGD trade pairs are limited(2) even if available  SGD trade pair trading volume is comparatively lower so you may or may not suffer a poor spread (though Coinhako is decent),btohqsg
"on Coinhakopersonally  I'm not a fan of the Coinhako platform for multiple reasons:(1) High trading fees: at 0.75%  they are pretty much the highest fee exchange. arguably high fees can be mitigated by other ""features"" but that's not the case here because:(2) High crypto withdrawal fees: I can't remember offhand how Coinhako charges withdrawal fees but it's not the best(3) Fees for fiat deposit + withdrawals: They charge a percentage - which simply doesn't make sense when users have so many other options these days(4) Limited withdrawal network support: You may see a lot of SGD trade pairs on Coinhako but you need to consider whether you get the coins off the exchange for staking  DeFi  etc. (where the fun is at)- Unfortunately  Coinhako support in this regard is super limited and left wanting---Coinhako must be acknowledged for their pioneering efforts in the Singapore scene (they've been around since 2014) but given the abundance of options  I see little reason to stay with Coinhako and many more reasons to explore other platformsBut then again  every thing boils down to one's personal optimum amount of hassle. If Coinhako meets that for you  then perhaps it's fine too",btohqsg
Maybe you want to change your title of the video. Shld be best way to change your currency,btohqsg
1. The title is fine2. It is about which exchange is preferred first. The funding is almost the same for other platforms,btohqsg
Unable to pay via credit card  is it only for us credit cards?,btohqsg
Depends on exchange. If they only accept USD  then yes only US credit cards,btohqsg
Has anybody compared Gemini Earn Vs Hodlnaut?,btohqsg
hmm if you're comparing the supported coins on Hodlnaut vs Gemini Earn- then Hodlnaut rates are definitely higher----but comparing risks  how they do it  etc.: different thingswhat are you looking at?,btohqsg
no specific topic actually  just general overview,btohqsg
I tried to sign up for options trading in IBKR but failed.,btohqsg
So no pt watching what 3hr option trading video since access denied,btohqsg
Or u can watch the video  then complete the options teaching exam,btohqsg
the point of watching the video is to get some basic knowledge on options,btohqsg
"I've promoted@boontee86to Stocks guru of this group. Check out his YouTube channel ""Invest with Boon Tee"" as well. He creates content around stock market investing and have really good insights",btohqsg
So@wilflarewhen are you creating your blog or youtube channel?,btohqsg
Can just take the options exam  i think the exams can redo multiple times,btohqsg
agreed! ðŸ¥²  i blindly gotten some alt coins previously from coinhako only when try to withdraw for staking then realize that withdrawal is not supported,btohqsg
been thinking about it - got most things set -up but no time,btohqsg
hello Christopher  have you heard of CardUp before?,btohqsg
CardUp is pretty useful to earn miles and cashback on insurance  rental  etc. and more,btohqsg
Yes  but im not using (yet),btohqsg
incur 2.25% processing fee for expenses that usually cannot earn miles,btohqsg
i started to trade options 4 months agoOnce got the concept right  it is quite interesting (but gotta to proper risk management).happy to learn from the community here .,btohqsg
