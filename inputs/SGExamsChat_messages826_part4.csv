Also if any one here is interested in pursuing a Chinese major. Come to NTU,btohqsg
Don't bother with NUS. Like legit NTU is just better in terms of experience,btohqsg
U get a free exchange to PRC every semester in your class,btohqsg

I recently found out body shop can sell products that is manufactured 2y agoâ€¦coz i just checked the mfd of my sun block bot Aug 2023 and it was manufactured in Sept 2021ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
as long as it isnâ€™t expired  still cn be used,btohqsg
No expiry date written but I think the rule of thumb is 3y (supposedly after date of manufacture),btohqsg
Next time need to check manufacture date before grabbing stuffðŸ’€,btohqsg
Actually in general  most cosmetics is 3y fr MFD (if unopened) and 6m-1y when open,btohqsg
but like selling a product 2 years old???,btohqsg
I mean in clearance ig it's fine,btohqsg
For sun block especially I think they did a study  the efficacy decrease rapidly after 3 years,btohqsg
But this means the actual durability becomes 1yðŸ’€,btohqsg
Not only thatâ€¦the texture of the sun block change alsoâ€¦,btohqsg
I haven't touch cosmetic science in a lost ass time but yeah.,btohqsg
The most important thing is the SPF protection I mean skin cancer is not fun,btohqsg
So if u can prevent it  so why take risk?,btohqsg
Yeah just don't cheap out on sunblock,btohqsg
Depends if it's a homogeneous mixture cuz if so after 3 years I would expect it to separate out,btohqsg
Mask cream  concealer  blusher those kind,btohqsg

I see you've unmasked my persona,btohqsg
So that photo was just a facade,btohqsg

No one can debunk im matcha because no one can prove i exist in NTU,btohqsg
