You have options below:1). Increase your qualified expenses  exclude rent  to $500 to get 5% from UOB One. Which means spend *additional* around $150 to earn $33.33 more of interest per month.2). Have you ever consider:a). Use GXS to earn 3.48%.b). Use TBill to earn 3.8%-3.99% pa of interest for 6 months. Need to re-subscribe every 6 month.,btohqsg
1ï¼‰ do u have other credit card can't earn more cashback? But the oub evol minimum spend is $6002) moomoo plus will be more amazing then that,btohqsg
Usually credit card that earn higher cash back required minimum spend that is above your average month spend. Eg $500. Those 1%-2.5% cashback required no minimum spend but will not help you on getting higher interest on your saving.Moomoo plus only for 1 month?,btohqsg
