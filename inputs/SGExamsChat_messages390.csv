The only reason I didn't outright scold was cux,btohqsg
One of the ppl involved is my friend,btohqsg

geog is jist memory and throwing out,btohqsg
my friends gave a name for my hairstyle,btohqsg
Ok la but fr I just find it Sian in lower sec,btohqsg
according to my friends  they call this the 'fold mountain',btohqsg
I can't unsee it now lmao,btohqsg
HAHA u thought SBS transit is it?,btohqsg
My hair q similar to urs,btohqsg
when two continental plates converge  compressional forces are applied. as both plates are too thick and buoyant  subduction cannot occur. hence the layers of the plates buckle and fold  folding over one another to form fold mountains.,btohqsg
using geog terms on a history student,btohqsg
No ah  i also ntu but i cant recognize,btohqsg
Is this the legendary techtonic plates !!!,btohqsg
seriously tho! how does my hair even resemble fold mountain!?!,btohqsg
a fold mt doesn't look like thst,btohqsg
my teacher would be so proud,btohqsg
tb has a fold mt diagram,btohqsg
Geog + hist ppl have good memories sia,btohqsg
we take humanities for a reason üòé,btohqsg
I chose hist cuz I was like,btohqsg

Managed to troll her for Chers day bahahaha,btohqsg
wow your essay deserves a score of five macbooks out of 2 universities/j,btohqsg
Apple is not any better. This is what I got after replacing the screen   logic board and some other components.,btohqsg
But yeah.. At least Apple ‚Äòs customer service is the saving grace.,btohqsg
I heard Aftershock CS is shit AF.,btohqsg
Uk their website has a love agent,btohqsg
I just want to enquire what material they use for chassis and it doesn't work,btohqsg
I waited for 25 minutes for a reply,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt support most local companies for such purchases. Many of them are just out there to screw locals.,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs what most local brands do. They do not even have self-confidence in their brand I feel. That ‚Äòs why need others to validate for them.,btohqsg
Aftershock like to sponsor local influencers and hence they always say.. Aftershock hooked us up with‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Times change bro. Luckily   I have AppleCare+   so have the room to negotiate.,btohqsg
This laptop is just 2 years plus,btohqsg
@Corporate_shillI just sent friend request le,btohqsg
Did u see it? They don‚Äôt make comps but produces food.,btohqsg
This one too. Shady ass company,btohqsg
The name sounds like a brand run by a street Beng or smth like that.,btohqsg
Not rly. The customer service is better. Based on my experiences compared to other brands.,btohqsg
Maybe it's just cuz of apple fanboys?,btohqsg
But u can say Apple is overpriced for preconfigured specs/ parts upgrades etc.,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs true. I can listen to ur rant too.,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs what I realized too. You can speak to service staff from U.S   Australia.,btohqsg
Apple is like a status symbol I feel.,btohqsg
Just gives you the ‚Äòpremium feel‚Äô,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a nice place to sip tea,btohqsg
That is unmatched by many brands although they have been trying very hard.,btohqsg
There are some features of apple that make it nice to be within their ecosystem,btohqsg
why is everything about laptops now,btohqsg
is that why aftershock always got offer one,btohqsg
can use chepo usb type c what,btohqsg
ahhhh no wonder every time i check their website like got big discounts one,btohqsg
ya then what else u need for,btohqsg
They get the laptops for low price cuz directly from oem and their usual price markup damn high so they can afford to give offer,btohqsg
was looking for a desktop and my aunt suggested aftershock cuz my cousin bought frm thr but aft hearing this idk man,btohqsg
i think ppl will come up w a fake,btohqsg
i kept thinking how come they can gibe such big discounts,btohqsg
Their og price already gives them big profit margins so they can afford to discount here and there,btohqsg
OH FINALLY I HAVE BEEN NOTICED üòç,btohqsg
of all desktop retailers/custom pc builders in sg whoch one is the btr one,btohqsg
It took a while for me to find a non official converter for my Samsung tablet lol,btohqsg
had this cheapo wire took so long to charge,btohqsg
this one like v common tactic for businesses nowadays,btohqsg
keep seeing everywhr wveryth on sale,btohqsg
True. I ‚Äòve used Apple for many years.,btohqsg
Nxt time i buy laptop i consult u@Voidchords,btohqsg
nawwww i don't even know what the diff components do and mean,btohqsg
Well. It ‚Äòs possible to look it up online.,btohqsg
You can do better than prism,btohqsg
anyway for laptop I‚Äôve been using MSI,btohqsg
now i need monitor and desktop reccos üò´üò´,btohqsg
Ltt got video how to build quite in depth nit bad,btohqsg
I heard is sell customer data or ads in phone.,btohqsg
Actually can. If u wan u can always look at their cogs u can tell roughly whats the profit margin liao,btohqsg
I recommend Dell monitors. Very good customer service.,btohqsg
Can turn off no? My k20 pro has 0 ads,btohqsg
i scared one wrong move and everything cannot work haha plus im not v patient either üò≠,btohqsg
Too broke to get one oc,btohqsg
rigjt i was lurking in this chat backreading haha,btohqsg
oh ya anyone heard of the custom pc builder the keanetobuild guy?,btohqsg
You can also find out more local company malpractices to assist you in making informed decisions.,btohqsg
yez i think backreading the convo made me reconsider my decision of buying frm aftershock LOL,btohqsg
ooh i saw aoc monitors b4 but the price not as attractive as prism so i didnt pay much attn,btohqsg
my cousin uses aoc n i think q nice leh the display but i cldnt find the same monitor,btohqsg
Key thing is to know usage. What you plan to use for  I don't game so high refresh rate is secondary and I don't need the best viewing angle so I go really cheap,btohqsg
this one actl q nice but monitor abit too long scared stare so long kena strain sia haha,btohqsg
oh wtf taobao rly has everything ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Strain due to length ? ü§≠,btohqsg
so big look frm left to right right to left,btohqsg
i cant read chinese to save my life üò≠,btohqsg
Viewing distance matters if u sit too near yes need to turn neck but mostly use eyes can see from one side to the other alr,btohqsg
i need to sit abit nearer to monitor cuz i cant see if sit further away haha i dun wear specs at home one,btohqsg
I think I‚Äôve been using the same Asus monitor for damn long lol,btohqsg
i wear specs at home cannot i feel v dizzy ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
My monitor I bought under 150sgd 23.8 inch   75hz   1ms response time,btohqsg
bcs usually afaik if u wear glasses then dizzy means ur eye power change alr,btohqsg
my friends power changes every 6 mths,btohqsg
if i stare at screen w glasses at home i feel dizzy,btohqsg
but even astigmatism it shouldnt matter if screen is seen at home or outside right?,btohqsg
when u change ur glasses u can ask the person there,btohqsg
I mean the lighting conditions would make a difference,btohqsg
wait is astigmatism noticeable like if u look in the persons eye can notice?,btohqsg
Is good for multi-tasking like opening more Windows but like what you mentioned   long displays are not for everyone.,btohqsg
how come IT can talk so long,btohqsg
i disagree with the childe one,btohqsg
right but he acts too childish with lumine,btohqsg
does anyone have youtube premium and keen to share,btohqsg
Did u try and sign up for the studentOption and do u plan to use it to only skip ads?,btohqsg
can try asking if they want share account?,btohqsg
22.98$ a month share up to 6 accountsoriginal 1 account $16 per month,btohqsg
idw to pay $16 a month üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Pls u have tele premium üíÄ,btohqsg
um anyone can work tmr  decent pay,btohqsg
Cuz I share with my friends,btohqsg
Only subscription I have is tidal hifi,btohqsg
It's good enough dunnid so many premiums,btohqsg
I also hv Netflix but it's my family,btohqsg
But right now Netflix cannot share,btohqsg
If not have to pay extra,btohqsg
Download the free Brave browser if watching on laptop. No more annoying YouTube ads. That ‚Äòs what I did myself.,btohqsg
Why are so many people disappointed with Chinese,btohqsg
xian zai wo zai chi bingchilling,btohqsg
It supports other streaming sites beside YouTube,btohqsg
Can use is still can use,btohqsg
But its stuck in an older ver.,btohqsg
I had a sudden craving for fishball,btohqsg
children shld not sleep so late,btohqsg
u cook ur own bobo yu yuan,btohqsg
comb sci in the afternoon what,btohqsg
im planning on studying in the morning,btohqsg

I dont even know u m9,btohqsg
I think there is a website for that service,btohqsg
uh can u guys share with me ur opinions on POA? is it easy? what is it mainly about,btohqsg
as someone who hates poa  dont take lol,btohqsg
if youre interested in business activities and all those type of stuff then i think its okay. but if youre like me and thought poa was js math then     youre wrong HAHAHA,btohqsg
i rlly dislike poa because i cant understand anything. i dont understand why this particular transaction occurs when that occurs etc. so it was difficult for me to catch up and excel in the subj lah,btohqsg
but ppl in my class who also likes poa rlly can get A1s all the way one  so id say its personal preference ?,btohqsg
Poa is one of those subjects you can last minute mug,btohqsg
what‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ u last min mug ah,btohqsg
wth‚Ä¶. i last min mug i also cant pass eh,btohqsg
For prelims just do practice papers,btohqsg
o‚Äôs i js whack cause idc about poa alr atp,btohqsg
Some questions I just whack but paper 2 is easier than paper 1,btohqsg
but i feel bth pprs equally difficult eh like  same difficulty,btohqsg
I plan to use science  Chinese and humans,btohqsg
yeah same but im using em and am instead lol,btohqsg
idk why my lower sec mind decided poa was a good choice imo,btohqsg
It's easy when you have the foundation,btohqsg

now I am doubting whether to study POA just for fun,btohqsg
it was easy in sec 3** not lower sec lol,btohqsg
There was no lower sec poa,btohqsg
Have fun with the new accounts,btohqsg
A math is more fun actually,btohqsg
id rather do chinese o levels 3 times than do poa honestly,btohqsg
I'm gonna borrow my sis tb when she get it to learn when I'm free sia,btohqsg
I cant say if poa or amath more funs,btohqsg
same bc i dont take amath HAHAHHA,btohqsg
and i keep seeing everyone in my school complaining/dying,btohqsg
It rly depends on ur Foundation in maths alrd,btohqsg
The cancer part abt amath imo is,btohqsg
If u make mistake first part,btohqsg
The rest of the qn may die alrd,btohqsg
And it's hard to spot ur careless mistakes,btohqsg
I would rather do any subject I took 3 times including hist SS and amath than Chinese,btohqsg
I struggle my way through also,btohqsg
but I can pick up concept real fast tho,btohqsg
i think its supposed to be < instead of >,btohqsg
Nah y'all jealous because physics has a calculation,btohqsg
