Can UOB ladyâ€™s card be used on Kris+ to earn 6mpd?,btohqsg
Provided the mcc code qualified to earn 6mpd.,btohqsg
How about the Moomoo promotion?  Is it additional or same as smart park?,btohqsg
If i use HSBC revolution on Cashback  which MCC does it go to and do I get rewarded the 4mpd?,btohqsg
"Hi if my UOB One account is opened today  is there a ""right"" time to deposit the $ in? My salary is not activated to credit in yet until mid next month",btohqsg
I reckon I will not earn high interest until next month so am thinking if its worth to transfer from my other bank account and lose the interest?,btohqsg
I think not all allowed that. I a m using HL bank..dont have that trasction drop down as salary,btohqsg
But you may need to spend 500$ by end of the month to get bonus interest even after self crediting salary,btohqsg
When will hsbc give out EGA bonus interest for those that opened in March?,btohqsg
Anyone using ViewQwest in CCK area? Any feedback? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi need loan advice.Earning abt 7.5k per month b4 cpf. Need to pay for my 61k nus master course. Should I save up to pay for my tuition or should I take a loan at 4.38 p.a. if I take the loan I would probably use that money to dca into spy500. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Dca at index 80+ to 90% percentile hmmmm....,btohqsg
What would be your expected salary bump after masters? There are no guarantees in investment btw,btohqsg
I am still quite young  so I think I can afford to take risk. Boss say master won't effect salary in the short term.,btohqsg
Ok. What is short term? Also  why do you want to do the masters?,btohqsg
In the industry of tech but don't have relevant degree. A master in cs would pay off in the long run.,btohqsg
Ok so u don't care about the short term anyway. That's fine. If you're sure of getting a higher return than 4.38 pa by DCA  then go for it.,btohqsg
Also keep in mind the Forex risk,btohqsg
Hihi any one apply uob amex card ..1.7% cash back recently?,btohqsg
Hi  will OCBC monthly credit card spend amount be accounted as net amount after cash back or gross amount spend before cash back?,btohqsg
Is it possible to rise gxs withdrawal limit above 15k,btohqsg
Diff method also same withdrawal rate,btohqsg
Just manually key in the amount (limit now should be 100k),btohqsg
But the settings gt no manual is prefix at 3 option,btohqsg
Under your setting daily transfer limit,btohqsg
O that hw it set thanks alot,btohqsg
The cimb whatapp registration they just cfm thru phone number can liao is it lol seem werid like no detail or name given just ok u registered,btohqsg
HSBC just credited my EGA interest for March 2023 but it is awfully low! Does anyone get the full 4.xx%,btohqsg
Hi William sifu  no signs of EGA interest yet  yours is fast. My promo period is March to July 2023. Should be in by end of this monthâ€¦?,btohqsg
Did you calculate your ADB for each month correctly? I think Can ask hsbc if the breakdown thru the appâ€™s Digibot,btohqsg
I won't expect much for Mar EGA cos open accout mid-month. But anyway  nothing received yet.,btohqsg
Ask for a pure ATM card only and use your cc card,btohqsg
Got it! Will do that when I decide to get a job CC,btohqsg
UOB can ask for pure ATM card?,btohqsg
saw this in my uob lady uni$  how do i make sense of the 5x amount? the amount seems to be lower than the non-5x one under the same category. ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Where do you see this screen from?,btohqsg
Go bank in person others bank still have,btohqsg
hrm..so anything with 5XUNI is your bonus category ?,btohqsg
yeah thatâ€™s my thinking too. so suppose my travel earns 100 uni$  wouldnâ€™t bonus be 500 uni$? canâ€™t see the breakdown so itâ€™s challenging to know how itâ€™s derived :/,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” ok thanks  probably call CSO to check if can request. If not go bank branch on Monday.,btohqsg
5x is 5xNon-5x is 9xTotal 14x,btohqsg
Can I check for the citi rewards and amaze pairing  if I use amaze to book air tickets  does the 4mpd still works?,btohqsg
Plus the 1x posted on transaction  equals 15x = 6 mpd,btohqsg
thanks!! that makes sense! got confused as 1+5mpd = 6mpd ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
strange for mine.  my bonus category is fashion. I paid using amaze paired with UOB ladys to make payment. The mcc code as confirmed by UOB is correctly tagged to fashion MCC but my uni$ is only showing as normal . It did not say UOB Ladys Card Uni - Fashion. Instead it only stated AMAZE*ZaloraSG. Does amaze work with UOB ladys to gain bonus?,btohqsg
need to wait for the next month before the lump sum uni$ is collated,btohqsg
No  the mcc code is still travel which is excluded by CRMC,btohqsg
I m 42 years old earning 18k a month. Is that above average?,btohqsg
Should be bah. 18k still average then really GG,btohqsg
Ohh okay I see  got it. Thanks thanks,btohqsg
