Hi can ask for UOB one  for the $500 spending on credit card  I understand if I spend $400 on insurance premium (not eligible for Cashback). But if I spend more than 600 on the credit card  will the $200 be eligible for cashback? Thanks,btohqsg
anyone purposely make giro payment fail so that the money will be deducted only on the next try? objective is to keep the money in your bank longer.,btohqsg
Perhaps you need to provide more details on your question.1a). Is it your spending is $600 qualified transaction excluded insurance + $400 insurance(non qualified)?Or1b). $400 insurance(non qualified) + $200 qualified transactions?,btohqsg
1b only has $200 qualified transactions n it is less than $500 to qualify for credit card cashback.,btohqsg
So even though I spend more than 500,btohqsg
To get UOB one credit card cashback  you need to spend $500 or more on qualified transactions each month for 3 months.,btohqsg
But I will still able to qualify for the 3.85% bank interest rate right,btohqsg
if men can apply uob lady card is there a need for hsbc revo anymore,btohqsg
Provided you meet all the requirements. Salary or Giro  + $500 spend requirements.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs good replacement for EGA? My promo ended  for july,btohqsg
I considering this and park 100k to maximise.if you create new stash account and register for the National Savings Promotion and put in 100k for 4 months  you get additional 1.674%  so total for the 100k = 3%+1.674% = 4.674% PA for the 4 months if I compute correctly.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
"then not worth to ""lock in"" the incremental funds.",btohqsg
I happen to have a newly created Stash so I think just nice can double dip.,btohqsg
Or best fd rates for July,btohqsg
Or the rates only come in on Monday?,btohqsg
Any other way to apply for Citi prestige without having to put 10000 monthly income on the application page? Eg. secured credit version etc,btohqsg
Provided if the day end balance on 30 Jun is zero. Right?,btohqsg
UOB lady only cover 2 categories which definitely something will be missed and hsbc revo can be the back up (somemore 4mpd + 1% cash back isnt that bad afterall),btohqsg
already have citi rewards w amaze so am thinking between hsbc revo or uob lady as the backup,btohqsg
to maximise 0 or a low amount will be the best  since anything beyond $100000 don't get much interest.,btohqsg
no harm keeping revo as no annual fee,btohqsg
but if you worried about orphan point  perhaps need to considered again then,btohqsg
I did pay my bill 2days late  which incurred a $100 late charge and subsequently waived. Dont seem like this interest is something on top of the late charge tho,btohqsg
you can try to call in and appeal! i almost didn‚Äôt make it last month  the customer service officer told me can try to appeal,btohqsg
actually  the current hsbc rate is 3.85% right? + 1% extra if u meet the criteria? pardon me if i got it wrong. i just opened an account üòÖ,btohqsg
