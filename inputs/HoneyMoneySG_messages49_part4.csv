Hi. First time applied for t-bills. Got SMS saying I succeeded. But in the cpf dashboard  the amount deducted from my OA is a bit less than the amount I bidded for. Means what ah?,btohqsg
Deduction is based on cut off yield of 3.84%  not on the amount you bidded.,btohqsg
Ok no problem  the credit card earnings on points will still be valid even if u also earn from kris+  cuz i use kris+ quite often,btohqsg
What is deducted is the discounted amt. Example you use 1k for 6m tbill. On auction  cut off yield is 3.83 Sgr discounted $19.10. How you are deducted is 1k minus 19.10. On maturity you will get back 1k. Your effective yield minus all the bank admin fees is $19.10,btohqsg
