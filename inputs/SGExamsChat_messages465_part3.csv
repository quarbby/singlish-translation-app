and it has happened to my bunk twice,btohqsg
the other story I heard was that after lights out  this recruit still using handphone when everyone else slept.Then suddenly he hear footsteps and thought was sergeant coming to check bunk  so he close eyes.Then he hear little girl voice talk.Little girl: Grandpa  what are all these people doingGrandpa: They are serving army.Little girl: What are they doing now?Grandpa: They are sleeping.Then the little girl walk to the recruit that pretending to sleep and ask: Why this one not sleeping yet,btohqsg
True a not also not sure  maybe coined to bluff people to sleep early,btohqsg

In my unit  there was this person who said he experienced it directly during BMT.So it's CNY and someone brought bak kwa into tekong bunk. Not supposed to bring pork in mah  but he brought and put in cupboard.That night the cupboard shake shake shake. Then also came knocking sounds from the wall.But that is the end of the building  so the other side of the wall is nothing.Then someone quickly on the lights  then they found the bak kwa.,btohqsg
