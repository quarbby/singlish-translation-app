Thanks for not booting me out!Promise max 2 silver posts a day :),btohqsg
No complaints la just asking why the infatuation with silver. Don‚Äôt mind me,btohqsg
I got read also. Useful info,btohqsg
NAV is the based on the valuation done on the company and there is no difference from industry to industry. This is the cash amount that one can get by liquidating the company at that point of time. The only thing that is missing is the future opportunity which nobody can guarantee. This should be the cause of the market price in a rationale market. However for the market price to balloon so much out from the NAV  how much extra revenue does one expect it to drive for 2021?,btohqsg
Not at all!Happy to ans any silver qns too.,btohqsg
Got plenty of inputs for Oceanus but actually say now sounds like bird talk lol,btohqsg
Shld be able to see DM tac 260...üôèüôè,btohqsg
Err.. you sure there is no diff from industry to industry?? NAV for a property counter and say SGX is very different..,btohqsg
Of course next to cash everything else has element of discretion,btohqsg
ok... coz the screenshot he posted is the NAV from the recent FY2020 result,btohqsg
Yes he refer 1 cent nav 7.5 cent share price or something. Multiples of nav,btohqsg
That is the liquidation value... the price of the company Net Asset Value divide by no of shares...,btohqsg
I got problem reading oceanus assets. A lot of unknowns,btohqsg
Anyway if me I match out oceanus,btohqsg
Each company has FS to detail the assessed value of the company at the end of the financial period ... the Net Asset Value akin to a price tag.... as to whether you want to trade based on the price tag is up to the buyer/seller,btohqsg
The NAV is audited so is normally refer to as fair value especially for Merger / Acquisition,btohqsg
Oceanus fighting to close at 24,btohqsg
Good one yzj  closed day high and year high..,btohqsg
Btw cimb buy 260 for banana,btohqsg
that is textbook answer.. Furion's answer is nearer to what is liquidation value.. ie only consider cash..,btohqsg
You can't just consider cash only as companies have liabilities. Such liabilities will need to be paid off before the equity holders received their cash if the company wind down. This is why we use NAV to understand what is the value of a company at certain point of time...,btohqsg
anyone got buy XELA in us market?,btohqsg
Dm not bad  last minute 200k buying,btohqsg
yes  that is also the textbook answer.. when company go into liquidation  it sell off all the asset  repay all liabilities and what is left over are to be split by the shareholders.. but.. you don't look at NAV from an liquidation angle when investing. because if you by this logic  SGX is way overpriced  coz NAV is $1.18  but price is at about $10.. even higher than Oceanus when at it's peak..,btohqsg
Good stuff.U got in before yesterday?,btohqsg
Why chase the tendies.Find the nx XELA.Today premkt impressive though. U could flip it for quick profit.,btohqsg
I mean all assets are valued with a certain level of discretion except cash. So won‚Äôt take nav at face value.Better off applying a discount to illiquid assets such as receivables and hard to value ones. Properties isn‚Äôt that bad in valuing since got neighbors and reference points,btohqsg
The next xela is when u look hard at it and it makes sense but nobody else is buying it. U load up then break the news to everyone. If pple see it too then u moon.,btohqsg
Bb sam also got buy üçÖ?,btohqsg
Alot expectations baked into DM üòÇüòÇ no room for error liao,btohqsg
