from what i am communicated to  it's an additional $30 from Singsaver plus $150 from HSBC for new customers  Existing gets only $50,btohqsg
Correction  only new customers get +S$30 from Singsaver,btohqsg

Hi  can I check whether is there any credit card that can replace my POSB Everyday credit card for utilities bill such as M1  Giga  Gomo  SPGroup and Tuas Power that does not need to have minimum spend to have this Cashback?,btohqsg

Anyone has trouble creating GIRO arrangement with HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
If my account balance is $0  technically they cannot charge me $5 right? Because they have minimum account balance of $2000,btohqsg
Giro application mostly via physical form,btohqsg
technically yes...but then you risk your GIRO not going through and kena charged failed deduction fee + late fee + interest.For my peace of mind I just keep a little over the min balance all the time,btohqsg
I managed to do it via hardcopy form recently,btohqsg
So you downloaded the hard copy form and mailed it to HSBC?,btohqsg
Failed giro deduction might attracts fees of minimally $10,btohqsg
Adding on to the options   now tt scb journey cc waive off fcy in June  wonder ifScb 2mpd ringgit rate without fcy is betterOrAmaze w/ crmc 4mpd wit fx spreadOrYoutrip with no miles if the rates are really better,btohqsg

Hi can anyone recommend how could I pay for my M1 billsOptimizing cashback / rebates?(Have HSBC EGA),btohqsg
Utilities are excluded in most cards,btohqsg
UOB Amex card can also right?,btohqsg
Citi Bank Cashback+ can't earn anything at all?,btohqsg
Telco =/= utilities. Different MCC so not excluded like utilities.No min spend cards yes Amex TCB can get 1.5% cashbackBut best is can use those that give cashback for online transactions like UOB Evol (I think this is 6%) or miles card like CRMC. For me personally  I use OCBC365 which gives 3% for recurring telco cos it also give cashback for utilities as well. My telco monthly bill not as high cos using sim only.^ Note that these cards have varying min spend of $500-800 monthly. miles card like CRMC no min spend,btohqsg
No. Uob lady. Best is pair with amaze for overseas spending.Because uob lady don‚Äôt have any overseas fx rebate promo now.,btohqsg
Not a frequent traveler and doesn't have CRMC.Thought of using Instarem amaze card to transact in MYR to avoid carrying too much cash in Malaysia.Saw honey boss video on best card on overseas travel  confirming my understanding:- Transact in Malaysia using Amaze card funded by amaze SGD wallet = SGD convert to MYR (+0.3% spot rate mark up)Need to top up using Mastercard OR SGD account right?,btohqsg
Yup  either Mastercard CC or bank transfer (PayNow),btohqsg
