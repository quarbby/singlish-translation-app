for internal use just bind 😊 much cheaper and easier,btohqsg
plus i dont think my writing would be interesting enough to read,btohqsg
let me take a picture of what I do on the internal part. Need to cover the logo first  else it becomes an ad 😅,btohqsg
or can make it into a “book” yourself,btohqsg
storybook wise i like classics and romance,btohqsg
2018 version. 2021 I brought home now don't have,btohqsg
machine price: $60Binder price: $0.20Time take for each copy: 3+ minutes,btohqsg
Machine can buy from ezbuy :p,btohqsg
That looks really tempting to have,btohqsg
Taken at an angle not to become an ad,btohqsg
These type are perfect binding. Send to professional printers to print,btohqsg
Generally the price is only low if you print >= 1000 copies,btohqsg
what other juicy information you all want?,btohqsg
Does this include jc1 n 2 notes too,btohqsg
My notes are much thicker  those will not be published.,btohqsg
How long did you take to compile the notes,btohqsg
10+ years of work  updating every year,btohqsg
Book feels pro....u know marketing gimmicks,btohqsg
Is it As ten year series or smth,btohqsg
It is a compilation of the different kinds of questions that appear in exams.I compiled based on types of questions  and not randomly chosen questions,btohqsg
so when you study  yes TYS is important  but is important for you to know what types of questions are being tested,btohqsg
eg you finished O level Physics. Within Kinematics alone  v-t graphs  I have 10 different kinds in my worksheet,btohqsg
there are at least 15 types  but some are too hard to solve using O level methods. So scrape it.,btohqsg
My secret is no cigarette 😳,btohqsg
Hi guysI have something to ask y'allMy friend wants to go to NUS  so she's actually writing out her Personal Statement nowFrom the information about Personal Statement that my friend sent to me  the maximum number of characters is 2 000. However  she got 3000+ characters. So  do y'all think it's still acceptable?,btohqsg
guys do you think Low 70 rank points is good or bad? what options do I have?,btohqsg
HmmThen what should she actually have to include in her Personal Statement?She studied Environmental Science in poly  and she is planning to study about the same course in NUS as she wants to save the environmentShe had included her internship  the modules that she had studied on the environmental issues  FYP  use of transportation  laboratory work  and some talks about environmental issues as well in her Personal Statement,btohqsg
Not alot  ur in the same boat as me i guess,btohqsg
I predict like I’ll get somewhere around 72.5 73.75,btohqsg
I’m thinking of going for business school,btohqsg
or if not NUS FASS not sure if it’s possible,btohqsg
they have the bonus points if I’m not wrong?,btohqsg
so unless u get 74 + bonus 2(?) points  you're out of luck basically,btohqsg
yeah if I get 73.75 and after adding 2.5 bonus I’ll reach 76.25,btohqsg
if not my choice will give me 75,btohqsg
that’s my prediction after my As now lmao,btohqsg
i mean NUS biz sch hopeless for low 70s anw,btohqsg
but not sure if like I’m one grade away whether can give a course a try and just apply,btohqsg
maybe like 2.5 or 3.75 rank points away from the 10th percentile,btohqsg
just make sure your portfolio good lor,btohqsg
otherwise they got no reason to accept u,btohqsg
if u want biz  ntu biz your best choice lor  71.25,btohqsg
but not sure are there people who meet 10th percentile but get rejected,btohqsg
I hear rumours but dk if it’s true,btohqsg
got ppl who meet 10th percentile who get rejected  got ppl who never meet but aso get accepted,btohqsg
i never hit 10th percentile i still got in,btohqsg
your course requires portfolios interviews rite?,btohqsg
idts? but i got in through ABA which requires interview either way,btohqsg
can try ntu econs aso  it's 71.25,btohqsg
but if die die want biz  then ntu biz lor,btohqsg
