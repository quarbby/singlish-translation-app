u just tried as in today?,btohqsg
if bank still don't want waive annual fees after threaten them to cancel the card  i just be foolish to pay annual fees if i really want to utilize the card?,btohqsg
The underlying MCC also matters  it should be a qualifying online spend.,btohqsg
All 3 transactions done on 26th Jan,btohqsg
amaze shows which mcc? travel spend even if online don‚Äôt get 10x,btohqsg
2 less than $10  the other $25+,btohqsg
Amount doesn‚Äôt matter. Check the mcc,btohqsg
These won‚Äôt get 10x points even with amaze^,btohqsg
Understand that amaze convert all purchase to online transactions. All 3 using paywave.1.Mcdonald $3.302.ShengSiong $25.603.Mcdonald $1.60Total: $29( $3+$25+$1),btohqsg
If you threaten them to cancel the card  you should be prepared to follow through on your threat üôÇ,btohqsg
I think just wait a few more days  you should receive the reward points. It should be around 290 Points,btohqsg
Transaction posted $29 x 1.2 = 35milepoint. Let's see whether they reward the additional 255,btohqsg
Posted should have received. 35points for 1x also not correct,btohqsg
$29 x 1.2 local spending = 34.8 round off to 35,btohqsg
Why do you keep saying 1.2? Crmc doesn‚Äôt award points this way. 1x is 29  additional 9x is 261. Total 10x is 290 (equivalent to 116 miles) Not sure how you get to 1.2.,btohqsg
Does it come in mile points?,btohqsg
This is citi premier miles. A completely different card. did you link to citi premier miles instead?,btohqsg
Citi got many currencies worth differently.And they don‚Äôt pool.,btohqsg
I link Amazon with this credit card.  Is it a correct card?,btohqsg
This is Premier Miles. 1.2 mpd  not 4mpd Name is clearly stated at left corner on the card.,btohqsg
Hi new to miles here. how do you guys usually track your miles earned per card every month? Since I believe the miles amount per every transaction won‚Äôt be reflected right? Any tips would be appreciated,btohqsg
hi all  signed up for the moomoo cash plus promo almost 2 months ago1. is there a way to see the progress of when the 2 months will end exactly on which day on the app?2. how will moomoo top up the difference in return to match the 5.8%?,btohqsg
CRMC = Citi Rewards MasterCard  it‚Äôs not the same as Citi PremierMiles,btohqsg
Msg customer svc. They quite prompt.,btohqsg
U need to look for live agent,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a countdown on the promotion page,btohqsg
Anyone here new to trading? im really new and confuse,btohqsg
What does the FAQ on the website say?,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm currently own CRMC+amaze & HSBC revo credit card. I have a big purchase upcoming. Any other miles card y‚Äôall can recommend?,btohqsg
UOB VS or PPV for 4MPD,btohqsg
Hi guys what do you think of having multiples streams of income even though your main income is stable and how many income streams do you have?,btohqsg
Trading is not easy  often you are to be burned multiple times and still confused,btohqsg
Need more details. How big is the purchase  what mcc  online/offline payment  accepts paywave etc?,btohqsg
For me 1 main income from job  and investment as another streamRest of the time all go to job and family ü§£,btohqsg
What are the investments are you doing sir?,btohqsg
Is it stock market or MMF like that?,btohqsg
Looking to get a engagement ring. So was wondering should i get another card for their welcome reward,btohqsg
Ya sign up bonus is usually a good deal. Can consider UOB Prvi or Citi Presitige  I feel these two are some of the better deals. (Of course you need to go read up and see if you are comfortable with the terms),btohqsg
yea that's what scared me but people make fortunes out of it daily.do you have a youtube recommendation that you go to for this?,btohqsg
Going to be frank. Have u heard of survivorship bias,btohqsg
Any other 4miles per dollar card u would recommend? The only other card i know off is UOB ppv which you would have to spend 1k for 2 consecutive mnths,btohqsg
PPV and Visa Signature are 4mpd cards  but no sign up bonus. Spend 1k for 2 consecutive months is the terms for UOB Prvi Miles welcome bonus.HSBC Revolution is also a good card for every day spend but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs eligible for what you are going to spend on.,btohqsg
"ok i googled it""Survivorship bias is a type of sample selection bias that occurs when an individual mistakes a visible successful subgroup as the entire group""",btohqsg
Ye I mean  I'm not a trader so maybe someone can advise if you wanna go down that road  but do remember that not everyone will be successful.,btohqsg
Oh my bad haha. Yes just check with heymax its a eligible category for hsbc revo however for the first 1k spend only,btohqsg
If you can paywave  then ppv and vs are good. 1.1k on PPV  2k on VS,btohqsg
Hi everyone - I tried to search this in the community here  but couldn‚Äôt find the answer - if I have no relationship with Citi and am trying to get CRMC  I see a signup bonus on Citi site as well as singsaver. If I sign up via singsaver will I get both? Singsaver promo was 300 cash and Citi had 40000 thank you points. Appreciate your help! Thank you,btohqsg
Do you plan to quit your current job and trade daily?,btohqsg
