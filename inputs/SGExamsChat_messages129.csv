FYI: Aftershock doesn't design the machines themselves. They're rebrands of ODM chassis.,btohqsg
Same for a few gaming brands out there,btohqsg
I know it's rebranded from Clevo  but idt Clevo ships internationally  plus I'd like the warranty repair option,btohqsg
Most Clevo-based laptops are solid high performance machines,btohqsg

o we usually only keep one main thread,btohqsg
None of us know the answer@damnu9000. But it's more of the majority üòÇ,btohqsg
My answers are exactly the same. This is like a breather of hope  because I flunked oral and paper 1 HAHA,btohqsg
For me i also flunk oral and paper 1,btohqsg

if anyone needs an extra hi hi pls lead the way,btohqsg
"its more of ""if you ain't in tdp""",btohqsg
i not planning to go until physical events resume,btohqsg
then those who want build portfolio experience mun wtv all cannot la isit,btohqsg
unless they like me go independent,btohqsg
doing that shit online is üí§,btohqsg
MUN ultimately is a social event,btohqsg
what do u prepare or wtv,btohqsg
kek the amt of ppl i knew who dated fellow munners,btohqsg
mun? more like tinder for students,btohqsg
MUN can range from free to hundreds of dollars,btohqsg
then they give u a delegation to represent?,btohqsg
They dont last very long in my observation anyway,btohqsg
i have no good comment on that,btohqsg
i wonder if we have muns with other countries,btohqsg
i imagine that to be superior,btohqsg
the language barrier be difficult enough in intellectual setting,btohqsg
I cant imagine being more personal in that context,btohqsg
i thought english wld be the common language,btohqsg
if a chinese speaking china dude can date an english speaking angmo,btohqsg
cultural gaps really show through what they ask at the forum with GOH,btohqsg
i feel like this was phrased weirdly,btohqsg
but i think yall get it,btohqsg
muns look so intimidating but good,btohqsg
MUN is only good in the moment,btohqsg
The amount of my MUN groups that become occasional ads group tho LOL,btohqsg
Did you have a single lost-lasting friend from MUN?,btohqsg
but he was the note passer,btohqsg
The closest I have is three on instagram that we talk occasionally. Y'know instachains and MUN  well so many of them on my instafeed but I only bother responding to 3,btohqsg
Ok to be fair  some I see more as senior that I admire  but nothing to say,btohqsg
but there are some I'm like questioning why am I still following them,btohqsg
ah  there was one like that,btohqsg
eventually i decided to kick his ass off my ig,btohqsg
overdramatic for his age  simply put,btohqsg
"what is ""elitism"" in 3 letters",btohqsg
Where you roleplay as ambassadors in UN Meetings,btohqsg
so you'll do fine winging it,btohqsg
Oh wait how u get into MUN ah,btohqsg

To write a position paper  you alr research to a certain extent le lah,btohqsg
i went as independent delegate  signed up directly with organisers,btohqsg
my friend went overseas for MUN,btohqsg
like there are good people in MUN,btohqsg
SHE WENT ALL THE WAY TO SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE,btohqsg
but the toxic people negate their influence,btohqsg
when i heard of it i kept my mouth shut but fuck i really wanted to laugh at how... unreasonably dumb the whole thing was,btohqsg
I can't remember any muns further back than thay,btohqsg
i consider that a good thing,btohqsg
It's better to be out  than physically in but socially out,btohqsg
the mental gymnastics to come up with that,btohqsg
the inner MUN circles are notoriously tight and exclusive,btohqsg
its challenging  but i continue to try it anyways,btohqsg
like wouldn't y'all feel left out sometimes,btohqsg
I quit trying after 10 MUNs,btohqsg
its like a funny way for me to see how best i can throw logic out the window,btohqsg
My final two I questioned why am I doing this to myself,btohqsg
In hindsight  I was trying to achieve something that was never possible,btohqsg
but sad thing is I've been in MUN for so long  I dont think it was like that when I first started  I could be naive and unaware in my early days  but I dont think so,btohqsg
wah y'all sound like you've been thru a lot in MUN,btohqsg
omg not that sticker again HAHA,btohqsg
(1) I didn't(2) I just boarded the bus,btohqsg

Is it difficult to do well,btohqsg
Whats so hard about doing a paper,btohqsg
okay did u get your 90rp?,btohqsg
i remember someone having difficulties going uni üëÄ,btohqsg
Even without that I don't think u can get 90rp,btohqsg
Can I ask does anyone have any tips on how to study for Hist? Especially for UN haha,btohqsg
Best is to remember case studies that are chameleons,btohqsg
Meaning  case studies that are applicable to different kinds of question,btohqsg
That will ensure you will have some examples to run a few basic arguments for any question,btohqsg
After you mastered that  then pick out those special case studies that illustrate special cases  that often also mean that they're only useful for one kind of question  so not much strategic returns  but if that particular question comes out you have an ammo for that A,btohqsg
i see you using tele for ns,btohqsg
I did easily get into uni tho,btohqsg
oh right its your head jwjdjwjfn,btohqsg
did u get smth u didnt choose,btohqsg
Also why r u interrogating me,btohqsg
why the sudden change of heart so late on,btohqsg
I dun even know if im able to get in,btohqsg
Thanks for pushing my low self esteem even lower,btohqsg
Then again this economy is big sad if you entering it now,btohqsg
They will have interview if it is too competitive,btohqsg
Gd luck SG road not only one road  despite what many say,btohqsg
Wa so many ppl WADIOing ah,btohqsg

I'm pretty sure they will ask,btohqsg
If you want to join full time after grad,btohqsg
But this kind idt they will say while i'm interning ma,btohqsg
Well i'll just take first if they offer,btohqsg
But the starting pay a bit the crap,btohqsg
Ye well as in  if gov sector pays 5k,btohqsg
And this one only offer 3.2,btohqsg
gov not easy to get in also la,btohqsg
but in this current economy  i think we should be glad if someone extends a job offer to us,btohqsg
Yeah hence I'll take it but I will also go apply elsewhere,btohqsg
If I get then i'll drop,btohqsg
Pay isnt everything imo  i believe the opportunities that comes with it is more impt,btohqsg
ive seen ppl who took a higher paying job,btohqsg
Hehe this one is no life and no pay,btohqsg
paiseh i didnt know it was from Big 4,btohqsg
But you're definitely going into managerial role,btohqsg
I don't know if i'm good at managing people,btohqsg
Just instantiate them as py objs and add attribs as necessary ez/s,btohqsg
Aha ya i ask the perms,btohqsg
its great to seek advice from seniors,btohqsg
Well it's gonna be low pay no life grind and i'm not sure if i'll enjoy managing ppl in the future so given a choice i'll apply elsewhere,btohqsg
