Good read this one to identify potentials of NFT gamingMain takes:1) Major video game publishers Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive are digging deeper into theNFTgaming space with today’s announcement ofa $40 million Series A roundraised by Horizon  the developer behind NFT-driven competitive card game Skyweaver.2) Take-Two  meanwhile  recently acquired mobile and casual game maker Zynga  which is currently working on NFT-driven games. In January  Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnickspecifically cited “Web3 opportunities”on the horizon  which he said the combined company would be better positioned to tackle.3) However  many in the Web3 space—fromdeveloperstomarketplace builders—believe that NFTs will eventually take hold in the video game industry due to prospective benefits for players and creators alike.#vividthreecomestomindSource:https://decrypt.co/111215/ubisoft-take-two-ethereum-nft-game-maker-horizon,btohqsg

🎉Pika World FOMC Minutes Review – 13 October 2022🎉💣No Fed pivot in the near term🔫The latest FOMC minutes dashed away hopes that the Fed will move away from an aggressive rate hike. Instead  the minutes discussed the risks of the current elevated inflation  which are mounting. Indeed  the cost of not taking bold steps now will lead to a higher price in the future.There has also been a note that any premature departure in monetary tightening that aims to tame inflation tend to lead to unfavourable outcome based on the historical standard.🎯Pain ahead still on the way💸Uncle Powell has also spoken in recent times  referencing historical occurrences of ending the fight against inflation too early. He had on several occasions acknowledged the pain  such as higher unemployment and reduction in economic output. Yet  these are the by-product of the necessity of actions to hold inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.💎Some doses of dovish  but hawkish remains🗽There have also been some light-hearted comments that the collective rate hikes may bring down economic demand more than required  given that policy tends to have a lag time. As such  a timely calibration of policy stance may be warranted in a rate hike to alleviate the risk of downside risk to the economy.This helps to give indices some level of support in a relatively muted trading session.📮What’s on the menu today?📖The highlight of the week  which we all have been waiting for  has arrived.Core CPI data will be released at 8.30 pm  and we should see moderate growth of 0.5% from 0.6%.Initial jobless claim data will be released simultaneously  and we can expect a modest climb to 225K from 219K.It is 13 October  Thursday  at 9.10 am in Singapore and 9.10 pm in New York. Let us hope for a good set of CPI data to provide a dose of relief and smiles to all friends of Pika World.,btohqsg
