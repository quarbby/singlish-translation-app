Very lost  seems like there‚Äôs alot of good credit cards  so what is the heuristics of picking the ideal card for myself?,btohqsg
like picking the right spouse.. MANY CONSIDERATIONS!,btohqsg
My M1 and starhub bills are charged to UOB One card by default :),btohqsg
I can hit the $600 without my telco bills so I going to use it for my UOB One. I also use atome if possible so when months i cannot hit $600 i will pay my atome bill off,btohqsg
why no love for Maybank telco category 8%?,btohqsg
Personally  I apply the risks vs rewards method to select cards in consideration of administrative overheads.That's why I do not sign up cards for the sake of sign up freebies unless the freebies are really attractive!,btohqsg
so strange  should get bonus cashback for online if u paid monthly via singtel website/app. For Giga heard that it is online even if recurring bill payment via Giga app.,btohqsg
nope. it counts towards your $600 min but doesn't give you cashback,btohqsg
I do get get my bonus cashback for singtel when I paid via singtel app,btohqsg
Just to confirm - did u observe over a period of two statement months to confirm that there is no cashback?,btohqsg
KFC O.R. Twister meal for just $3!üôè Trust Bank Code: HUQPC614https://www.trustbank.sg- No min spend required- Present TRUST card at KFC counter and order before 10:45 AM- While stocks lastüëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
based on my calculation over two months yes there is no cashback. on top of that i spoke to DBS yesterday and they told me so.,btohqsg
did u check the mcc and payment mode via dbs ibanking chatbot?,btohqsg
like i said. i spoke to the DBS spokeperson and confirmed based on the transaction i made.,btohqsg
hi  if you dont mind sharing  did the DBS CSA share what is the MCC for giga?,btohqsg
Got it =) DBS does not control the MCC of the merchant(such as Giga). The MCC is matter between the merchant and the card company. Knowing the MCC helps us understand the 'why' but it doesn't change the prospect of cashback.,btohqsg
i had called DBS again to request for a breakdown. i just want to understand a little bit more. i want to maximise but i am not very particular about that few cents difference,btohqsg
so based on my calculation I am within plus minus 30cents  which in my opinion good enough. but i just want to know more,btohqsg
let me get back to you on this coz i am waiting for them to call me back with the breakdown,btohqsg
anyway I just want to thanks those who helped. appreciated!,btohqsg
Giga will earn 10x for crmc paired with amaze tried and tested,btohqsg
I guess can't use dbs live fresh to pay for zero1 to get the 5% then ):,btohqsg
The more you call for details  the more they investigate n found out  then more nerfs will be announced in the future. üòÇ,btohqsg
breakdown including the MCC and payment mode? If not easier that u can chat these via ibanking chatbot. If online and mcc is telco  no reason that u not getting the 5%.,btohqsg
yeah actually i support this..should not call banks to ask.. just try to reconcile manually or ask in chats...if unsure  just avoid. Don't go and ask for black and white or ask they investigate this and that.,btohqsg
A lot of Nerf announced past few months were the results of people calling banks to investigate for rewards/cashback  ask for details‚Ä¶.  etc‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Just present and pay using card can Liao Ah? That time other kfc promo  the cashier ask me order from app. Very troublesome,btohqsg
Call into Bank...I read your TNC say buy voucher cannot qualify  but I hear from Internet People that they buy voucher and can qualify  can you check and confirm for me please?,btohqsg
I support that  too. I design my questions to check on transaction around their terms and conditions. Included/Excluded. If excluded  why it is excluded?I personally won't dive into details like asking for MCC code of a merchant because that won't change the outcome.,btohqsg
oh i am the other way leh.. i only ask for MCC code from UOB chat service when I'm unsure.I won't ask them to clarify anything about their TNC...,btohqsg
If you want MCC‚Ä¶ remember Max? üòªüòçHeymax.ai,btohqsg
I see :) I prefer to call. I'm not clarifying their TnC. I'm checking on my transaction. From data point angle  it would be under a generic category 'check transaction'.Thankful I learn from this community that there are chat bots and AI tools.,btohqsg
I call and check my transaction. I don‚Äôt question the cashback and I don‚Äôt dispute it. What is given to me is given. I just want to understand. If they are gonna nerf  they will nerf it eventually without you doing a single thing. So I don‚Äôt get why you shouldn‚Äôt call to understand more about your transactions.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt ask why certain thing is include while others doesn‚Äôt. I just want to know based on my spending what was excluded. That‚Äôs all.,btohqsg
because when u call in to check on your transactions  the bank may discover a transaction that should not qualify for rewards  actually are qualifying now due to system error.,btohqsg
I am sure if I don‚Äôt do it  someone else will. Like i said  if they want to nerf it  they will nerf it eventually. They are bank. They ain‚Äôt stupid.,btohqsg
That's also the posture I take. The intent is for my call to be classified as 'checking transaction'.Customers are fully entitled to checking their transactions. This is also a MAS requirement to include good and easy to use service to aid customers to check on their transactions.Calling the bank vs self check channel  do not make fundamental difference as long as the Ask from customer is related to 'checking of transaction'.,btohqsg
Yes! I am checking to understand my spending better. So I can make the best decision on which card to use for which merchant. Honestly cashback is just something extra. Even if certain things is being excluded doesn‚Äôt affect my spending.,btohqsg
Yeah giga abit weird. Pay thru app or apple pay also dont count into the card‚Äôs cashback/reward. Last time when i used SC Spree also same thing.,btohqsg
What? So I don't get 4mpd on my HSBC Revo even if it's google pay?,btohqsg
What you asking?Anyway if you asking abt paying utilities/telco with HSBC revo  defo no 4MPD irregardless if you go through Google pay  it‚Äôs not on the whitelist for 10x points bro,btohqsg
Yeah. Only get the base rewards of the card you hold.,btohqsg
i think someone mentioned above CRMC+Amaze can,btohqsg
just looked thru UOB ONE and EVOL T&C...seems like it doesnt exclude giga MCC also,btohqsg
Not sure if the following website will help you or not.https://heymax.ai/v2/search/Giga%20telco?useVisaApi=false&country=all,btohqsg
hm  Giga can pay using contactless?,btohqsg
i see giga accepts amex now so maybe amex tcb can be a alternative also,btohqsg
1.7% is UOB absolute...but yeah shd be can,btohqsg
no what i meant is why only aim 1.7% rewards for paying telcos?,btohqsg
i mean...to each his own. I'm just curious what cards dont exclude and therefore can earn more than just the base rate,btohqsg
