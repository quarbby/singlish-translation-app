Forget about the E man 500 is crazy,btohqsg
I thought that was a 718 until I saw the height,btohqsg
Aren't there only like 186 in the world,btohqsg
is this the daytona violet unit?,btohqsg
the singapore edition or whichever it was,btohqsg
they made 10 Individual specs in 2015 iinw,btohqsg
just did some light research. the M4s were called Performance Editions,btohqsg
It will come up as performance edition i think,btohqsg
can't say that this is the exact one though.,btohqsg
usually theres a small wording at the passenger side,btohqsg
should be etched into the trim,btohqsg
so rlly cnt tell if sg edt or nt,btohqsg
they came stock with a small wing on the back and style 666s,btohqsg
the wing blade says m performance,btohqsg
but they're relatively easy to get rid of when the owner starts modding,btohqsg
so ig plates  vin and that etched trimpiece should tell all,btohqsg
i js feel sg edt just look at the interior enough alr,btohqsg
alot of stuff inside the car which cant be bought aftermarket,btohqsg
iinw one unit was modded to hell and back,btohqsg
not all ah bt i think cn understand what im trying to say ig,btohqsg
what happen to the green unit tho,btohqsg
is the yellow sg edt owned by arthur wong ?,btohqsg
cs he literally has every m performance parts,btohqsg
No his one LCI comp only,btohqsg

it’s best to observe from a distance and not interfere with nature,btohqsg
so wide and the wing is hella huge,btohqsg
I nearly got attacked by a wild monkey before cos apparently my friend accidentally got too close to it and it felt threatened  so it nearly attacked us,btohqsg
Monkeys can carry rabies and transmit it via bites.,btohqsg
oh dang i remember a monkey stealing my food and i stole it back,btohqsg
Basically if u see any wild monkey  stay away from it,btohqsg
Oh fuck  hope u didn't get attacked,btohqsg
'I beg you. Please  please': S'pore sec school boy negotiates with 2 monkeys to return his school bag -Mothership.SG- News from Singapore  Asia and around the worldhttps://mothership.sg/2022/02/schoolboy-macaques-bag/,btohqsg
Kind of shows a big problem,btohqsg
The monkeys have been fed before by humans so they associate bag = free food,btohqsg
In some countries like the US  they actually had to put down bears who were fed by humans  because they got trained into humans = free food and went after them,btohqsg
and i got my food back so im happy,btohqsg
I don't understand why would some people feed wild animals thinking they are pets  they don't know the consequences of feeding wild animals,btohqsg
The only way to get a auto transmission Evo IX,btohqsg
EVO IX sedan came with 5MT for the RS and 6MT for the GSR,btohqsg
The Evo IX Wagon came with either 6MT or 5AT,btohqsg
Woah damn the place somehow a bit familiar  looks like it's at amk ave 3 or smth,btohqsg
Omg it's somewhere near my place,btohqsg
Some old pics of an Evo IX Wagon at Anime Festival Asia 2010,btohqsg

SG is full of sour grape Karens who have this mentality that I CANNOT AFFORD A CAR SO I MUST MAKE THE LIVES OF CAR OWNERS AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE,btohqsg
Friend of mine left behind to me a whole bunch of hot wheel 1:24 cars,btohqsg

My friend will rather they go to someone who will open them up to display  then to end up in salvation army bin,btohqsg
Anyone know where to get cheap Michelin tire  my car tire was punctured,btohqsg
Michelin anywhere isn't going to be very cheap either way,btohqsg
If you want to tide over until ur next proper tire change  just buy a pair of 2nd hand tires to replace the punctured + the one on the other side,btohqsg
cheap and michelin don't gel well.,btohqsg
if you're getting Primacys  those aren't cheap too 🤣,btohqsg
Not sure need to check the car but it’s just a regular sedan,btohqsg
i would say bridgestones are decent la,btohqsg
Saw the brand on the ruptured tire is Michelin and I’m assuming that I gotta get the exact same brand so that they can still service the car every year,btohqsg
Generally speaking if say u puncture front right tire for example  you just replace that tire + front left tire,btohqsg
one traffic light to the next you set a PB,btohqsg
If normal bnb sedan like corolla  just almost any tire will do,btohqsg
But I scared that if I don’t get the exact same Michelin tire it came with they will refuse to service the car,btohqsg
I don't think that's how it works bro,btohqsg
Tire isn't part of car warranty,btohqsg
Its like u change your phone case they won't service your phone?,btohqsg
according to apple they'll sue you,btohqsg
Rim ya maybe  some car dealership are arse that way,btohqsg
I remember motor image sg u buy wrx  I heard u change rim = void warranty,btohqsg
are there stuff at millennial walk car park,btohqsg
still maintained by motorimage for quite awhile,btohqsg
Maybe they changed the policy later on,btohqsg
tbf they flip prata w.r.t their warranties,btohqsg
I heard it was damn basterd during the GDB-F/GRB days,btohqsg
ours was an 06 Leggy so,btohqsg
plant one mentally deranged xdd to chase down the owners there with unlimited data and a shitty android phone and u have your 24h cam,btohqsg
he message a lot of people,btohqsg
he is just being nice man  if you dont like him just ignore? or block?,btohqsg
he even said sorry for bothering ...I dont get the issue?,btohqsg
tell us what we don't get,btohqsg
There is a lack of kindness in this world  and when people try to step out of their way to be nice and welcoming this is what they get in return,btohqsg
some idiot wants the admin to kick someone out just because the eprson wajted to welcome him and say hi??,btohqsg
we've got alot of reports about this user alr,btohqsg
basically every single person that joins he dms,btohqsg
but what did he do that's what im curious about,btohqsg
Welcoming someone with a DM is fine,btohqsg
how else do u welcome someone?,btohqsg
A bit creepy to me but fine,btohqsg
i think there was worse but he toned down la,btohqsg
Unless he tried to like harass someone,btohqsg
"bro probably said ""yoooo welcome in""🤣🤣🤣🤣",btohqsg
u lot settle it amongst yourselves,btohqsg
How much for 3.2 litre VR6 from Volkswagen Golf R32,btohqsg
@Mxitlxndtry not to dm every single person that joins esp if you dk them,btohqsg
My bad  I'll try and refrain from this,btohqsg
Hi everyone! Check out this place for diecastLike and comment on the video 🫶,btohqsg
The first one of these I've seen in SG. They should bring more in  beautiful cars imo.,btohqsg
they COULD have brought more in,btohqsg
but very little demand for these unfortunately,btohqsg
most of the Genesis we have here would've been management units.,btohqsg
komoco management uses ioniq 6 nowadays?,btohqsg
i know one of the 5Ns belongs to someone higher up,btohqsg
Those cars are also quite striking. Catches my eye more than the Taycans and other electric cars.,btohqsg
saw the demo runs at TAS this year. Taniguchi hooned the i5N around like it was just another hot hatch,btohqsg
Instant torque from the electric motors ah,btohqsg
was thrown around as if it was 1.7/1.8 tbh,btohqsg
Yeah  that's one thing a lot of reviewers agree on as well. Helps mask the weight of the car,btohqsg
my friends who were given the press cars at launch loved it,btohqsg
they were flown out to Hyundai to test it  glowing reviews,btohqsg
I haven't heard a bad thing about it from any reviews also  only some complain about the fake engine sound being pumped into the cabin,btohqsg
But iirc  can just turn off,btohqsg
the fake shifting seems fun tbh,btohqsg
but if given a choice between a normal EV or one with the option to fake shift i'd take the latter,btohqsg
Gives the car more character too,btohqsg
best 2 car solution is 2 genesis,btohqsg
i didn't say which genesis tho,btohqsg
Hi everyone! 👋I’m new to the automotive world and just started out as a sales consultant about a month ago!I wanted to share a quick video of one of the cars I’m currently selling.Would love for you to check out my first video:https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSMJhTjT3/If you enjoy it  feel free to drop a like and follow! No pressure  but your support would mean a lot to me as I’m getting started.Thank you so much in advance and I hope you like the video!😊,btohqsg
oh i think i saw this on the road recently,btohqsg
but anyways admin team will clear this. please read our chat description or clear promotions with admins in advance,btohqsg
sweet. just a heads up to run through potential sales posts with us before you post next time!,btohqsg
Ohh okay i see! Sorry for missing this out🙏,btohqsg
People will rather buy an Mercedes E class with zero options  then buy a fully optioned Genesis,btohqsg
It's also the same reason you don't see too many Honda Accords on sg roads,btohqsg
For the price  people rather buy C180 with nothing inside,btohqsg
we got our family merc for the high ARF,btohqsg
It's not really a sg specific problem,btohqsg
In the US and Europe same thjng,btohqsg
The Genesis is hard to sell vs what it competes with in their market,btohqsg
ask to follow his ig but doesn't follow back,btohqsg
Ah shit my bad I was busy that time so I forgotten  but I can follow back,btohqsg
if it's an actual B7 those are properly rapid,btohqsg
it looks like the real deal,btohqsg
won't know until you run the plates ig,btohqsg
how complete life would be owning a lamborghini svj with gintani exhaust 😌,btohqsg
I think he's a 185cm Lamborghini Murciélago Connoisseur,btohqsg
bruh its from a book on censorship,btohqsg
then you give me back the 7.40 lor,btohqsg
sorry dah beli bende dgn $7.40 tu,btohqsg
excuse me its in the scm rulebook ofc i need to censor ok! 🤓,btohqsg
looks like a type r man,btohqsg
Whats so special abt it lol looks ordinary to me,btohqsg
"it is ultimately ""just a civic"" to many lor",btohqsg
having driven many FD2Rs and FK8s the engineering behind one is what makes it special,btohqsg
tho i dont like fk8 look :/,btohqsg
