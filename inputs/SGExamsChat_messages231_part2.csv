How hard will to be to enter CHS now,btohqsg
in fact in the grand scheme of things your a lvl cert only useful to wipe butt,btohqsg
took A Levels in 2015; can confirm this is true.In fact I don't even state my A levels education on resume for job applications; for some applications  didn't even submit the A level cert... still manage to get an interview,btohqsg
Lol job applications for me only ask for resume and transcript and cover letter (optional)  and the interviewer don't even look at your transcript,btohqsg
watch ur back from now on !!! üêîüêîüêî,btohqsg
btw guys i need some... advice,btohqsg
so im moving onto my y3 in poly and like as time goes by i realise that science is just not for me  i would really rather be doing something else  so my gpa is rly fked up like it's just super average and i definitely cannot go big 3 uni la you know that type of thing,btohqsg
but i DO want to go to uni and major in something that is not science-related  like English which i've had my eye on for a while now,btohqsg
does anyone hv experience or know if it will be possible for me to do English for example when my 'science' results are just not good? or do u think it doesnt matter and i cant go to uni anyway ü•¥ü§™ü§£üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
will they have like entry based on aptitude & interest like a poly EAE,btohqsg
how bad is bad? ntu english 3.2-3.3ish still got chance,btohqsg
Idk I just saying no ban to both sides,btohqsg
Hope U didn't see what I said hehe,btohqsg
Dun ban him cuz he is a precious boi,btohqsg
make to png or smth like without white background,btohqsg
so like the picture like the logo becomes the logo itself,btohqsg
There is an app that just remove background,btohqsg
make new image on gimpselect transparent background in optionspaste the original image tou want to to edit  as new layerremove background,btohqsg
hi im so sorry this is so random does anyone happen to know where to find those thick glass noodles  its thicker n bigger than kwayteow one,btohqsg
tqsm!! been craving this for years,btohqsg
There's a stall outside one of the exits of Chinatown MRT,btohqsg
ouhh then nope im looking for glass noodle kind,btohqsg
basically i can go chinatown there shud be able to find right,btohqsg
u can go to yuehwa building also,btohqsg
that place sells mostly products straight from china,btohqsg
Why not just give them actual books,btohqsg
will they be willing to read books on their own time?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre the typical Singaporean student,btohqsg
ie if you call it homework they will do,btohqsg
and is the vocab the problem or reading?,btohqsg
cos sometimes they know the word verbally but they cannot recognize the word,btohqsg
I also tutor now but a sec 3 kid  usually promising incentives like bubble tea to them gets them to do the work but after awhile the incentives also no use,btohqsg
and also  can they read it phonetically?,btohqsg
but they just don't understand the meaning,btohqsg
I‚Äôm ok with spending $3 on their bubble tea for the sake of my blood pressure stabilising abit during tuition,btohqsg
Oh I didn‚Äôt know there was actually a term for this kind of thing,btohqsg
so they can read the word just by the spelling? but dont understand what the word means?,btohqsg
You could actually pick out a compre passage and make the student go through it with a highlighter,btohqsg
And highlight the words they don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
they should be able to somewhat pronounce the word,btohqsg
Then slowly go through the words highlighted and that‚Äôs 20 mins vocab session done,btohqsg
It really helped when I was in primary school,btohqsg
if u want to give homework  you can just pick out a few compre passages  and make them go back and use a dictionary to find out the meaning of the words,btohqsg
try not to make the tutees too dependent on you and make u feed them answers,btohqsg
yea this is a really efficient way to do it  altho you shld be careful abt the difficulty of the passage or else later they will become reluctant to attend classes/do work,btohqsg
yep  just steal passages from p2 assessment books i guess,btohqsg
p1 is fine also if you feel the tutee is at a p1 level,btohqsg
i used to tutor this p2 girl  i was using k2 books...,btohqsg
Alternatively if you‚Äôll like to keep the students attention you can try snipping excerpts from children story books,btohqsg
But be careful ah some books are really not appropriate also,btohqsg
