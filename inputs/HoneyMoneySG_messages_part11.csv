Have a bit of arkk as well,btohqsg
Wow 3 years... I'm not sure I can tolerate that üòÇ SG retis have been terrible recently. More specifically syfe. Because they say they track S RETI. I'm not sure if I shld just shift to getting specific retis like mapletree logistics and industrial on tiger... Too much diversification isnt good...,btohqsg
"Ya. Cos daily monitoring of stock price on tiger will go crazy. Especially recently when Facebook and Nike ""crashed"". All the gains wiped. Seems like will take very long to recover",btohqsg
although some business are great  but need to also take note of the valuations  if it is overpriced  then will take longer to breakeven.,btohqsg
Yes I have ARKK ARKQ ARKW ARKG ARKF in 1 portfoilio in syfe. let's see how Kathie wood does lor. I mean if active ETF can outperform passive ETF I won't mind üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeah I use to have like 15 REITs plus other blue chip traps before i condense to just 5 now  and shift the rest to US markets. They all had a pretty good run until 2020 Mar,btohqsg
For me and my partner I don't wanna monitor so much our joint account,btohqsg
haha sometimes is better not to look... not to monitor especailly for ETFs.. the less you do  the less mistakes. keep it there  let it work for u,btohqsg
And invested abit in arkk as well,btohqsg
Just need 3 etfs:World indexS&p500Nasdaq 100Good to go for long term,btohqsg
Arkk is just to test Cathy's investment acumen,btohqsg
Her etfs are too fast moving. Need more monitoring than vwra lol,btohqsg
I got things like: VTI  RSP  QQQ  VTV  ARKK  SDY on syfe. Aren't too shabby isn't it? Mainly 100% US market tho  I don't want China üòÇ esp after what happened on Monday,btohqsg
Yeah she was goddess of 2020  not so much in 2021 for her picks,btohqsg
Yes I intend to buy and hold. Don't want to monitor. No time for that. But is true that if u lumpsum into syfe  can never achieve the projected gains compared to DCA?,btohqsg
Another thing about ARK is the high expense ratio of about 0.79% if I'm not wrong. One thing about syfe is that they don't disclose that this expense ratio is paid on top and over their 0.65% charge. Means it's really expensive to hold etf on syfe. Yet  if u get etf on tiger  it's 1 unit as mentioned . Means no transferring out halfway  and it's all about timing market and guessing when to sell which defeats the purpose of passive investing,btohqsg
Yupp  unless u buy 10 units  sell afew units when u feel its overpriced or a correction is going to happen? Haha that's why for passive investment   I feel it's always easier to buy the dip rather than timing when to sell and buy back.. easier to buy when low rather than constantly trying to time the market trying to beat it.. as mentioned the more u do  more susceptible to mistakes. In the end   better off just holding to until one day u decided on a better investment opportunity or if its a stock.. if the fundamentals changed.. its time to sell off.,btohqsg
yup i think ARK is a hype ETF eh.,btohqsg
but if i dont buy into the hype and it really isnt a hype etf  then it's a waste haha,btohqsg
ARK is so 2020. Long dead in 2021. So what's the latest hype ETF now again? üòÇüòÇ Nothing can beat tried and tested ETFs like SPY and VTI. the track record shows,btohqsg
Anyway knows the difference between hype ETF Vs momentum investing? (MTUM)?,btohqsg
tried and tested also can include VWRA and IWDA i suppose?,btohqsg
Haven't really heard of them b4. I'm more into vanguard  nasdaq and Invesco,btohqsg
^ regarding the poll  the reason why I like honey money cos it's honest review of portfoilios.Didn't have a good experience with some other YouTubers (not naming who) who said things like it's a good time to invest in retis when inflation rises. Not true at all- just see the syfe retis Portfolio. Crashed worse than equity 100.,btohqsg
Excluded Chicken Genius Singapore as he is less active now.,btohqsg
I believe people follow kelvin also because his content is quite relatable as well? Like other are mostly in financial industry if I am not wrong?,btohqsg
Thanks GY. Not speaking on behalf on others but sometimes we must understand that Content Creator job is to create content and generate sales. But whether it is content with integrity  that makes the difference,btohqsg
And he is also rather entertaining   reusing recycling cold jokes... over and over again. But still quite funny..,btohqsg
üëçüëç true! But a lot of them once they are more well known they get blinded by greed,btohqsg
for investing  best to follow those that show their live trading account.,btohqsg
i mean this apply to all kind of youtuber/influencers,btohqsg
He says.. if we burn.. he burns more,btohqsg
he go holiday liao ytd last video in that studio lol,btohqsg
Maybe he go find Elon Mars ah hahah,btohqsg
haha actually a bit scary all eggs in one basket. of course if huat then huat big. but what happens if Elon end up like Steve.,btohqsg
True conviction towards tesla   at least he made a stand,btohqsg
CGS is very extreme and has strong personality  thats why he have lots of followers (and haters at the same time). But unless you have deep pockets like him  it is rrally a big bet,btohqsg
Oh yeah. Kevin is really good and relatble also. And also very up to date. Like he will explain about the latest developments like the evergrande within the week of the development.,btohqsg
Ya agreed  he did lots of research and have strong conviction towards tesla. If it's me I cannot sleep at night hahaha,btohqsg
Hahah if cannot sleep can call him  he will scold u  not to be donkey,btohqsg
all of you follow him all eggs into tesla also?,btohqsg
Hahah don't have a deep pocket,btohqsg
I didnt know of him then. Now that tesla is alrdy up.. haha will follow him on his other stocks instead,btohqsg
"Kevin likes to make funny jokes about how ETF is like picking cai fan and say funny ""orhorr"" jokes sometimes. But I subscribe to more than just him ah. Support local channels",btohqsg
don't need deep pocket cause US can buy fractional shares. but if anyone dare all eggs into one stock  I Salute him or her.,btohqsg
I currently own Tesla through ETF in syfe. Not through individual stock  cos it's abit too voliatle for my liking.,btohqsg
now buy fish at cai fan stall will think of him hahaha,btohqsg
tiger I not sure but ibkr can,btohqsg
His jokes always reuse and recycle,btohqsg
Kevin's mind:25% fish - ARKK25% veg- VTI25% potato- SPY25% seafood- VOOThere u go! Custom portfoilio!,btohqsg
