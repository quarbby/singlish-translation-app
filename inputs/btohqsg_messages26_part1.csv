Today my friend also struggling with this,btohqsg
No  it is not new to me cos my 1st hfe (that expire 11 Sep) was asked to upload payslip  this one i got approval after 1month.I had already put up my 2nd hfe 1mth ago (ie. In Aug  together with payslip) n i got the approval within 3days.So you need to submit so that hdb can expedite the process of your hfe.,btohqsg
Wat was Ur queue number within flat supply?,btohqsg
Way out of supply but got scheduled for appointment. Queue 285 out of 175,btohqsg
Auto email and sms sent to first applicant. Today late morning like 11plus last chinese slot taken.. ard 1230pm got notified,btohqsg
We did not send any email.,btohqsg
Hmm ok.. i didnt recall about upload payslip,btohqsg
Shld have chance based on dropout rate for thc. Good luck.. my is way far out of supply,btohqsg
My opinion:If both of u are Chinese then you need to choose Chinese.But if you have a choice to choose either chinese or others  & if you are thinking easy to sell of course is Chinese but don't forget it is harder to get a unit becos of ethnic distribution ratio.,btohqsg
But I think it is neither here nor there cos might be just few units to choose  worst if the available unit left with 11units (i have mind set on my budget  so price  floor etc are my priority  if the balance 11 units are outside my budget  I cannot take  cant take n cant waive no selection)..  If less than 10 then can ask for waiver. Right?,btohqsg
Someone in chencharu telegram chat just tried asking for waiver when theres 13units for an earlier bto. Outcome not out yet.,btohqsg
Do you think there'll be more bto launches in Yishun?,btohqsg
Will have on next yr.Chenchuru is the 1st project at that areas  and more to come next few yrs . U can read the news on that site planning etc....,btohqsg
I'll suggest u if u want to BTO  please apply for every launch  is not just u want yishun u will definitely get a Q number right.Can't be next project Yishun is on next yr Q2 or Q4 u wait till then what,btohqsg
The rest of the projects will be in chencharu too?,btohqsg
This is true. Still deciding on some factors. Thanks!,btohqsg
Chencharu will likely be their focus over the next launches.. but if you look at the map shared  Yishun still have some random empty plots here and there (yellow plot). Not sure if gazetted for residential or not,btohqsg
Ooo thanks for sharing the information,btohqsg
Just to check:if holding a Q number within supply  can still apply for next project that just launched but before your turn to choose from the 1st project?(I understand if your Q nber is outside supply  you can apply for next project when it is launched).,btohqsg
So the system does not allow me to submit? Or if I submit my 1st one be cancelled n the Q number for the 2nd project is still tbc.,btohqsg
Hi can i check if anything related to HPS can be ignored for those who fully paid for the new hdb bto without applying for any monthly cpf loan ?,btohqsg
If don‚Äôt tk loan  must pay in full during which appt?,btohqsg
That if your HFE state you can't take HDB loan,btohqsg
System wont allow u to submit,btohqsg
I see  ok noted. Thanks to all.,btohqsg
Ok another scenario:After I submitted for Oct bto launch   there is a SBF launch in Nov. I haven't given a Q number yet for the Oct bto that I submitted  can I still submit for Nov SBF?,btohqsg
Usually sbf is launched tgt with btos (im not sure about this anymore though),btohqsg
Don't have this scenario. Because SBF only one time per year. As it comes together w BTO Launch together as per last time data .And u know why now BTO 3 times and 1 time SBF ? Is because they know by the time your BTO results out next SBF launch sure u know your previous results already,btohqsg
So your assumption won't happen.Your OCT BTO Launch already results sure out before next yr February if next SBF is in Feb 2025,btohqsg
As a matter of fact  no more sbf this yr so confirmed 101% your OCT results will be out before next yr sbf launch,btohqsg
Oh I see. Cos I thought I saw something like SBF in Nov 2024 (may be last one for this year?) and Feb 2025 (one abd only going forward?).Ok thanks for the info. If I happen to see the news article I will share here.,btohqsg
Nope only one SBF from this year onwards,btohqsg
Ok thanks all  I guess what I saw was an old article. üëç,btohqsg
Luckily I joined this chat group  I get advise from you all  really appreciate as the  advise from you guys here  definiely clear my doubts & help me for better planning.  You guys are good. üëç,btohqsg
Curious to find out if anyone has inputs to this:Husband - main owner of BTOWife - occupier of BTOIn future if buying another property under Wife‚Äôs name (occupier of BTO only)  does that mean Wife is considered as 0 ownership of property and hence no ABSD on future property?,btohqsg
Thank you for the info! I guess its more of trust here if spouse is ok with this arrangement of being an occupier only?,btohqsg
Yup. Do note that the spouse with the ownership can kick the other spouse out at anytime legally.,btohqsg
Huge risk there. Thank u btw appreciate!,btohqsg
HDB doesnt allow decoupling now though,btohqsg
At least thats what the staff told us when we went to sign papers üòÇ,btohqsg
What u mean doesn‚Äôt allow? Thought we can choose who is the owner and the spouse as occupier?,btohqsg
yes can but the asbd thingy is not allowed,btohqsg
Not referring to 99 to 1 ratio for the private property,btohqsg
Was mentioning in future the next property buy under 1 spouse name (100% ownership) of next property,btohqsg
Hi  just checking  will first timer be void forever if you choose to miss after getting the ballot?,btohqsg
The sbf for 2024 is over already on Feb 2024,btohqsg
Next yr sbf not sure which month  wait for hdb give info..For my pov  go try for Oct BTO first.,btohqsg
i'd think might need pay absd or smth too better to clarify with hdb,btohqsg
There should be a 1 year cooldown (2nd priority) when you discard your number that is purely within range of supply.,btohqsg
If you don't select when you get the chance to (ie when you're called down for appt and there are still units you can choose from  but you don't go for the appt) 1. All existing applications will be voided2. You will be considered 2nd timer for 1 year,btohqsg
