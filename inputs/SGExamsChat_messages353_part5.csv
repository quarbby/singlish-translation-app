now we are waiting for SEAB to scan the paper to us,btohqsg
I mean SEAB to scan the candidates answer to us,btohqsg
idk exactly but I roughly know what they tested,btohqsg
QNS:#1: Surds (find value of a  b and c)#2: θ is an acute angle  cotθ=8/15  find cosec2θ#3a: find dydx by product rule and find the value of _the letter_ (i forgot)#3b: explain why x=2 is an Inflextion point and determine the nature of the other turning pt (I got x=-4/3 and max pt)#4a: factorise x³-k³#4b: factorise (I forgot the exact expression)#4c: x³-k³=(forgotten expression)  eqn has only 1 real root  (I forgot what they ask us but I rmb it's 6m)#5a: using 3θ=2θ+θ  show that (trigo expression #1) = (trigo expression #2)#5b: find roots of (trigo expression #2)=(a number I forgot) [There are 3 solutions within the range btw]------------------------------------[Qn6  problem solving qn]: water freeze and turn into ice  (dydt) [I thought this was rate of change at first lol]#6a: given that dydt=(this)  find y in terms of k#6b[ice is safe to stake on at (I forgot depth distance)] :ice was initially at 1cm ice was (forgot another depth dist) at (this time) find the time when it is safe to skate on the ice--------------------------------Qn7 [this one legit santa clause give us 8m]: y=(smth)  2 x values are given  tangent at x= these 2 points meet at point P  find point P (intersection pt)#8a: show that the line does not intersect/touch (can't rmb) with the circle#8b: find the coordinate of a point from the line that is closest the circle and find the shortest distance between the centre coordinate and that pointQn9 (another giveaway)#9a: show that (x-4) is a factor of (expression; f(x))#9b: solve for f(x)=0#9c: I forgot but I think it was another eqn and then I had to link it to f(x) and solve it#9d(idk aso actually): explain how many are there In the 3rd eqn (basically the 1st eqn but replace x with sinθ),btohqsg
I give u all chance only,btohqsg
I’m just interested in the circles qn,btohqsg
heard many student found it hard,btohqsg
I thought you don’t have qn ppr,btohqsg
Urmm for circle what they said was,btohqsg
There was two points on the circle X=3 and 5,btohqsg
Then the tangent at the points will intersect at point P,btohqsg
ok that part v ez but what about the other part,btohqsg
Next question was find. Length of point P to centre of circle,btohqsg
I put infinite solution for 9d cos no range given HAHAH,btohqsg
in a nutshell: p2 was easy to the point that even I can do it,btohqsg
what was the hardest qn iyo,btohqsg
but is just that the question u all nvr see before,btohqsg
ye for o lvl students it should be very easy,btohqsg
but that trigo solving qn was the tricky one in p1,btohqsg
OK ah. need to think harder,btohqsg
"basically I simplified the expression to...(sinθ-4)(sinθ+2)(sinθ+8)=0I wrote""since there is no range given and trigonometric graphs are infiniteTherefore  there are infinite solutions""",btohqsg
that mhm was not meant for this,btohqsg
cos they asked how many solutions,btohqsg
you sure no domain given ah,btohqsg
I shud have wrote 3 roots sia but idkzzz,btohqsg
"they js asked ""number of roots"" oni",btohqsg
I dowan say anything until I see qn HAHAH,btohqsg
actually won't share the paper here.,btohqsg
Is getting fat from project work normal,btohqsg
taking H2 math make me fat.,btohqsg
just vectors a bit jialat rn,btohqsg
took me 2 years to understand,btohqsg
you need emb3 <12 and all grade 3 or above right,btohqsg
I mean next year if u go sec5 can eae also rite,btohqsg
yep ik I was from na,btohqsg
it's another hard thing to do,btohqsg
all the interviews and the writing,btohqsg
I mean honestly I feel like q ok ah if u go sec5.. js try eae den average C5 can alr,btohqsg
you have a course in mind?,btohqsg
sec1 NA to sec 2 exp,btohqsg
then you can afford to lose a few marks here and there,btohqsg
I mean like if ur eae cfm less stress mah.. me rn,btohqsg
I can get <12 for emb3 but not all subjs <B3,btohqsg
I almost went to Sec 2NA tho,btohqsg
got one sec 5 student get 7 points l1r5 yk,btohqsg
english  art and all those subjs are more subjective imo,btohqsg
I think that sec 5 class average was 18 l1r5,btohqsg
ye I don’t like art and dnt and stuff HAHAHA,btohqsg
I barely passed dnt in sec 2,btohqsg
share qns when you get qn ppr ah,btohqsg
