What is the TAC price? Is it a buy up or a sell down at auction?,btohqsg
lets say TAC 1  i trying to buy 0.7,btohqsg
cannot is it? have to wait until sgx close then can place order?,btohqsg
if at TAC  it's a buy up at 1. You can only buy at 1.Unless you are saying you want to queue  not match or buy at closing  then it's a different thing. If you want to queue for tomorrow  you have to wait until after closing is over which is 1716hrs,btohqsg
the time that you can start putting your orders to queue for tomorrow and after -- depends on brokerage also. Some allow from 1716 hrs  some 1730 hrs... i forgot POEMS is what time. FSM is only 8pm onwards,btohqsg
Hopefully tonight I guess right 😬,btohqsg
