Guess Human Rights only apply to selected people in their countries,btohqsg
Just like high wages only for selected people here,btohqsg
Because China has one of the highest cost of rents in the world in tier 1 cities,btohqsg
Lian Beng also localized but the founder is from mainland chinese la cos 1970s not many singaporeans started doing business,btohqsg
Singapore don't have enough Singaporean big name companies lol,btohqsg
Maybe have but 1 or 2 only,btohqsg
Other countries have a lot more lol,btohqsg
Is it cos sg is young?,btohqsg
There are  although not really unicorn-kind,btohqsg
Mostly the kind mentioned in CRA  still quite big,btohqsg
And if you mean specific examples then no,btohqsg
We need more Singaporean core to make decisions while foreigners can only provide advice in companies,btohqsg
And a mix of scholars and common school graduates,btohqsg
If you had a family dating back to the Majapahit  you'd at least be somebody,btohqsg
Then they must bring foreign expat talents on board,btohqsg
@poppy422I think too late sia  too much foreigners take up jobs that Singaporeans can do,btohqsg
So the students here who are locals should study hard,btohqsg
Provide support for the core please,btohqsg
Whenever I see someone say study hard,btohqsg
But foreigners are not excluded entirely. They still can provide advice and experience but no decision making power,btohqsg
@poppy422imagine the HR is a foreigner then they will naturally hire their own people of the same kind.,btohqsg
Study hard  laugh hard  play hard. Others places don't be hard,btohqsg
As I said  decision makers cannot be foreigners,btohqsg
I thought everyone in uni naturally study hard lol@poppy422,btohqsg
Unless it is a foreign company in Singapore  then bo bian,btohqsg
But we can set legislation for foreign companies setting up branches in Sg,btohqsg
But still they need to adhere to certain guidelines n quotas right,btohqsg
I think you setup your own SME then you can do your ideal organisation structure@poppy422,btohqsg
That is to have at least 50% in their company to be Singaporean or pR that can make decisions,btohqsg
Yup. If is MNC we obey them,btohqsg
today i piak cornetto üç´skeptical of that tbh  you should take a look in changi business Park,btohqsg

Alot at changi business park r IT n backend roles leh,btohqsg
Then u look at takashimaya or cbd,btohqsg
Singaporeans can probably do those pmet jobs lol,btohqsg
I alr have 2 foreign epass friends working in bank IT support üòÇ,btohqsg
Then someone asks why no Singaporean core,btohqsg
That company is local or multi national,btohqsg
Dun want say. Later I kena humtum,btohqsg
If is local then not possible,btohqsg
If is local then of cos main decision maker is still local,btohqsg
Aiya. Some local also value angmoh,btohqsg
So in a way that decision maker is tapping on foreign minds which is good ah! The local will gain,btohqsg
If is foreign then cant blame wad,btohqsg
Not all. Most are empty vessels. Talk good only,btohqsg
Is that true in the dating market also@poppy422,btohqsg
The company is theirs they expanded here from home,btohqsg
They wanna bring their own vision back home at the end of the day,btohqsg
