I tot only i had the privilege,btohqsg
I heard transition metal is being removed for h2 chem due to the covid situation now :o,btohqsg
Tm was fun to learn D:,btohqsg
Transition metals is isolated from the rest of Chemistry in H2,btohqsg
Transition metal is an odd topic. Serves no purpose. Good choice,btohqsg
its actually linked to atomic structure and inorganic QA Chem,btohqsg
It’s like removing induction from H2 maths,btohqsg
are they gonna scrap topics from h1 math,btohqsg
Im sad they dont get to learn tm sigh,btohqsg
Organic in O Levels is very simple,btohqsg
i guess they forgot about it,btohqsg
They’re probably releasing a more comprehensive list,btohqsg
Most induction questions are easy on A level papers,btohqsg
Induction is only in fmath now,btohqsg
Which is why in the past it was more or less free marks,btohqsg
4 full chaps of organic chem for pure chemistry,btohqsg
is organic chem gg be removed,btohqsg
O level organic chem has almost no link to h2 chem organic chem also,btohqsg
Is John Smith gg be removed,btohqsg
organics in O level are fun,btohqsg
The one with the owner tag. Yes.,btohqsg
organics in a levels are crazy memorisation,btohqsg
O level organic chem abit boring,btohqsg
I just feel sorry for my CSE Juniors  you can’t clearly demarcate where one starts and one ends  because all topics interweave..,btohqsg
i cant at structural formula in chemical bonding topic so idk how im gna organic chem HAHAH,btohqsg
Organic is simpler in that sense actually,btohqsg
I think Bio A levels they most likely removing extension topics  which is kinda sad and ironically supposed to be the most relevant topic of the year.,btohqsg

I heard need memorise like crazy,btohqsg
U sleep in class still can get A bro,btohqsg
‘Non skill based subjects such as math’,btohqsg

No  he didn’t take H3 Art,btohqsg
Shops that sell exclusively chips will be closed,btohqsg
I’m just sad no more bakery,btohqsg
Why is bakery under the new restrictions,btohqsg
I learned it in literature class,btohqsg
It’s not selling a dessert  packaged snack  or beverage,btohqsg
The heart is only a few centimetres from the stomach,btohqsg
The real John Smith does not engage in childish shenanigans,btohqsg
No need to memorise colour of complexes liao,btohqsg
There weren’t that many to remember anyway,btohqsg
Quite alot actually just that many were alrdy somewhat taught in other topics,btohqsg
Haha easy game 25 names and colours,btohqsg
He got one less topic to teach and flex,btohqsg
Hes like jay tan but actually good at chem,btohqsg
Sure but the only new ones are the Cu2+ complexes,btohqsg
Fe ones were quite new also,btohqsg
I think exam did tested about fe and some other ones also though,btohqsg
Only if they’re in the QA notes,btohqsg
Or maybe the syllabus in 2016 was different,btohqsg
So it’s just QA colours and Cu2+,btohqsg
Tbh they might as well call it Term 3 and 4 and original Term 4 become once in a lifetime Term 5.,btohqsg
eh how to fix context services has stopped pop up,btohqsg
Whats u gonna do when he comes for u,btohqsg
Y y’all not queue for bbt,btohqsg
I was planning to buy bbt tmr URGH,btohqsg
my sgt say if we go buy BBT  he'll charge us,btohqsg
go ntuc and stock up on boba pearls  20 cartons of milk  20 cartons of tea and 10 bags of sugar,btohqsg
that's homemade bbt for a month,btohqsg
But I think I'll stick to teh peng after tdy,btohqsg
Wah cant imagine ur sugar level,btohqsg
Tiger sugar close at 12 today,btohqsg
if you're gonna drink bbt  might as well 80-100%  if not no point drinking some weak ass concoction,btohqsg
I got order a few times ah,btohqsg
If u drink once in a while ok,btohqsg
Frequently then good luck to you,btohqsg
Why do you even need sugar  0% also alr sweet,btohqsg
Anyway 0 is also sweet because of the bubbles,btohqsg
I'll just drink my teh peng man,btohqsg
So there’s no downside to getting 0,btohqsg
I'll make my own teh peng,btohqsg
Not a v good substitute eh,btohqsg
U get to flex that you dronk 0% bubble tea,btohqsg
bubble tea isn't that sweet compared to thefresh blood of my worst enemies,btohqsg
Real and Fake John Smith’s are on the same page,btohqsg
But you don't get the benefits,btohqsg
why not order 0% bbt to flex  then go home and add 10 tbsp of sugar yourself,btohqsg
u get the social recognition AND the taste,btohqsg
Bubble tea is actully a luxury prodyct,btohqsg
are starbucks gonna be closed also,btohqsg
hmm wanna have a chem shokugeki?,btohqsg
Make sure u fucking eat leaves then,btohqsg
A third of all foods are carbohydrates,btohqsg
0% thats the way to go,btohqsg
LOL the anime that only motivated me to do well for a levels,btohqsg
0% first step of escaping diabetes,btohqsg
Compete at speeddoing a Chem Olympiad paper,btohqsg
Yes  and will not result in the icky feeling in your throat afterwards,btohqsg
but sad  i lost to 3 people in the cohort for the real a lvls :(,btohqsg
What the freak u talking abt!?!?,btohqsg
Write out the E/S configuration of 2 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine,btohqsg
U can make ur own bbt,btohqsg
Kumarby the way  who do you love?,btohqsg
I lazy make my own tapioca pearls,btohqsg
You can't love physics  you can only feel passion for it,btohqsg
U cant be lazy to make stuff u like,btohqsg
You can love physics  you just can’t make love with it,btohqsg
That’s how I know you’re not trying hard enough,btohqsg
Nor can u prove urself right,btohqsg
The statement itself isnt a statement,btohqsg
God is a man and his name is John Smith,btohqsg
Real John has no interest in the paltry affairs of the common people,btohqsg
Yea true la control for 1 month u can do it,btohqsg
Fake John is insecure and seeks for the social validation of the common people,btohqsg
I  however  do have a vivid interest in poultry of the common farmer.,btohqsg
Truer words have never been spoken,btohqsg
A transdifferentiation event. As the fake john smith (N**L) would say,btohqsg
He was contemplating but it wouldve given away his identity,btohqsg
Cb how many john smith are there now,btohqsg
To the Shincheonji cult of John Smith,btohqsg
Anyone knows who actually created sgexams,btohqsg
Insider job by ong ye kung,btohqsg
SGExams was created by an r/Singapore mod because r/Sg people were annoyed by exam posts,btohqsg
However I don’t think that mod was involved in any more than that,btohqsg
is that the origin story of@dekita,btohqsg
The creation of /r/SGExams  in 2017,btohqsg
So is there on OIC of sgexams now?,btohqsg
Damn first time i not sure if my bio answer is relevant to the ques,btohqsg
Wait john is the owner of this chat,btohqsg
He was also here in this thread,btohqsg
John is part of the lineage of the Rothschild family as well,btohqsg
I am the owner of this group,btohqsg
I am just a cog in the machine,btohqsg
Are you counted as a mod then of sgexams,btohqsg
But sgexams isn’t just internet group chats,btohqsg
There’s also people organising community projects and stuff,btohqsg
And maintaining a notes repository site,btohqsg
Thisbis by right illegal unless the notes are handwritten,btohqsg
The projects are really cool i wanns try forest this week,btohqsg
SGExams has become a MNC already,btohqsg
It’s only illegal if the person uploading didn’t create it,btohqsg
Oh  wow. Some comments aged like curdled milk. Thanks for sharing Fake John Smith.,btohqsg
I’m sure the people who did that project lurking here would be happy to read this,btohqsg
No I think he's part of all the Medieval banks,btohqsg
John has the blood of Charlemagne,btohqsg
It’s not illegal for you to share the things you made,btohqsg
I would prefer SGAcademia but it sounds too goddamn pretentious,btohqsg
Academia and studying pre uni is bigggggg difference,btohqsg
This is blasphemous  Jayden should fire you bahaha,btohqsg
Seems like a good word choice imo,btohqsg
Wait uhh whys there two john smiths,btohqsg
Nobody uses 'academia' to refer to students 'studying' Central Limit Theorem,btohqsg
Everyone is a fan of John Smith,btohqsg
This one is still true though,btohqsg
What’s a sidebar? Mobile Master Race,btohqsg
In this group or in general? Cuz you're not allowed to use either in SGExams,btohqsg
That means I must ban him,btohqsg
Do they have something against sgexams?,btohqsg
Eh well  difficult to say in SG. We have racial issues but not the same groups as US,btohqsg
I think r/Sg has just forgotten about SGExams,btohqsg
But yeah  especially in a Singaporean society where black communities are scarce and basically non-existent  the use of the n word has pretty much culturally been a substitute for a term like 'dude' or 'bruh' or any term that is used to address someone in an expressive manner,btohqsg
So I'm genuinely curious why we're censoring the word even in our community,btohqsg
r/sg very cringe about 98% of the time. And I think it's somehow moderation policy to keep it that way,btohqsg
I can say HidingCat is impressed with SGExams trajectory,btohqsg
I don't endorse the use of it but I'm curious,btohqsg
A sizable proportion of people I know say the N word that way,btohqsg
The only sg non r/sg subreddit i know is r/sgexams,btohqsg
Cuz we need to be US-friendly,btohqsg
SGExams is trying to be legit,btohqsg
So we need to be v clean,btohqsg
I understand that platforms like SGExams cannot endorse it,btohqsg
oof  john just dropped the ok boomer bomb,btohqsg
But singaporean society doesn’t censor it as a whole,btohqsg
Given that there are still people out there using the word without repercussion,btohqsg
Yeah i mean most of us dont know the real history behind it,btohqsg
Or know but we dont care cause doesnt affect us,btohqsg
Or dont care cause theres not much people of african descent here,btohqsg
Legally we have MRHA so if you do anything that is legally provable to 'hurt' feelings you gg,btohqsg
That’s our version of the N word I guess,btohqsg
But does the word abunehneh really originate as an insult tho,btohqsg
Or is it just insensitive but not meant to be an insult,btohqsg
This is a very interesting perspective,btohqsg
But I’ve never heard it used much anyway,btohqsg
I mean as I grew older  I stopped using it  but I was surprised to learn that it’s considered an insult in secondary sch/JC,btohqsg
There are words people don't consider insults,btohqsg
Even the most innocuous words can be used with malicious intents,btohqsg
I mean honestly even with the most posh English,btohqsg
Which is why I think it really boils down to the intention of the user  and that no word is inherently harmful,btohqsg
but the snowflakes in America clearly disagree,btohqsg
Nigga was intended to be an insultWas abunehneh an insult from the outset? Or did it evolve to an insult?,btohqsg
I mean  I just used 'snowflake' as an insult,btohqsg
But how to judge intent? Is that a finding of fact?,btohqsg
Let me consult my local linguist,btohqsg
Reminds me of that Vjc girl,btohqsg
Based on the track record of the individual  I suppose,btohqsg
If the person has traditionally been against the black community in the past,btohqsg
then any use of the n word can only be interpreted as malicious,btohqsg
Oh u dont know the story ?,btohqsg
I don't know the story either  come  spill da tea,btohqsg
I probably have seen it but not really sure what story being mentioned,btohqsg
I think is still on reddit,btohqsg
So you need the person to stay long long and insult long long before you do anything?,btohqsg
I grew up hearing things like 马来猪 and I always knew that was always an insult  but I grew up not knowing that abunehneh was an insult  so I’m like did the meaning change over the years  or was I just an oblivious child,btohqsg
Whenever I was hanging out in the HDB corridor as a kid my grandma would tell me to come back in before the ‘apunehneh catch u’,btohqsg
There was this girl from VJC complaining about her skool in very sophisticated anglish,btohqsg
"Well they won't say""Come back before the race that cannot go Navy catch you""",btohqsg
Oh I think I know which one liao  but I didn't find the eigo beri guddo,btohqsg
When I was growing up  I always thought abunehneh is an Innocent googoogaagaa speak for Indian,btohqsg
But it’s used with the idea that they are bad people who will abduct you,btohqsg
I’ve never heard any other usage,btohqsg
Only my grandma said it to me,btohqsg
For me I heard it used in this scenario and in all other scenario which could’ve been replaced by Indian,btohqsg
Don’t complain abt no time  recess time instead of waste time Qing can do work first,btohqsg
You guys just don’t know how to maximise time,btohqsg
She was complaining about people talking to their friends during break time,btohqsg
I wonder how she’s faring now hahaha,btohqsg
asian with man buns yay or nay,btohqsg
Where’s our resident Asian with man bun?,btohqsg
it depends on how the person looks,btohqsg
but with a van dykes beard,btohqsg
I don’t remember any key words,btohqsg
Btw for good English I'd recommend this bloghttp://singaporerecalcitrant.blogspot.com/,btohqsg
When i only have 1 tick lel,btohqsg
how long did it take to grow full length and how did you maintain it during the growing phase,btohqsg
so do you wear a cap or just fuck it and let it flop,btohqsg
damn thats some dedication im gonna try and hop it turns out fine thanks for the tips,btohqsg
okay thanks HAHA let’s see how long i can do this,btohqsg
but i recently just cut last month after a trip so its square one,btohqsg
damn those white doods look hella intimidating,btohqsg
yeah hopefully i can stay committed but honestly doubt so,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone here take H2 computing or took and still have their notes with them ?,btohqsg
Should one continue to study what he doesn’t like although he is scoring well or change his course to something that likes but there’s is no guarantee that he do well and the course is harder,btohqsg
I chose a course i liked eventually  and I will prob do fine in it,btohqsg
personally for u what would u have done and whats ur rationale,btohqsg
my seniors sent me samples of her lectures and exam papers,btohqsg
how fair is it for me to judge now,btohqsg
Finish it and change to something you like in Uni,btohqsg
My gpa is 3.8 in a course that i dun like,btohqsg
isn’t dat harder to adapt ltr,btohqsg
What’s the course you actly like,btohqsg
It’s fine  if jc kids can do psych  without bckgrd you can do psych with slightly diff diploma  in fact I won’t say your current diploma is completely unrelated,btohqsg
Unless unless you say that your dislike for the course will make your GPA drop to cannot go Uni level  then change bah,btohqsg
idk but i have been questioning myself why am i in this course since y1,btohqsg
If not  just stick with it,btohqsg
Depends on how far along you are. If you're halfway past  just finish it. Learn about the thing you're interested in in your own time. School isn't 100% of your learning.,btohqsg
if i change 0 to lets say 1,btohqsg
i get index error: replacement index 1 out of range,btohqsg
Btw how do i change that into f string,btohqsg
Why were we added to that group?,btohqsg
A bot that skimmed the group member list,btohqsg
There are supposedly even NIE Trainees in there,btohqsg
I would’ve thought they would’ve been taught that it might not be very professional to be in those kinds of grp,btohqsg
Now I am curious what group this is,btohqsg
Idk they have used a bot to auto delete invite messages,btohqsg
I see them flash and go as new members joined,btohqsg
They know what they're doing is wrong,btohqsg
I think might be Charles look at the recent undeleted invite,btohqsg
I invited you btw  just for you to see what’s up,btohqsg
Scrolling up  it looks like they're associated with that sg covid group that has been spamming ads here,btohqsg
Hope annoying telegram groups won't be the next pandemic,btohqsg
If that dude whose message I forwarded and deleted (coz I feel might be dox) is legit  I really facepalm.,btohqsg
I mean you’re free to be in any group you want as Long as you don’t harm people  but common sense would tell you not to reveal your profession in those spammy grp,btohqsg
Admins should check the recent actions  I think we found the culprit bahaha,btohqsg
People who’ve been spotted adding members here to their spam group,btohqsg
Not courteous to just add people indiscriminately into their group,btohqsg
They are probably a group of uni students who feel that it would be fun to start a project like these,btohqsg
Anyways if you can change your privacy settings to only be added into groups by your friends,btohqsg
People making covid 19 free tuition initiatives and shit,btohqsg
A pandemic and all you think about is resume,btohqsg
He’s known for doing that probably,btohqsg
Some group that added a bunch of people here in,btohqsg
Probably just didn’t want him to say anything,btohqsg
I think our education system wired the students to be too opportunistic,btohqsg
I don’t mind people saying they’d give tuition for free,btohqsg
They mute instead of ban because they want the numbers lol,btohqsg
Even if they might be motivated by their resumes,btohqsg
I won’t deny  I been through a phase of wanting to do something because🤑🤑MY RESUME🤑🤑But then after awhile I’m just like  while people praise me for what I have on paper  it just highlights how I feel I have nothing substantial.,btohqsg
Provided they actually put in the effort to tutor and not just lip service for resume,btohqsg
They are actually sliencing speech in that group,btohqsg
Messages about joining the group are deleted,btohqsg
Such a sneaky game they play,btohqsg
Maybe just for this group I should just record all their messages,btohqsg
Can I put Valued Contributor on my resume and not be laughed at by 198% of the hiring population?,btohqsg
VC is one of the most highly valued roles nowadays,btohqsg
i was added to that grp,btohqsg
Nothing you can do except leave,btohqsg
Their admin added a bunch of people from this group to theirs,btohqsg
Wonder why telegram still doesn’t have the ability to hide group memberships,btohqsg
Maybe it means they are gonna continue adding more people if they put slow mode,btohqsg
Post something then edit it after a while,btohqsg
Maybe your messages will last longer,btohqsg
I see my clone has arrived,btohqsg
plenty of fishes in the sea,btohqsg
That is the month of June,btohqsg
Lol i was added to that group also,btohqsg
For us hehehe  not for them  not for them,btohqsg
Can you write a script to screenshot all their messages,btohqsg
Oh well June is holidays for us also,btohqsg
Though wait a minute  having a 13 week term with a mid-term break is legit them having a taste of a Uni Sem hahaha,btohqsg
Screenshots would be annoying but i could probably write a script to get all messages sent in the group,btohqsg
Anyway i left already and reported as spam,btohqsg
For 25 weeks only have 1 week holiday for them,btohqsg
I’m calling it Recess Week coz it’s literally a Uni Sem alr LAWL,btohqsg
September Holiday might as well be Reading Week,btohqsg
When tf am I gonna get Air Force uniform,btohqsg

projects got moved up to 45%  finals down to 20% this sem,btohqsg
how come so many john smith imposters,btohqsg
