Ever since Sinochem International increased their Halcyon Agri stake at $0.45/share by buying 10.2% from other insiders  bringing their stake to 65.2% control of Halcyon  counter roared alive since prices were at $0.20 when this deal took place.Also  many watchful eyes on this one as it could be ‘easy money’ if they indeed make a Mandatory General offer ‘MGO’ to take full control of Halcyon.Background:- 2016 Sinochem merged with halcyon when they came in at $0.75. They extended MGO to all of Halcyon at same price. Then the share price was $0.635 when this MGO was made- Sinochem International has become a pioneer in implementing the Chinese Government's Belt andSource:https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-sinochem-international-at-a-outlook-stable-25-07-2022https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/I1UBASE9BFRJ83SC/733166__FORM3%20SIO.pdf,btohqsg
Paying attention to Halcyon at this juncture could prove to be fruitful as we explore the possibility of Sinochem making another MGO to Halcyon since their control stake is already 65.2%So  we asked ourselves what’s would have happened if more than 90% had accepted the $0.75 MGO in 2016?(Means it could have already became a private entity back then)Hence  Sinochem already had prior intentions to gain full control then. Therefore  this recent married deal up stake to 65.2% at $0.450 makes them one step closer to their original plan. With prices not performing and market outlook not the best  perhaps this time shareholders would accept the offer. Of course  many would regret that they did not accept $0.75 back in 2016.I guess that’s life and just have to live with it.Based on research  I think probability of an MGO seems really possible as Sinochem have recently undertaken intentions to raise funds too.Source:https://www.halcyonagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/HAC_Media_Release.pdf,btohqsg
Back in 2016  when Sinochem made the mandatory offer to Halcyon at $0.75. At the same time Halcyon made offer to acquire GMG by issuing 0.9333 shares for each GMG shares . With this 3-way play  it makes sense now that the $0.75 MGO would not have gotten the desired 90% .That move seems more a calculated effort to merge halcyon and GMG first  whilst coming out as controller shareholder of that exercise.The picture gets clearer as we can see Sinochem International bid to build and become the world biggest rubber player.Now  that they have more than a foot in this  I believe the time have come for them to take full control of Halcyon. I’m convinced Halcyon being cheap now at $0.230  it is an opportune time for Sinochem to make the offer to get what they had intended to get at the start of this plan  dating 2016.Better to offer now that market is weak rather than pay higher premium when market is stronger?Source:https://www.halcyonagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GMG_VGO_Offer_Document.pdf,btohqsg

Earlier this week  the OPEC  US Energy Department and International Energy Agency all slashed their global oil demand forecasts in their monthly reports. Highlighting softer demand  official data showed that US crude inventories surged by 9.9 million barrels last week  way more than market expectations for a 1.8 million barrel rise  while gasoline stocks jumped by 2 million barrels versus estimates for a 1.8 million barrel drop. Lackluster demand in top crude importer China as it clings to its zero-Covid policy also weighed on oil prices. The UK oil benchmark rallied 15% last week after OPEC+ agreed to a large supply cut  but the IEA warned that resulting price spikes could tip the global economy into recession.,btohqsg
