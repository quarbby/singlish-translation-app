Last year i also thought i would join the kawai y4 boy batch,btohqsg
Turns out  i promoted (what a miracle),btohqsg
my batch no one retained (even the bozo who skipped promos),btohqsg
Unless it's mi (sorry not a dig to flame mi  but from what ppl say),btohqsg
Or maybe y4 promo criteria more lenient,btohqsg
those are either they want to change subject combi or like legit dun care,btohqsg
i believe the situation in YI is worst ngl,btohqsg
UK the criteria for Ur sch?,btohqsg
Y4 is pass english and gpa >2.8,btohqsg
YI is always the one to get flamed,btohqsg
TM criteria is damn lenient..like pass GP and 1 H2 subject  the rest S,btohqsg
Ik ppl fail gp still nvr retain,btohqsg
There was a time both JP and YI were neck and neck,btohqsg
Ppl it's exam season still got beef with cohort mates ah,btohqsg
prob if u fail GP and ur others are ok  can nego with principal,btohqsg
Ya my friends situation was everything else subpass or btr,btohqsg
I give u 500 dollars to promote me,btohqsg
So there's no like nego persay,btohqsg
in sec sch  my friend failed english and had to beg the principal to let her promote coz my sec sch dun retain people in lower sec  they kick u out of the school,btohqsg
I think i can pass bio,btohqsg
passing promo criteria is one thing  i realise a lot of people can somehow beg n convince principal to let them advance,btohqsg
But i want to take h3 bio,btohqsg
H3 criteria isB in ur h3 subjectE in everyting else,btohqsg
I think if i lock in can,btohqsg
wah...for TM  to be offered H3 need be in top 10% or top whatever  i did not get H3 chem despite scoring an A for promos,btohqsg
I thought jiejie took h3 maths,btohqsg
Jiejie did well for h1 geog,btohqsg
Cuz I saw my promos grade I thought might qualify,btohqsg
yea i only got offered math  my promos was 87% (slipped in j2 tho coz i focused my heart and souls on chem),btohqsg
No way A is 15% and more,btohqsg
no need to moderate if the avg is C for H2 chemðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
they are not transparent about the criteria for H3 in TM  till now i dunno,btohqsg
i got A for chem but never qualify,btohqsg
Still do la it's CLT as long as got sample size can liao,btohqsg
i dun think that many people scored A for chem tho lol,btohqsg
There's no hard and fast ah it's top 10% overall top 5% for that subj,btohqsg
I got S for Maths but I can easily set up an Excel sheet to moderate it in 5 mins,btohqsg
But honestly idt I can keep that standard,btohqsg
Dw they are in their jc drama era,btohqsg
Yao teck korkor got penta u,btohqsg
but actually hor  if i got offered chem  i realized somehow chem always too little people to form a class,btohqsg
So anyone wld have done better,btohqsg
Everyone traumatised from H2 chem DW h3 alrd,btohqsg
Ye I know but the talks are Abt jc lol,btohqsg
Then u wanna talk about RP? 23:59 RJ pls,btohqsg
