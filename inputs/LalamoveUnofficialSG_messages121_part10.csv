Genuine question   im not expecting real answers but do yall think if too many people just open lala app and scroll but not taking job will affect the algorithm as it registers many rider/driver online hence the low price these few (many) months ?,btohqsg
Of course there are many more drivers/riders nowadays   but maybe there are just so many that open the app scroll and scroll but dont take job .. and wierd thing is lala keep looking for new drivers when its already so hard to earn and not like job untaken .. most jobs   even lousy ones all taken in 5 mins unless sentosa lah.,btohqsg
