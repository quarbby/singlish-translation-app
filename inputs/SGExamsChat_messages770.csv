I just need to buy some eggs that mixed well with the indomee,btohqsg
Man the second sentence structure abit the sus,btohqsg
sounds like someone I used to know,btohqsg
ok so basically recently i feel really horrible  it's not a new feeling and I know it's gonna pass. i've felt like this quite a number of times in jh alr. so like recently life has been quite overwhelming for me even though i try to repress everything and then like i think it's kinda backfiring now because i feel very :// everydayand i know this sounds super insensitive but sometimes when i see those ppl on reddit complaining about how jc academics is too difficult and they have trouble coping  i kinda envy them  cause like sometimes i think i rather deal with the entire not coping with academic rigour thing than wtv i'm going through now (i have sch problems (one big problem i having now  it  is not rly related to that boy  but the boy is also kinda a part of my other problems)   and then l also have problems at home that has been ongoing since dec 2022)  and then I legit feel a bit tired of all this and I know all of this will pass  but i just need to let it out sometimes too  i can't just push everything inwards  even though i try,btohqsg
i mean tbh i don't think the jump from sec sch to jc is that big  but i still feel sad and empty everyday so,btohqsg
yea i saw that one too and for 1 moment i feel like OP is overreacting,btohqsg
i feel like that OP compare themselves to others too much alr and need to focus on themselves more,btohqsg
This is smth I also felt in JC HAHAHA,btohqsg
everyday my family members got fight,btohqsg
yea actl the one happening at home affects me a lot,btohqsg
but i just like maybe alr used to it,btohqsg
i lost a valo game so hard my laptop crashed,btohqsg

"i doubt ppl will even bother to stay back to ""play""",btohqsg
we setting up on the 2 days before,btohqsg
"24th april is the ""carnival"" day",btohqsg
I somehow got myself into planning comm for 3 events alrd over my time in jc 💀💀💀,btohqsg
In preparation for the Earth Day (24 April)  we need you guys to stay back on 22 and 23 April to set up the booth and SEA. And on 24 April is the actual day (235 to 5 pm).,btohqsg
no idea wat SEA is lol,btohqsg
its just like carnival games each class has to make with reusable materials,btohqsg
bobian i had to choose for our class to make marble maze,btohqsg
"then the cher still wanted a ""instructional manual"" fpr how to play the game  a marble maze",btohqsg
idk how they wan us decorate,btohqsg
u r laughing at my expense 😢,btohqsg
"""lol get used to being laughed at loser""",btohqsg
teachers become teachers because they love kids  is that wrong 🤨,btohqsg
i mean teaching dont pay well  barely any career progression  def dont have flexible hours and cost a bunch of money to train to become one..so instinctively i guess the only reason someone would become a teacher is their love of kids,btohqsg
Why is this coming up again?,btohqsg
when we already mentioned teaching is actually highly viable,btohqsg
what other reason do you think teachers have for becoming teachers?,btohqsg
Dude since when did teaching pay very little,btohqsg
yes there's the liking kids part (dont take out of context),btohqsg
but in other countries they underpaid,btohqsg
my sec sch teacher says the pay is just enough to live comfortably,btohqsg
O ya recently poly lecturer pay has been up to $100/hr,btohqsg
highly viable? my teacher literally said  the kind of knowledge teachers acquire in order to teach students does not give them enough relevant skills or knowledge to partake in the industry they may have spent 2 decades as a teacher,btohqsg
My brain cannot process what u saying,btohqsg
im refering to teachers not lecturers or faci's,btohqsg
Kindergarten is low lvl kinda so,btohqsg
im asking u explain ur point lah,btohqsg
that's the whole issue with all industries,btohqsg
every industry need low lvl workers,btohqsg
like as kuro said if you scholar then def higherthen like tbh the same amount also mean different things to diff ppllike my y4 ft is single so she can afford all the branded goods and holidays to nice places with her own salarybut then if someone have kids and parent to support then maybe is just enough to live comfortably,btohqsg
Some parents making that amt at 40+ ah js a reminder,btohqsg
the teacher i was referencing taught principle of accounts for o levels. I asked him if he could get a job outside doing accounts with his relevant knowledge in the field,btohqsg
Nurses then we can argue abt that they rlly underpaid,btohqsg
They do a lot but not paid enough,btohqsg
Guys I think we shud just be sex workers,btohqsg
and willing to pay for u,btohqsg
Make people want u and willing to pay for u,btohqsg
Can you send the societys loss sticker,btohqsg
To be a sex slave for the saf,btohqsg
Getting fked in a diff way,btohqsg
Lets look objectively how much the avg teacher gets paid ig,btohqsg
Stepping stone to become tuition teacher,btohqsg
There's like ppl that actually choose decent paying job,btohqsg
but also ppl that choose sht paying,btohqsg
then complain abt how sht their pay is,btohqsg
When the same job in another company pays better,btohqsg
long service? Bro dont even look a tad over 30,btohqsg
but like if they cannot get the better paying job then maybe ah,btohqsg
that they actually might not be qualified or good enough for the job?,btohqsg
Or they dw like risk and change company,btohqsg
And like a lot of ppl still entering the market,btohqsg
Its at less than 1 rn,btohqsg
nigga what are you yapping about,btohqsg
we talking abt kindergarten teacher arent we,btohqsg
more ppl in market than demand,btohqsg
guys this gordon scam moe ah,btohqsg
but they also cannot hire too many,btohqsg
25 years...bro did not even hit 20 in 2024,btohqsg
that medal was given in 2022,btohqsg
bruh this one legit scam moe,btohqsg
and put in start year wrong,btohqsg
which is highly concerning either ways,btohqsg
Or u have the wrong guy,btohqsg
moe only got one Gordon Goh,btohqsg
"and the link is back. ""ite tuiton""",btohqsg
Why does it feel super ironic,btohqsg
Ite and tuition in same line feels weird,btohqsg
wah everyear i got to delete that fking link and ban the person,btohqsg
idk what im doing w my life,btohqsg
it's those kind of troller that say brainless stuff for clout,btohqsg
he always say inappropriate things under sge posts,btohqsg
not that yi ones btw like other stuff that is inappropriate,btohqsg
shld ban him from the sub,btohqsg
go study for ur h1 lah,btohqsg
Speaking of econs  my econs cher told my class CME ppl their H2 econs somehow their best subject,btohqsg
+ i stack ard 3 leaves,btohqsg
I received my offer 2nd week of April iirc,btohqsg
Lemme pray for u  but nus chemistry should be can bah,btohqsg
I think still got hope bah,btohqsg
Eh if u want this  u needa put in ur 1st 2,btohqsg
Why is Penta U keep coming up,btohqsg
And guess what I did to myself this time…I itchy finger burst my pimple and now it is bleeding lol,btohqsg
cuz he say he retaking a lvl during ns,btohqsg
He said he had 2 H2 As…,btohqsg
so yt are you retaking A lvls,btohqsg
Neh  I can take forever to make decisions,btohqsg
My friend said for some classmates travel from pasir ris to ntu,btohqsg
ya what from the east to ntu,btohqsg
My friend tour me around ntu before,btohqsg
I already complaining traveling to nus  idk how to go ntu,btohqsg
Anyway ntu got free 1y place,btohqsg
go boon lay mrt take 179,btohqsg
Tbh ntu has more than enough hall places  unlike nus u really need join a lot of things,btohqsg
an offer to retake A levels,btohqsg
Tbh same I didn’t plan to wanna stay,btohqsg
This whole thing reminded me how I ruled out nie just coz ntu is too far for me to travel to,btohqsg
why did you ever rule out nie,btohqsg
Yea I rule out just coz ntu was too far for me to travel to,btohqsg
I put chs first but no news still,btohqsg
When others with lower rp alr got,btohqsg
Chem is a common degree programme in chs right,btohqsg
that means bedok got either high 70s or low 80s,btohqsg
For courses with no interviews  if you are above a certain percentile of applicants  u will automatically get it,btohqsg
Is it you have to declare major and you select chem,btohqsg
But they dun necessarily go in rank point order to offer if I’m seeing it correctly,btohqsg
I think it could be because I stupidly didn’t declare my preferred major,btohqsg
I wanted to do Econs as 1st degree and polsci as 2nd but didn’t realise I should’ve just wrote Econs,btohqsg
I feel so stupid now Hais,btohqsg
Erm unlikely to be the case coz most ppl under that system only declare after at least 1-2 sem,btohqsg
Hearsay those who don’t tend to get their offers later,btohqsg
If common degree shouldn’t be too hard,btohqsg
So they start with the common curriculum first?,btohqsg
Yes so now chs y1 and 2 has got some pre-allocated common modules spanning both science and arts…even if u declared whatever btw,btohqsg
It kinda replaces the older ‘general elective’ sort of modules,btohqsg
Ah ok I thought both the modules under the courses I declared and the common curriculum runs simultaneously,btohqsg
Not something like the first 2 semesters common curriculum only,btohqsg
But it is not really a common curriculum  o guess what people do is to take some time to do modules towards the major u want / most likely  the rest can be considered under unrestricted electives,btohqsg
I shall send this again the day of the a level Econs paper,btohqsg
Oh so it’s like you can choose any modules first without declaring what major you want?,btohqsg
That’s like very flexible isn’t it,btohqsg
phys the only gd thing is mcq,btohqsg
U actually have up to 2y to declare lol,btohqsg
I think it is meant to be? And u get to plan ur curriculum as well,btohqsg
wah if econs got mcq i want sia,btohqsg
So if I’m wishy washy or indecisive  I have lots of time I guess,btohqsg
Last year Econs had mcq for Singapore a levels was 2006 lol,btohqsg
I do not understand the question,btohqsg
Oh if it’s Econs should be A,btohqsg
I’m happy I did not take h2 phy coz I wun survive the practical,btohqsg
Seeing how my chem practical gg,btohqsg
My prelims would have lost an A if my theory was not 92% lol,btohqsg
I got D for chem practical  my cher no reaction,btohqsg
This sounds like someone in my class too,btohqsg
I really do not understand these people,btohqsg
Everyone has access to everyone’s grades,btohqsg
I can't tell if you're holding a grudge or what bro,btohqsg
"it's like u going "" once upon a time"" like kuro",btohqsg
I actually top my class in 3/4 subjects consistently but this dude chose my chem to be salty about,btohqsg
The funniest thing in my class was this same dude  she said if she is my mother  she will be pissed with me…when the cg chair ask me write teacher day card and I said wait coz I was doing some revision,btohqsg
Mine is the contents (chem  math  phy and sometimes econs)  I dun have energy to deal with GP,btohqsg
Bruh then the whole class witnessed us fighting,btohqsg
This was before the cher walked in  else my reputation will be ruined,btohqsg
The only violent thing I did was to snatch my notes back,btohqsg
wah shout back at teacher not bad ah,btohqsg
No no  it was my classmate,btohqsg
This one is a ticket to detention already,btohqsg
got ppl piss in class before bruh,btohqsg
cuz her fren jealous of her results mah so both of thwm fight in class,btohqsg
unless is like grp project n the fren got Fked over or smth,btohqsg
side note but  i noticing 1 of my chers the white hairs are coming faster and faster💀,btohqsg
quite common in sec sch and ite,btohqsg
Actually this fighting was coz my classmate got something against me for mugging. Then there was once cg chair asked me write teacher day card  then I say ‘wait’ coz I was doing something else (like at least lemme close up on my revision mah)…then that girl not happy  her friend snatched away my notes (and I actually snatched it back)…then she be like ‘Wah if I’m ur mother  I will be damn pissed’,btohqsg
dont get why the girl got so agitated to snatch ur stuff lol,btohqsg
Then er I just shouted back at her,btohqsg
Then the whole class witnessed the show,btohqsg
I also dunno why she brought up my mother lol,btohqsg
maybe he is teaching since 1998,btohqsg
Most likely cause got bond with MOE after graduation,btohqsg
but 168 min for cat 2 seat pein,btohqsg
Is there any other job he listed? Any job in the civil service should count towards the 25 years,btohqsg
Nope that’s it on another job forum he spent 20 years as a special assistant,btohqsg
Those are the ones that are probably what most ppl think about ig,btohqsg
I avoid choosing Australia for Exchange cuz they damn stingy with the course load,btohqsg
Ccb only give us 4 mods,btohqsg
For most Australian Unis the maximum amount of Modules u are allowed to take per Semester is 4,btohqsg
Bro OK for context the normal load for SG unis is 16-19 AUs,btohqsg
Fucking 3 or 4 modules is like 9 or 12 AUs,btohqsg
having a presentation in 10min 💀💀,btohqsg
I think i bombed it 💀,btohqsg
ok tbf that's pretty tame coming from josh,btohqsg
Going to civil defence academy route,btohqsg
I feel like my generation thinks doing the bare minimum is the best way to work for a company.Meanwhile every generation before actually wanted to prove they could do more than their jobscope.Then my generation wonder why they don't see the promotions they deserve 🤔,btohqsg
but idk the definition of era,btohqsg
im so tired but i can't sleepppp,btohqsg
You don't see the same eagerness to do more in their lives as much as how the people before the 2000s went through theirs. Like you could almost see the lives of these people 20-30 years into the future because of how predictable everybody has become,btohqsg
There was a time when self improvement was more of a personal choice than a societal choice. I wonder why that changed,btohqsg
That's not self improvement  the kind of self improvement I'm talking about is picking up more skills rather than wait until shit hits the fan then decide it's time to pick up more skills,btohqsg
ryan why are you active everywhere then,btohqsg
"""picking up more skills"" and how do you do that? You converse with people",btohqsg
go talk to more ppl irl instead of conversing with ppl you barely know online,btohqsg
in other words--touch some grass instead of touching ur device,btohqsg
You know thanks to these convos here I've learnt Alot about ns that I would have otherwise no clue about,btohqsg
This is the most thought provoking substance less statement I've read today,btohqsg
Like its a statement no doubt,btohqsg
It's just words put together to form a sentence that has no meaning,btohqsg
it's too early to be discussing stuff like this,btohqsg
I mean I got a great example  in the past if people were required to close a store  most would see it like it's a golden once in a lifetime opportunity...nowadays you tell these same aged kids to close a store  they see it as a added chore,btohqsg
There is no idea in that sentence,btohqsg
It's just words put together to form a sentence that has no meaning,btohqsg
Maybe i just have bad reading comprehension bug there's no logic,btohqsg
Eagerness to do something that you could do once in your life  you don't see that anymore.,btohqsg
Or even a basis in reality,btohqsg
Like are u just saying that,btohqsg
People are less eager to chase after once in a lifetime opportunities,btohqsg
What if I give u 10 million now to do smth would u not do it,btohqsg
And this is the only time u will get the 10 million,btohqsg
What is one once in a lifetime opportunity you been thinking of chasing?,btohqsg
My understudy disappeared to the canteen,btohqsg
I think the issue is more of u not recognizing ur opportunities,btohqsg
Like for me at least as a dancer  I got to perform at many shows which I never expected to perform at considering I'm q new,btohqsg
And its all shit that I go for,btohqsg
ryan is back at it again,btohqsg
Ur the one who's choosing to not take the opportunities that's given to you,btohqsg
Don't drag the rest of society down with ur inability to be a human,btohqsg
Don't people always say set your goals and work towards it? When was it ever work and create a goal for yourself,btohqsg
you are the limiting reagent of society,btohqsg
And then create a goal for urself,btohqsg
Wished I had my laptop with me,btohqsg
The two other people with me rn,btohqsg
My understudy disappeared to the canteen,btohqsg
Ystd he disappeared from 8am to 11am,btohqsg
They're identifying similarities in Christianity and hinduism,btohqsg
Recognizing opportunities  means recognizing a goal you would have otherwise missed  isn't that the case.,btohqsg
I'm know I'm not saying bs cause it's literally factual  if that is not what is being said then I just could not get my point across clear enough,btohqsg
"an opportunity is not a ""goal you would have otherwise missed""",btohqsg
Should threaten to report him and say he’ll get charged if he continues,btohqsg
Then what is it? In the context,btohqsg
In SAF is the understudy thing called ADO,btohqsg
please search google or your dictionary,btohqsg
Tbh I also don’t know what ADO stands for,btohqsg
i can have a goal without having the opportunity to advance myself towards that goal  but i can have an opportunity without having a goal,btohqsg
I just know that when they give off in lieu for it they say it’s “ADO understudy OIL”,btohqsg
Idk I just know that for an extra duty with shift 12h they give 1 day off in lieu,btohqsg
But my office hour is 9h45min so I rather not have to do understudy lol,btohqsg
For this it’s either ppl stay overnight or come on a weekend,btohqsg
Not yet it’s in July for me,btohqsg
That’s why need to make use of the lack of Mc restriction,btohqsg
If it’s SOP to give OIL I think it’s grounds for reporting him,btohqsg
What makes you think I do not give a fuck about my life...,btohqsg
I guess it’s another reason why scdf>saf in general,btohqsg
shldnt even be an argument ngl,btohqsg
You literally see what I said about my gpa...it literally went from exact 1.69 to exact 2.57 in one sem,btohqsg
Cos I’m the branch that deals with NSmen/nsf admin matters  if they’re going to receive goodie bags with snacks they all get delivered to our branch. Often there’s extras and we get to take them for free.,btohqsg
"It shows I'm doing shit about my life and not just ""not giving a fuck""",btohqsg
Like in my office got free milo can milo powder nature valley bar and nuts,btohqsg
They call it personnel branch in scdf,btohqsg
But isn't ur point people are actively choosing to ignore these opportunities,btohqsg
They just leave all the surplus items in some area of the office,btohqsg
Oh maybe hrd is for CDA?,btohqsg
eh we all refer to the maj joshua department as HRD,btohqsg
My branch has roles such as charging ppl  recording their leave  booking ppl for ippt,btohqsg
he's the guy that deals with NSFs back then,btohqsg
i mean that was my entire job for FFRB,btohqsg
because they're inefficient pieces of shit,btohqsg
I have no idea who that is,btohqsg
imagine as the admin who needs to split all the trainees into the 5 rotas,btohqsg
and i don't even get the trainee list,btohqsg
until the actual day of posting,btohqsg
Because got so many branches then when other branches don’t do their shit everything gets clogged up,btohqsg
Is Maj Joshua someone from cda,btohqsg
bugger comes down every 3 months,btohqsg
BFFT is quite literally only from BRT tho lol,btohqsg
I think CDA discipline should be quite strict,btohqsg
Like my office is more lax,btohqsg
Good thing I didn’t get posted there,btohqsg
CDA can be q slack la,btohqsg
@chemcerdyk which uk unis have good bio programs,btohqsg
So you worked at CDA last time?,btohqsg
we at CDA over here working OT cause HRD refuses to give us more ppl,btohqsg
Can do stuff like sleeping in office?,btohqsg
meanwhile those buggers fuck off on the dot,btohqsg
My branch has too many ppl lol,btohqsg
Idk why they not distributing the recruits to places where they need them,btohqsg
Ic my place also like that,btohqsg
and whoever heads it still doesn't know how to do their jov,btohqsg
Did yours allow you to do so,btohqsg
lol  back when i was in SCDF  the HRD part that deals w NSFs only had 1 major & 1 NSF,btohqsg
Also what does he do when he comes,btohqsg
no but we had different offices,btohqsg
My branch has more than 30 ppl,btohqsg
My point is the people given these opportunities don't see it as one and instead see it as a chore. So they are ignoring these chores in their mind.No sane person would ignore opportunities. That's all,btohqsg
split the BRT trainees into BFFT and EMT training lor,btohqsg
and deal with the OOC ppl,btohqsg
Like you just go to another office where your officer isn’t in?,btohqsg
I still don’t know what’s BFFT,btohqsg
Then I don’t get why they can’t move more ppl elsewhere,btohqsg
how do u not know what's bfft HAHAHA,btohqsg
I only heard of emt but I don’t know acronym for firefighting is efft,btohqsg
i go into a PERS office,btohqsg
and all of them wld be sleeping,btohqsg
Good thing it’s overstuffed I guess so I can slack more,btohqsg
this is why GST is increaing,btohqsg
If I’m not needed pls give me pes F,btohqsg
Opportunity cost of NS is higher than my NS salary,btohqsg
Im not saying they will accept or deny the opportunity  all I'm saying is they should and would acknowledge the fact a opportunity did come to them,btohqsg
you'd be surprised how many ppl ignore opportunities,btohqsg
Or is it cos you cda,btohqsg
no we get shoved shitty cookhouse food,btohqsg
So maybe that’s why no meal allowance,btohqsg
and we pay for canteen meals on our own dime,btohqsg
Even cheaper than acjc canteen lol,btohqsg
I took full day leave tdy,btohqsg
I think this is what he's saying,btohqsg
Hes saying that people don't know how to recognise opportunities,btohqsg
But see them as like troublesome,btohqsg
Using the examples of the business thing,btohqsg
Cause iw get as little days in office before my pcc,btohqsg
"there is a world where people miss out on opportunities on reasons apart from ""lazy""",btohqsg
don't project your own inability onto the world,btohqsg
I'm not surprised if you have not realised it by now  because too many people mistake opportunities to improve as chores or added work.,btohqsg
maybe that's just the ppl around you?,btohqsg
But yeah she in office tdy,btohqsg
the world is bigger than yourself or the ppl around you and the school you're in,btohqsg
So you are saying I got a unlucky spawn,btohqsg
"no don't use ""luck"" as an excuse",btohqsg
you're saying no sane person would miss out on opportunities,btohqsg
but if you're not even open to the opinions of others and open to improving yourself and listening to others,btohqsg
how are you even supposed to see these opportunities,btohqsg
Who says I'm not  where did that assumption come from,btohqsg
how come my buddy in hall  whom parents never got more than PSLE  and are living in a rented 2 room flat  is still able to get to university and do well,btohqsg
if you say you are  then bloody act like it,btohqsg
"stop giving us excuses like you're ""unlucky""",btohqsg
im gonna eat at 1 i think,btohqsg
this module is going to fucking murder me,btohqsg
werent you complaining about RP denying you of opportunity yet your grades are plastered with Cs,btohqsg
"You honestly think I actually think it's cause I'm ""unlucky""  no way I will ever think that.I own my mistakes and have made efforts to correct it. You don't see me repeating questions and it's always a new form of questions everytime. Can't I be inquisitive  is there a problem?",btohqsg
ppl complaining that life is unfair,btohqsg
u ownself say one dun say i say,btohqsg
I never said it denied me specifically  that is what y'all constantly think I meant,btohqsg
those are rookie numbers (i slept a proper number of hours last night),btohqsg
youll be unlucky in life but your actions can minimise your misfoortune,btohqsg
if u think abt it life is an rng game,btohqsg
ya life is unfair  life can be unfair,btohqsg
Yea I know I said it become you can't tell it's not meant to be taken seriously,btohqsg
but if you wallow your fucking life away,btohqsg
"your life will always be ""unfair"" and ""unlucky""",btohqsg
Idk why whenever I bring a point across people keep thinking I have a fixed mind and won't ever change  it baffles me. Maybe is just how I phrase the questions,btohqsg
okay then tell us seriously  what are you doing to improve your life and your outlook in life,btohqsg
i dont think talking on sge telegram is a way to pick up skills,btohqsg
bluffed into quads  jammed qq into kk  raised top top into a set etc,btohqsg
I love how we turned this into a personal attack on Ryan,btohqsg
start 5 wars lose all of them,btohqsg
i understand nothing but just pretend i said something related,btohqsg
because I don't intend to want to flame u or anything but I'm genuinely curious that you say you're open  you say all these big things  but what have you done for yourself to help yourself to get out of the situation you deem yourself to be in,btohqsg
if you don't want to share in a group of 2585 members,btohqsg
I feel hes just sharing an observation abt life LOL,btohqsg
idt its a philosophy he personally subscribes to (i hope not),btohqsg
"but whatever we've been saying is not based on ""assumptions""  but inferences from what you've said",btohqsg
Finish up my internship  do well for my fyp. Get my grades  chart a career with my strengths and work on my known weaknesses.That is it,btohqsg
i keep thinking when ppl say fyp they mean for you page and not first year,btohqsg
u r on tiktok too much,btohqsg
yeah mb i forgot what it was,btohqsg
I keep reiterating this but y'all constantly think I'm bsing,btohqsg
no im just confused why u think people nowadays are treating opportunities as chores,btohqsg
But then u deflected it with weird examples,btohqsg
ill just try ah but within two months like abit crunch,btohqsg
no we're calling bs on shit like this,btohqsg
i rmb begging my parents to get it for me and they sad no,btohqsg
i have that poly student buff (they gave me the entire cloud for free),btohqsg
Real world examples showed me  idk if it has been skewed cause of my friend group or anything that is what I've constantly seen,btohqsg
ive been tryharding photoshop the past months,btohqsg
i feel like its the cliche generation hate type stuff,btohqsg
im guessing its just ur friendgrp,btohqsg
ur friend grp has caused u to have a very skewed perception of life and u involuntarily accepted that as a principle for living,btohqsg
i feel like the only time ppl treat their opportunities as chores is when they dont want to put in the effort to make the most out of it,btohqsg
which is why even though u consciously think you are not doing so  your own actions and words subconsciously say otherwise,btohqsg
bc if u rlly want the chance  itll only feel like a hassle if u feel its not worth it or ur lazy to actually put the work in,btohqsg
and my whole ass point is that the world is bigger than you and your friends  if you or your circle of friends treat opportunities as chores  then too bad you're missing out  because every opportunity that I come across is oversubscribed by my peers,btohqsg
and should i generalise that because my peers are so cutthroat  the whole world is cutthroat?,btohqsg
"i wish people stop applying for things I apply for then i stop getting comments like""Oh wow you are the first non-RI student that made it this far for this batch""",btohqsg
if you view the world through your friendgroup thats a massive skill issue,btohqsg
im not saying be extroverted but make people want to gravitate to you,btohqsg
Ive only seen two people from this gc irl before,btohqsg
yeah thats what i meant mb LOL,btohqsg
DEFINITELY a good strategy (hell no),btohqsg
one is someguy who left alr,btohqsg
KURO DOESNT KNOW HOW I LOOK LIKE,btohqsg
come let’s make it a third,btohqsg
i don't even need to go back too far to find another instance of you generalising the entire bloody population,btohqsg
I did think  the sample size was above a dozen. But idk what is happening in their workplaces but many friends I know turn down invitations to functions or events because they are lazy  tired  don't feel like going etc.That is why I had that thinking,btohqsg
the world how many people ah,btohqsg
tbf i go NUS too so it’s feasible later on,btohqsg
definitely alot more than a dozen,btohqsg
Yea cause that is what I've grown up seeing with my own eyes  you realise none of my statements have been generalized to any group,btohqsg
i need more irl friends thx,btohqsg
bro then the fuck si this,btohqsg
id travel to ntu just to use the field,btohqsg
that is EXACTLY what generalising is,btohqsg
youre taking data from a largely biased sample and extrapolating it to mean the entire population,btohqsg
"no i don't realise that  because ""people"" doesn't mean the things you've seen with your own eyesif u mean smth different from what others mean  then maybe it's a phrasing issue that you need to work on  and not how everyone else interprets what you say",btohqsg
I didnt go for my NTU interview,btohqsg
but thats cause my long term plan literally never involved me going to NTU,btohqsg
Seems very much like a phrasing issue  and how I phrase certain statements comes across as ok while others seem confrontational,btohqsg
Sample size less than 30 h2 math says that sample is unreliable,btohqsg
h2 math is the holy grail of math,btohqsg
anything that is not h2 math is not math,btohqsg
facts (i wanna take h2 math),btohqsg
i tried learning jc math but i cant understand the fucking binomial bs,btohqsg
the issue isn't that you'reconfrontational  the issue is that the way you phrase things make you sound like you're generatlising the entire population based on waht you've seen in the ~20 short years  even though you've been living in a country that's thrice your age and a modern world many times your age,btohqsg
what is a n choose r 😡,btohqsg
she C on my N till i R,btohqsg
she N on my P till i R,btohqsg
I mean like this statement  I just needed to clarify and that was settled,btohqsg
einstein didnt fuck his cousin for this,btohqsg
how do u become a teacher without liking kids,btohqsg
And this statement actually led to a good discussion I felt,btohqsg
"every time i pass by the tp daycare i look at the children and go ""LITTLE CHINESE BOY""",btohqsg
I think ryan what happens is that u ask a very general statement then u make it seem like its something true. But when it goes on into further discussions  especially for things you're not super familiar with  it becomes even more confusing what youre trying to get at,btohqsg
not sleeping is catching up to me,btohqsg
im gna sleep after this dumb class,btohqsg
Just don’t teach pre/pri/sec sch lol,btohqsg
But he’s going to be one,btohqsg
for ite hn students who want to eae  if iw to submit portfolio must i make a site myself and post my stuff on it or can i use any portfolio site,btohqsg
Wtf is wrong with iOS autocorrect,btohqsg
I need to finish an incident report today,btohqsg
And he hopes that moe posts him to a jc next time but if he’s forced to go to a sec sch  too bad,btohqsg
i mean depends on course i guess??,btohqsg
"some nsmen went to complain to MINDEF that in his reservist unit he got ""pushed""",btohqsg
what portfolio u want to show,btohqsg
google sites is a popular choice,btohqsg
