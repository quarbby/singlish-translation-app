After proceeding u can find ur number of ballot and details,btohqsg
Lol-ed at thishttps://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/18z52yf/hfe_wont_be_reassessed_during_key_collection/Seems like HFE can be reassessed upon request,btohqsg
I can understand the grant amount being fixed but not the loan amount partUnder HLE  loan eligibility is reassessed when nearing key collection and this makes sense as ability to pay a loan may have changed by the time the flat is ready few years laterIn case a person has decreased income or lost job for prolonged period  one spouse decides to stay at home etc but doesn't ask for reassessment of HFE due to desperation of getting a flat  isn't HDB putting themselves at more risks?Unless there is a clause about false declaration or compulsory to update if income decreased when nearer key collection etc that is legally binding somewhere?Then again... Watching the HFE system crashed when it was first launched last year and how the SimplyGo saga unfolded recently... Bit no telling what the government is thinking these days,btohqsg
The answer  will be out when the time come,btohqsg
ballot results for dec bto is not out yet right?,btohqsg
Hi itâ€™s not i think it will be through email,btohqsg
The more feedback it get maybe faster ?,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone here confirm whether a reassessment of income will be done (during key collection) if one is to apply as 1 student and 1 working adult now. The student will be working full time soon as such there will be 2 incomes instead.This is for HFE. Iâ€™ve called in several times but none of them is able to provide a concrete answer.,btohqsg
When is your estimated key collection?,btohqsg
Of course can bro  4 years is a long time for them to peg it to your initial letter loan amouny,btohqsg
They need to release grant early cause booking flat got DP so grant release first,btohqsg
2029 if all succeed  we are still waiting for the results which is in feb,btohqsg
Which is for people who have been employed aka students prior HLE  cause their HLE will be NO EHG eligibility,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve called in in regards to this context three times and none can provide me a â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜noâ€™ answer. So would like to ask if anyone knows or in the same situation,btohqsg
Do you think SBF applicants who use HFE can give feedback?Like  waiting time long enough for them to request reassess their loan eligibilityNot familiar with SBF process  ha haUsed to apply SBF but ended up getting my future place through BTO,btohqsg
Theirs is HFE... Should avoid dragging HLE inHFE is supposed to paint the entire picture... Grant  loanWhereas HLE is only for the loan partGrant is assessed separately,btohqsg
Anyone has group link for Bidadari Bartley green rise?,btohqsg
went for selection yesterday - officer said that no changes to loan amount even if income increase and will follow HFE letter. i did not even ask and she mentioned it so they must have been receiving many inquiries regarding this,btohqsg
Did the officer mention anything about if income becomes lesser?Maybe need people to uproar like it was done for SimplyGo ðŸ«¢,btohqsg
"Oh ok  thanks~Anyway  let us all keep an open mind...Who knows  they might decide to do reassessment next time or maybe there is such a thing as ""upon request""Actually  bit sianz about the ambiguityLike  does HFE really help people who want to get their own house",btohqsg
Asking for a friend does anyone know what the right circled portion mean?,btohqsg

gable end wall  it protects corner units from sg heat or smth,btohqsg
out of curiosity  anyone have experience with these walls  do they work?,btohqsg
hello  i applied when we both are students and realised the moderate loan amount is only $187 700 and the maximum is $263 500 despite having $0 income. can i check if anyone has the same amount and will this mean our income assessment is deferred? donâ€™t want to have to pay $500k in cash hahahaha,btohqsg
If you applied while you're both full time students the deferred income assessment scheme should automatically apply,btohqsg
ahhh but then why does it state that we are eligible for this amount of loan even even we havenâ€™t worked for twelve months or is this the default,btohqsg
Sorry  I'm not familiar with the HFE application page. Maybe you can check with HDB directly to confirm,btohqsg
Hi anybody got this spare toilet floor tiles available?,btohqsg
Whats the combined income to get $560k loan approval from HDB?,btohqsg
Your annual income combine need to Hit around $126K,btohqsg
Hi  anyone able to advise how to upload documents for HFE letter? I'm having issue uploading into the system,btohqsg
Maybe you can try asking in your project Telegram or fb group,btohqsg
I got a question about the option fee  is it possible to just get the default door without flooring or is it a set (must get door and flooring),btohqsg
choice 1: floorchoice 2: doors and toilet basins and showertoilet bowl and main door is given by defaultu can choose either choice 1 or choice 2 or none or both,btohqsg
For referencing - My appt timing was 930am and we were called in approx 929am! There was one before us.,btohqsg
Option fee and Optional Component Scheme (OCS) are 2 different things...?,btohqsg
Option fee is what you have to pay when you select your flatIf I'm not wrong  the amounts are:4rm and above is 2k3rm is 1k2rm is 500Optional component scheme is opting in to flooring / doors / sanitary fittings. Most projects will have OCS  but the details of OCS will be project by project,btohqsg
Then most likely is stick to time bah.,btohqsg
Any admins here approving the development progress photos at btohq,btohqsg
Wonder if we can apply for the Feb sbf when we already apply for the Dec bto,btohqsg
Is your queue out of supply? If yes can.,btohqsg
Think the results not out yet it say Feb,btohqsg
Out of supply as in ?I Saw unit list in hdb say85 so U meant mine ballot number is 86 and above then it's out of supply,btohqsg
Ya letâ€™s say there are 100 units  if your number is like 200  you can apply. Thatâ€™s my understanding of the new rules,btohqsg
Dec BTO result isnâ€™t out yet right?,btohqsg
Hopefully we can get to see the result Tmrw,btohqsg
Anyone know when will Tengah SBF come out?,btohqsg
Oh so fast can see results?,btohqsg
If I get 101 number so I suppose I'm out of the range?,btohqsg
