Nvr expect the uno reverse card to play on me in uni,btohqsg
Final stage of studying life:Meets physics,btohqsg
Ppl who say is easier than jc are closet muggers,btohqsg
But it also depends on the cohort performance,btohqsg
But the score range between the top 15% of the cohort and the next 85% is very bigEg. Ppl who scored 30/80 gettin A  but ppl who scored 55/80 also ended up with an A too.,btohqsg
Any one can explain simple cell of electrolysis chapter? Thanks.,btohqsg
2 electrodes made from different metals in solutions containing the respective metal cations  and wires from electrodes with voltmeter in between,btohqsg
More reactive metal electrode oxidises and hence is the anode. The other is the cathode. Electrons flow from anode to cathode. Voltmeter registers a reading.,btohqsg
I dont understand why hydrogen ions accept electrons to form hydrogen,btohqsg
I thought copper is less reactive than hydrogen,btohqsg
Copper won’t oxidise because zinc  being more reactive than copper  oxidises instead,btohqsg
Hence copper electrode is the cathode,btohqsg
Metals can’t be reduced. So copper remains intact,btohqsg
U might wanna look at the d orbital,btohqsg
Hmm I don’t think this is A levels,btohqsg
This one just swallow it for now. I ask my teacher the same qn when I was sec 3,btohqsg
One person msg can't get thru,btohqsg
There’s no copper ions in the electrolyte,btohqsg
It's actually magical cos it can be used as a noun  a verb  a pronoun  an adjective ...,btohqsg
H is negative in this case,btohqsg
? I said metals can’t be reduced,btohqsg
H is negative if it’s metal hydride,btohqsg
They should ask the teacher can hydrogen be both cation and anion,btohqsg
Just look at relative ease of discharge table,btohqsg
And ask yourself what ions are present at the electrodes,btohqsg
And look at whether it's electrolytic cell or...,btohqsg
In the example you stated  hydrogen ions and zinc ions are present at the cathode  hydrogen ions will be reduced since on the relative ease of discharge series H+ is lower than Zn2+  so H+ is preferentially reduced.,btohqsg
As simple as that  no need to complicate things further.,btohqsg
So if you were confused by 2 ppl above  hopefully this sums it up succintly,btohqsg
I figured there were misconceptions so hence i explained,btohqsg
I saw 'metals can't be reduced' i got triggered alr,btohqsg
Enjoy ur studies before u go out and work ur lungs out,btohqsg
But considerin u are quite smart,btohqsg
I wish I m in hawaii,btohqsg
U will be the bell curve wrecker,btohqsg
So i can see why u made that comment,btohqsg
Okay you tell me how metals are reduced to anions :),btohqsg
Thanks. I understand now. Can you give any more example of this for more clear understanding.,btohqsg
U nvr know  it may be possible :)Source: Uni,btohqsg
I think pure chem textbook quite good alr,btohqsg
When u throw the metal into the sun,btohqsg
It gets reduced so fast it vaporized,btohqsg
But yes metals cant be reduced.. under normal conditions,btohqsg
I thought it just vaporise haha,btohqsg
Reduction from the hydrogen in sun issit,btohqsg
Actually  what is the core of the sun made of ah,btohqsg
This remind me of that time I laugh until I drew my sister out of the window,btohqsg
Yup. Nuclear fusion stops at iron,btohqsg
Why won't the iron vaporise ah,btohqsg
Hydrogen to helium all the way till iron,btohqsg
