What they don't tell you: Your pop and bang map isn't anti-lag and it isn't doing anything for your car's performance ❌🙈Pop and bang  or crackle tune - call it what you like  but it doesn't add to the performance of your car. Oh  and it doesn't sound good to most people either.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
