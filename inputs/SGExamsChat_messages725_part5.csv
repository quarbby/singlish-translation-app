Elitism is usually not from the top,btohqsg
Na ITE there's 1000% a stigma,btohqsg
My jc friend fine with ite ppl ah,btohqsg
nono because i have ri friends who deadass talks trash about poly ite students and double digit pointer jcs,btohqsg
Fine is one thing its more on if they treat u equally bro,btohqsg
"most of them would literally be like ""oh they exist""stop assuming that ""elite"" jc = elitistmost people just want to mind their own business",btohqsg
Can someone say this to my nightmare of a classmate this sem,btohqsg
How. Cuz any discussion about academics between both is like tryna avoid the elephant in the room,btohqsg
like sometimes the ite friends need help with sch work the poly and jc peeps will help,btohqsg
And sometimes my friend need help with jc hist ill help,btohqsg
I meant like study buddies those kind the gap is too big liao tbh and the content diffs too much,btohqsg
iÊ¼ve hung out with some of my RI friends and they actually point and laugh at lower cop jcs and ite students (when they wear their uniforms),btohqsg

i mean u can ask them help with proj wat,btohqsg
poly students dont wear uniform leh  how to identify,btohqsg
that's why my ite friends do,btohqsg
ITE at least for me don't have projects one,btohqsg
yeah if that then point and laugh lor,btohqsg
i think there is some level of disconnect even if all sides are nice and non judgmental,btohqsg
this is not a RI problem,btohqsg
this is a your friends problem,btohqsg
I wore my ITE uniform to uni and they ask me if I was at the right place,btohqsg
yours is friends first then go these schs or afterwards,btohqsg
as someone in ite i have no comments  u have the super smart ppl and those who heck care bout their studies. environment wise is actly quite okay. facilities is actly nice untill some jokers decided to destroy it e.g  the toilet.,btohqsg
u are trying to have an intellectual discussion with an 07 kid,btohqsg
My CC1 topic and essay was literally on that,btohqsg
u should not have intellectual discussions with ur own batchmates,btohqsg
So my presentation I was making a point.,btohqsg
but their friends all fine also,btohqsg
Then again i feel the SAJC peeps are actually damn chill,btohqsg
U haven't seen the boys one,btohqsg
Wait till ppl here abt my case,btohqsg
i am talking bout the boys one. i saw on tiktok,btohqsg
So yeah in fact the joke for me was that should I take Nlevels to get all the seab certs.,btohqsg
Some bitch with A in the mod laugh at someone with A also,btohqsg
Blue Green Yellow all combined as one,btohqsg
Imagine a A student calling another A student undeserving of A,btohqsg
yo is anyone else coming for carnival tmr,btohqsg
to get all n level certs,btohqsg
and make noise to class and to all lecturers,btohqsg
That's the only cert I don't have,btohqsg
Maybe I take 6 Nlevels private candidate just to screw with the bellcurve,btohqsg
Na bro the actual experience is different,btohqsg
I don't dare to even bring my phone there,btohqsg
If it drops on the floor,btohqsg
