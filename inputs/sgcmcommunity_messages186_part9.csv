Also ask me if I want to trade in my car instead,btohqsg

Loan I feel should only go with the external financiers. In-house loans usually many T&Cs and not as transparent,btohqsg
They have a list of financial like DBS   UOB   HL to choose from.,btohqsg
But car comms still have some,btohqsg
Why earn one comms when u can earn 2 comms,btohqsg
But I do not want to take loans,btohqsg
Find one salesman who dont want comms lor,btohqsg
My friend bought 2 cars for himself and wife . Also full payment,btohqsg

I have 2 cars for trade in   but need to bring wife along . She the finance minister in the house,btohqsg
If on set u say no loan  they will adjust price to max without discount to make up for the lost in comms,btohqsg
If they calculate for u based on 60/40  then u say full payment  they cannot increase the price,btohqsg
My friend says must see the short fall . Then decide whether to continue to proceed . I learn something today from a friend .,btohqsg
From the start   just talk as per  the sales of the vehicle . Then later on inform no loan . Then see the gap   from there negotiate the deal to get the best deal .,btohqsg
Or u just tell them cut their crap,btohqsg

My friend says buying without loan also must get some decent discount . Cost saving .,btohqsg

Some dealers just say no loan penalty 2 or 3k?,btohqsg
2 to 3 k loan   let say 3k . Monthly for 7 yrs only $36,btohqsg
I think an insult to the financial companies,btohqsg
Maybe the paper cost more than the 3k,btohqsg
Is normal  some AD also quote us the price with the assumption that we taking their in-house loan and insurance,btohqsg
Then when you say you will find your own insurance and won't take loan  they will mark up the price,btohqsg
do you know how much they will mark up?,btohqsg
always see promo price alot of T&C's at AD,btohqsg
But it all depends on. If the sales man is far from his quota   and it is a confirmed deal . He may want to secure it,btohqsg
Some will indicate in their brochure. They always quote us the lowest price but if we don't follow all the prerequisite  will have the rebates removed,btohqsg
You can get 2.28% currently from hyundai. Eir around 4.5%,btohqsg
