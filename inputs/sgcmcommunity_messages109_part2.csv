Basket! I was driving along the SLE n slowed down at the speed cam to 88km/hr then kena flash - J,btohqsg
I return back  drive at 85km/hr also kena flash - J üò°,btohqsg
The speed limit there is 80?,btohqsg
Most speed cam zones 80 or 60 from what I've seen,btohqsg
it's  normal. If you do a search. That camera üì∏ something like this. But don't think you will receive letter.https://youtu.be/mkwj-PuFR9A,btohqsg
No wonder the traffic comes to a crawl there,btohqsg
Maybe phantom driving very fast beside u,btohqsg
Hahaha don‚Äôt worry! I kena also ü§£,btohqsg
Did you smile for the cam? ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
You know the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results..?,btohqsg
Okay but on a serious note  is this why people slow down all the way to like 70 or even 60 on BKE?,btohqsg
But if your meter points at 85km/hr  your speed isn't. Its lower.,btohqsg
Idk why people don‚Äôt know how to look,btohqsg
But the speed limit is 90,btohqsg
People thought it‚Äôs the same as the PIE one,btohqsg
KPE is just a sad series of bad planning,btohqsg
But the BKE one‚Ä¶people keep slowing waaaaaay down  which annoys me so much,btohqsg
But but‚Ä¶ what if I use larger rims with higher profile tyres!! ü§ì,btohqsg
That depends on your level of over read though,btohqsg
Larger more better!!!! Smaller gap to fender too. Like cool only!,btohqsg
That reminds me of a story,btohqsg
A man was driving down the road. He passed a traffic camera and saw it flash.Astounded he had been caught speeding when he was doing the speed limit  he turned around and  going even slower  he passed the camera.Again he saw it flash. He couldn‚Äôt believe it!So he turned and  going at a snail‚Äôs pace  he passed the camera.Again he saw the camera flash. He guessed it must be faulty  so home he went.Four weeks later he received three traffic fines in the mail  all for not wearing a seat belt.,btohqsg
Lol. I always wear my seat belt!,btohqsg
