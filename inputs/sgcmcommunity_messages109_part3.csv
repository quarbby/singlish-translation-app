I work at an oil change shop,btohqsg
Curious how does the qn 'is there rust on the car' let you know whether the guy is a true car enthusiast,btohqsg
True car enthusiast will just send for PPI,btohqsg
You tell me car no rust I also won't believe  so I don't bother to ask,btohqsg
To be honest my fc is 6.5km/L. Wouldn’t consider it a gas guzzler haha,btohqsg
"Imagine a VW Kombi from the 60s spotting ""EVS1L"" plate in SG on classic veh scheme",btohqsg
His is 4L V8!!!! 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
Some other brands I’ve seen cars get to 4+KM/L,btohqsg
It all depends on how the cars are tuned la,btohqsg
Tuning?? I heard someone say illegal leh,btohqsg
I think his m3 no need tune bah already so high performance le. Unless he wants to do the VROOOMMMM PAP PAP PAP PAP PAP,btohqsg
Tuning is just adjusting air fuel ratio and firing timing,btohqsg
Yeap. Optimisation is the best. Like computers softwares and stuff. Most cars arent optimised nowadays. Optimise is not equivalent to meeting emission standards.. sometimes😂,btohqsg
"Problem with lower powered cars <2L displacement  is that the stock hardware severely limits how ""hard"" you can tune",btohqsg
And many times to make the car perform to the owner's satisfaction have to use some gray area mods and straight up illegal mods,btohqsg
hi  need advice on car insurance. the brokers recommend comprehensive plans from NTUC  Bubblegum (MoneySmart) and Etiqa with similar coverage  so far anyone with plans from these companies? thanks!,btohqsg
Get a quote from budget direct also,btohqsg
They don't use brokers so usually they won't appear,btohqsg
moneysmart i tot got singlife also?,btohqsg
if not try sgcarmart insurance quotes also,btohqsg
i tried sgcarmart  motorist  moneysmart..my current is with DirectAsia  and they are even higher than the 3 quoted.. have not tried Budget  will ask them,btohqsg
I think depends on what we are trying to optimise it for. Hahahahahha. Manufacturer deliver the engine also optimised for different target from enthusiasts,btohqsg
Manufacturer usually under tune from engine maximum potential to suit emmision standards,btohqsg
As a side effect  which is good for them also  the wear of the car is less,btohqsg
better for owners too... there's a compromise usually between reliability and performance,btohqsg
funny are those who squeeze performance and whack the car  then complain car lame. Keep leaking or breaking down,btohqsg
I am sure the engineers who designed and built the powerplant know what they're doing with all the CAD and fluid dynamics computations they do,btohqsg
I was surprised too  my forester xt already 7,btohqsg
I no say  u guys assumed hahahaha,btohqsg
Hahaha still can tune even without pap pap pap,btohqsg

hmm  I've heard/read NA engines dont get much from a tune  turbo seems to have a better overall result. Do you have any experience on that?,btohqsg
Forced induction engines get more margin to play with because they can vary the induction pressure,btohqsg
That opportunity came about when you bought your car,btohqsg
