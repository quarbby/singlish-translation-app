Amos Group (formerly known as Gaylin) recently proposed to issue rights at $0.0135. This counter has been super illiquid and there is only 1 reason why. This counter used to be trading $0.6x at one point before the oil and gas sector took a beating and so did they and many are stucked at above $0.20 and thus no buyers and sellers at current price range. Currently  the majority owners are a PE group  Shawkwei & partners. They bought this company at $0.050 in 2018.This time round  after the successful rights issue  their cost will drop to be about $0.0325.More importantly with this proposed rights issue  what they will do for the counter is that it creates liquidity at the current price range. From there anything can happen.All those circled I consider them to be prior accumulation. I think they might already have been chosen by BBs to be played. It will be an opportune time to do so as there have been a lot of P&D by BBs on illiquid games. Also  similar to what happened for HLH.Pump to get subscriber,btohqsg
Added some last week $0.016. I reckon safe price since the proposed rights issue $0.0135. Also not much selling pressure for this counter. Very light now. DYODD. This one illiquid  if play likely need to hold. If in the money   OTOT thanks.,btohqsg
