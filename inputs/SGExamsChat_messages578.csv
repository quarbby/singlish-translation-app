hmm I sent a friend before,btohqsg
1) Sponsor - might have strong financial backing. Capitaland  Keppel  Mapletree comes to mind here.Aims REIT was originally meant as a turnaround play for me that worked well2) NAV - Ideally get below NAV. It's like buying a property below its actual price.Bonus if the NAV was due to property valuation that wasn't as updated  and is SG property. Because valuations should have gone up by now.3) Yield. To take the risks  we need higher yield. This varies according to the types of properties as well.Industrial should be the highest as the lease is usually lower at least for within SG. Followed by offices  then malls.Hospitals usually lowest. Exception was FIRST Reit who sold their SG hospitals and moved to Indo  and kenna big time from their sponsors there.4) Gearing. Don't want a REIT that borrowed too much  like that kenna high interest  and no room for expansion.Don't want a REIT that borrowed too little  that means leverage not enough. Most REITs do this well  so no issue.5) Geographical. I like SG related ones as we can see. Capital China Trust was an exception as I wanted some exposure to China  but indirectly. I don't really like US and Europe ones last time  and so far proven correct unfortunately for those who bought in.6) Anchor tenants concentration. Generally if the anchor tenant is a major portion of the rental income  this is a major risks if the anchor tenant decides to stop. The reit that kenna big time was Sabana reit. At that time  they also restrict themselves to being Shariah Compliant  which was really dumb imo. They probably realised that years later  and finally stopped.If the anchor tenant is also the sponsor  then there may also be a risk of preferential treatment. Again Sabana reit comes to mind here.7) WALE ‚Äî Weighted Average Lease Expiry. Lease renewal should be what we look for in a higher interest rate environment. Such an environment generally will see lease renewed at higher rates.,btohqsg
Add on to that  I also noticed a perfect technical falling wedge set up that matches a support level from earlierso I went all in,btohqsg
intention is to keep it for years though. It's worth at least $1,btohqsg
this is just more for a final check,btohqsg
on hindsight  it is more limiting in terms of tenant profile,btohqsg
u want people to fight for your limited space to have higher rental,btohqsg
anyway those are my checklist for reits.Companies are trickier and I'm far from mastering itSo far I have been lucky with Keppel Corp and unlucky with Hyflux perpetual bonds,btohqsg
my mum says being pondan means you are LQBTQ,btohqsg
What do i do if im freaking out for my o level results,btohqsg
Its in like 2 months üò≠,btohqsg
what uve done is ur best,btohqsg
let it go and just wait for the results of ur hard work,btohqsg
like something u never tried before,btohqsg
i not going watch your reels anymore,btohqsg
(im sorry malisa pls watch my reels dont ghost me üíî),btohqsg
idk how indepth u wanna go but i guess python is always good,btohqsg
Attending red camp was amazing but the anxiety got to me again,btohqsg
go n google how to download python and learn how to code,btohqsg
python not simple to learn (maybe cos i'm dumb),btohqsg
Does all engineering courses now have to learn coding btw,btohqsg
If ur whole life is just working u will forget everything else,btohqsg
I got rejected 3/5 jobs i applied for,btohqsg
Wait what r u applying for that u can get rejected,btohqsg
As a 16 y/o idk what to put in my resume üòê,btohqsg
but that means u got 2 offers? good what,btohqsg
I've only ever worked at wingstop,btohqsg
I just begged at the feet of people,btohqsg
Okay but ngl of the 4 jobs I did,btohqsg
wait no its dior  chanel and ysl,btohqsg
u hv to do a resume ???,btohqsg
I mean i applied through fastjobs,btohqsg
i hv no idea‚Ä¶ i use fastjobs,btohqsg
highest education  ability to work at fast pace environments???,btohqsg
imagine not having a 11 inch destroyer in ur pants,btohqsg
anything in STEM and it's expanding beyond that,btohqsg
I no holiday dog.. ehh idk 1 month?,btohqsg
tbh anything nowadays can be coded,btohqsg
shut up ah dog natalie tan xiaoming,btohqsg
Are we including the guys who are more feminine when they interact but still are masculine when needed,btohqsg
in sch we only learnt vba,btohqsg
not really. ntu mae dont need to learn,btohqsg
my friend from ntu mech say he no need learn,btohqsg
i mean i'm looking at the curriculum rn,btohqsg
plus my sis grad from ntu mae,btohqsg
nah sometimes the curriculum not updated one. even im in eee and they are not following their own curriculum lol,btohqsg
the aeronautical is the one u dont even think of going,btohqsg
i found the 22/23 one also,btohqsg
I saw it under one of the poly's diploma listing,btohqsg
like there's no way they'd remove it lol,btohqsg
Apparently can only get in through DAE,btohqsg
And idk how DAE works but,btohqsg
whats the cut off point now lol,btohqsg
my time was like 13 raw to get in,btohqsg
They say DAE they nv state any points one,btohqsg
I heard there was a infamous Dr loke in ntu,btohqsg
that‚Äôs weird. my friend who is literally y1s1 not taking,btohqsg
If my o levels fr cmi,btohqsg
or their schedule change to y2,btohqsg
like i fr doubt they'd remove it bc it's so necessary for so long,btohqsg
maybe. i ask him if he is taking any programming mods  he said no. idk haha,btohqsg
tbh if u think u struggling in o lvl den no point go eng leh,btohqsg
the numbers gonna fk u up,btohqsg
like my faculty also recently changed their schedule and shifted the y1s1 coding mod to y1s2,btohqsg
to accommodate a lot of cc mods,btohqsg
but i tbh cannot think of any other courses tht interest me much,btohqsg
if u legit dk i think there is common engineering?,btohqsg
between civil  eee  envt  materials and mech,btohqsg
yea but to think of it on a larger scale. I wld try gg for it but i also have to think i competing w ppl w lower points and prolly ite students also,btohqsg
But isok i try my luck nxt yr,btohqsg
oh u all talking about poly nvm,btohqsg
even if xxx uni or xxx poly course not teaching coding  doesn't mean u don't need to learn. think about what employers will look for,btohqsg
from what i heard  nus all courses now has at least one programming mod except for the social sciences,btohqsg
most of the time u need self learn coz your course just give u basic stuff,btohqsg
unless u com sci or com eng,btohqsg
Y coding so important. I mean i cannot pinpoint the main importance,btohqsg
even social sciences. u won't keep your job in psych or econs if u can't code your stats model,btohqsg
in short it helps to shorten the workload required,btohqsg
Would it be reccomended to also learn excel,btohqsg
I feel like alot of jobs req to use excel also,btohqsg
So i feel like if i pick up rn i can at least save myself some time during poly,btohqsg
gonna be useful when u writing reports,btohqsg
"there is even a ""microsoft excel world championship""",btohqsg
Im so glad i found this chat grp sia everytime i open and ask stuff i learn sth,btohqsg
no but i think nowadays new laptop give u free office,btohqsg
if not use your sch acc in poly,btohqsg
use google sheets - this one free,btohqsg
My laptop i buy 2020 but idk which year the model,btohqsg
i find google docs abit more clumsy than word docs,btohqsg
But right its so shit. Rn the hige broken. I send repair also no use same thing happen so its like stationary on my table. It runs so slow i cld say my grandmother can function faster,btohqsg
and idk how to fix the issue,btohqsg
just learn as much as u can  however u can,btohqsg
i scared later i learning python the computer crash,btohqsg
my mum learnt coding by reading a textbook and writing on pen n paper,btohqsg
Macbook overheats like crazy i heard,btohqsg
can one. whatever u have  just get started n try,btohqsg
if u havent gotten it already,btohqsg
i coded with a surface pro so,btohqsg
dont think youd suffer that much,btohqsg
Tdy iw to rest tho LOL so i start tmr,btohqsg
see u in the excel championship next yr!,btohqsg
all the finalists r asians. go figure,btohqsg
I can dream. But dreaming doesnt hurt,btohqsg
Firstly my math cannot be so rabak,btohqsg
I feel like its a stupid qn,btohqsg
I dropped amath at the start if the yr,btohqsg
uh comp sci some part got maths ish related but i dont think its a requirement,btohqsg
they teach maths to see how good your logic skills are,btohqsg
some mods got test maths stuff,btohqsg
Poly i heard the lecturer will still need to teach amath for the benefit of those who didnt take it,btohqsg
they will teach u maths one,btohqsg
have further maths as elective module,btohqsg
but after u ord all that info is forgotton,btohqsg
u thinking too much   wait for poly sch start first den see how,btohqsg
Thats like the most important thing for now i assume,btohqsg
i trying to enjoy but also i tend to be behind others all the time,btohqsg
we are all behind others in 1 way or another  it's totally normal,btohqsg
Iw to try and help myself which is the least i cld do,btohqsg
who‚Äôs the white haired biker girl w the cat in ur pfp,btohqsg
i would say for now practice ur amath,btohqsg
this is like ur last break break,btohqsg
okay i regret dropping amath sia but regret also no use,btohqsg
which poly course intending to go,btohqsg
Yea thts wht mny ppl told me also,btohqsg
did u look thru the mods,btohqsg
u like the name of the course no point if u dont like the modules of the course,btohqsg
I will force my sister to be my patient,btohqsg
my friend is a y3 opto,btohqsg
got a free eye check up,btohqsg
you ask some of the patients to get an eye check up,btohqsg
then you get their data and put it in your sch prac,btohqsg
i'll try to ask my fruend's sister in tht course,btohqsg
cuz he measured my right eye degree as 70 and left eye as 80,btohqsg
He still got a B+ LOL i guess he still manage to measure the 10 degree difference,btohqsg
Ukw idc. I'll marry a rich man,btohqsg
erm i think one of the modules is ethics üòÇ,btohqsg
I will politely invite my sister to sign up,btohqsg
or latex if you're feeling fancy,btohqsg
nah i was talking about mae but found out that mae also need. but yeah ntu eee also learns c and python,btohqsg
Yes but some group them together,btohqsg
my friend knows all of em surprisingly,btohqsg
they're the reason why i feel like its troublesome to have kids,btohqsg
Like generally teens who behave like tht,btohqsg
Genuinely i would disown my child and send for adoption if he/she becomes like tht,btohqsg
Jokes. I mean i wouldnt know how to approach them if they think being a rebel is cool,btohqsg
It surprises me how audacious they are. Kena police case must make capcut edit of the offence letter,btohqsg
Tbh i feel like being a rebel is mainly because they dont understand why their parents are strict on them but also sometimes the parents are at fault for going too hard not saying they must be too negligent,btohqsg
I was a rebel in P4,btohqsg
I got stripped off my prefect role LOL,btohqsg
act idk if i consider P4 rebel also. P4 nothing one P4 ppl scold me i cry,btohqsg
oh u r so wrong. My classmate was a rebel in P2,btohqsg
now got pri sch kid that vape also,btohqsg
The teacher screamed and shout at him he cursed at her,btohqsg
my sis is 12  she has one friend that forced her to put her pronouns in bio,btohqsg
i made my mom complain to sch,btohqsg
and i banned her from talking to the bitch,btohqsg
What do they know abt pronouns theyre 12. Literally kids no matter how much they want to argue,btohqsg
u sir will go far in life,btohqsg
some shit about supporting lgbt or sum,btohqsg
stfu what do u know about lgbt,btohqsg
he looks like the skinny version of guolai ngl,btohqsg
Idu why lgbt is being exposed to them at a young age. This is whh kids should be BANNED from tiktok,btohqsg
They should live in the musically era,btohqsg
It was all js funs and games,btohqsg
musically era hands down best era but i went broke w all the kendamas. Theyre now prolly sitting in semakau landfill,btohqsg
holy fuck bros making it to law/med sch,btohqsg
imagine having this much wisdom at what 10?,btohqsg
Though i would quite say the same thing,btohqsg
I got bullied in P6 for some stupid kpop  fruend grp drama they called me fake stans lah whatnot,btohqsg
Legit stupid i say they all no brain bruh,btohqsg
u have more wisdom than a lot of people my age which is essentially double yours,btohqsg
dude i wish i was fat as a kid,btohqsg
i appreciate not being a disgrace to the society,btohqsg
hit the gym and in 2 years ull be like,btohqsg
i was skinny to less skinny (dont dare call myself buff lol) and being skinny is hell,btohqsg
i got like thinner over time not cos i starve but prolly puberty,btohqsg
Eh no. I js actuvely engaged myself in sports in sec school,btohqsg
i also gym 5-6x a week and have mental illness,btohqsg
if only badminton accepted me in tho üëπ i will be UNSTOPPABLE,btohqsg
I just eat like a glutton 5-6x a week,btohqsg
i cant skip the gym any day or ill feel small n useless n downie,btohqsg
eating is a form of exercise,btohqsg
Gosh if only seoul garden also serve pastries üòç,btohqsg
why get rice when there's free flow porridge,btohqsg
Talking abt hdl  i rmb seeing some tiktok,btohqsg
Their lunch no longer mcd or 18 chef. Straight up hdl,btohqsg
the century egg porridge is better than most outside,btohqsg
while the physics students doing P2 now  I celebrating,btohqsg
cuz the girl getting beaten is dating a guy,btohqsg
and the guy is quite hot so like her friends r jealous,btohqsg
then the girl getting beaten also q xmm and like abit like whore idk,btohqsg
so the gang go call her slut then she not happy,btohqsg
then they argue until she kena whack,btohqsg
thats what i heard at least,btohqsg
the guys there r also pussies and retards,btohqsg
like if u dw get beaten at least call the police,btohqsg
idk how old they r but if they r 07,btohqsg
on the other hand the bar is set lower so i progress easier,btohqsg
my friend knows one of em,btohqsg
they r at least 07 la,btohqsg
bruh okder than 16 still so retarded?,btohqsg
like bro ur probably failing ur academics maybe go study or smt instead of bullying,btohqsg
man id square all of em up at once,btohqsg
my other friend knows all of em üóø,btohqsg
Poly got all sorts of ppl from all sorts of background ones,btohqsg
how t they 09 they dress like sluts,btohqsg
Is filming tiktoks at hdb staircases still a thing?,btohqsg
wonder how they gonna survive in society,btohqsg
i hope no retards in np üôè,btohqsg
maybe bc your sch very normal,btohqsg
then the ones you see become more obvious,btohqsg
everyone that wants to speak here needs to go through a rand screening,btohqsg
its aight alot of ppl alr called me that b4,btohqsg
i save 100 on a monthly basis so idk what he doing,btohqsg
go open a vault and do daily saving lor,btohqsg
i doing that for my korea trip in 2.5 years üòÇ,btohqsg
bleed the money then put it back in,btohqsg
it's OK. You are a student,btohqsg
100 go to transport 400 to eat or buy stuff,btohqsg
but then i do put 100 into my saving side of my pouch then if rly need then take lor,btohqsg
don't bother. Your fastest earning years is later on. And you will want to make sure you are well prepared and positioned for the acceleration,btohqsg
like im spending too much or too little,btohqsg
i think i sometimes too spendthrift,btohqsg
Not easy still upon grad. Majority of middle aged workers don't even hit that amount,btohqsg
i saw my friend using budgeting app to track her expenses then i adopted it and track daily lor,btohqsg
previously I tracked when I just graduated,btohqsg
on average I spent $900 per month,btohqsg
now I think family expenses hitting near $6k monthly.,btohqsg
I would think $20k though I'm far from it.But hey I work a lot less than those who earn that much,btohqsg
i ask my dad to give me cash then everytime i take the cash out every week my heart pain then i spend less HAHAHHA,btohqsg
but renting out my flat and moving in with in parents to take care of them,btohqsg
both if possible.Dividends are great for cash flow while waiting for the breakthrough,btohqsg
but I paused all these after wedding for 6 years. So slowed down. Else I might have hit 3k to 4k monthly alreadyThen again nothing good to buy few years ago also,btohqsg
now reits are very very attractive,btohqsg
some of the financial bloggers I know that are older  are hitting like $10k monthly just from dividends,btohqsg
key word: olderit took them near 2 decades to build up,btohqsg
but i think i abit the,btohqsg
key is don't don't don't get in credit card debt,btohqsg
yea my dad ask me get a credit card i too scared so i said no,btohqsg
that time don't know how to buy overseas one,btohqsg
last time buy all the overseas shares need pay monthly custodian fee,btohqsg
when i turn the legal LOL,btohqsg
local one very stable cash flow,btohqsg
7% to 10% for reits  lots of it now,btohqsg
I think hor  younger time don't need emergency fundsnow then I feel the need to have some,btohqsg
parents can still provide emergency fundsBest time to chiong,btohqsg
now I putting more into ssb,btohqsg
these are my semi emergency funds,btohqsg
yea my mom told me this too when she got me my first card as a supplementary,btohqsg
i lowkey wish i interested in finance,btohqsg
not a lot cuz you are still young,btohqsg
looks a lot relatively but is actually little,btohqsg
i not interested in finance but i interested in going holiday,btohqsg
yea  only thing is its not compounded haha,btohqsg
have. Those corporate bonds 250k 1 tranche,btohqsg
now got fullerton cash funds also  but only short term,btohqsg
ok batt low. come back later,btohqsg
avg yield for 10years  first 7 years is 3.3%  last 3 years is 3.68% iirc for dec allotment,btohqsg
is not  cuz they pay u the dividends every half year  unless ur dividend can hit the minimum 500 to reinvest lor,btohqsg
Prolly after national exams then they dye hair all,btohqsg
u still get the interest rates,btohqsg
No let me rephrase. Ashamed tht ppl think of 07s in a menacing way cos of behaviour liddat,btohqsg
Then thts y they look older idk,btohqsg
everytime i realise theres 07s here  i feel old even tho im not,btohqsg
I forgot im an 07 smtimes,btohqsg
Talking to ppl prolly twice my age,btohqsg
better then put in bank tbh  if dk where to put or dk how invest  just put there first lor,btohqsg
i thought they were having thanksgiving,btohqsg
like idk what ppl meant party‚Ä¶. isnt that normal like birthday party,btohqsg
No im talking abt wtv they were doing,btohqsg
oh idk why ppl say lower sec have party and clubs then they fight,btohqsg

"One guy said ""i paid $20 to see this just whack. Whackkk js whackk""",btohqsg
thats dumb to take vids of the fight,btohqsg
like if i was there i wld bully the bullies,btohqsg

apple charges 1.5k sgd for what would be a midrange android,btohqsg
most of my classmates and teachers use apple too,btohqsg
I heard apple's security system is stronger,btohqsg
So like android and apple security same same,btohqsg
Maybe apple more ex cos can add extensions,btohqsg
thats the issue w apple lol,btohqsg
midrange androids r also overall all rounders,btohqsg
means high end androids r better,btohqsg
the only thing apple has going for it is the ecosystem,btohqsg
my entire fam uses apple üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
