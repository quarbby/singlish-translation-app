TECH5 announces biometric proof of vaccination03 February 2021 17:38 GMTJump to commentsTECH5 announces the availability of a new and differentiated Proof of Vaccination as part of its Biometric-Driven Mobile ID solutions. The newly-launched solution provides biometric proof of a holder’s vaccination status completely offline and within seconds  and with no need to link to any other personal data.““COVID-19 certificates”  “Vaccination Passports”  “Immunity Passes ” call them what you will  but a plethora of solutions aimed at getting the world moving again safely is being announced on a regular basis” – says Rob Haslam  TECH5 strategic advisor. “But most  besides being unproven  are fundamentally flawed in a number of ways: some rely on being connected to national or medical databases or linked to government-issued IDs; few  if any  address the issue of foolproof verification (how do I know the person presenting the credential is who they say they are?); and all seem to rely on everyone having an up-to-date smartphone. Many also need the verifying party to be online to check vaccination status”– Haslam explains.TECH5 takes a different approach  offering a solution which is inclusive  fully private and leaves the holder in control of their own identity  while at the same time allowing the verifying party the ability to check vaccination status anywhere  anytime  without a network  without checking back on a database  and even when the holder doesn’t have a smartphone: even where the proof of vaccination is in printed form  it can still be checked biometrically against the holder.The TECH5 solution will allow vaccinating entities to provide each vaccinated person quickly and easily with a biometrically-verifiable credential in electronic or printed format. The credential will contain the vaccination date and status  as well as both an image of the holder’s face and a biometric template  all encrypted securely. The credential can then be presented  on a smartphone or in printed form  to any verifying organization that has downloaded the verification software  which can run on a smartphone or other mobile device  to verify that the person presenting the credential is the true owner. But while the check is based on biometrics  the biometric data itself stays with the owner.The ability to generate and verify a credential that proves one’s vaccination status will make entry into and participation in a wide range of activities  including shopping centres  sporting events  government buildings  safer. In addition  given the continuing restrictions for entering a new country or re-entry into one’s own country  the ability to prove immunity will become critical. “An essential element of this new TECH5 solution  particularly during this time of pandemic  is that it can be implemented quickly and used immediately. The solution does not require connecting to an official ID or a national database. This approach makes the solution safe  efficient and effective” – says Machiel van der Harst  TECH5 co-founder and CEO. “Furthermore  the solution does not have complicated architecture that requires a significant investment in hardware; rather  it can be easily integrated with most existing infrastructures” – van der Harst explains.In addition to confirming vaccination status  the solution can also be used to provide confirmation of a negative COVID test as well as to confirm a positive COVID antibody test.Various organizations throughout Asia  Europe  Africa and Latin America have already tested the Biometric-Driven Mobile ID solution (T5-Mobile ID) and proven its efficacy in various scenarios. The company plans to start implementation of its vaccination solution in the first quarter of 2021.For an overview of how the solution would work in a proof of vaccination scenario  see the latest official demo video of TECH5:https://youtu.be/o6-V5L3qBaY,btohqsg
