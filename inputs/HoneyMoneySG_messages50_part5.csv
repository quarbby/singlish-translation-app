Should be ok if you already have credit cards previously. Try DBS/POSB credit cards  I found that they are quite easy to be approved especially if you have a savings acc with them. You can apply easily through their ibanking website. I managed to get approved without submitting proof of salary.,btohqsg

Hi  I'm planning to making booking of a Japanese hotel via their website. I tested the DBS trick to find its MCC and it turns out to be Retail instead of Travel. So this means my original plan to use Amaze + UOB Lady's card won't work.I'm thinking of using Amaze wallet since there's a 4% rebate and FX from wallet is much better than using Amaze with card. Question is  is there a cap of spending for 4% rebate?Also  can I deposit SGD in the wallet and Instarem will simply draw down in SGD and convert at the point of transaction  which is what YouTrip can do?,btohqsg
Up to 125 spend per transaction for amaze wallet promo,btohqsg
