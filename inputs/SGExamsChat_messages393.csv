diet is just about calorie intake,btohqsg

Its liddat for the first few weeks,btohqsg
just make sure your calories is worth it to make you full,btohqsg
like certain foods esp vegetables got a lot more water,btohqsg
which helps making you feel fuller too,btohqsg
i just like no time to est,btohqsg

Also a not very healthy tip  but coffee is an appetite suppressant,btohqsg
for the record  this is from my experience of losing 10kg last time,btohqsg
So may not apply to everyone,btohqsg
No wonder why aft I drink coffee I don't feel like eating as much ?,btohqsg
i drink a lot of water a day,btohqsg
But is good if u need to study,btohqsg
it‚Äôs different from eating water heavy foods,btohqsg
