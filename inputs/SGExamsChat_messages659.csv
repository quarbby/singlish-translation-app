Same as most schs ej also,btohqsg
also got the barely promoted and didnt hit 4h2 criteria,btohqsg
Had more h1 physics students than h2 physics students,btohqsg
My circle is not circle enough,btohqsg
Freebody drawing too small and shit,btohqsg
I rmbr when I approached the sch to drop to h1 physics,btohqsg
"""If you drop to h1 physics I would have to recommend 90% of the h2 physics batch to drop""",btohqsg
ya it's quite common in general to drop to h1 econs,btohqsg
bruh i need to pre read my maths lect,btohqsg
and i just came back home,btohqsg
why is the derivative of e^x itself?,btohqsg
prolly best to direct to math gods,btohqsg
actually meant to send i Os chat lol,btohqsg
i haven't bought my gc yet,btohqsg
cos i was overseas during cny,btohqsg
I'll prolly need my GC for q awhile lol,btohqsg
rate of change of the function at a given x is the same as the function itself,btohqsg
like this is one of the properties of e^x that makes it such an important constant,btohqsg
and there's a million ways to look at the why ig,btohqsg
Tbh it depends on learning style I feel,btohqsg
Me preread I more blur sotong,btohqsg
my seniors have scary promos stories,btohqsg
and idw be one of them,btohqsg
"""i got U for GP""""oh it's normal""""WHAT""",btohqsg
me in sep reading this be like,btohqsg
I saying this as someone who did,btohqsg
consistent work will legit pay off,btohqsg
idk about a level stuff per se. it's more of you guys are taught differentiation without getting a proper sense of what a derivative is,btohqsg
No it's not normal to get U for GP,btohqsg
If u get U for GP ur like,btohqsg
how do you even get U for GP LOL,btohqsg
you gotta legit not even try,btohqsg
U cannot get less than 20 for essay,btohqsg
The only combo I can see,btohqsg
like if you do bare min to answer a question,btohqsg
Is 20 essay 19 paper 2,btohqsg
Horrible horse cock shit at gp,btohqsg
Cuz cambridge got give U before,btohqsg
watch me  ill write my whole GP essay in skibidi language,btohqsg
For someone who hard memorise essay,btohqsg
Then he try and shove in,btohqsg
"""Books are not relevant in modern society.""",btohqsg
Then someone shoved in an essay he remembered about books,btohqsg
Cambridge gave between 0-6 for content,btohqsg
U need to unironically not write anything,btohqsg
Or write a completely different topic,btohqsg
So long as u put I,btohqsg
U will not get U probaby,btohqsg
Actually I had a ex student from YI she got 18 for her gp essay,btohqsg
anyway base level understanding is knowing that the derivative of a function at every point is the rate of change/gradient at that point. e^x is a function where one of its special properties is every derivative is the function itself,btohqsg
you will not have to understand anything more deep than that unless you do math in uni or smth,btohqsg
check with you when I'm a Dr,btohqsg
if ever find y'all for hotpot again legit gonna call U Dr sia,btohqsg
i take h3 econs then i drop H2 to H1 so i take only h1 + h3,btohqsg
i will say the weirdest stuff out of existence,btohqsg
i hopefully won't get grey hair yet...,btohqsg
people alr do that now lol,btohqsg
the next time we meet is when a new 90rp joins us because then  kuro and dsy will sponsor,btohqsg
U think I legit can 90 rp meh.....,btohqsg
I >85 alrd laugh like mad,btohqsg
We'll find out in 2025 guys,btohqsg
If I can actually get A for geog,btohqsg
I hope I don't have to eat my words,btohqsg
Confirm can with the new h1 syllabus,btohqsg
Would be very wasted if you donâ€™t get,btohqsg
Bruh I can feel the pressure,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s hard to find good geog chers in JCs,btohqsg
Mine was one very bad the other one decent,btohqsg
I naturally just get how to,btohqsg
Then the decent one probably retiring soon,btohqsg
Process econs n geog stuff btr than my,btohqsg
At least I feel both can use common sense. My math was so rabak then between prelims and a levels I had to spend one math doing math day and night before I could actually get a decent score doing TYS.,btohqsg
Geog GI some qns can rly just whack,btohqsg
At least you used to have some very good teachers right,btohqsg
Ohya tell me next time got hotpot LMAOOO,btohqsg
I think drq my prelims I managed to get 96 or 97/100,btohqsg
i'm gonna be broke for the next month,btohqsg
Nah you just built different lol,btohqsg
I havenâ€™t heard of anyone getting 90+ for drq before even in other schs,btohqsg
My brain is damn arts oriented,btohqsg
But I took chem and physics,btohqsg
how can i when im a reggieðŸ˜¤,btohqsg
my brain is lepak oriented frfr,btohqsg
but my prof will legit think i keng if i skip meeting,btohqsg
What subjects would you have taken instead of physics and chem if you didnâ€™t choose them,btohqsg
I think I feeling it also abit,btohqsg
My office a lot of ppl kena flu late last month,btohqsg
I guess I got it early,btohqsg
i mean i've just been coughing at night like mad since i got covid,btohqsg
but then now flu symptoms also,btohqsg
My sis been sick for like,btohqsg
I felt abit also but its like,btohqsg
My initial subject combi going into ej was,btohqsg
Cuz I rly rly liked o level chem,btohqsg
I chose the 4 subjects I knew I can di,btohqsg
How much effort did U feel like U put in for phys,btohqsg
Cuz in sec sch those 4 just came naturally to me so i didn't have to actually study,btohqsg
For my sciences for a levels I put in effort to get the A,btohqsg
Oh well itâ€™s never too late to sit as a private candidate to try new subjects,btohqsg
I knew what people my batch couldn't do and capitalized on it,btohqsg
Stop sia imagine in the future I try to go do,btohqsg
we are clearing all available subs,btohqsg
H2 geog for the shits and giggles,btohqsg
Jk idt can take 1 H2 alone one right,btohqsg
Ok good luck. But must get A if not itâ€™s just jack of all trades master of none,btohqsg
Whee I could do any subject combi,btohqsg
oh ya saw on insta got that girl doing 28 A levels in uk,btohqsg
Also how much would it cost to sit for every subject until thereâ€™s none left lol,btohqsg
that's why we use our NS allowance,btohqsg
I think this guy can sit for some arts subjects and easily get A without much effort,btohqsg
I just wanted to do trip humans trip sci,btohqsg
i'm gonna take math fmath and physics to feed my ego,btohqsg
cuz i literally dk the content,btohqsg
I mean by the time you finish taking all  you would probably have started working since Cambridge wonâ€™t allow you to register for all in one sitting,btohqsg
my understanding of h2 history content is whatever my friends tell me then it just gets retained in my brain,btohqsg
and how much of a screw up he was,btohqsg
It is H2 Pattern spotting and qn analysis,btohqsg
I think just memorise a bit would be good enough for you,btohqsg
Cuz h2 physics has so little content that they literally test the same variation of qn every single time,btohqsg
i wish i could say tht,btohqsg
I consistently got B in EJ for physics,btohqsg
literally i had a 30 point difference betwen my h2 chem and h2 physics for J1 MYE,btohqsg
i think i found the y1y2 guy who made my life shit on reddit,btohqsg
h2 physics is like if i understand the content,btohqsg
i could probs finish the paper in half the time,btohqsg
he wants to go us uni ðŸ’€,btohqsg
So I don't need see do much,btohqsg
she looks like a geog cher in EJ also,btohqsg
im just using the maths notes from hg,btohqsg
EJ one is just the younger lena koh,btohqsg
what is thr to know abt climate change,btohqsg
wait did u finish evidence yet,btohqsg
On effect on ecosystem rn for lect,btohqsg
Bro Jeremy Wong also quoted it,btohqsg
lowk ya but got some stuff that's like,btohqsg
i have an effects of climate change essay,btohqsg
I think I saw el nino or smth,btohqsg
in the depths of my essay bank,btohqsg
one of the impacts of climate change,btohqsg
Wait I send U my essay in ABIT,btohqsg
That she kinda flamed me for during lecture.,btohqsg
wah but ej style of writing,btohqsg
is very diff from other schs,btohqsg
other schs like to see a shit ton of examples,btohqsg
ej just focus on 1 and explain well,btohqsg
mine must have been an anomaly then,btohqsg
Ik other schs also damn anal abt accuracy of examples,btohqsg
alot of schs dont teach it,btohqsg
but idk why they dont la,btohqsg
i think cuz its too much of an expectation,btohqsg
for students to write like 3 examples per para cuz alot of schs are like hehe my students cannot memorise,btohqsg
usu just 1 example per para enuf,btohqsg
but cambridge actually did say before that stronger responses are characterised by a wide range of examples,btohqsg
But how to complete on time,btohqsg
yeah but issue i find is that most are just regurgitating rather than actually unpacking the examples,btohqsg
ok but my misunderstanding here is that i thought 3 examples was... little/just nice,btohqsg
i think wide range normally refers to across space and time,btohqsg
like if u give me 3 examples in the same country,btohqsg
i mean thats not really a wide range,btohqsg
because most model essays i have seen are whole paragraphs full of examples no explanation then simi,btohqsg
So normally what I do is,btohqsg
i will write 1/2/3 example per continent (bar antartica),btohqsg
normally what i do is ... ''do 1 time good one''@chemcer,btohqsg
DC and LDC if possible right,btohqsg
get the A then zao  never come back,btohqsg
i mean it's more of giving enough examples that lend credibility to your argument on a larger scale/scope,btohqsg
just do 1 time good one bro,btohqsg
must make sure you fluke on that day itself,btohqsg
im too lazy to teach gp,btohqsg
when i used to teach gp,btohqsg
idk i feel like if schs just focused on actually teaching skills,btohqsg
my fren went for her first few RI GP lectures/tutorials,btohqsg
the techniques of GP to get B is damn straightforward,btohqsg
"""memorise this entire infopack we do test next week""",btohqsg
ya but people still cant get B,btohqsg
and B by SG standards is normally an A,btohqsg
uhh A is normally u just need get full marks for the entire SAQ + Summary portion,btohqsg
i mean A takes a bit more thought on how you use your content la,btohqsg
then write a semi passable essay (30ish),btohqsg
but if you got decent technique with your content dump you can get a B easily,btohqsg
bro we are all over a level why we still talking about it,btohqsg
Saq is so badly done in internal exams,btohqsg
also seeing a lot of people's summaries make me wanna puke,btohqsg
A lot of ppl get less than 10/17,btohqsg
actually just in general seeing how they paraphrase,btohqsg
I have consistently gotten higher for AQ than SAQ,btohqsg
I had a paper before where i lost,btohqsg
All my marks in the paper 2 in SAQ,btohqsg
hmm idk about my mentee but their paper 1 prep does seem to be just going topic by topic. like they do do some stuff to teach how to plan the essays out properly but it's not drilled enough like content is,btohqsg
and plan doesn't translate to writing skill,btohqsg
its only 1h 30min a week man,btohqsg
ya she consulted her tutor for like 3 essays recently,btohqsg
Do you think Cambridge is more lenient when it comes to marking saq,btohqsg
rn she's like high B close to A,btohqsg
so p sure she can hit it,btohqsg
bro you assuming that jc kids can reflect so well,btohqsg
is she okay to send me her essays,btohqsg
i can see where she goes wrong also,btohqsg
if they can  you wouldnt be here talking about gp A,btohqsg
do yall have like 1.5-2h breaks,btohqsg
uh start around 8/9 most days then end around 3?,btohqsg
or the tutorials are more spread out,btohqsg
but i like that rn she's like trying all these more interesting/harder questions to learn how to form arguments that isn't just regurgitating content,btohqsg
stay in canteen or mug in class,btohqsg
not so often though   iirc only 1/2 days out of the week?,btohqsg
how many tutorials do yall have in a day,btohqsg
eh then she shud be fine,btohqsg
I rmbr in J2 Term 1  what i did was just attempt qn based on qn itself rather than based on whether ik the topic well enough or not,btohqsg
so it allowed me to write random enough qns to be confident enough to not actually read examples for gp,btohqsg
no  we are over that as reggie,btohqsg
now i have 2 dr senpais,btohqsg
So now we are deciding who gets what PB,btohqsg
tbh idt it differs much from sec sch timetable,btohqsg
1 of them is physics phd 1 is mbbs,btohqsg
When you dr need to take picture together,btohqsg
the pot calling the kettle black,btohqsg
Only in camp 1.5 days this week  rmb to time ur mcs well,btohqsg
OC oni nia  tell CO la,btohqsg
must take MC either on Wed or Thurs only,btohqsg
Must rotate ur excuses and clinics also,btohqsg
Idk how ppl still get A even if their saq marks is always single digit in internal exams,btohqsg
they saving their fluke for A level....never waste it on internal exams,btohqsg
I think my friend from ny said that in his prelims his GP Cher  said no one passed saq in the class,btohqsg
my fluke was getting into local uni despite my grades ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Ya lol better to peak at a levels than early,btohqsg
my Gp always 0-20th percentile bro,btohqsg
but tbf if you can control the fluke  it is not really fluke anymore,btohqsg
They give out 50s for essays,btohqsg
i saved my luck for uni,btohqsg
GP and PW were my only As,btohqsg
Oh welp nvm can retake with Bedok and get 90rp together,btohqsg
Posted to changi airbase as ASA,btohqsg
Meanwhile me who failed h1 Chinese and had to take clb,btohqsg
I literally spent 2 years of my JC life touching Chinese,btohqsg
Ya its me bro  OSA ya,btohqsg
I kind of hate my ASA job,btohqsg
Apparantly the cio closed the tap,btohqsg
So there will be limited ASAs coming to 9Div,btohqsg
Like most of the time itâ€™s very slack but when I have to use the computer it gets very bad,btohqsg
Cuz theres too little asas rn,btohqsg
But he doesn't want to open it,btohqsg
Like it reached a point where I get calls over cby,btohqsg
I got a call from bmtc,btohqsg
Eh how come this 3sg cannot promote,btohqsg
Chuer someone call to ask me,btohqsg
hi anyone knows if MOE AU still exists?,btohqsg
Why the ippt data not synced yet,btohqsg
i see the PSC page but dh academia section,btohqsg
i doubt ill make it past psychological test,btohqsg
i gon call you boss soon,btohqsg
I got lazy to apply for psc,btohqsg
for PSC teaching you have to roleplay as a teacher,btohqsg
with the assessors as ur students,btohqsg
be it local or overseas uni,btohqsg
oso psc is a damn good title to have,btohqsg
I only know moe is 5 years,btohqsg
the psc scholars i know are mostly quite rambos leh,btohqsg
I have faith in one psc scholar,btohqsg
idk see which psc it is,btohqsg
Wait what I never knew thereâ€™s diff types,btohqsg
if ur vocation is related to ur bond then yea,btohqsg
and ur bond is 6 years or sth as a teacher,btohqsg
I thought of psb academy Welp idk why my brain thought of that out of the blue,btohqsg
isnt it damn hard to get it tho,btohqsg
bout to drop out of ntu to go there,btohqsg
Might as well just apply for moe scholarship at that point since they only require 5 years,btohqsg
almost a 100 students for my friends batch,btohqsg
tot like only 5 ppl get one psc per dept per year,btohqsg
i have interacted with a few and a common trait i have noticed among all of them is that they have super strong opinions and it manifests in 2 waysthe positive way is that they are legit game changersthe negative way is that they are elitist,btohqsg
That is if they wanna become a Cher,btohqsg
i have 2 friends in psc,btohqsg
normally its between 50-100 students per batch,btohqsg
lol not surprised that theyre elitist,btohqsg
which tracks with any ministry level scholarship (MND EDGE Scholarship  SAF Merit scholarship etc.),btohqsg
lowkey shouldve just done that  wouldve been finishing by now lmao,btohqsg
batch as in the entire sg cohort?,btohqsg
i mean idk how uw define batch la,btohqsg
like it can be anyone between the ages of 19 to like whatever the max age is,btohqsg
my sch only allow top 50 ppl to apply iirc,btohqsg
psc is normally RI  HCI  ACSI dominated,btohqsg
my batch in EJ has one?,btohqsg
and this is where the EJ drama comes in!!!,btohqsg
cuz apparantly ej shat on her for her entire referral,btohqsg
was her clarifying whatever ej wrote abt her,btohqsg
like apparantly the SCH made shit up abt her,btohqsg
so that she wont get the scholarship,btohqsg
in comparison to this other girl who applied for the exact scholarship (who is also the star student of EJ),btohqsg
(the nepo baby into NUS medicine),btohqsg
where they celebrate very very few students,btohqsg
and only give the opportunities to them,btohqsg
"so they dont like it when other students come out of left field and ""steals"" the opportunities",btohqsg
acc to some of the ej teachers la,btohqsg
hold up  my sch does this also,btohqsg
i think ej was rly scared of this girl winning this over another girl,btohqsg
and mine ip so they groomed the student from sec1 all the way to j2 LOL,btohqsg
"the ""left field"" girl got it",btohqsg
cuz the girl that got it right,btohqsg
she just doesnt have the same level of connections as the star student,btohqsg
mine also is damn ass cuz we got 3 IP JCs,btohqsg
then everyone thinks their gods gift to mankind or smth,btohqsg
@chemcerfr we not going to grow out of this phase,btohqsg
hes really celebrated amongst ej students,btohqsg
cuz he tries to connect with the students alot,btohqsg
the talking abt JC/A Level phase,btohqsg
"like i rmbr when he came into ej his fun fact was like ""I play Clash of Clans"" townhall level 14",btohqsg
then he talked abt it for the entire assembly,btohqsg
then he played it for us,btohqsg
and bro everyone was CLAPPING for him,btohqsg
yeah thats why the students like him,btohqsg
but he does alot of shady shit in the background,btohqsg
cos last year he oso showed the same thing lol,btohqsg
but ns is too boring for me to talk abt,btohqsg
if i were to talk abt NS stuff,btohqsg
wait my whole jobscope is literally confidential anyways,btohqsg
yeah i can only talk abt office drama,btohqsg
i found out cuz i talked to alot of the chers that left ej,btohqsg
and they only had negative things to say abt andrew,btohqsg
those who tend to be better at picking up intent-issues,btohqsg
but yea honestly ej image rlly damn good,btohqsg
i mean all things aside EJ is like just a party shc that somehow does well for a levels,btohqsg
cuz dt theyll do well this yr,btohqsg
go to office  lift some boxes  go home,btohqsg
Idgi sooo it's like what....tryna so called steal the spotlight?,btohqsg
tis convo would drag another hour,btohqsg
i wnat to eat my dinner,btohqsg
I also only eating dinner now,btohqsg
then idk some bird fly into the class,btohqsg
then after i finish the maggie  i put rice into the soup then put microwave,btohqsg
asking her to come up for her 2345,btohqsg
before he leaves  i must memberi hormat,btohqsg
sum of my frens also guys fucking baby face smooth,btohqsg
and they wash their face using the same bar soap for their asses,btohqsg
or you can reduce a bit of the soup and use it to fry more noodles,btohqsg
i boil in water  strain  keep a few ladles of soup  then put 1/4 to half a packet of the seasoning  put cheese,btohqsg
meanwhile  frozen chicken in air fryer,btohqsg
yea i do that for my normal maggi goreng also,btohqsg
bc without the liquid the seaosning doesn't spread much,btohqsg
Not so salty but just nice alrd..,btohqsg
he puts 1/4 of the seasoning,btohqsg
Won't u taste most of the cheese then,btohqsg
but my favourite is the maggie red curry one,btohqsg
Cowhead cheese carbonara pasta is nice,btohqsg
i could use dark soy sauce to make it less dry but not the biggest fan of that taste,btohqsg
but my favourite of all time....is still steroids chicken,btohqsg
people still eat cowhead cheese now...?,btohqsg
i thought it is just a childhood snack,btohqsg
Help lah pcme schedule knn last yr every Tues 5.30pm end now every Tues and Thurs end at nbccb 5pm then depending on CCA schedule  every wed has CCA till fucking 5,btohqsg
ytd i made lu rou fan then got extra sauce,btohqsg
