Virtual currencies plummeted yesterday and today  causing many investors to lose their money. Do you know why it fell?,btohqsg
The first reason: Musk canceled the decision to use Bitcoin to directly buy Tesla cars  including his mention of Dogecoin as a fraud in a variety show. The second reason: Chinese officials once again stated that China is not allowed People trade virtual currency  and trading virtual currency is a violation.,btohqsg
hahhaa machiam tak boleh tahan sial,btohqsg
Therefore  it can be concluded from this event that virtual currencies will not be recognized and cannot replace currencies of various countries.,btohqsg

This is also the reason why I have not been optimistic about virtual currency  which is like a gambling behavior.,btohqsg
