But then alot of Malaysia registered 30yr yr old Diesel truck and pickup entering Singapore daily😅Especially Durian season is here😂,btohqsg
Seeking advice.My rpm went so low at traffic until the engine stalled. Restarted car and back to normal. Happened twice  today and about 1 week ago. Any possible reason? No fault lights whatever so.,btohqsg
😱😱😱U must be really luckyFor conti   I experience cam shaft sensor issue.Go to the workshop and scan,btohqsg
Shud get A45 scirroco r or m135,btohqsg
Better brand more powder and cheaper,btohqsg
Buy this car scared maintenance is best dun buy,btohqsg
High maintenance is a necessity for these cars to show the car sibeh powerful and must pump 98,btohqsg
Could be ignition coil  spark plugs or sensorsWhen was the last time you went servicing?There may not be any Check Engine Light but fault codes may already be stored.Just go workshop to do a obd scan for faults,btohqsg
BYD + alfa wheels = stylish?,btohqsg
could be for many reasons  u notice the car being sluggish or anything?,btohqsg
best is like what hanssom said  go to workshop and check,btohqsg

i dun associate stylish with this kind of human carrier,btohqsg
for M drivers here who want to join. someone sent me,btohqsg
About a month ago. Ignition coils and spark plug are new less than 6months. Ya probably need a trip to ws,btohqsg
No  drives normally. Just that it stalled on me twice at traffic light.,btohqsg
Thanks all  will go to ws. Just seeking some heads up advice here. Will be good if just coil or plug or simple fault. Don't want go ws get heart attack need to change so major stuff,btohqsg
check temperature sensor and thermostat too.,btohqsg
haha i see  my prediction is that it might be alternator  but thats just my ASSUMPTION.,btohqsg
Could be flywheel sensor tooBest not to guessGo workshop and obd scan :),btohqsg
Stalling could be fuel pump assy or fuel pump control module too,btohqsg
Most of the time it's the causd,btohqsg
This I also changed together with coil and plug. Got towed when alternator died on cte 😭,btohqsg
you are right hannsom  best not to guess cos it reflects alot on me. Workshop will be the best bet,btohqsg
Once car is moving  alternator is less importantAlternator is mostly to recharge the 12v battery,btohqsg
I want go see m gals,btohqsg
desaru is now a nice place,btohqsg
It can be spark coil tooo…. Planning to change car soon?,btohqsg
is this where the EV conversion persuasion starts coming in?😂😂,btohqsg
wahh you change alot of stuff sia haha,btohqsg
My Kona at 188848  only change 12V battery twice.Brake pad still first set from brand new car. Only thing is global battery recall change.Other than that… don’t know what to complain,btohqsg
hows the resale on the kona compared to petrol counterpart,btohqsg
Thanks to government green plan. Now EV resale value is ok,btohqsg
good to know haha  hows battery life after X number of years?,btohqsg
This I can’t comment cause it changed battery before.,btohqsg
But I’ve been DC and AC to 100% always,btohqsg
Oh yes. Changed 4 sets of tires,btohqsg
i see not bad leh haha,btohqsg
its always good to have a EV as a daily  much cheaper to run compared to petrol. but obviously i still want a ICE weekend car weeee~~,btohqsg
When I had my petrol car  $1200 a month petrol.Changed EV public charging become $300-400,btohqsg
My petrol car was going at 1L to 11km,btohqsg
I’m happy I saved loads of money,btohqsg
ok kopi for a tesla 3 ride,btohqsg
My daily commute is MRT. Definitely electrified 🤪,btohqsg
i hate it when EV drivers floor their car because i always get an electric shock😅😅,btohqsg
EV is definitely the future...The next car revolution is basically seeing AMG  M  Type R  STI badges on EVs,btohqsg
I think these are outdated   ppl going for this,btohqsg
it be interesting to see how German EV will fare against Tesla in next few years,btohqsg
Pretty much similar patternAmericans favours acceleration and straight line performance.Germans put effort in how the car corners,btohqsg
Currently Their ev is still ice set up with transmission tunnel,btohqsg
