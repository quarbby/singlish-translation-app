https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/us2t-in-investments-needed-over-next-decade-to-green-south-east-asiasMain Extract:SOME US$2 trillion (S$2.7 trillion) in sustainable infrastructure investment is needed between 2021 and 2030 if South-east Asia is to achieve climate and sustainable development goals  according to a report produced by Bain & Co  Microsoft  and Temasek.These funds are needed for investments into infrastructure for renewable energy  energy-efficient buildings  greener transportation  the treatment of water and wastewater  rail networks  and the processing of waste.Anyways  did some study and found 1 counter that should benefit quite significantly from this infrastructure Investment.*ANNAIK ($0.072/$0.073)* - FOR INVESTMENT ONLY AS OF NOWFurthermore- their recent numbers looks good- Did a series of share buybacks recently in the past 1.5 months at as high as high as $0.078?- NAV $0.21- There was a recent pump up to 9 series which should be some accumulation by the players.Can keep this one closely. Put in watchlist. I believe this one will be an easy half or even double bag when in play. But DYODD  as it still rather illiquid although can tell that the volume is slowly streaming in.,btohqsg
