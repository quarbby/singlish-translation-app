And UK screwed up so bad now,btohqsg
Plus uni highly encourage us go back,btohqsg
If not youâ€™ll be stuck overseas for maybe months,btohqsg
We all know how ex the uk is,btohqsg
So it is still your choice to heed the encouragement,btohqsg
Tell me what's not a choice,btohqsg
No you can choose to die,btohqsg
Please everything is a choice only to what degree,btohqsg
No not the act of paying ransom,btohqsg
The fact that you are kidnaped,btohqsg
Please you kill yourself they can't force you do anything,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s assuming you have the means to,btohqsg
Ok can please tell me what act is not a choice,btohqsg
They kidnap you is not an act on your part,btohqsg
Die may sometimes not be your choice,btohqsg
Die or kill yourself is different,btohqsg
Die you can be the subject of death,btohqsg
But not the perpetrator of death,btohqsg
One example of an act that isn't a choice,btohqsg
This is a holy Christian group chat.,btohqsg
Whenever ppl say no choice is just that the alternative choice sucks more than the current choice,btohqsg
It's only the degree to which the other choice suck that determines the degree to which you have no choice,btohqsg
So don't play word game please leh. You overseas right now 1k ppl die per day in your country of residence you want stay overseas is it,btohqsg
Being pedantic is an occupational hazard of mine  right?@cauchycriterionðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No mah is u trying to play word game. Play game must serious,btohqsg
Iâ€™ll let John Smith do the honours,btohqsg
Cambridge cancelling all May/June exams  no idea if it'll affect Singapore,btohqsg
I actually thought Cambridge Uni cancelling,btohqsg
fuck off la i think ill barely pass,btohqsg
I don't think any sound minded individual should be against breastfeeding in public as long as the mother at question take sufficient measures to ensure that she isn't indecently exposing herself,btohqsg
Maybe they think the hubby is indecent la,btohqsg
Or maybe the critics dun like nipples,btohqsg
Usually the critics are haters and incels. If I see a woman breastfeed  just let her be. No need to stare. Give her some space to attend to the baby,btohqsg
Ya la. Unless those critics see nipples will be aroused lor. Then the wives mind. Hahaha,btohqsg
I don't know tbh  perhaps anything that would be considered indecent exposure by the law when done by a woman who isn't breastfeeding?,btohqsg
I personally would just look away if a mother is breastfeeding her child  but the problem at hand is that we need to draw a line using the extent of necessity  otherwise we're being unfair to exhibitionists (not being sarcastic),btohqsg
aren't there like special clothing for breastfeeding moms,btohqsg
But if you read this article  the woman claims that some/most children is uncomfortable when breastfeeding using those clothing,btohqsg
Without people staring at their boobs,btohqsg
But donâ€™t cover the kidâ€™s head,btohqsg
This is true. Some kids like claustro. They not used to the cover because at home no cover. Some also need to see mommyâ€™s face to feel relaxed.Momâ€™s with these kids really find it tough to use cover,btohqsg
"It is not against the law toÂ breastfeed in publicÂ inÂ Singapore. According to theÂ SingaporeÂ Police Force  â€œIt is not an offence toÂ breastfeed in publicÂ if the woman is decently clad and she does not expose her breast more than is necessary toÂ breastfeedÂ her child.""",btohqsg
If we use this example  I think she could have been prosecuted by these legal standards,btohqsg
Hopefully she has a good lawyer if this happens,btohqsg
She can use this in her defence,btohqsg
She could argue that she only exposed the feeding breast wat. The other breast is covered,btohqsg
Yeah she could  it could go either way,btohqsg
Angmoh beaches nude moms sitting beside children  no one cares...,btohqsg
