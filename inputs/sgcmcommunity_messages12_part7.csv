you guys dont send cars to car wash?,btohqsg
these days i also become lazy to use the pressure jet. it is just spur of moment thing to buy. but that kartcher is very very useful when you want to do spring cleraning say chinese new year washing.,btohqsg
I only send to the car wash I trusted. Petrol station ones usually CMI,btohqsg

My Fav so far is Island car wash. Will purposely cruise along Eunos instead of PIE to go there if I need them to wash.,btohqsg
i get stone chips. i think this cannot be prevented right? ca goes fast,btohqsg
Yea I wanted to go Malaysia for a proper car detailing before my restoration.,btohqsg
I dunno leh… hopefully they can help me clear small scratches,btohqsg

If they can’t  then I delay doing it,btohqsg
does your speedo still work? how many km now,btohqsg
you are going to get a new car  why bother to do,btohqsg
speedo works. Fuel gauge no.v 😂,btohqsg
I mean new car look after coating maintenance…  not getting new car,btohqsg

Going back workshop. Fuel gauge change le but still not accurate LOL,btohqsg

X50 can’t meet demand. Some wait for one year.,btohqsg
After geeky took over things improved,btohqsg

Really? Volvo quality improved under the Chinese? Saw some Vloggers giving bad reviews on XC90,btohqsg
The interior quality really good  can't deny. Test drove the xc60 t5 last year and it was really smooth.,btohqsg
My ex colleague owned the previous version XC60  maintenance cost on average was $1k whenever it’s in the workshop after warranty. Decided to switch to Subaru Forester.,btohqsg
Reviews on performance or interior quality? I just like the styling under geely,btohqsg
"Volvo reliability is pretty solid from a volvo owner for the past 20+ years.. newer volvo are defo abit less ""tank like"" but are still as reliable as ever",btohqsg
That will be before it’s under Geely,btohqsg
I know of someone who repaired the Volvo DCT 3 times each time costing 2-3k. It’s a 7 year old xc70,btohqsg
The older gen Volvo and Mercedes are damn solid beast.,btohqsg
Volvo at that time used the Ford DCT which was undoubtedly unreliable... Post 2012  Volvo has not been plagued with any serious issues,btohqsg
These days  they build cars to breakdown so manufacturers can sell spare parts when breakdown?,btohqsg
Still using the DCT as it was following the P2 platform,btohqsg
P3 and SPA platform are solid without any major issues,btohqsg
Ioniq 5 is nice wait for that,btohqsg
