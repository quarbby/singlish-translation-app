Heard that it is good to use DBS multipliers to transfer USD between IBKR n DBS multiplier.,btohqsg
I got my stash bonus safely throughout the last saving quarter haha,btohqsg
Hi  anyone used chocolate finance recently? Was testing it out and wondering about the rates. Seems like the daily int did not meet the 4.2% was wondering when the top up int will be effected?,btohqsg
When did you transferred in your money?,btohqsg
If you have max $20k  your daily interest shall be $2.31 or $2.32. Is it correct?,btohqsg
If over 20k u will be subject to market return  so u need to keep it at 20k and withdraw daily. So just keep at 19950,btohqsg
Yea  I did a test top up to check on the returns. So far  the returns were <4.2%. Was wondering if they are fluctuating daily and would be topped up by Choc Fin,btohqsg
Thanks reminding. I realised that 4.2p.a. so should be correct if I prorated it on a monthly basis. Just realised that I was calculating the p.a. for monthly int.,btohqsg

Sms first 9 digits or last 9 digits to participate? First 9 starts with 151?,btohqsg
eh it is in the first page of the PDF.. please read.,btohqsg
If they write last is more clear lol. Because first 3 digit on the app is branch code. But it's needed for GIRO setup. 🤦🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
T&c say first 9. But I sent last 9 also 🤣,btohqsg
Fking HSBC really. If you try to send the first 9 which includes branch code maybe will fail.,btohqsg
nerf is true. may not be small for some ppl,btohqsg
big nerf. utilities bill is no small matter for families,btohqsg
May I introduce the UOB One card  which gives 4.33% cash rebate for SP Power BillsIn the event you KPKB you want OEM power generator HOW?!?!?!  may i introduce Tuaspower which uses SP Billing.QED,btohqsg
Its a big nerf. Was waiting for my Stanchart ntb status to reset and get this card for utilities. Too bad. 🥲,btohqsg
and u want to endure SCB refusal to waive annual fees? BOO TO SCB,btohqsg
Ikr? I kena this year. My annual spend for this year is 90k sia wtf,btohqsg
I really don’t understand. This would be my first time trying the sms. So I should ignore the first three digits?,btohqsg
my only comfort to you is YOU ARE NOT ALONE.even my $30k peasant card (simplycash) got rejected for annual fee waiver,btohqsg
Idk if their cashback for utilities is worth this  I need to go and calculate the cashback I got for utilities outweigh the annual fee.But their OTP shit is annoying. I press approve  and then it says failed? Then I have to sit there for 2 minutes waiting for it to change to sms. Cannot retrigger or manually send OTPI using the ‘peasant’ card also haha. I don’t like miles,btohqsg
You scared just send first 9 and last 9 la. They will send you SMS confirmation. SMS is mostly free what.,btohqsg
"when we will get the ""refund"" of 10000 points?",btohqsg
"how many days is the ""otw""?",btohqsg
Usually within 2 days  after waiver is approved.,btohqsg
the screenshot says first 9 digit ah,btohqsg
Is there an updated TNC? The terms and rewards are all over the place,btohqsg
last time when i newbie i used to send EGA SMS every month as i lost track which cycle i was in.,btohqsg
Yeah won't go wrong. SMS is mostly free,btohqsg
watch out for those promos where the LAST or FIRST SMS is the overriding one,btohqsg
Yes hahaha so far don't have,btohqsg
Yes  i feedbacked it earlier and they are managing it now,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone happen to know what is Moneysmart MCC? Planning to buy their points to redeem something of higher value,btohqsg
Eh crap  I just saw the new utilities exclusion. There's like no reason for me to use this already  except for Amaze linked spends,btohqsg
Do you have Amaze card? do an empty wallet test? Heymax suggested 5734 for Moneysmart.,btohqsg
I have always sent first 9 digits and it has worked,btohqsg
It is confusing  right… so Last 9 digits!,btohqsg
Thr tnc say first 9. Why u all wanna do something else,btohqsg
Why not just follow T&C and send first 9?,btohqsg
probably they are shutting down cc biz? or try to be hero to change spore cc landspace,btohqsg
i think they are just trolling,btohqsg
I go google search the oldie HWZ and got ppl comment that the EGA last three digits always 221. So  only first 9 is unique to individuals,btohqsg
How long does UOB do waiver for the credit card? They just deducted 10k points... submitted the waiver request,btohqsg
I send 2 to be safe😁,btohqsg
Through the chat assists or must call?,btohqsg
was phone call because system didn't allow waiver,btohqsg
Bcoz i just realized i sent last 9 last month,btohqsg
lol don't u all just copy and paste the previous SMS? how can do wrong one,btohqsg
