At most 3-4 mark  usually 1 mark,btohqsg
this person said 10 .. lol,btohqsg
i wouldnt bank on it tho,btohqsg
Cohort to cohort  subject to subject,btohqsg
So not really reliable to count on what people in other systems say,btohqsg
if the cohort does really bad on the whole like maybe 20% passes would there even be a 10 mark increase,btohqsg
I had no moderation in my entire jc life,btohqsg
Lol the role of exams is to test your knowledge and if they are gg to make it very hard so that 20% pass and ended up giving free 10marks to everyone it is stupid,btohqsg
realistically  the role of exams is a filter to see who should go which school. to test your knowledge is philosophically true  but practically a side effect.,btohqsg
Ya if you give 10ms to everyone wonâ€™t it cause an inflation,btohqsg
Could add easier questions for ppl,btohqsg
its not about deserving la. nobody cares who deserves what marks.,btohqsg
P is carbonate salt q is copper 2 chloride,btohqsg
I put r1 then right my class like every1 i ask except for 1 put r2,btohqsg
Cuz got more to react with so need more acid,btohqsg
First 2 observation got carbon dioxide right,btohqsg
I wrote it felt cold to touch and form whiten ppt in limewater,btohqsg
I wrote longer but ye summarised,btohqsg
Shit i never write bottom feel cold,btohqsg
I wrote same but never write bottom of test tube,btohqsg
Yall is talking about combined chem right,btohqsg
I write effervescence observed an gas bubble through lime water,btohqsg
Ye test tube was cold oso,btohqsg
This one tgt 1 mark if i not wrong,btohqsg
I wrote light blue ppt produced,btohqsg
Cause i no good in o levels,btohqsg
rp is good if u like going to sch,btohqsg
My brother asked how y'all use dropper to test from co2,btohqsg
And push the air into Abit of Lime water,btohqsg
In A level you won't really use gas delivery tube anymore cos troublesome  just use dropper,btohqsg
My brother didn't have like delivery tube,btohqsg
And he said his lab broke out ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
And someone else on Reddit also got,btohqsg
U literally just suck it out and put it into limewater hahaha,btohqsg
U will be forced to use that for A level hahaz don't eorry,btohqsg
Literally suck it and put it in like 1cm3 of lime water,btohqsg
Cos udn Alot of co2 to be produced and udn Alot of ppt,btohqsg
I put rubber stopper on boiling tube when it was bubbling,btohqsg
when u put the rubber at the wrong time,btohqsg
When u cant pass so u make every 1 fail,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA when you use 100% of your brain power,btohqsg
wtf so is the ans r1 or r2,btohqsg
Anyone have the practical paper for combined science?,btohqsg
Anyone wrote this : To put the  limewater into test tube A and B before the start of experiment. To prevent having external source of air to contaminate the result which might cause the A and B to contain CO2. (--- my brother asking,btohqsg
I dk my brother wrote that,btohqsg
I think he was answering the question for improving the experiment,btohqsg
The how to make it the same,btohqsg
huh HAHAHA I donâ€™t recall that,btohqsg
