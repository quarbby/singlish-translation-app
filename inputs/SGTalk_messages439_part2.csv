The whole pass holder missing lo 😢,btohqsg
Depends on timing also  towards 4-6pm costs more,btohqsg
Maybe was morning timing.. hmm 🤔 but I remembered last time cheaper,btohqsg
Anyways can't help if they increased 😅,btohqsg
Like our chicken rice now also increase. Want to eat then LL also have to buy,btohqsg
Austin area from JB central area usually 20++ RM at least.,btohqsg
Ya I remembered was 20+ but that day 30+ near 40,btohqsg
So I was shock for a moment 😅,btohqsg
Peak hours usually more.. so near 40 is understandable,btohqsg
I saw robbery happened in front of me before. That fellow ran n behind shouting robbery help help but yet no 1 helped,btohqsg
But it was ironic that robbery was running towards ciq 😅,btohqsg
In JB or most part of Malaysia no one will.Coz they don’t want trouble and most likely they know it’s a Singaporen kena rob .,btohqsg
Even own local kena also may not help,btohqsg
Actually we are to used to Singapore safety so usually we are targeted .,btohqsg
Even fake gold looking jewellery also don't wear go Malaysia liao 🤣,btohqsg
Sad but true. The local more cautious also will,btohqsg
U try leave ur hp  wallet or whatever on a table outside SG see,btohqsg
U can still see it there in the next 5 mins I also say u r protected by someone up there,btohqsg
Kena robbed or car window smash bopian LL .As long not injured okay .Or what worst is must keep your children safe . The worst is kidnapping,btohqsg
I was there n the mcd next to my Airbnb got 2 guys fight over umbrella n that fellow took out a weapon n the other fellow went to heaven liao,btohqsg
I remember my friend told me got a sg guy refused to let them snatch his phone  his hand kena chopped off,btohqsg
And probably they on drugs too,btohqsg
Last time got 1 news ma,btohqsg
Ya high on drugs liao so anything also might do 😢,btohqsg
Got someone kena chopped at petrol station,btohqsg
That one is revenge act i think,btohqsg
Nowadays more common is even u go supermarket suddenly some crazy ass came n random shooting,btohqsg
Almost like every day in USA it's happening,btohqsg
In Malaysia 1 right? That 1 is revenge,btohqsg
So it's different if no revenge then no chopping 😅,btohqsg
Recently i saw a video from other group,btohqsg
Got a guy tio beaten up and slashed,btohqsg
1 whole group assaulting 1 guy,btohqsg
I think max I go 1 corner hide then call mata,btohqsg
I'm not master ye  I can't fight 10,btohqsg
When I was young  I remember got 1 phrase was 英雄变狗熊,btohqsg
Just light up a fire at the rubbish nearby and shout fire  sure a lot of people will come out,btohqsg
I think the police also dun dare intervene,btohqsg
It's just to make them run,btohqsg
If you really not scared of dying just take a fire extinguisher spray at them,btohqsg
The powder will attack their eyes and you can grab the victim and run,btohqsg
Like machiam in a movie scene,btohqsg
Must make sure can use leh,btohqsg
Scarli become dry liao   cant use,btohqsg
"U don't suggest. Later 1 day we see news headlines is ""1 sg lang tries to use fire extinguisher to spray at gangsters at JB kena wacked into 狗熊""",btohqsg
Even if you use insect repellent and spray  the smell and burning sensation on the skin will fend off most people,btohqsg
Ya especially overseas 1.. sakli all Alibaba fire extinguisher 😂,btohqsg
Not 狗熊，  maybe can sell salted egg,btohqsg
Especially if you spray on their faces,btohqsg
I trying not to think till so bad lah 😂,btohqsg
