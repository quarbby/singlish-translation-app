We are the first and only Southeast-Asia based non-profit focusing on youths with a China and ASEAN angle.In this inaugural survey  Singaporean youths will be asked questions about their perceptions and knowledge about the ASEAN and China regions. It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.We aim to pilot this survey of on youths’ perceptions  monitoring ASEAN youths’ expectation  concerns  common trends and national differences about both ASEAN and China regions. We hope that our findings  which will be published in the form of a report  will shed light on the youth’s perception of these two regions.Survey link:https://tinyurl.com/AWRFAACIf you have any questions about the survey or the procedures  feel free to contact TYS by email athello@theyoungseakers.com.,btohqsg

I heard the a math paper was dang difficult,btohqsg
Make sure u take FMaths because u like maths  not because maths is easy,btohqsg
Yeah that’s what I heard abt a lot from people,btohqsg
Some of my FMaths classmates took FMaths to dodge chemistry,btohqsg
Things didn’t turn out too good,btohqsg
I was thinking of taking f math to dodge bio tho,btohqsg
Not sure whether that’s a wise choice,btohqsg
Don’t worry  if it’s a bad choice you can always retain in J1 and take another combination,btohqsg
We can choose a totally different subject combination,btohqsg
Yes  I know people that have done that,btohqsg
Hahahaha. Not too sure about the MOE H3 maths...,btohqsg
Yes i know someone who did that and it worked,btohqsg
Because you are starting all over again. Why can't you?,btohqsg
Just if u dont mind the extra year,btohqsg
It isn’t  which is why u should be sure that the no. 1 reason u take FMaths is because u like it  not because u want to dodge something else,btohqsg
I incorrectly assumed that that carried forward into JC,btohqsg
History doesn't make any sense bruh,btohqsg
At least geog you can understand,btohqsg

But double sci need take PH,btohqsg
Ngl my subject combination probably has no future if I were to go to JC,btohqsg
I take literature and POA my man,btohqsg
FMaths and maths together means half of all your lessons are maths,btohqsg
Only arts stream for me in JC,btohqsg
And no offence to arts students but history doesn’t have many career prospects in Singapore,btohqsg

there are pple saying the advice that h2 math is like alr a big jump,btohqsg
I hated pure history at first,btohqsg
Can I say that like I like learning how they solve stuff in f math also which like is another driving reason as to why I’d wAnna take f math,btohqsg
Unless if you wanna be history lecturer or something,btohqsg
Not really. You still have GP  PW  MTL  if applicable,btohqsg
