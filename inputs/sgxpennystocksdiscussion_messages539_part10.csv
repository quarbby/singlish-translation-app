Just teach the few topics will do..But have to understand your child able to do or not..A lot of methods.. so parents feel very difficult so send to tuition‚Ä¶Move over teach own kid not easy too..,btohqsg

I really love this chat group. Topics are so varied. So many experts sharing experiences,btohqsg
Just have to see what the auditors found out in Malaysia about the glove factory workers living in horrible conditions. What happened . Nothing. Business as usual!,btohqsg
Street education is best. Learn to live. Learn to fight.,btohqsg

Most of the times  the bosses of auditors are in some form of relationship with the company they are auditing,btohqsg
Can't screw up those relationships by checking too much,btohqsg

I dropped FM after 1st year  and didn't need to study MC... Machiam only 2 subjects left,btohqsg
I remembered the MC tutor very scared of us... Because we were there to audit her work real time.,btohqsg
My college very funny  for FM students  we don't have to attend MC lessons. So they teach together....,btohqsg
Stock operator as in broker. Or bookie. Or gambling house. They are the only ones who make money. Charge us for every trade,btohqsg

Actually the teacher teaching you in the lingo or way you can understand is very important. Even if the teacher is PHD or teach some students well but lingo not understood by you you also cannot catch his/her point,btohqsg

Yes. I used to give part time tuition during my army days ($89/month). If my student could not understand my teaching I had to change another angle to explain until he could understand. Every one understands differently,btohqsg
