today i tired out the malaysan toll RFID on my car. really nice. no stopping,btohqsg
U can tune to comfort   standard   sports,btohqsg
I use comfort most of the time  As standard is too tight,btohqsg

Singapore road so slow   just 1 hand at the bottom of the steering wheel more then enough,btohqsg
so you also drive a manual car with your left hand resting on gear knob?,btohqsg
No usuallly my other hand is on the arm rest or at the edge of the window,btohqsg
my only conern is fire risk. i mentioned this in the very beginning in some other groups.,btohqsg
when not done right. battery can catch fire easily,btohqsg
Actually most report show that ev risk of catching fire is lesser then Ics,btohqsg
Yeah  because with EVs something really has to go wrong before it catches fire and it's generally slower. With ICE  a few wrong mods or some issue and your car can catch on fire super quick and it can be worse because of the tanks of petrol/diesel being carried,btohqsg
i heard ice combust petrol for the car to move...,btohqsg

Many ADs throw in the cameras for free as well as part of the offer. Like PA and PML do with the Audi/BMW branded dashcams which are worth between 800 to 1000 according to them,btohqsg
Others will provide a list of approved workshops to get cameras installed and you can ask them to cook the price of it into the car price and do it for you before delivery,btohqsg
