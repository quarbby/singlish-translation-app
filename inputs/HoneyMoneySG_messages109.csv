Sorry I have questions on this. Because I check on heymax app. On going facial at bioskin . Only earns 0.4 miles. Pls advise,btohqsg
Need bros advise on this.. I notice not the standard exclusion of citi rewards card  but if check under heymax apps  some merchants were shown as only 0.4 miles earn .. eg facial / hair salon . Pls advise ...,btohqsg
Offline got whitelist that get 4mpd. Not in whitelist then is 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Uob one cc - SQ ticket no more cashback?,btohqsg
the original post was in response to a question about shopback payment. are you paying via shopback?,btohqsg
Why no cashback? Please go check the tnc of uob one and your card quarter,btohqsg
Can la. You try first. If cannot you tell me.Cannot trust heymax  sometimes not accurate one.Only when you tried  then it‚Äôs accurate. Don‚Äôt think  just do.,btohqsg
Then next time need to time the start date. Eg.. 16 Jul - 60days = 16 May(deposit date or subscription date).,btohqsg
So means I pair it with amaze using citi rewards card pay first.. then check the mcc code with the citi bank customer service?,btohqsg
Amaze card will show the mcc liao,btohqsg
Yes. No need check CSO. Just check your points balance can liao.,btohqsg
Yes.. never seen bioskin or Jean yip hair salon has shopback QR,btohqsg
Heymax shows you standard way of earning miles of that merchant. If that merchant does not accept online payment  it shows 0.4 miles. You can use Amaze to convert to online. Heymax does not include the Amaze hack info. It is not suppose to publicly advertise. The hack is for the ‚Äúsecret group‚Äù only.,btohqsg
Anyone uob acct earmarked for the promotion alr ?,btohqsg

I use excel for HSBC EGA. It‚Äôs where I keep all my liquid funds now. Almost daily movement so I have to use excel to track to ensure the interest finally given isn‚Äôt too far off,btohqsg
I think not fair to apply retrospectively. But yes is within the FI legal grounds.,btohqsg
I don't really give a damm... I will withdraw everything when my counter is at 0. If they never give me bonus voucher  I will submit a ticket... And after this matter is settled (regardless of outcome)  I will delete my account and uninstall the app. üò°,btohqsg
If they stated in the tnc  they are able to. If they didn‚Äôt  then we probably have a saying in this,btohqsg
Depends when you register for the promotion. Stated very clearly when your fund will be earmarked,btohqsg
Yes  funds earmarked and cash rewards credited on same day 20 May.,btohqsg

hi  anyone using dcs ultimate platinum mastercard? it‚Äôs 2% cashback without min spend capped at 200 per month  looks like it‚Äôs the best among all the no min spend cc (considering we‚Äôre not a high spender since we are looking at no min spend in the first place)is there any catch to this cc?,btohqsg
just make sure not in exclusion list,btohqsg
Difficult to cancel. You may end up need to pay annual fee from 2nd year onwards?,btohqsg
Confirm that from 30 Apr till now  your total amount never drop below Mar MAB + participating funds?,btohqsg
I heard the customer service is bad unless you call in for fraud then there‚Äôs actually someone to attend to you,btohqsg
yea i‚Äôve browsed through the terms and conditions for its exclusions  quite similar to other no min spend cc  just afraid that i missed out something,btohqsg
ahh i see  hopefully no need to call customer service for any help üòÖ,btohqsg
You applied liao ah? I was thinking of getting it too  the rewards seems ok but then the reviews of it not very good. Scared 2nd year onwards jialat when need to request waiver etc,btohqsg

true hor  when need to request for fee waiver then the problem comes if the customer service is bad,btohqsg
Maybank is same as due date,btohqsg
Small issue ba  at most cancel the card,btohqsg
you can request for fee waiver from the app itself... i got one late payment and managed to waive it using app within a day,btohqsg
For UOB big saving promo  only can participate in 1 qualify month?,btohqsg

Hi guys need your advice until now I‚Äôm trying to apply for a credits card from various bank and is unsuccessful.What should I do to get a credit card?,btohqsg
the easiest way is using Secured Fixed Deposit way.have you shared your profile with us before?NationalityJobApprox salaryStatus of your relationship with Singapore,btohqsg
Why unsuccessful....I also unsuccessful with ocbc bank apply 2 times... all rejected..Only foreign bank   dbs   uob accept me.Only in March ocbc then accept me,btohqsg
Seriously bro...Ocbc is the most strict among all other banks,btohqsg
Profile as in here?Nationality - SGJob- warehousingApprox salary - 2 200,btohqsg
I‚Äôve tried like POSB   ocbc  UOB & trust card all decline,btohqsg
oh bro.. if $2200 x 12 = $26 400. That is below the $30k MAS requirement..,btohqsg
Just realised you edited the amount üòÇLike that best is FD secured card with bank,btohqsg
Yes. Secured is easiest .Some bank required min 10k.I heard for solitaire lady card require 30k then can,btohqsg
What is the best option?1. I go to the bank and ask for the FD secured card ?Or2. I do it online   put in 10k in FD and apply for a credit card ?,btohqsg
Can I know what is considered foreign bank?,btohqsg
U need to go bank sign a form to use the FD as collateral based on what I know for UOB.And interest rates usually not good. So do consider what‚Äôs best for you.,btohqsg
Yes I did the same too. FD 10k sgd as collateral.,btohqsg
What if they make both fee waiver and card cancellation difficult because of poor customer service? üåö,btohqsg
Basically beside 3 local bank  all remaining is foreign entity that open here lah,btohqsg
Citibank Singapore Limited will be so sad to hear this....,btohqsg
Foreign entity can open sg limited  aus limited  my limited  look at parent company,btohqsg
Just like when people mention the australia big 4 bank same,btohqsg
Citibank singapore is a subsidiary of citibank america of course,btohqsg
I forget about scb. Because their redemption rate to miles is poor,btohqsg
Boc and icbc basically they are poor in miles... never mind. Hsbc also part of China now... revolution  and travel 1 card. I believe will continue to be strong,btohqsg
Why is it related to miles all of a sudden,btohqsg
What are you getting at talking about China out of the blue lol,btohqsg
Icbc don't have miles   previously there is promotion for boc . Need to spend certain amount cash in SQ to get the miles,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the link between miles and bank locations?,btohqsg
Does anyone have a good system to track when their card will be charged for annual fees?,btohqsg
too many credit cards to keep track,btohqsg
You will get used to it üòå#iykyk,btohqsg
Dont bother about him  we talk A  he answer B then change to C,btohqsg
Yea I know  it‚Äôs my daily entertainment,btohqsg
Because previously sam you ask what is considered foreign bank,btohqsg
Then how is it related to miles?,btohqsg
This depends on the card what the bank offers,btohqsg
Anyway all those who want to jump in may snack challenge rmb to do so within this few day to enjoy the monthly dividend.,btohqsg
Hahaha so a bank is foreign and miles is related?,btohqsg
Hopefully their customer service improves after Tin Pei Ling joined.,btohqsg
I feel is related. Because in my opinion foreign banks are more capable to offers 4 miles. Whereas local banks offers by blocks of 5,btohqsg
Cannot join liao ba  alrd out of subscription slots liao,btohqsg

No la  I heard someone complained and she immediately got CSO to follow up,btohqsg
gxs maribank also not local? haha,btohqsg
Digital bank shouldn‚Äôt be taken into consideration,btohqsg
Please read the banking license difference  digital bank not full fledge banking license. That why alot of restriction,btohqsg
what‚Äôs a good way to easily hit that min spend on credit cards?,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits and lifestyle,btohqsg
Oh? What kind of vouchers? and where can we buy?,btohqsg
Are there apps or e-wallets where we can ‚Äútop up‚Äù with CC  then spend the money later?,btohqsg
U can but the mcc wont qualify for any reward except grab top up with uob absolute cashback,btohqsg
Chris has a yt video on this topic. You may refer to it.,btohqsg
I bought lots of NTUC vouchers when UOB Lady's gave 6mpd,btohqsg
you know when u use the vouchers you don't earn link points ya,btohqsg
Buy eCapitavoucher from Wogi  then spend balance in any amount. In app purchase is excluded as it is counted as wallet top up.,btohqsg
Actually can just buy wogi credit and redeem which ever voucher u like later more flexibility,btohqsg
Is there a mcc code for wogi purchase,btohqsg
Does anyone know if webull is involved in some forex trading thing ?The profit seem extremely high,btohqsg
Hi all. What's the best choice if you're a lazy person and wanna park your cash somewhere without the restrictions of crediting salary etc  but at the same time you have access to your cash and use it like a regular bank.Is Maribank only a digital bank for interest or it has Debit card options too?,btohqsg
Ya maribank  no debit card option,btohqsg
The other chat also got another entertainer üòÇ,btohqsg
Heard they are same person with 2 accounts.,btohqsg
GXS or maribank would be your best option. GXS has a card that you can use but the troublesome thing is higher interest is only given on the savings pocket and transaction made with the card will need to be deducted from the main account. So if you want to spend it  you need to transfer from the savings pocket to main account. But GXS stopped new joiners le,btohqsg
Haha maybe kena ban there create another account,btohqsg
Ah in that case my only option is Maribank 2.88% or UOB One with the salary credit and spending yea?,btohqsg
Also from Wogi website? Can't find where to buy Wogi credits,btohqsg
What do you mean plan? Just the ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
Ok ok I'll check it out. Thanks,btohqsg
Any reason HSBC EGA is not considered?,btohqsg
Not sure what‚Äôs his definition of restrictions. GXS and maribank is the ones that I know that is more no frills and he mentioned that he‚Äôs lazy and want to park his funds somewhere,btohqsg
Just went to read on hsbc egaIs the 1% rebate on giro bill payments also applicable for iras tax?,btohqsg

Nope  didn‚Äôt. But for restaurant in msia  payments still able to pay tho..,btohqsg
Maybe can try going to the counter to pay,btohqsg

Hi! Sorry if this is a weird question! I‚Äôm thinking to apply for the HSBC Revolution card. Would it be too late to be the first 500 eligible applicants for the gifts if I apply asap? I‚Äôm new to signing up for a credit card  so just wondering if I still stand a chance to get the PS5.üòÜ,btohqsg
No one will know for sure. See your luck only loh  but the offer has been out almost a week. Imo  if I need the card and ok with the rest of the gifts after the 500 applicants  I would still apply. Otherwise wait for the next time,btohqsg
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt looking out to apply for a card until 2 days ago then noticed the deal. Welp. Alrighty then! Thanks for your input!,btohqsg
No worries. It‚Äôs still quite a decent card to have. Can just wait since you‚Äôre not planning to apply without the deal,btohqsg
Can drop a email to cardup they reply fast. But as far as i know  if u already set up giro  they will deduct from ur bank on 6th or 20th. So u can check. And for card up recurring payment  they told me they need IRAS to deduct once for the NOA23/24 before cardup can do their payment. I was told May and June payment is an estimate base on previous NOA. So the 1st payment for NOA23/24 is in JUL. Therefore U need put a due date for cardup in JUN  so they can deduct the money from ur creditcard in JUN  couple weeks to reconcile with IRAS  so that it will be in time for JUL deduction.Jun- 1 deduction from ur giro/1 deduction from ur CC for payment in JUL.Jul - 1 deduction from CC for Aug payment..etc etc.Best to ask cardup still. cheers,btohqsg
Hope citi bank will have good miles promotion soon to compete against ocbc 6 miles and also uob ladies card,btohqsg

Hi there  Regardless of when you deposited fresh funds  starting from 20/5/2024  the reward distribution time for those who have not received their reward subsidy has been revised according to the Terms & COnditions (T&Cs). We hope to seek your kind understanding. You may still withdraw and deposit funds at any time  but you need to ensure that on the last day of the activity (16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT)  the net deposit calculated during the activity period (from 1/4/2024  10:00PM SGT to 16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT) meets the fresh fund deposit requirement based on the respective task.Meanwhile  to strengthen your trust  Moomoo offers additional coupon benefits. You can access the Cash Plus 6.8% annualized income promotion page Ôºàhttps://invest.sg.moomoo.com/investsmartereup2404Ôºâtoclaim it  ensuring your investment return. (Expected to be updated and launched on May 23rd  you can go to the activity page to claim it after the 6.8%p.a.earnings period ends.It should be noted that customers who receive a 60-day 6.8% p.a.earnings period can receive interest rate increase coupons 7 days before the 6.8% p.a. earnings period ends),btohqsg
Would this be too JIT? Or before 10am sat proven to be safe?,btohqsg
Thanks for highlighting this. Im aiming for 100k so i will still have some funds in UOB one even after trf out.,btohqsg
Saturday before 10am is safe. The cutoff for Saturday is usually 1pm/5pm/10pm  so 10am confirm safe.,btohqsg
They deleted the chat post in moomoo on this topic.Think many will be caught unaware of this new change to the 6.8% clause.,btohqsg
Yeaaa  I just found out too,btohqsg
Hi everyone  have a query for the UOB Big Savings Payout Promo..My March ADB was $104k.. then i funded another $50k to participate for additional $50k to get $250.. so the additional $50k was earmarked already on 21-May (and received the $250 liao).So my query is the the excess $4k can i withdraw without affecting my promo eligibility?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I noticed that my UOB one available balance is  20k higher than my reflected balance due to the UOB Big Savings payout promo where i supposed they are reflecting a lower balance  due to the clause of 'no withdrawal for 4 months'. I' m cool with that but does anyone know if the UOB one interest will be based on the true balance or the reflected balance (lower amount)? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
UOB One interest is based on Account (not available) Balance's MAB,btohqsg
For the updated tncs  20 May 2024  for moomoo cash plus 6.8% guaranteed return:For scenario 1  does it mean that one can withdraw the fund after 16 July 2024 9:59PM and it might take up to 14 working days (5 Aug 2024) to receive the delta returns?For scenario 2  assuming one‚Äôs qualifying period ends on 17 July 2024  he/she can withdraw on 18 July 2024 and it might take up to 7 working days (26 Jul 2024) to receive the delta returns?It seems as though it is more beneficial for those who participate in the promo later (scenario 2) as they dont have to lock up their funds longer to be assured of the 6.8% guaranteed returns.Am i missing something here?Thanks! üôè,btohqsg
Hi all. Using SMRT card to make atome payment is not always MCC 5999?Citibank told me that it‚Äôs charged under ‚ÄúMiscellaneous and Specialty Retail Stores and not online. ‚Äú therefore could not earn cashback. I thought atome always uses 5999. Any expert can advise me please.,btohqsg
Yes  too late for us that already joined earlier,btohqsg
To be clear  for scenario 1  we cannot withdraw even after the 20/40/60 days  in order to get the 6.8% returns  and we are only guaranteed the 6.8% returns for the 20/40/60 days?,btohqsg
Atome so far is 5999 but not always online.,btohqsg
No  you can withdraw after 20/40/60  but will not get extra $ as per 6.8% interest,btohqsg
What i meant was cannot withdraw to be eligible for the 6.8% returns. Edited my original query.,btohqsg
Uob promotion:March MAB:$87000Register May promo  31st May balance :$87000+ fresh fund 150k=$237000(31st May)On June  can I withdraw some fund out and maintain the MAB $150k and balance $150100 sit for the earmark on 20 June?,btohqsg
nope you cannotyou need to maintainMarch MAB amount (please look at app figure) + $150 000 + $10 buffer through the entire earmark promo,btohqsg
which means very lugi for u,btohqsg
Ya  will think of others method.,btohqsg
a number of us are totally emptying UOB One in June.. (leave $1001)then july participate,btohqsg
later UOB go and use AVERAGE OF THREE MONTHS MAB.. don't come find me ah,btohqsg
for supermarket spendings do y‚Äôall still use the citi rewards + instarem amaze combo?,btohqsg
i using UOB Lady Family category,btohqsg
Not even worth to put past 150k..,btohqsg
HmMy reading was otherwise as you need to keep the funds till 16 July.After 14 days from 16 July then they will issue the delta between the 6.8% and the fund output %.13. When will the cash reward from 6.8%p.a. be issued?The cash reward will be issued according to the following scenarios: Scenario 1 If your activity period (20/40/60 day) has ended before 16/7/2024 9:59pm SGT  the reward will be issued within 14 working days after 16/7/2024 9:59PM SGT.,btohqsg
So you are stuck in it for an extended period of time at the market rate which could be 3-3.5%?,btohqsg
Quite cunning of them to do this retrospective one sided change for moomoo cash plus,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGare you planning to do an update to your viewers on this?Think many subscribe to moomoo cash plus from your channel,btohqsg
Yes  that's why I thinking fund in 31st May to increase the fresh fund  then withdraw fund out for June to remain $150k MAB.üòÇ,btohqsg
is there surcharge for Instarem Amaze card when paying internet bills ?,btohqsg
Huh  are you joining this big savings promo? If yes  you can‚Äôt withdraw the funds out,btohqsg

Not sure if I‚Äôm missing out anythingMy atome is not coded at 5999.I bought something from a motorcycle shop and paid w atomeIt‚Äôs coded as 5533,btohqsg
If withdraw anytime  will still meet the fresh funds requirements?,btohqsg
I don't think it meets the requirements  if withdraw anytime,btohqsg

HSBC can give 4.x% for 1 month,btohqsg
You can use trust account where if you fulfil there criteria (100k  salary giro  5 x trust card use  ntuc member)  you will be able to get 3.5%. The good thing is it applies up to 500k. I will use this account to store temporary and deploy my funds in/out.,btohqsg
Hi all  I am very confused on HSBC EGA and I plan to open it on June since the promotion going to end by 31 May.1. how much do I need to deposit for this account? E.g. uob need to hit 150K to get the highest interest2. Does the giro apply to paying credit card bill also?Tq,btohqsg

White listed cause 5311  I usually get Klook voucher from there using UOB PPV then any remaining small tiny amount I use AMEX KFA üòÇ,btohqsg
Just note the redemption site u have to do it in browser,btohqsg
yes  choose the 15k monthly transfer,btohqsg
Any requirements from bank for an account to be upgraded to Premium other than $15k transfer ?,btohqsg
Yes if they still have the promo. You will need to sign a separate priority banking upgrade form with the $15k monthly in commitment.When I did it they claimed it was a 24 month promo only (must topup to $200k subsequently).Not sure if they do enforce it strictly though.,btohqsg
Thanks üôè. Will check with HSBC CSO on this. As currently my Giro is above $40k. Which premium can‚Äôt go above $300,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt work when we use app ?,btohqsg
The voucher works  just that the redemption page is hard to locate in the app (I always copy and paste the link in the voucher redemption details)- voucher is not applied directly to your booking (works like a wallet basis),btohqsg
I thought they updated through the tnc already?,btohqsg
Yea  but think Chris is checkin w them on the sudden change which is unfair for the customer who sign up prior the change of tnc,btohqsg
I'm will be clarifying the T&Cs and what to do next (as an affected user).Having said that I cannot reverse any change as decision is made by Moomoo SG.,btohqsg
Where to find it in the apps? Thanks!,btohqsg
play store or ios? look for DCS Card,btohqsg
Thanks I already install the dcs apps but can‚Äôt find the fee waiver button,btohqsg
Hi  checked with Heymax that smrt cc give 5% for starhub bills. Is it accurate cos not sure if i read somewhere telco bill is excluded?,btohqsg
Go to your card > card management >Request Fee Waiver,btohqsg

Amaze nukes InstaPoints  caps earning at just S$5 per monthFrom 1 June 2024  Amaze will be nerfing its InstaPoints system by adding a 500 IP per month cap. Yes  per month.bit.ly/44TbECMDiscuss this@milelion. Join@milelionroarsfor more updates,btohqsg
Wah. This is bad news . Amaze nerf earning at just 5-$ per month.Spend oversea will at least 200 sing and above...may consider . Revoult soon,btohqsg
Use trust lor easy ni need top up Plus nice decent google rates,btohqsg
"Nerf or not  I don't really care about Amaze's InstaPoints. I just want to use Amaze to tank the otherwise 3.25% bank FX fees and ""slightly better"" exchange rate while binding it with my Mastercard for rewards that's all.",btohqsg
Bro. Revoult can withdraw oversea up to 350 is free,btohqsg
Overseas  I use trust when I need cash and amaze linked card for payment. Different use cases.,btohqsg
in order to get the 8.4% rewards  the $$$ must be go to the moneybull or any of the money market fund will do ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm curious where you get this 200 sgd from,btohqsg
Yea i think it still has its uses  as long as it fx spread is below bank 3.25% for UOB ladys etc. Converting spend to online for CRMcC  UOB Krisflyer  etc,btohqsg
The $200k upgrade route need to maintain $200k in the account else they will downgrade you again. If you cannot maintain that just do the $15k monthly route. Using $15k route you can do the $15k in and do 5 transaction and withdraw out the fund if you wish.,btohqsg
Because go holiday you need to eat and spend shopping oversea .,btohqsg
If you spend 200sgd  nerf or not doesn‚Äôt affect you,btohqsg
1st of June. You will pay 2.1% if visa top up... so better not use visa .,btohqsg
Thumb of rule.Never ever use any source of top up using your rewards card. 0 miles earn.,btohqsg
Ohhh nooo cannot use visa alrd. My life is going to end,btohqsg
Is this mean to be a pun?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see a pun tho,btohqsg
Coz visa top up wallet always have charges  only mastercard no to amaze wallet. But now all have fee liao. Have u been toping up amaze wallet with visa?,btohqsg
Amaze big change just only 1 insta point to 0.5? Top up fees no impact if pay using credit card,btohqsg
every $2 1 point so you will get cashback up to $1k spend monthly,btohqsg
Erm  top up fee increase for both visa and mastercard from 1 jun to amaze wallet,btohqsg
If using credit card to pay directly no impact right?,btohqsg
Then it is not consider top up. It is link card  with nerf like this within a few month of amaze  not hard to see more nerf coming. Just not sure when and what it is,btohqsg
A lot of possible nerfs that will come. But if they remove those no one will use the card since amaze card by itself is pretty useless,btohqsg
Like grabpay card die off by itself loh,btohqsg
Yea not surprising that will happen to amaze. Honestly they kinda dumb to increase the top up fee and reduce the instapoints in the same nerf.,btohqsg
Time to update amaze again after the Grab nerf series,btohqsg
This means the company has done the analysis. Top up wallet n insta point rewards does not give profit to the company because low FX spread n rewards eat into its profit.,btohqsg
I know but doing it in the same nerf doesn‚Äôt incentivise people to top up to amaze rather than using linked card. Now they are just targeting one use case which is using amaze and link card.,btohqsg
But the cap of instapoints in the issue if they wish to target more user groups,btohqsg
Paynow is instant cash gone haha. Use cc top up then giro from ega u get extra 1 percent,btohqsg
isn't it supposed to be rule of thumb...,btohqsg
Basically they limit user to spend 1k on link card for overseas uses to get the max reward,btohqsg
Amaze wallet fx rate is not even that low compared to other travel cards right?,btohqsg
I guess ppl prefer trust or youtrip more after the change,btohqsg
Yea I mean if they were to increase top up fee but increase points earn through wallet. At least that can target a seperate group. Just my two cents,btohqsg
Use to be able to clock the 2k insta in a few month  now is at least 4 month then can redeem 1 time 20 dollar  1 year is 60 only.,btohqsg
Technically ya  but more likely people uses linked card  so retrospective to bank fx fee is better,btohqsg
Yes  i mean amaze wallet as a use case is now bad since you can use other travel cards and no need to be held hostage by their cashback,btohqsg
Ya their instapoint expire in 12 month as well haha,btohqsg
I think the problem with limit to 500 instapoint per month is when ppl go travelling  that is when big spending hit. I go malaysia weekly for doc also wont hit the 500 instapoint. Haha,btohqsg
Sometimes I made big purchase overseas. This change will make amaze quite limiting for that purpose.,btohqsg
Yea if you go like Europe countries or even Japan  easily hit the cap. Better choice would be an annual cap instead of a monthly since people don‚Äôt usually spend huge amount every month,btohqsg
wouldn't amaze be more for the amaze + crmc   so that you can convert to online spending + get 4mpd? instapoints is more like a bonus since its really hard to hit unless you spend in overseas currency often  especially with the 12 months expiry date,btohqsg
Before the nerf was quite easy  the limit was 500 per transaction instead of per month.,btohqsg
Hiii dining at Kopitiam and paying with FairPrice app is it considered dining or family?,btohqsg
When I search on this chat paying to town council seem like not much option,btohqsg
To earn Cashback too bo other option ?,btohqsg
Any insurance pros here ? Eg I go to the hospital as a follow up to my accident. I pay bill myself and then make a claim against insurance companies after that. However  I have 2 overlapping insurance for personal and company ones. If I double claim  they have to pay me and it should not be trackable isn't it?When I was hospitalised with a 10k bill  I understand the insurance companies pay them directly thus I cannot claim twice.,btohqsg
If pay via axs app ? Visa master which card wil earn Cashback,btohqsg
Thanks! Is it the same MCC when buying groceries at fairprice?,btohqsg
Does anyone have a problem with grabcard transactions today? Tried paying for something online but it keeps saying insufficient funds when there is.,btohqsg
Hi. Can CIMB World Mastercard be linked with Amaze and earn Cashbacks?,btohqsg
Cimb exclude amaze transaction if i am not wrong,btohqsg
can but only 1%-2% provided mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if I can pay my renovation with cardup -charge to HSBC revolution to hit the min spend for Singsaver promo?,btohqsg
are they both integrated shield plan?,btohqsg
can request fee waiver  subjected to approval,btohqsg
Depends how you look at it ba  but amaze online conversion is more of a hack than the official purpose of it. They just haven‚Äôt nerf this yet  maybe they don‚Äôt know what to call this function to nerf it,btohqsg
It‚Äôs probably traceable if they want to,btohqsg
One is shield plan  one is just company hospital benefit. not sure if its legal to claim twice.,btohqsg
Use AXS pay+earn but need to pay service 2.5%,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think you can even claim twice  you should only be able to claim if one plan doesn‚Äôt fully cover the spending and if the other one does  they reimburse the difference that is not covered by the other plan.Why would insurance companies be dumb enough to reimburse you twice and you make a profit out of it? And this can be seen as fraud probably,btohqsg
If previously I've setup the GIRO with another bank and want to switch to HSBC EGA  is it possible?Second question  I read earlier in the chat that it's possible to also use CardUp to pay tax even thought previous GIRO arrangement has been made  just that the I'll need to setup the CardUp payment date to be before the 6th of each month so as to not have IRAS deduct from the current GIRO plan  is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Just to seek clarification  For cardup income tax 2024 promotion  the T&Cs state  the offer may be redeemed 2 times per user on or before 31 Aug. If setting up as monthly payment is the 1.75% rate applicable only for 2 months or the entire 12 months?,btohqsg
Need to be before giro is initate so always better to pay early if u want via cardup route,btohqsg
"Hi  do anyone know if MCC 7011 qualify as UOB lady's card ""travel"""" category rewards?",btohqsg
Just wonder singsaver gift iPad 9th genIt is 2021 model,btohqsg
can i still use ins with the mc?,btohqsg
Company hospital benefit meaning corporate insurance or company let you claim hospital bill? Is 2 different things.,btohqsg
Thats right  they paid 10k for my operation  i did not have to claim . Just wondering for the followup treatments if I can double claim  since im paying myself first.,btohqsg
Just send interbank GIRO form to IRAS through physical mail and they will process it within 21 days.For CardUp payments  you pay this month for the following month (i.e. pay on 12 Jun for Jul). IRAS will reconcile the payment for the month paid when payment comes.,btohqsg
Hi all  i applied for DCS masters platimum card but got rejected. I meet the min income level though. Anyone experienced this also?,btohqsg
U not suppose to double claim,btohqsg
So is company claim and not corporate insurance la.. I mean if you try and successfully do it  then get caught for insurance fraud/abusing company policy  it's on you ü§°,btohqsg
Go read article on recent bank of singapore saga on anyhow claim,btohqsg
Haha we already say cannot ma.. ppl think they 500 IQ to double claim  get caught then their own fault liao. Play stupid games  win stupid prizes.,btohqsg
My Confirmed Income Tax Relief for YA2024 NOAhttps://youtu.be/LBGJ-XbDABg,btohqsg
Its corporate insurance. So the flow is initially hospital bills are paid by personal insurance. Then personal insurance claim against my corporate insurance.But just wondering if I pay subsequent follow up and then have to claim myself   how is it tracked?Who is so free to check if everyone is doing it or not. Follow up money are not that huge anyway.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for interactive broker. How come I don‚Äôt see recurring investment? Is there some sort of setting to do? Additionally  due to the minimum USD conversion rate  is it advisable to deposit USD instead?,btohqsg
You think they don't do audit meh? Like what Queenie said  go read article on BOS false claims lor...Like at most what's the worst right? Pay back  lose job  can't find new job in the same industry?,btohqsg
Aiya  later he kena flag and ask to explain then show his reply to finance lol.,btohqsg
Personally i am contended to earn miles or cashback from paying the follow up first then claim from insurance liao. Not so *smart* to double claim,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone know hdl ps mcc is 5812?ü§™ thanks,btohqsg
Hopefully it's part of how their system runs and its a happy feature to have such that it doesn't cost much to them. Pray hard.,btohqsg
Did you apply for another bank's card recently?,btohqsg
They probably have a system in place to track who claim from where and what. You think people manually key in these entry and calculate how much left you can claim meh? Probably once you claim from one side  you can‚Äôt claim the whole bill from the other side.Not huge why you want try to risk to claim both side? Actually nvm  can go try and let us know?,btohqsg
No i didnt. Will it be better to apply thru their website or their app?,btohqsg
When was the last time you applied for another bank's card? Why would applying another way be any better?,btohqsg
Very interesting leh these people  want to challenge the system then later come back say jialat cannot do it,btohqsg
Double claim can be consider fraud  not exactly a simple system loophole,btohqsg
I mean he sounded so confident can do that and say cannot track so let him try loh,btohqsg
How is that not recent lol,btohqsg
Bos saga also is a few year record all kena dig up and people got fire for small claims,btohqsg
Oh cannot alw apply card? How often can apply?,btohqsg
Hahaha sure got ppl doing it at his company now that's why he's asking,btohqsg
They sure have some things in place since that happened.,btohqsg
All record kept for at least 7 year,btohqsg
Like i say if want to risk go risk big  dont risk for small amt. Rmb city harvest  misappropiate million get a few year term  misappropiate small amt get longer term then millions,btohqsg
Big amount  higher chance of getting flag,btohqsg
I doubt you'll get an answer here. Finding another person who uses grabcard here is like finding a needle in a haystack.,btohqsg
Ppl launder 3b get one year plus only leh. Who knows how much undeclared already went out of SG?,btohqsg
Ya that why i tell u wrack big lol,btohqsg
Correct. But they have revised to old tnc. The end date is back to 1 July and no need to lock up fund once you finish.,btohqsg
At first i type aug 2023üòî then i edited the msg cos i suddenly recall i did apply one card in feb or march this yr,btohqsg
Not sure if this was asked before  can I link instarem amaze to youtrip and use amaze to top up the account huh?,btohqsg
Then I link citi rewards to amaze to earn 4mpd,btohqsg
Yeah ok lo 0.4mpd then haha,btohqsg
Why wanna use YouTrip also? lol 1 way ticket,btohqsg
Like this everyone will top-up to YouTrip  earn the miles  then go ATM to withdraw  free miles for life,btohqsg
Oh really ah  I didn‚Äôt get my Mastercard until now so I haven‚Äôt use it yet,btohqsg
Mostly it‚Äôs just for the conversion to online transactions for crmc and the versatile use of mcc,btohqsg
The cash plus?They never announce officially leh.,btohqsg

You verified that? And you didn't join the previous earmark in Jan?,btohqsg
Hi all  urgent enquiry. I have paid my taxes via cardup and transactions has gone through. But it is still not reflected on my IRAS. Is there some steps I am missing?,btohqsg
Your payment this month will only reflect for next month's payment,btohqsg
Yeah.. I join last sep didn‚Äôt join Jan de. Maybe I wait until 30 May then üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah can wait till then. But you might want to double check your Mar MAB against your lowest end day balance from 30 Apr till today to be sure.,btohqsg
I assume your CardUp payment was few days ago at max? It should reconcile with Jun's payment.,btohqsg
How to check end day balance? The one reflecting on the main page?,btohqsg
Charge date was 20/5  just realised it was due today (24/5).Hopefully will reflect in IRAS records soon?,btohqsg
As on IRAS portal   I have not paid yet.,btohqsg
You might want to check with IRAS... Your charge date is too late. If it's paid through GIRO  20th is the 2nd GIRO deduction date  and will be paid. But through CardUp is about 3 to 4 weeks.Ideally is charge through CardUp on 12 Apr to pay for May. Since 6 May the first GIRO deduction date for May. IRAS will reconcile the payment against your GIRO payment plan.,btohqsg
I was paying one lump sum. So that's not GIRO  right?Sorry  am totally new to CardUo,btohqsg
You did setup the GIRO payment plan on IRAS website right? That's the first requirement stated by CardUp.,btohqsg
Suggest you use#mabcalculatormethod then you can see daily amount. Can stop before step 5.,btohqsg
I just went to card up and followed instructions to pay IRAS,btohqsg
Clearly did not follow the full instructions... Now few scenarios may happen:1. IRAS accepts that payment - all good2. IRAS charges 5% late payment fee and accepts that payment - which you still have to top-up with the fee3. IRAS charges late payment fee and rejects the payment because you did not follow the required first step - suggest you quickly setup your GIRO payment plan and CardUp payments,btohqsg
When you pay at card up,btohqsg
They charged my card on 20/5  IRAS to receive it today 24/5.,btohqsg
Am reading this  as I am doing one time payment  no need GIRO. But will email IRAS to avoid conflict,btohqsg
Take note. You pay at cardup will take a few days to clear. Is not like paynow. Immediately,btohqsg
Oh. You're doing single payment. Then maybe just wait till end month to check. But why not repeat payment? There's absolutely no benefit to be on single payment over repeat payment  while vice versa does.,btohqsg
Am quite confused with the terminologies here. Kindly help a brother here üôèüèæüôèüèæ So where is the first GIRO deduction in May getting money from if it's not from CardUp,btohqsg
Chose single payment this time as too confused with the set up (as above) .would certainly love to do recurring payments for next year's YOA,btohqsg
Thanks. I'll email them now to avoid misunderstanding,btohqsg
For CardUp payment for May  then in April of course.GIRO is always for the month itself.If not sure what to pay in Apr then let the first month be paid via GIRO (preferably through HSBC EGA).,btohqsg
In other words  for this to work smoothly  gotta settle for tax form asap  so can get NOA and then set up card up payment to start from April (for May due)?,btohqsg
You can setup using the estimated amount they provide in Mar. But if you file your own tax form then maybe you won't be able to setup CardUp for Apr already. I'm on no filling so no issues with me setting up my payments in Mar to start paying in Apr.,btohqsg
In this case  say I use hsbc ega for first month payment  then cardup for the rest  I'll have to then cannel the giro plan via hsbc as well?,btohqsg
No. Do not cancel the GIRO plan. Read the screenshot you sent,btohqsg
I see. Now the screenshot starts to make sense üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Next qn is  what card you used?,btohqsg
Thank you all. I'll do my homework and hopefully get to set this well for next year.,btohqsg

Trust vs amaze  I've done this comparison 1 year agohttps://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM,btohqsg
Actually bros I feel even now amaze going to nerb.. is still good to use amaze to earn 4 miles oversea.,btohqsg
But the worse I got it in Jan this year airport at hcm .. I buy sim card. When I was paying payment suddenly amaze card can't be used... no choice have to use scb card ...,btohqsg
I did remember to activate amaze card oversea... later on I eat with friends I try again.... the restaurant in vietnam accept amaze card. Lucky,btohqsg
I think you use cash better. No need think. Just pay.,btohqsg
buy viet wife can use amaze card?,btohqsg
Usually I use cash in spore when coffee shop or hawker. Or fun toast insist on paynow... so I pay cash,btohqsg
Nowadays I only keep 40$ in wallet. The rest just use samsung pay,btohqsg
We are not interested in how much cash you carry and how you pay for stuff. You can keep this to yourself.,btohqsg
The nerfs only affect top-ups and IP earning what. Why would it affect how good or not it is for people who are going to pay using linked card?People who pay using linked card are generally more concerned on:1. Avoid paying bank's 3.25% FX charges (albeit the rates are not as great as YouTrip/Trust - covered by rewards earned)2. Converting offline txns to online (this is considered a hack and may be patched anytime)This clearly shows you didn't even bother watching Chris' video that he generously sent a couple of minutes ago.,btohqsg
Can try AMEX pay or Citi payall,btohqsg
Previously I watch . I also agree with him... seriously I hope they won't take off the link to master cards. Or citi   uob nerd amaze... I be upset,btohqsg
Can try citipayall  since the name say can pay for all things,btohqsg
Once amaze removes those features  we will find new ways lor. For now just enjoy and swipe away üòÄ. I'm sure Chris will cover it when that happens. *touch wood* for Amaze not dumb enough to do that.,btohqsg
He scared people rob him  so he tell others only got 40$ inside  not worth it,btohqsg
Utilities can't citi pay all. And also keppel electricity bills. I already tried .,btohqsg
Thank you very much for your confirmationbut do you think viet wife can use Citi pay all,btohqsg
Actually some time such thing happen.. look at Dbs they remove amaze .. so means earn no reward points.,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt  for now. Since there‚Äôs still a large use case especially in this era where people are travelling more often.,btohqsg
Buy Viet wife can earn miles?,btohqsg
Yeah didn‚Äôt have any transactions. Not sure what I did wrong ahaha üòÇ maybe shall wait and see,btohqsg
The date you registered correct? Different month register different earmark date,btohqsg
Must try amaze empty wallet check MCC Liao.. heymax don't have,btohqsg
Ohh then see by 31st may have bo loh  since technically they have until 31st to earmark it,btohqsg
Well assuming you registered with the correct amount  account and you verified your Mar MAB against your end of day balances then just wait lo. At most try register again on 31 May.,btohqsg
Still got people haven‚Äôt receive their NOA? I tried asking for earlier they ask me why i want it haha. Pay them earlier still ask so much,btohqsg
Hello all! I have a portion of USD in moneybull and I want to deposit more idle USD into the moneybull account. How do I do so? Pls advise~ thanks!,btohqsg
Me but I used the estimated amount to submit to CardUp üëÄ,btohqsg
Later then adjust the amounts ü§£,btohqsg
How accurate is the estimated compared to actual? I first time paying income tax hahaOhh but what if your first amount is lower or higher than the actual amount,btohqsg
I think usually quite accurate eh. The payment plan only start when NOA is received so they will clock it as you paid x months early. Just adjust accordingly that's all.,btohqsg
Ahh ok  coz I can‚Äôt edit my current payment plan also without the NOA,btohqsg
Yeah because you got no NOA.. the estimated only available in Mar/Apr üëÄ,btohqsg

Today the comex IT at suntec  example if i buy an item worth $900   do I earn 10X reward if use amaze+ citi reward cc ?,btohqsg
Actually if amaze remove the credit card link... it will be a all close competition between revoult   trip and even wise.... so far I never seen any vietnamese dong inside these 3 travel cards.,btohqsg
Anyone manage to get annual fee waiver with BoC? I spent around 30k last year,btohqsg
My electricity bills go thru via Citipayall successfully.,btohqsg
Wise got dong. You can even send it to your Vietnam wife,btohqsg
I use wise all the time to send dong all the time,btohqsg
But problem can't link with citi rewards card,btohqsg
Coz‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not their purpose. It‚Äôs meant to give competitive rates similar to money exchange. If amaze removed link card no one will even use it.,btohqsg
Not sure what is the problem statement for you.You gotta have a problem statement before you can have a solution for it,btohqsg
Wise is a direct competition to revoult and trip,btohqsg
Before I use amaze. I am thinking of whether to pay the fee for revoult metal card,btohqsg
Sometimes human problem is the problem statement ü§°,btohqsg
Till date i still find this one of the most comprehensive video. Actual calculations all done swee swee there,btohqsg
why would u want a revolut metal card?,btohqsg
Anyone manage to link up Amaze card with SCB Manhattan card? Amaze failed to link up this card. Any advise?,btohqsg
Sat ki ma  pay that time accidentally drop then got cling clang sound,btohqsg
The problem statement is he wants a platform that provides linking of credit card and give best rates,btohqsg
When u use a bad card  better not draw attention... Imagine Grab also comes out with a metal card version. ü•≤,btohqsg
i once saw a lady tap CRMC card physically at a bakery shopvery tempted to tell her that its the wrong way to use  but i think maybe she knows somethng i dont know,btohqsg
Well grab was ok when it first came out. Revolut not too bad ba but there‚Äôs better options,btohqsg
im guessing she doesnt get to maximise it but i dont know? so i did not think much of it,btohqsg
Maybe the bakery sell bag not still bread üåö,btohqsg
yeah maybe the bakery mcc is a shopping mcc,btohqsg
Haha mebe some people didn‚Äôt really pay attention about mcc,btohqsg
Yeah maybe need to put them in one grp with heymax staff alone üëÄ,btohqsg
Some I saw use citi premier miles to use at toast box and ya kun. You can't fault them on this... is up to them,btohqsg
hmmmmm premiermiles no good for toastbox arh,btohqsg
Haha. You go read up on citi premier miles ...,btohqsg
you tell me la  since you also dont like to read.,btohqsg
I read up also... ok share with you.Citi premier miles is a good card .. mostly I actually use it when bo pian.. burst the bonus cap on hsbc revolution... then use. Go use it go agoda. 6 to 7 miles per dollar other.. others usage only earn 1.2 miles,btohqsg
When hsbc revolution nerds on travel... hotel... my solution is to use it on citi Web link to agoda book hotel 6 miles earn,btohqsg
you never talk abt toast box and ya kun leh,btohqsg
Toast box and ya kun. I will use uob preferred platinum visa. Hit the over 5$ mark to earn 4 miles.,btohqsg
if you only need to drink 1 kopi  will you help the person behind you pay also to make up $5,btohqsg
If you only buy 1 cup.. then use cash to pay..,btohqsg
no leh  i can use premiermiles what,btohqsg
Bros and sisters.Beware of fun toast.Not all outlets allow paywave. Mostly can't... except harbour front ..,btohqsg
Up to you... i use cash if cost less than 5,btohqsg
brother  if you want to buy 1 cup and want to pay cash  best is you go kopitiam.$1.50-$1.80 cents,btohqsg
Opps.... sorry I forgot about this.. so sorry bro,btohqsg
Sometimes good to be penny wise pound foolish ya. Important to take a few minutes discussing on a chat on what cards to use before spending a few dollars on fast food coffee,btohqsg
Anyone know if pay town council with uob LS will move uob1 tracker for $500 spend?,btohqsg
Some people just can‚Äôt think when in front of counter on what cards to use  I have that experience a few times üòû,btohqsg
"Don't bother unless there's good membership sale1% equivalent means you got to spend 10K before you ""break even"" from the cashback",btohqsg
"If the bakery is linked to a ""restaurant"" (e.g. the Breadtalk at causeway point is linked to Toast box)  it getspossibly billedas the restaurantThen again she might be using it to purely clock account requirement too",btohqsg
Is there a way to get a refund on cc annual fee ? Missed the date to ask for waiver and they charged the fee.,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs why I think she has some thinking behind it,btohqsg
Waiver is requested after fee is charged. Just call in and ask ... else if cannot   see if they willing to waive if u ask to cancel,btohqsg
Is Kopitiam app considered online spend? Checked but can‚Äôt find,btohqsg
Anyone got experience with Citi rewards waiving the annual fee? It‚Äôs my most used card.,btohqsg
Citibank are quite liberal with annual fees waiver I feel.Having said that  I have my PREMIERMILES for many years  and I used it for many OCCASIONS including buying coffee @ Toast Box,btohqsg
I think they meant youtrip. If not I dk what he talking also.,btohqsg
Got mine waived after using it for over a year  i always used it with amaze,btohqsg
Some mentioned that it‚Äôs not considered online spend. Might not want to risk it,btohqsg
Restaurant won't clock 4mpd also. That's why I said the bakery sold bags üåö,btohqsg
is the hotline to call just their normal line?,btohqsg
oh my bad  i saw it as Lady's card üòÇ,btohqsg
I wrote in to their support chat (in the app)But if you wanna call  it should be the hotline (called in for fraud   but they seem to accept it as with other transactions),btohqsg
Mostly of the times  nobody know what this guy is trying to say,btohqsg

Guys  which app has the best exchange rate for sgdmyr and also can topup to tng? Thanks,btohqsg
yes but link credit card instead of apple pay,btohqsg
With iChange suspension of TnG reload  alternative is YouTrip. But see this:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/184108,btohqsg
I think amaze cos top up using credit card got surcharge... Using debit card no fee. Then you can giro the underlying credit card of amaze with hsbc giro for additional 1% cashback.,btohqsg
Ya thats the problem now  ichange was the best last time,btohqsg
@MelvynEzicare to share what's wrong with my suggestion? I have an upcoming trip to Malaysia in June... Wanted to top up my amaze wallet before the new charges come in.,btohqsg
What's your actual step-by-step plan when you proposed that?Top-up Amaze Wallet? Then reload to TnG?Reload TnG with Amaze linked card?,btohqsg
Ah... I think I missed a step... Use mastercard top up amaze wallet  then use amaze wallet to top up TnG card.,btohqsg
If u plan to spend  why dont try ichange?,btohqsg
I'll be mainly using amaze card link with maybank FnF card. Only for places where credit card isn't accepted  then I will use TnG.,btohqsg
Hi guru  is it true that if one top up 8k to SA and 15.3k SRS in the same calendar year. This total value of 23.3k will be included in the next year tax relief?,btohqsg
Top-up Amaze Wallet then reload TnG - no CC rewards  have an FX spread (bad exchange rate compared to just using YouTrip)  will incur top-up fees from Jun 24 for Amaze Wallet  withdraw MYR from ATM with 2% feeReload TnG with Amaze linked card - no CC rewards  have even worse FX spread (worse than topping up Amaze Wallet)  incur 1% top-up fees for TnG reload with CC  withdraw MYR from ATM with 2% feeReload TnG with YouTrip - no CC rewards  MasterCard wholesale exchange rate  no top-up fees  withdraw S$400 in MYR from ATM without fees  cannot store MYR,btohqsg
Yes  assuming you understand tax reliefs.,btohqsg
If accept CC  then best to use Amaze linked card. But if going places that only accept TnG/cash  always good to have YouTrip card.,btohqsg
Amaze convert to myr store in wallet  dont use sgd wallet to top up tng. Use the myr wallet,btohqsg
Eh really meh? I thought Amaze Wallet by itself quite closed to spot (like youtrip/trust etc)üò®,btohqsg
Correct ah. But you already incur FX spread the moment you convert to MYR on Amaze Wallet.,btohqsg
Their exchange rate is quite good de. Better then youtrip i find. But after the 1 percent fee inplement then i not sure worth it liao anot,btohqsg
Amaze Linked card is slightly over 2% spread now  Amaze Wallet I remember is almost 1% spread. But to be accurate is just check against MC website before top-up lor.OP's keyword is best exchange rate ma.,btohqsg
hi all  is payment to m1 broadband entitled for cashback for citibank cashback+ credit card?,btohqsg
But youtrip don't have MYR so mastercard will use SGD-USD-MYR for conversion isn't it? Yet their rate will still be better than Amaze wallet SGD-MYR (edit: maybe it is transparent to us  even with MYR currency  mastercard might still do SGD-USD-MYR)?For your para 1  I don't intend to do atm withdrawal  just TnG top up  so I'm not concerned about that. Yes  the 1% top up fee will be the killer after 1 June.,btohqsg
They use SGD-MYR based on MasterCard wholesale rate. Why would they use SGD-USD-MYR?,btohqsg
So youtrip to tng will be better to top up tng wallet?.1st june will incur the charges or all the long have the fees of 1%?,btohqsg
I read somewhere all foreign currency will be converted into USD before converting into sgd. But I'm not 100% sure about that.,btohqsg
I'm not sure... I guess using youtrip is the best according to@MelvynEzi. The amaze top up fee from mastercard credit cards are free  until they start charging 1% wef 1 June.,btohqsg
Able to use other credit cards to top up into tng wallet ?,btohqsg
Sg cc shld be have 1% incurring fees as Well?,btohqsg
TnG charges fee for top ups using credit card. That's why debit cards like YT or Amaze is preferred. Not forgetting the lousy FX rate by credit cards.,btohqsg
HSBC new nerf won't affect restaurant and bread shop right like four leave only ntuc affects and those kpitam,btohqsg
A lot of eating places are 5814  not just Kopitiam.,btohqsg
That's if you pay through banks/merchant conversion.,btohqsg
I see! That's probably where I read the fine prints many years ago! Tks for the clarifications. üòÑ,btohqsg
Actually best way to compare is to do a real time conversion comparison by toping up to tng,btohqsg
From now till 1 Jun  can always check the conversion rates on Amaze app and MasterCard's website then decide to use either Amaze Wallet or YouTrip. Afterwards no point because every top-up to Amaze Wallet has a fee.All SG CC will incur 1% fee for TnG reload  bad exchange rates by bank and 3.25% FX fee by bank.,btohqsg
Oh 5814 kana black liated then HSBC Revo kinda only can use on retail shopping,btohqsg
yes  to be safe just move dining expenses to other cards.,btohqsg

Hi guys  does anyone has experience using PayPal to purchase items (e.g. tickets to a concert) by linking PayPal to an American Express card?Wondering whether it will be counted as eligible spend and earn rewards for the AMEX Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer card.Reason for doing this is because the merchant doesn't accept AMEX but accepts PayPal.,btohqsg
Yes as long as mcc not excluded,btohqsg
I checked the MCC for the tickets is under 4722.From my reading of the T&C of AMEX card  it doesn't seem to be excluded.PayPal does not change the MCC yea?,btohqsg
"Just came across this section in the terms & conditions page of Citi SMRT Card under the ""bill payments"" portion does that mean ALL bill payments are excluded?",btohqsg
You can put more than 150k to get avg of 150k,btohqsg
Yea.. going to.. to increase MAB but need to withdraw by end June for other purpose..,btohqsg
When I apply for UOB one account does it automatically come with a UOB one debit card? As I‚Äôm going to apply for UOB evol card and link to UOB account. Or u can choose when signing up the UOB one account?,btohqsg
It will come with the debit card. But during the application  you can add on the evol card.If I‚Äôm not wrong  the debit card has an annual fee that is waive with 12 transactions a year. I rmb you can request to change to a card only for atm purposes,btohqsg
Hi friendly souls  would like some advise. Currently using UOB One CC for all my spendings. But Im considering to earn miles  to claim Business class air tix to Japan. Choosing only UOB CC  my concern is the waiver fee for the 2nd year onwards and if its worth the switch. My estimations as such:UOB Lady - $120/mth for transportUOB Preferred platinum - $500/mth for general expensesUOB Prvi - Big spending once every quarter for insurance/investment (Cardup)/travel,btohqsg
Insurance u going card up way? What type of investment can use cc and earn point.,btohqsg
Aia insurance & investments using card up,btohqsg
No way to opt out during sign up?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so  like any bank account application sure will give a debit card,btohqsg
Yeapp  but the cardup 2.25% fee is also a factor‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Just giving u a simple view  business class tic to japan is 52k one way saver rate currently. Which mean with 4mpd card u need to spend 13k so if u need return it is 26k spending on 4mpd card. Redemption rate is not guarantee as sia might increase miles required anytime they want which is what we call devaluation,btohqsg
But can request for cancellation once i received right? Should be no penalty I assume,btohqsg
Maybe u want to google for a better understanding?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs penalty but would suggest to see if can change to the atm chip card if you happen to need withdraw money from uob,btohqsg
Card up is a online platform similar to citi pay all. To pay your expenses. Air miles card can be use to pay your expenses. Promotion codes are sometimes available too.,btohqsg
When i checked sia website  a business (saver) class tix return flight to japan is 100k miles.Unfortunately  im just using uob prvi card (1.4mpd) + card up combo (2.25% fee) to pay for my insurance/investment (worth $13k).But thank you for your pov  i should work out how long do i need to claim that japan business class ticket (maybe need advantage instead of saver)  before i cancel to stop paying the waiver fee for UOB Prvi card on the 2nd year. The other 2 CC (lady & preffered platinum) seems to be easy to waive.,btohqsg
52k one way  104k return saver rate.70k one way  140k return advantage rate,btohqsg
Uob privi not hard to waive,btohqsg
Would also like to check  from past users  if the following cred cards are easy to waive off annual fee on 2nd year.I read that the uob prvi card can waive off provided i spend 50k/year. But with my utilisation  i barely spend 15k/year :/,btohqsg
Not really lah  i seldom spend also got waive haha,btohqsg
Thanks all for your inputs ‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
I only spend on the card during their FCY promo. No issue waiving,btohqsg
I read somewhr  uob quite sneaky. Ask for waiver but they deduct from the uni$ instead ü´¢,btohqsg
Yes.. they always do that .. check your uob card statement when is close to 1 year usage. Call in to ask for card waiver  and pay off your outstanding debts.,btohqsg
Guys and ladies . Any of you still having hsbc 1 travel card. I heard news as at today. If you want to cancel the card. You can start transfer to Sq kris flyer or hotel programme as at today until jan 25. Without any convertion fee.,btohqsg
Wow where did you see this?,btohqsg
I saw at milelion. As previously chris say don't want me to share other blog.. so I just share it here,btohqsg
But isn‚Äôt hsbc miles going to be pooled? So it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs earn from travel 1 card anot,btohqsg
This I not very sure . I only know revolution and  hsbc visa infinite able to access 1 travel card  21 airline and hotel transfer partners,btohqsg
Citi bank used to be strong in air partners and hotel transfer partners. Now seem hsbc takes over now as the most air and hotel transfer partners,btohqsg
Any best way to book hotel room for Tokyo to save some money? Which cc to use is better? Tia,btohqsg
Your definition of save some money?,btohqsg
Optimist so I can get things like cash back,btohqsg
I usually go throughbooking.comor Airbnb.. And did not see which cc is better.. can advise,btohqsg
Try agoda. Agoda andbooking.comis the same company. Different bank run different discount right now.always use different browser to do the price comparison between normal agoda page and bank landing page to see which is better,btohqsg
I heard some people say better to use dbs woman world card for agoda than citi premier miles card . Citi premier miles card maybe more expensive in agoda . Is that true ?,btohqsg
Depend  agoda pricing is dynamic. Change every time. So need to have 2 page side by side at the same time to compare.But if dbs wwmc at 18 percent will be better then citi premier at 20 percent due to miles earn,btohqsg
Unless there is bank discount  it's same price lah.,btohqsg
Can. Just talk to UOB chat assist.,btohqsg
Hi all. Quick question. If paying at foodcourt (kopitiam  food republic and food junction etc)  the miles I earn would be the same for Amaze + CRMC/Ladys Solitaire right? Both at 4 MPD.,btohqsg
Nope  crmc plus amaze is 1 dollar block while lady is 5 dollar block,btohqsg
Oh ya. Thanks for reminder. So Amaze + CRMC is the better combo.,btohqsg
Then you should have just earmarked 100k at the start right?,btohqsg

Uob ladies card with travel category,btohqsg
Anyone feels a nerd coming to ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Good options too but I don‚Äôt really play games so to me those are bad cards,btohqsg
Sad  I really wanted elite miles,btohqsg
Surprised they haven't announced anything yet. But I tink will hav nerd,btohqsg
Maybe not so soon since they still leading in terms of 100k balance compared to uob. Think will see the nerd mid year onwards. Plus they just launched the 2x interest for first two months. If any nerd  probably after this promotion end,btohqsg
Uob lady card.I use for Entertainment purpose,btohqsg
Bros.. if you are into wine. Can use in uob lady card for wine connection shop and cafe,btohqsg
Earliest we can see the announcement is in Jun then,btohqsg
Bros... just to check with you guys. Has the 20k miles been credited to your travel 1 statement. I check mine... they say need to wait for June...,btohqsg
you need to give more details for people to give u a substantial answer,btohqsg
Because I apply 3th months ago.,btohqsg
By right this month travel 1 statement should put in 195$ annual fee. And 20k miles was not in my statement also,btohqsg
I applied in Feb  paid my annual fees in MarchGot my miles in about 2 weeks later,btohqsg
The customer service person say you have to wait till end May,btohqsg
Ya highly likely June or July will see some movement. Can‚Äôt really deduce what they going to nerd. At anything below 100k not really good,btohqsg
"Quick question guys. If I apply for the Stan Chart simply cash card first via the singsaver website  and THEN apply for the Stan chart Smart visa credit card next (because it only lets me apply one at a time)  am I still considered a ""new to bank"" member for the Smart Visa card? Because for some reason  I need to spend on the smart visa card instead of the simply cash card to earn the discount from the merchant... thanks in advance for any advice!",btohqsg
Both products are from Standard Chart  so your view do they see you as 1 customer or 2 different customer?,btohqsg
Anyone holding the DBS LIve Fresh Card  is Taobao purchases eligible for 6% cashback?,btohqsg

Hi all  amaze x Citi rewards can get 4mpd for MCC 7991 (tourist attractions) ?,btohqsg
7991 not in exclusion list from ml,btohqsg
Cause not risking it ? ü§î,btohqsg
What‚Äôs there to risk? If it‚Äôs not excluded,btohqsg
Cause it me automatically routing all my travel spend to UOB ladies instead and keeping all touristy places away from CRMC,btohqsg
Coz that‚Äôs what you do? And doesn‚Äôt mean that mcc doesn‚Äôt earn 4mpd on crmc,btohqsg
Edited based on feedback  pls readhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/201899,btohqsg
I feel as a admin of the group  currently not setting good example on how it reflect if someone give a wrong answer as a admin should you be helping or correcting instead of ridiculing a community member trying to be helpful ?The question when unanswered for quite some time  I came in give a quick answer and yeah I give the wrong answer but you just join in and ridicule me for giving the wrong answer ~ that would lead more people more afraid to give a response ? It seem that more are willing to chime when bashing on people rather then when people asking for assistance.I was about to let it go and move on but seen you as a admin and giving this kind of replies and just clowning on the community members. Yeah it might be a joke but as admin you are setting the precedent for other members to bash and ridicule people for giving the wrong answers. People make mistake  we can acknowledge and move on.,btohqsg
Thank you for your feedback üëçüèª,btohqsg
Do not spread misinformation. 7991 is not excluded from earning 4mpd.Do read up the t&c from CRMC before providing advice.,btohqsg
I totally agreed with you. I don't know where@ChrisHMSGfound this admin and why he was appointed him to be admin. This Melvyn is definitely not setting good example and ruining what Chris has built up so far as a helpful and friendly chatgroup.I think Chris should change the admin and just simply look at all the recent post  he has basically giving clown emoji on so many people's post. If he really doesn't like Terry maybe just ban him instead of tagging clown on literally every post he made.I was looking at some of his own post about nerd here nerd there  he doesn't even know what nerd means and made himself like a clown. I think he was trying to say NERF instead of NERD but he can't even tell the difference. I hope@ChrisHMSGcan salvage this before it get worse.,btohqsg
Hi good morning. Can I confirm if payment through HealthHub (polyclinic) is eligible for UOB EVOL cash back for online category?I heard about it somewhere even it‚Äôs hospital but through HealthHub   it is eligibleThank you,btohqsg
wait a couple of days after transaction posted to be rewarded points,btohqsg
I shared with him on the DBS vantage chat. Is it cause of the $5 spending block?,btohqsg
Just wanna verify  $5 spend means accumulate till $5   or each spend must $5 and abv,btohqsg
So maybe is need to wait for the points to come in a few days laterRead further down:How are DBS Points calculated?,btohqsg
There's no spending block for DBS Vantage. It's based on transaction charges divided by $5  multipled by 3.75 DBS points  then rounded down to nearest number. That's why minimum spend to get 1 DBS point is $1.34.OP should get 2 DBS points for $2.9 transaction.,btohqsg
Posted today? Can check again tomorrow.,btohqsg
Wah very informative! Thanks for the info,btohqsg
1. Admin is only human and is already rather tolerant.2. Some members appear to be trying very hard to troll and to provoke.,btohqsg
Does this apply same to Dbs World woman card?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs good that you give a response to someone that asked a question but it‚Äôs better to give the right answer than the wrong one as this might cause people to worry or track their points earned incorrectly. If you‚Äôre unsure and wish to help  an easy Google search will give you the answer or give a non-definitive answer will be better.We don‚Äôt live in this chat 24/7  hence it‚Äôs common that some questions may not be answered promptly.,btohqsg
Yes payments via Health hub app are counted for Evol online cb,btohqsg
Hi.. can I ask if Telco and utilities spending charged to Ocbc 365 card counted towards the 360 account $500 credit carding spending ?,btohqsg
Yes I read. Awarded by blocks of 5,btohqsg
Guys . Take note . Do not pay your bills on axs machine or apps . Pay + earn.  No bonus miles awarded. Using dbs woman card.,btohqsg
1x point: 1 dbs point every $59x point: 1 dbs point every $0.556,btohqsg
Yes... bro... thanks for clarification further....,btohqsg
Clown emoji has been removed. There is no need to ridicule anyone if they made the wrong input  but please correct them in a polite manner.For Edwin  I apologize on behalf as this is not the right conduct. I agree with the notion of do not kick people when they are already down.Admin Melvyn has been very helpful to the community and has already acknowledged the matter. So please do not look past his contributionsFor Terry  despite his post history  he is harmless in this group and has not been offensive to anyone nor violate the group rules (for now)Please behave like adults in this group  I do not want to babysit people here.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if I use the lazada instalment of credit card per month  can it count as monthly online spend transaction to clock miles on crmc? Or monthly instalment not counted?,btohqsg
May I ask when you book hotel with Agoda  need to pay with credit card immediately  so as to enjoy the bonus miles?,btohqsg
CRMC excludes hotel.Evol can earn miles?,btohqsg
Yes excludes travel. Evo no miles  but my current strategy is more pro cashback and FX spend with lower FX spread. I only accumulate miles with CRMC and HSBC Revo (for flights tickets only),btohqsg
Agoda has option. To with hold the price . Can pay within a certain date,btohqsg
If u pay now it lock in the current rate and post the payment to your card then u will earn miles after transaction posted.If u choose paylater  the rate is fluctuated and payment since is later  it will get the miles after transaction is posted,btohqsg
Crmc exclude travel spending for bonus points  including flight ticket,btohqsg
Yes I never use CRMC for any travel related including hotel related stores/ restaurants,btohqsg
Hsbbbbbnbccc Revo should be removed as too much Nerf,btohqsg
Not really  there‚Äôs still use cases for it and still on par with the other 4mpd cardsPlus most cards have a cap at 1k. So revo can be a supplement card for spendings above 1k,btohqsg
