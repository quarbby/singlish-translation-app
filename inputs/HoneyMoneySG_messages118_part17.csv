Ok. So I need to move out the money first then sign up  then move it back in?,btohqsg
And How badly will it affect my one account interest if I move money out and back? Is one day enough?,btohqsg
Please read the tncs carefully if you want to take part. I would say you are probably too late to participate for this round.,btohqsg
Hi all  I got one question.For priority pass  can I borrow my relatives to access the lounge without my presence?,btohqsg
Oh. So it’s 30 days. I thought I read people were going to empty the account right before July in anticipation of an earmark promo in July (I forgot about it!). So this means it doesn’t work that way  we can’t move out the money just for a couple days and move back in to take part  am I getting it?,btohqsg
