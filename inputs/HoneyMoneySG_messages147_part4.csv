Hi guys  for parent relief  if staying with parents and only 55 yo mum is not working (not earning more than 4k in the year 2024)  do I apply for relief in 2024 or apply in 2025 or it doesn't matter?,btohqsg
Qn: what cards should I tag to Changi pay ?,btohqsg
Only can use the balance inside,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just wanted to double check for UOB PPV  if I want to order Luckin (MCC 5814) & 5814 is listed in the online whitelist  so I can do in app transactions and earn 4mpd right??,btohqsg
I wanted to get a rolex but definitely not willing to pay way above retail price. I guess even 33% drop is still above the retail price.,btohqsg
Why not both? Unless you say she's going to be working next year and earning above $4k?,btohqsg
Provided the MCC for the app payment is 5814 also.,btohqsg
Hmm actually just applying for 1 year in 2024 and I don't know how the accounting works  to apply in the same year even when there's few days left or wait for year to conclude then apply,btohqsg
how to know? cause I checked on Heymax it says 5814,btohqsg
They do take it literally. If your parents earn less than 4k (I believe it is 8k for this year but please check with iras) from 1st Jan 2024 till 31st Dec 2024 and you fulfill the other requirements  you can claim the relief when the income tax comes next year.,btohqsg
Do you have Amaze card? You can charge to Amaze(linked to empty wallet) to check the MCC.,btohqsg
Tax season is not now. It is in Feb to April each year.So for income n relief in 2024  (year of assessment 2025) it will be done by April 2025.,btohqsg
have but I capped it alrdy so gotta use Uob ppv üòÖ,btohqsg
Ya link to empty wallet so that the transaction gets declined then you can check MCC. If it‚Äôs 5814  you can use PPV. If not then you need to find another card.,btohqsg
link to Amaze wallet is it?,btohqsg
if we signed up for cc but decided that we don't need it  will it be auto cancelled if we don't activate it?,btohqsg
You have to cancel it manually,btohqsg
thanks bro  appreciate ur response üôè,btohqsg
Take note that you'll not be new to bank anymore.,btohqsg
yeah  my friend went to sign up for DCS cc without checking the reviews ü´†,btohqsg
Anyone uses trust card to withdraw from atm in JB. Any advice which atm don't charge a fee. So far I tried UOB   don't seem to have any charges. But UOB only available at city sq,btohqsg
Siao Liao guys; I click this on the TMRW app and then it say it is done? I don‚Äôt remember keying in my krisfler details leh  where it goes35 000 uni$ üôà,btohqsg
May i know what is wrong with dcs cc?,btohqsg
If you have uob kf card I assume they would have the information I guess but I have not tried yet.,btohqsg
May i know what is wrong with dcs cc?,btohqsg
As good as non-existent customer svc / support,btohqsg
yeah this  the reviews are horrible,btohqsg
Have you enrolled before?  If you have  they already have the details. No need to key in. Anyway if there‚Äôs any error  the UNI$ would go back to your account within next few days.,btohqsg
I agree. My request to terminate the card took a while and after a few times I had to call in again cos they didnt do it.,btohqsg
You were lucky. I have been trying to contact them via call and WhatsApp but no response for almost a year. I just block my card,btohqsg
You have to be persistent. I call and call and call until I get through. Cos I was being charge for late fees twice for the annual charges which I told them I want to cancel the card.,btohqsg
Thanks sis  damn scary!! Heng I call UOB they say I got link le,btohqsg
But talking about positive experiences  the customer team via trust app chat responded fast. I went to Shanghai and my trust card was block probably due to they thought it is a case of fraud. I was first time in Shanghai and you have a list of transactions done in Shanghai start appearing. I was able to explain via their app chat they unblock my card promptly. Lesson learned  have 2 cards in your Alipay just in case.,btohqsg
Oh gosh. I was hoping to use the 2% cashback card. So not recommended to start using?,btohqsg
Hi experts  would just like to take ask on the opinion/perspective of the altitude card 5mpd promo on foreign spend  is it worth it generally?,btohqsg
Did they waive the fees for you in the end?,btohqsg
They did. I called them in Sep to cancel card as I dont want to pay the annual charge in Aug. I was charged in Sep & Oct and I called them that I have already called in previously to cancel. They didnt dispute my words. But the hassle is I have to keep calling. The problem if no one pick up then it will lead to voice message. Then I have to call again. There is no chat function on their app,btohqsg
31th last day alr leh. Now then ask?,btohqsg
Trust Cashback can only add to google and apple pay right?No support Samsung pay ?,btohqsg
Trust Cashback card category can only select 1 category to earn bonuses?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I would likely have to spend around 15-20K on home/electrial appliances at Gain City/courts/HN. Should I apply for credit card or take a personal loan. If credit card  which one is good? I'm not sure there is spending limit for credit card. I'm new to this,btohqsg
Bank will grant you a limit for your credit card. The limit depends on various factors and your income is quite important.Imo  dont spend beyond your ability to pay off.,btohqsg
"There are some ads running about some company called ""Arta"" any idea about that guys? Is it only for rich people?",btohqsg
