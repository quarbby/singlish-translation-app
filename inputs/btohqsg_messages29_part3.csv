So the moral of the story is take full day leave ü§£ and don‚Äôt schedule anything aft,btohqsg
Or pray you get the first appointment of the day haha,btohqsg
When I went down for selection  I was done in 20 minutes. Actually took the whole day off üòÇ,btohqsg
That time we waited 4hrs plus for our turn,btohqsg
0845 appointment  so first one of the day haha,btohqsg
But to be fair I‚Äôm a single and had all my documents in order and uploaded  and brought spare hardcopies,btohqsg
Haha I see mine was 10am+ I think  finished by around 1+. Went there around 9,btohqsg
Why so long? Usually it‚Äôs one hour on average,btohqsg
The actual waiting time should be around 2 hours. I may have exaggerated since I included the time I waited before the appointment  making it a total of about 4 hours for me. It probably took a bit longer because there were quite a lot of BTO project selections that day üòÜü§£,btohqsg
Feb bto should be launching soon! As hdb map updated with blocks for feb's offerings,btohqsg
Hello! Where do you see this? :),btohqsg
Pan or search by landmark just as mrt then click the red hdb icon on the left,btohqsg
So meaning the red hdb icons are usually the ones included for bto and sbf?,btohqsg
thanks for this. Looks like there are 3 blocks for Tanjong Rhu bto in Feb!,btohqsg
Tab the hdb icon on the left,btohqsg
The one I referring to is for upcoming bto,btohqsg
SBF are for past launches so they'd already have the icons up anyway. If new ones appear on the sites that were announced then the launch announcements will be pretty soon,btohqsg
What‚Äôs been the usual time after this is updated that the launch happens? A few days  a week later?,btohqsg
last time was like the next day or next few days.. but last oct's took longer than that to launch after the map shows the blocks.. i guess could be due to the large number of projects in oct.. hopefully its faster this time,btohqsg
Previous Feb BTO launch date2020 BTO - 11 Feb2021 BTO - 4 Feb2022 BTO - 17 Feb2023 BTO - 28 Feb2024 BTO - 21 Feb,btohqsg
if launch is next week  then align with 2020 launch,btohqsg
errr correct me if i'm i thought that red hdb icon is actually housing info? üòÖ it's very useful only for those applying resale,btohqsg
Its for existing flats and upcoming btos.. usually the map will be updated to show upcoming bto near the launch,btohqsg
ohhh lol! it's an actually old info ü•π*old info for me  new info for others hehhhhh,btohqsg
Any news on SBF release date,btohqsg
Should be the same with the bto release date too i think?,btohqsg
Yes  sbf and bto will be together so can only apply either one,btohqsg
No news on the bto date right? Cause I can't find anything on the website,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt release the date of BTO/SBF,btohqsg
