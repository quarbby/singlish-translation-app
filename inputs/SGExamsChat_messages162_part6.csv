Ohh so better to take bio,btohqsg
But trust me  the first year if u physics student they will force u learn all the o level and a level stuff,btohqsg
He is literally trying to memorise 100 different types of muscles in the hand alone,btohqsg
And that is not even the whole body yet,btohqsg
o/a level is just to bring you to next level. applicability of such knowledge doesn't matter,btohqsg
Well  I am still battling depression and a whole lot of other medical conditions  so it isn't ideal as well,btohqsg
When I did a research with my prof  he's a med sch teacher  the things he teach   only if u bio student den u can understand,btohqsg
I don't see how physics student can understand them,btohqsg
Unless they also learn bio themself,btohqsg
Like reaction wise it is true but pure sci and combi sci like only a little difference,btohqsg
Yea thats what i was wondering as well.,btohqsg
Ask ur bro to pick the subject he love  not which subject easier to score well,btohqsg
Also  I think it's way too early for him to decide Med sch now,btohqsg
Oh okk sure. Thanks for the advice.,btohqsg
He haven't expose himself to the other stuff out there,btohqsg
It's okay man  things gonna get better,btohqsg
ya lol sekali suddenly want be accountant,btohqsg
I thot jc can accept combi sci,btohqsg
I also wanted to go med sch in sec 3 cos my bio pretty good  but now when I'm in JC  I have some research internship and now not sure if research or med or veterinary medicine,btohqsg
depends on sch ah.usually combined science need like b3+pure science pass can liao,btohqsg
JC to take H2 science need minimum B3 for combine ecience,btohqsg
Ohh ok. I heard getting admission into nus med damn tough.,btohqsg
some require u to take bridging lesson,btohqsg
Yes  to enter NTU need take BMAT also,btohqsg
Is ur bro getting straight A1?,btohqsg
Den I think his study should be ok to survive o level   but a level I not sure,btohqsg
Yeah  I'm much better now  but of course life still isn't easy. But I contemplated suicide in the past and there were a lot of other things that happened. Not in MINDEF's interest to let me serve.,btohqsg
Med sch like popular choice ah,btohqsg
But the med sch doesn't just want good grades also,btohqsg
Oh ok. Maybe i ask him reconsider being fixated on med,btohqsg
Ask him to expose himself to more things  attend conference  workshops etc,btohqsg
Yep  don't lock himself on only one choice at such a young age,btohqsg
Just message in this grp we will be thr,btohqsg
because med school is for the very best,btohqsg
but also good to have something to fall back to,btohqsg
Also does he have strong reason to study meds  cos there's mandatory interview,btohqsg
Yea true. Most like something in the it field coz thats the other thing he occasionally brings up.,btohqsg
Bedok or me is ur better friend,btohqsg
it and med v different sia,btohqsg
Idk he just interested in bio and wants to become a doctor in the future haha,btohqsg
