how do i know it is time to do wheel alignment?,btohqsg
balancing and alignment got any difference?,btohqsg
Balancing is put weights on the wheel to make the wheel CG balanced.,btohqsg
Alignment is the position of all 4 wheels relative to the chassis.,btohqsg
Do alignment if your tyre wear uneven or your steering wheel doesn't return center when driving straight,btohqsg
But always good to do alignment once in a while,btohqsg
Because if you hit potholes can make it run,btohqsg
ahh! no wonder i feel so strange that i keep having to turn back the steering to make it straight,btohqsg
there are many potholes at my area and LTA dun even bother to cover it up,btohqsg
Recommend that you go to Wei Alignment to do  they're very professional,btohqsg
i think. i never done that before,btohqsg
By right dealers should do alignment before handover  but a lot of them just act blur if buyer never request,btohqsg
Wa i in heaven there sia,btohqsg
I walked out w 200 dollars worth of car wash.. 👀,btohqsg
Send to oneservice. I reported then a few days later fix alr haha altho the job looks bad,btohqsg
I wudnt bother lah cus i usually change rims n tyres immediately aft i buy car.. then need do realignment again..,btohqsg
Rims and tyres don't affect alignment leh... Only if you touch the suspension parts,btohqsg
I that time was advised to do again aft i changed all these,btohqsg
50 dollars only still can swallowwww,btohqsg
Ya but 50 dollars from 100 customers is 5000,btohqsg
Who told you this advice? Best avoid lol,btohqsg
Some customer i met while changing tyres,btohqsg
oh ok...good idea also. never thought of that,btohqsg
Best app ever. 😂 just to make ppl work HAHAH,btohqsg
u very good in calculating ah. in a good way,btohqsg
But idt got anything wrong to do wheel alignment aft change new tyres. Just prevent uneven wear and tear lo,btohqsg
I buy window cleaner  rim cleaner  soap.. cloths.. wa i really like small kid in the store,btohqsg
