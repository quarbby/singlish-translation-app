Hola!Which is more worth to get to collect points:HSBC Revolution or Citi Rewards Miles Card?The reason I'm asking is because HSBC offers 4mpd for most everyday transaction. Yes there is a conversion fee.However Citi Rewards offers 1.2mpd for daily spendings with additions on overseas 2mpd and citi payall 1.8mpd.Any advice out there?,btohqsg
People tend to pair CRMC with the Instarem Amaze card which will also change many of them to 4mpd because they are now classified as online spend. The only exception is that it shouldnt be used for travel as it's an exception  which isnt the case for HSBC Revolution,btohqsg

Hi friends  I‚Äôm in a bit of a troubled situation now.TLDR: Has anyone experienced transferring money from GXS to Coinbase and didn‚Äôt receive the funds?some context: I have been transferring funds quite a few times with no issues but last week this happened. I asked GXS they said transaction was successful but Coinbase said that they did not receive the money. So I tried transacting $1 and it worked. I asked GXS to help contact the bank to return the transaction but they said it‚Äôs not guaranteed. So I‚Äôm not sure who else I can contact or what I can do now. Any help would be sooo appreciated  thank you üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
Contact coinbase customer service and provide them with your account statement & the transaction reference to show that the money has been deducted on your end.,btohqsg
I showed them but they just said they have not received it on their end and provided no follow up‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Coinbase keep asking me to verify with my banking institution (GXS) but I already verified and sent Coinbase the transaction details and reference,btohqsg
