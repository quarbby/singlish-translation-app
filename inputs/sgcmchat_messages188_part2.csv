Practising the 3Rs in Singapore (Reduce  Reuse  Recycle) helps to achieve sustainable living by reducing waste  conserving resources and minimizing the negative impact on the environment.Reduce: By reducing consumption  less waste is generated. This helps to conserve resources and reduce demand for energy  land and water.Reuse: By reusing items  the lifespan of products is extended  reducing the need for manufacturing new products. This helps to conserve resources and reduce waste.,btohqsg
I want to clarify with respect to your retracted/deletedstatements. It was a form of endearment.,btohqsg
Recycle: By recycling materials  non-biodegradable waste can be turned into new products. This helps to conserve natural resources and decrease the amount of waste that ends up in landfills.By incorporating the 3Rs into daily life  individuals and organizations in Singapore can contribute to a more sustainable future.,btohqsg
