Hi gurus. May I ask about the risks of participating with moomoo's existing customers promotion?Let's say I deposited 200k in to moomoo  subscribed to the fullerton fund. Then if moomoo folds.

Depends if there is fraud. If no fraud it will get transferred.See what happened to ftx. They supposedly had fraud so all the crypto held on trust were frozen.If no fraud your holdings can be transferred to taking over broker.,btohqsg
