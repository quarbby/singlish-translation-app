Haha think I only have the national exams certs la,btohqsg
Anwar? Not his direct successor but he came into office later after the 2022 GE. Anwar was supposed to be PM though but Mahathir refused to handover  and in 2020 there was the infamous Sheraton move where some PKR MPs switched parties and Bersatu withdrew from Pakatan Harapan. You can read up about this online,btohqsg

Today my JAE friend ask me if we alrlearn alot of the h2math topics and sadly yes,btohqsg
Did not know so many things not in o lvl,btohqsg
Which part of the paper is this in? And is it something like schools can choose different countries to cover so not all schs will cover this?,btohqsg

Oh ok. I saw the syllabus doc and it mentioned Malaysia a few times but it didn’t specifically say what events are covered besides Konfrontasi,btohqsg
After the IO beat him up iirc,btohqsg
I wonder if polsci or history would be better,btohqsg
Even tho my history is a C I still find it so much more interesting than geog,btohqsg
If I do become a Cher for the sake of MOE requiring teachers to be qualified in teaching 2 subjects I may choose to do econs+geog in nus but I don’t think I’ll like it,btohqsg
Maybe in nie I’ll train for geog even if I have no intention of teaching it,btohqsg
It’s a bit stupid that 2 subjects requirement if the teachers don’t ever teach their 2nd subject,btohqsg
I want to teach h3 PW,btohqsg
I guess they just want more flexibility,btohqsg
Also it was the police chief not the IO sry,btohqsg

Actually maybe doobdoob can provide some advice,btohqsg
The car did not brake at all  no amount of laws can stop someone like that,btohqsg
I saw the video. It’s unfortunate that reckless driving isn’t punishable by the death penalty. I feel like the black car driver was doing that intentionally,btohqsg

From TJC  can confirm  it aint good,btohqsg
