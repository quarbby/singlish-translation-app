pe thicker than blouse but then its more cooling,btohqsg
I think cut off above 240 is consider elite alr,btohqsg
But PE turns yellow and nasty after 2 yrs of washing and wearing,btohqsg
Who the hell even cares about our school history,btohqsg
back in pri sch i really tot 240 is like national average,btohqsg
i got a few nice centennial shirts from last year,btohqsg

My alma mater is my house. I was home schooled,btohqsg
How’s tat doxxing  you need to dig to figure that out,btohqsg
I never even get A for math,btohqsg
240 is st nick  250 is National kc   260 is hwachong RI  270 is nus high,btohqsg

I can't even pass the first round,btohqsg
How y'all know so much one,btohqsg

Your teacher say or parent say,btohqsg
LMAO i guessed my way thru tho,btohqsg

its all mcq so i just used rndint() on my calculator for qns idk how do,btohqsg
cus my friends in top class dsa,btohqsg
My school didn’t really tell me much about gep so I didn’t get excited for it,btohqsg
then its like all mcq iirc,btohqsg
i mean your life not fked up now meh,btohqsg
I only know about DSA  NUS High  SST and GEP in JC1,btohqsg

Lmao fuck GEP my pri school only accepted like 60 people I was number 62 or 63 knnccb always bu san bu si results,btohqsg
they give u top and front view etc then u need the side view,btohqsg
Lol I only knew after GEP after I was too old for it,btohqsg
you're actually answering it srsly wow,btohqsg
I only knew about any JC other than ACJC in JC1,btohqsg

gifted in RGPS Still come my lousy sch lmao,btohqsg
i nvr saw him ever again,btohqsg

I’m still trying to figure out,btohqsg
Lucky bastard my school raffles elite cock primary split both gep class 30-30 so I missed out by like 1 or 2 spots I'm still salty to this day,btohqsg
What’s with this whole AC franchise,btohqsg
They are different campuses  beside each other,btohqsg
people go ac for the name onlyy,btohqsg
I think it is as well,btohqsg
like ure segregating gifted kids and normal kids,btohqsg
How can you guys not know about GEP  I took the entry exam for fun. Haha legit  I always take non-school exa for fun. I always sign up for UNSW exams too,btohqsg
Because when you are young you dk how to work hard,btohqsg
i went OBS with ACSI doods lmao,btohqsg
I know a lot of people from ACJC,btohqsg
Same lol I always get merit/distinction for UNSW English how can I still get C for english,btohqsg
This conversation really exposes how differently people think of ACSI and ACJC,btohqsg
i dropped most special programmes during sec sch like olympiads,btohqsg
acsi is smart + high ses,btohqsg
let alone some lame gep shit,btohqsg
How many threads are going on at this time,btohqsg
not interested in any of these shits,btohqsg
acjc might not have rich keeds,btohqsg
Unsw tests are pretty much lame as hell,btohqsg
they are both just other jcs,btohqsg
I always brag that I take no math combi in JC right? Fun fact: i got distinction for UNSW Math in Sec 1.,btohqsg
ACSI cfm rich people  look at talon can liao,btohqsg
why is talon a thing on tele too anyw,btohqsg
my bff from acjc and he lives on breadcrumbs that were used to feed pigeons,btohqsg
Let’s just say that I am,btohqsg
"I don't get the unsw test ""prestige"" shit",btohqsg
It is literally lame as hell and easy distinction,btohqsg
science is CS1010S instead i rmb-ed,btohqsg
It's true  unsw tests are a joke...,btohqsg
But it seems like special term they don’t offer it,btohqsg
usernamewho do u think is most popz girl in our cohort,btohqsg
Ya thanks to all the missions,btohqsg
But if they offered 1101 I would take it though,btohqsg
i took e so idk the s side,btohqsg
Not bell curved so got chance,btohqsg
The SES divide is showing. That is my only distinction  have a few merit  but loads of participation.,btohqsg
but honestly i would be more than happy to get a B+,btohqsg
everything is just additions to portfolio in the end,btohqsg
cs was the most mindraping course i took so far,btohqsg
I was in a 190+ secondary school and I don't think you consider that elite,btohqsg
ngl i gonna try for it as a 2nd major,btohqsg
i genuinely tot 190+ refers to height,btohqsg
Lol its actually a waste of major imo,btohqsg
Some hci sec ppl are idiots too,btohqsg
It predicted im gonna procrastinate for the rest of my life,btohqsg
Some <Insert organisation here> ppl are idiots  will always be true,btohqsg
Schools use it to predict how well their kids will do,btohqsg
and 230 isnt damn bad LOL,btohqsg
There will be some anomalies after all,btohqsg
The best predictor is a qualitative analysis of the person,btohqsg
Literally anything is better than sorting students out when they are young,btohqsg
Predict how much of a chao mugger you are?,btohqsg
Got ppl with 90 rank points in a lvl getting like 20 points for o lvls,btohqsg
idk i felt like psle is kinda accurate if there is no diff in quality of teaching in diff sec sch,btohqsg
"No  o levels is really a brain dead way to ""gauge"" a student's knowledge",btohqsg
PSLE doesnt predict  PSLE covertly inserts a glass ceiling,btohqsg
Well  u will nvr know unless u are an MOE teacher/intern,btohqsg
I asked you to sort out your life but it seems like you are using bogosort,btohqsg
but tho  that may be true for JC but not for poly,btohqsg
And saw the literal PSLE to O lvl graphs,btohqsg
You can really tell the difference between students in a 230 and 210 school,btohqsg
good psle score -> good sec sch -> good o levels most likely,btohqsg
bc poly requires you to work as a group,btohqsg
while O levels is a solo thing,btohqsg
You can rote learn o levels and do extremely well but psle is not such case,btohqsg
so if good sec sch doesnt matter  then psle is the deciding factor isnt it,btohqsg
I never even had tution since I was born,btohqsg
I didn't do very well in psle,btohqsg
Except a few CDAC tuition for the poor famoly,btohqsg
@Jaycubed_tmy that friend was 232 for Os Btw,btohqsg
I only got to my sec school thru dsa,btohqsg
Did pretty good compared to my class,btohqsg
Best tutor u can have is urself,btohqsg
wellllllllllll it depends on how good the sch is too,btohqsg
Depends on definition of bad i guess,btohqsg
Some ppl be likeNo 90 = bad,btohqsg
The only tutor you’ll always have,btohqsg
And what about those scoring >6?,btohqsg
U know I was in a super neighbourhood pri sch and sec sch,btohqsg
i mean im always on the very average side,btohqsg
actually are u talking abt raw or nett lmao,btohqsg
This statement is not really accurate,btohqsg
how do you get below 6 pts for raw?,btohqsg
I was equally qualified for a schoalrship,btohqsg
JCs/sec schools with less connections and less money also less opportunities,btohqsg
You guys are assuming Sch is just for academics  neglecting that sch serves as an institution for networking too.,btohqsg
wait are you in jc rn lmao,btohqsg
DSTA schoalrship and MOE ore U schoalrship,btohqsg
Damn i must be below ok,btohqsg
well i barely hit the ok range,btohqsg
so much pressure to keep myself an average student in this grp,btohqsg
Ur jc can network.. hahahah lwoer tier jcs cant network oso,btohqsg
Network your way into an anatomy course,btohqsg
This only applies for University and higher,btohqsg
i mean you're supposed o go to schs to leanr,btohqsg
I manage to network more than some of the IP student in the short one year,btohqsg
My friend O level both A1 math and J1 promos he got S for math,btohqsg
i got U for math throughout my entire jc major exams,btohqsg
what are the schs with JAE discrimination lmao,btohqsg
That's like 2k a month for free,btohqsg
I mean I got 900 a year not schoalrship but Financial bursary,btohqsg
Any school with IP and JAE,btohqsg
i heard it's q serious in DHS,btohqsg
I thought so before I enter Uni  then after I enter Uni  my bubble was burst. There were so many ppl ard me that had amazing opps since Sec Sch bcoz of network.,btohqsg
Bruh imagine going to ip sch just to be looked doen .-.,btohqsg
Some jc math paper quite hard eh,btohqsg
If a certain school does not have any ip  there won't be jae discrimination,btohqsg
I dont understand why jae and ip discrimination exists tbh,btohqsg
Karma needs to fix this world,btohqsg
Yea  that's what connections and networking can do,btohqsg
Idu why mental issues exists tbh. Just stop being depressed,btohqsg
No as in  I’m talking about how Sch place a role in life performance,btohqsg
rmb my math promo girls are sitting in a circle crying,btohqsg
If u need to have one takeaway today  it will be to build Ur connection early and start making a LinkedIn account,btohqsg
How many ways are there to arrange them,btohqsg
and im thinking whether to retain or go poly,btohqsg
Lol who did you tag. My subj combi is PCME,btohqsg
block test 26 june u readyyy,btohqsg
I received my results at home,btohqsg
what i was fking happy lol,btohqsg
A level result is always mixed feelings one,btohqsg
Now is acjc for maths no more aj alr,btohqsg
when is the earliest i can drop out of JC,btohqsg
You can drop out at any time,btohqsg
The day us u get your posting,btohqsg
when i got U throughout  my entire jc life,btohqsg
can i drop out after orientation,btohqsg
You can even drop out before orientation,btohqsg
Orientation was the best part of JC leh,btohqsg
then how do you enter a poly course  by elr2b2?,btohqsg
after u drop out and join in mid sem,btohqsg
Quit JC at the end of year 1,btohqsg
You can even drop out in June Hols of J2  yea I went DAFUQ when somebody I know did that,btohqsg
Uni no orientation really v weird,btohqsg
Aint gonna fkin attend that degen shit LOL,btohqsg
One only uh. My sch 30% of the intake leaves by end j1,btohqsg
Lol orientation  I remember seeing my og mugging,btohqsg
Yes  but he quit of cos PW  cos he getting a fail for slacking,btohqsg
I knew you’d know who I’m talking abt,btohqsg
If u get accepted into JC and you want to switch to poly  just appeal,btohqsg
Of its free no harm attending arh,btohqsg
is a good idea tho yall can ban questionable phrases for cheering oso,btohqsg
She was the only one who made such a huge fuss that I didn't know that she was dropping out,btohqsg
lol but tbh idk leh like i feel like i'm more suited for poly life by cher recc to go jc,btohqsg
U got the link can alrdy,btohqsg
Have you talked to her recently?,btohqsg
What do you wish to achieve out of poly? What do you wish to achieve out ot JC?,btohqsg
like fk me in the ass cuz i love jesus,btohqsg
haha cos 10% are gay or bi. just wanna connect.,btohqsg
You'll be able to find a few,btohqsg
Yeah  last I spoke to her was 2018,btohqsg
honestly anything is ok both leads me to a double major in chinese studies and chinese language,btohqsg
Choose a place where you won’t regret going,btohqsg
I last spoke to her when she came back after dropping out,btohqsg
Technically speaking if you want go uni  jc is easier.,btohqsg
Wholesome is never an option with bedok,btohqsg
ye but for chinese studies in NP moe offers this scheme for moe teachers,btohqsg
Oh yeah  she said she was going to do private A Levels and then collect the results with us,btohqsg
Why give a shit about courses you don't want,btohqsg
Is the only worth it one,btohqsg
ya o basically free tuition + $800 every month,btohqsg
im so bored at this rate i am turning asexual,btohqsg
Poly is easier to enter uni and do quite well overall coz of portfolio experience for certain courses,btohqsg
Keep the chat PG13 if you wish to remain here,btohqsg
Honestly Lang Studies JC route is better  not much Lang courses in Poly. The closest I can think of is Creative Writing.,btohqsg
If you're very convinced  then go ahead with your plan.,btohqsg
Still can't forget the House MD episode on that,btohqsg
it’s not ok to be asexual?,btohqsg
Imagine doing physics for 4 years as a bio student,btohqsg
No  she said she did the UK A level over June Hols lol,btohqsg
Stop asking questions you know you aren’t going get responses to,btohqsg
I don't see the + point for JC if you're very set on a few courses,btohqsg
at least i know whos lgbt now,btohqsg
lmao the thing is in JC i can take a combi such as CLL translation Econs and h1 math/chem,btohqsg
and it's faster by 1 year,btohqsg
Maybe the dude/dudette doesn't know if there would be responses,btohqsg
At least it's better than econs,btohqsg
was gonna ask why then i realised its nursing,btohqsg
Do you even like Math or Chem?,btohqsg
she probably doesnt have a choice,btohqsg
go into nursing without passion then for wat?,btohqsg
but in the case that i dun get A2 for el,btohqsg
I don't see what's the use of H1 Chem or Math  if you have O-level Math or Chem,btohqsg
i'll be forced to take hybrid,btohqsg
ill replace h2 translation with chem,btohqsg
@chemcerI think it's good you didn't eat the mookata yesterday,btohqsg
any combination other than pcme and bcme are considered weird combination to me,btohqsg
anw i am 17 bi  if anyone wants to speak about lgbtq+ issues just slide into my dm  really into mental health awareness  so cheers 😂 (not PG13),btohqsg
Need b3 for hcl to take i think,btohqsg
and yes offence to art sstream ppl,btohqsg
It's for ppl to flex their bilingualism,btohqsg
Honestly I don't see the value of A-level chem. The electronic transitions  slightly better atomic/chemical model  etc.,btohqsg
That's not going to be relevant in Chinese Studies,btohqsg
i want to be bilingual uwu,btohqsg
i alr met the requirements for CLL,btohqsg
im a bilingual too no one offered me that D:,btohqsg
i need an A2 for EL now,btohqsg
Nothing academic is ever relevant to real life,btohqsg
Last warning  this is not a dating website,btohqsg
U aren't bilingual enough it seems,btohqsg
When did you come to my house,btohqsg
No  there are different levels of relevance,btohqsg
not dating  but just mental health awareness  thank u sir,btohqsg
"I'm not just saying ""hur dur you took latin so useless""The question is ON TOP OF O-LEVELS PURE CHEM  what does H1 Chem provide?",btohqsg
Bio Extension Topic  looks at what’s happening in the world now,btohqsg
Anyone who score A for EL and CL are pro linguists lol,btohqsg
wbu? not just for gays but also straight pple.,btohqsg
It's just a general feeling of stomach kot feeling well,btohqsg
oh i was offered chinese lit,btohqsg
i know someone who scored A2 dor both languages,btohqsg
Your physics is bio oriented so still ok,btohqsg
The discord is a pit of depression,btohqsg
Except for y1 mod. The other mods okay ez game apply formula only,btohqsg
apparently u just have to get A1 for hcl for sec 2 eoy,btohqsg
Not wrong someone literally left cos of gatekeeping,btohqsg
for my sch to be qualified for cl,btohqsg
It's just people screaming stuff at each other. That is not the signs/symptoms of depression.,btohqsg
nah just some neighbourhood sec sch,btohqsg
i joined for a while after my Os,btohqsg
I have been around many exam seasons,btohqsg
aiyah but i china lah how hard is it for me to take cl anyway,btohqsg
Kekw abalone got triggered over someone shitposting in#food,btohqsg
Can’t be neighbourhood and SAP at the same time,btohqsg
