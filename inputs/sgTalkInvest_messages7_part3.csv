Hi looking for big or small volume seller for sgd/usdt daily trading if possible.. dealing will be cod. Pm me,btohqsg
to Everyone  do NOT do P2P transactions over internetMust be CASH and F2F (face-to-face)too many scammers  and even when you get the money via paynow  the other person who send is not for crypto but some lovescam or sexscam a and eventually police will lock your bank account for investigation and order you to return the moneyeven for F2F  scams happened.scammers will say due to work  send friend / family / staff down to transact with you  then the address given is actually another address.i know of at least 4 victims in the past 5 months... be careful of P2P transactions,btohqsg
Thx yup yup. Dealing f2f cash,btohqsg
Beware  sometimes con artists will engage mules to f2f with you.Always ask the individual to show you his crypto account (app maybe) or telegram convo with you as proof.I’ve known 2 victims of meeting mules.,btohqsg
What happens to your money if u received from scam sources? U need to return even though u not scammer?,btohqsg
depends on court ruling.i know of a guy in court now fighting on this for a $10 000 p2p,btohqsg
his lawyer fees is now $15 000he doing it just on principles.... sucky is he still losing.,btohqsg
i think he lost the case already i lazy to ask him,btohqsg
then like that how to protect yourself from p2p trading? sell anything online oso can be subject to receiving funds from unknown 3rd party that involved scam. cannot be everything go through meetup/cash ma.,btohqsg
other than asking to pay back $10 000  is there any other charges? jail?,btohqsg
No lah  he’s not criminal  he’s also a victim,btohqsg
So no criminal charges. Just civil cases between two victims,btohqsg
F2F.And check with the other party F2F to clarify the address before sending to ensure the conversation online is same as the person you are facing,btohqsg
If u don’t do meetup for cash  sure go ahead lah 😂 it’s your own money no one can stop you. 😊,btohqsg
guess the scammer (middle man) got away with the money. left 2 victims fighting over each other.,btohqsg
Yeah. Though in some cases  if move fast and if scammers make mistake or using exchange related wallet  police can help ask binance or FTX to freeze the wallet,btohqsg

Hi ppl  need some advice for a predicament that i am in now:I have previously signed and DBS accepted and approved a mortgage refinance for a pte property in Mar 2021. However  the approved refinancing was put on hold as my current mortgage with Maybank only expire (3-year lock-in) in Nov 2021 and the solicitors contacted me to restart to complete the process last week.I totally forgot about the prior arrangement with DBS and went on to reprice with Maybank in Oct 2021 and the repricing was approved by Maybank on 15 Oct 2021.So now  I am stuck with 2 approved loans (Maybank = reprice  DBS = refinance) and I have to cancel on one of the bank with financial penalties.Maybank = 1.5% of $590kDBS = 0.75% of $590k + 1k payable to solicitorsI have written in to the solicitors acting for DBS to abort the refinancing and will be writing to DBS bank to reduce (not waive off) the financial penalty payable to the bank.May I know if anyone here have similar experiences?Also  what other options do I have?,btohqsg
Appeal and appeal. Write long story on how u forgottenFirst few time the appeal sure fail  but try to reach a proper human and not standard CSO who will just standard template reject u,btohqsg
I am appealing thru the DBS consultant that handled my loan application earlier this year.,btohqsg
yeah he/she will probably help to his best.but don't take his/her words for it. if appeal fail  go write in again and again butplead honestly...... end of the day  your letter is worth $5425,btohqsg
there is nothin else u can do  tbh.,btohqsg
hopefully one of the mortgage expert here kanna this type of incidents before and can advise.....,btohqsg
In this situation  no chance for them to waive.I handled many cases like that before. Maybe can get a reduction from Dbs but will have a small penalty,btohqsg
Maybank will not release ur mortgage to Dbs  so don’t have to appeal to them.Work only on Dbs side,btohqsg
I asked for reduction frm DBS side. Not waive off the totally,btohqsg
Funny thing is when I asked the DBS consultant for help  she actually said she will be helping me write in to the bank to appeal when I told her my predicament,btohqsg
