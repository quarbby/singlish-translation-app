Has anyone transferred / migrate cryptos from ledger to trezor and can share about the process ? As I’m hearing ledger is giving some issues regarding the seed phrase,btohqsg
Are you guys able to go in ocbc banking app? Mine hang at this,btohqsg
OK I found out is the Internet problem. Thanks,btohqsg
Ha Ha  lucky ok  else Ocbc to get fined my MAS like dbs 😅,btohqsg
Just import seed phrase into Trezor  that’s it,btohqsg
There’s no risk of losing all the crypto when I do it ? After I did framework update on ledger I’m quite worried,btohqsg
Nope no risk  maybe u wanna go YouTube to research a little too. DYOR,btohqsg
No risk  keep your ledger as it is first. Restore seed to the trezor. When u can see all your coins on it then you can format your ledger,btohqsg
pretty funny tho  he's saying ledger has issues with the seed phrase  but then import same seed phrase into trezor 😂,btohqsg

Need help guysI have applied a lot of time for credit card with 30k limit but always fail> I have cimb aswm card> I recently (6 months ago) got a declared cpf of 1400 from 2 company each> I always paid that cimb card on time> got two supplementary card from hsbc thru my sister> use hsbc card a lot since it won't affect my credit score(family member which I apply this from is not in singapore)> credit card I have tried so far amex  uob  standard charter  cimb  icbc  maybank> put credit limit same as my salary for 1 month> currently credit is EE and I didn't do anything except for that one time I use 70 percent of my credit but it was paid off> no asset like property yet> have a job in same company for 3 years,btohqsg
My colleague who defaulted on his payment a few time is able to apply for one which confuses me,btohqsg
Assuming your salary have increased  have you updated your income with CIMB (if you're applying with them)? Then try applying for the card again. If you're planning to apply with other banks  you might want to fix your credit score.To fix your credit  you can try increasing your limit to 3x your required expenses and do not increase your spending past your required expenses.You should also review your budget if you're spending 100% of your salary.,btohqsg
I apply via singpass so they have my cpf statement,btohqsg
They will use your last assessed income  which is for 2022.,btohqsg
By assessed income as in NOA ?,btohqsg
Icic  so I have to wait until April for them to update it or is there anyway to update it on singpass ?,btohqsg
A couple of factors possible…you always late payment it will also affect your credit score  and don’t apply for credit cards with different banks within a short period of time,btohqsg
Because I send citibank my bank salary slip and they still reject me I am not sure if It relates,btohqsg
I haven't miss any payment yet for my cimb card,btohqsg
Usually if it's income they will email to ask for latest income  or cpf contributions  etc.If they just outright reject then likelihood is you applied for multiple cards from different banks within a short period of time or your credit score is too poor.,btohqsg
Icic  I think I will cool off with the application for one month and try again,btohqsg
You can check your CBS from your recent application. EE only happens if you default or late payment.,btohqsg
One late payment from me dropped a couple of points on my credit score lol,btohqsg
