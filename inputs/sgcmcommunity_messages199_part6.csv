HDB chargers are all mostly slow chargers. By time they need to move it. Next day morning Liao.,btohqsg
HDB has to build such chargers  else there would be squabbles everyday and less ppl wan to buy ev  me included  if I gotta come down to move after dinner  so I'm one of them that prefers hybrid for the time being,btohqsg
If slow charge how to meet the needs of increasing number of EVs ah?,btohqsg
Maybe that’s why a lot of the european makers have announced slowing down EV production but focussing more on hybrids?,btohqsg
Volume of EV also nt a lot,btohqsg
Like and more leh - Hyundai  Ora  BYD etc etc. all so chio only,btohqsg
Some EVs look like hybrid leh?,btohqsg
I rmb some got EV and Hybrid models,btohqsg
Depends on ur usage. If too low no point going for EV/Hybrid. The fuel save wont make up for the higher instalment,btohqsg
Hybrid needs to be at least 20kkm/yr to make it truly worth the savings,btohqsg
Hi! How did u get to that figure hahaha. Pls share☺️,btohqsg
Now a days  hybrid/ ice/ byd all have similar depreciation,btohqsg
Like kona 8y8m has similar depre with a atto3 9y5m less the scrap value.,btohqsg

Hi anyone knows if there’s a chat group for BMW 1 series?,btohqsg
U see bids received vs coe available lor,btohqsg
Close to 400 bids overflow to August bid,btohqsg
Then u add sale made for 3 weeks,btohqsg
Even if no trade shows  govt also will make sure demand is healthy for them,btohqsg
Cant really compare newer cars ba. But usually hybrid vs ice  hybrid will be more exp which turns out to be around $100-200 more for instalment per mth. This turn out to be about 60-70 of litres of petrol or 150 litres if u pump at JB. So average car is abt 10-12km/litre. 70 litres = 700km~1.5kkm. Average user 15kkm/year = 1.25kkm/mth. Essentially pump abt 110 litres for ice and abt 60 litres for hybrid. 50 litres diff = 50 x $2.10 (after discount) = $100. If go JB then diff become even smaller,btohqsg
Ok bro. Thanks for the analysis.,btohqsg
Of coz this is based on avg ice car. If take sienta vs freed. The diff will be even smaller,btohqsg
Some hybrid is nt really fc saving hybrid. Mild hybrid only helps with the acceleration and it only saves a bit of fuel,btohqsg
At least hybrid won’t kena that $700 road tax component in EV road tax,btohqsg
Actually the EV thats worthwhile is tesla due to the low interest and parf value. Byd is cheap but its coz of the $0 parf. End up the instalment and battery degradation makes it abt the same as tesla,btohqsg
Volvo EX30 Ultra vs Smart #1 Pro+Both the Volvo EX30 and Smart #1 may share common underpinnings  but offer a surprisingly different user interface and drive.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 The battle of 2 EV,btohqsg
For battery degrading  byd giving battery warranty. So I’m wondering Shd be ok ma. Perhaps can shed more light haha. Cause I thought it’s a good choice.,btohqsg
I don think warranty covers degradation though. Else u tell them degrade 2% need replace the entire set meh?,btohqsg
Lol admire ur persistence in daily coe research. But don’t just research n research then never buy hor,btohqsg

Don’t know why sg market still selling old Honda civic.,btohqsg
Cannot afford to bring in new ones,btohqsg
But you paid so much .. haha 180k,btohqsg
Only in sg we pay 180k for a jap car,btohqsg
Ya sad .. at least give us the latest model,btohqsg
I hope coe will increase a lot. The roads will be clear,btohqsg
Road won’t clear. It will have more jams. Because more cars will be either skipping their maintenance and burn or they will skip changing tyres until it’s left with 1mm thread and leave everything to fate to decide. So all these will make other drivers more agitated and road rage.,btohqsg
Roads congested means coe not high enough,btohqsg
Better way to have clear roads. - Have another pandemic again.,btohqsg
I think roads will be much clearer if coe is 1m,btohqsg
More reliance on public transport will means more buses out there and perhaps from 1 bus lane will go to two or more cox less cars. 🤪 by then you will only have one or two lane to drive.,btohqsg
Possible also. Govt can reclaim the roads for more housings by then. Thats a good idea. 👍,btohqsg
this flawed. Bus designed 2 move large no of ppl efficiently. 1 bus can replace many cars  reduce overall traffic. Increase the frequency n capacity of buses and trains can handle more passengers without eating into extra lanes.,btohqsg
Well  if COE is 1m  I suspect more than half the driving population will not be able to afford. That half need to include those who have family members and as well as those who are old and fragile as well. The reliance on public transport will definitely be much greater than just the number of cars on the road  at least 3x.So just increasing the number of buses are not going to be enough.,btohqsg
Car lite but public tpt cmi,btohqsg
? Alr 70% sg population no cars.,btohqsg
Dont say drivers or road users entitled. U see the train and buses u know alr,btohqsg
And those doing private hire will have to charge sky high rates just to survive. Maybe one trip from Jurong East to Jurong Community Hosiptal will cost $50. And a trip to airport will star from $200. 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
