Hi All  still new to cardup and unsure how it works. So eg I got 4 policy. Two from Company A and Two from Company B. Does this mean got one of my policy would enjoy this rate ?,btohqsg
is valid on a one-off or first payment on a new recurring series. In T&C they also mentioned one off or first payment for recurring. Does it mean I pay company A full sum I get this amount charge  than company B will not enjoy this rate?,btohqsg
Does UOB priv miles Mastercard now also offers airmiles if using cardup? I rmb last time was all visa,btohqsg
I tested the promo code some time back and it was only valid for the first payment. The recurring will have the standard 2.6% fees.The remaining policies will be at 2.6% if no special insurance codes are available. Can use their recurring for 1.85%,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Please act fast and there is a cap on the amounts transacted at the promo rate if you switch to MC.There is also a limit on how many people they will give the promotion to.Do not use UOB PriviMiles at iPayMy. Theyâ€™re excluded by UOB for rewards.,btohqsg
But I'm not paying rent.more of want to pay a lump sum payment for my insurance,btohqsg
If your lump sum is <= $10 500  it will be ok. The cap is that amount. Just checked from the website.https://www.cardup.co/personal/pricing#offers,btohqsg
Both can get miles but diff admin fees. Insurance premium has same 2.25% admin fee for visa and Mastercard.,btohqsg
I see  so no point for me to change to a visa instead ðŸ˜‚ other than only if ipaymy come up with better rate.,btohqsg
iPayMy recurring is slightly more expensive than the CardUp MC recurring one for now by 0.05% + $1Theyâ€™re the only ones who can process loans now so no choice for people who are doing payment services for loans ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
I can see a lot of cancellations coming to the DBS Vantage once loans cannot be repaid via payment services ahahaSpending $5k a month for 1.5mpd is seriously bad.,btohqsg
Ppl will find another way and adapt to policy changes ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Ask the masters here. Which bank allows housing loans to be serviced via GIRO from HSBC?So far I have experienced UOB and OCBC and both donâ€™t allow GIRO setups to the loan servicing account.,btohqsg
U mean housing loan using cash and deduct from bank account?,btohqsg
"Tonight I will release a video on ""Cash or CPF to pay for housing loan""Mentioned Maybank Platinum VISA with CardUp strategy (before announcement was made today). Please note that video was completed before this news and VISA is no longer applicable for home loans w.e.f. 1 Nov 2024",btohqsg
Just paid insurance with this code today  only valid for 1 policy as its under same category  split the rest into ipaymy for $20 off first payment,btohqsg
ipaymy slightly more convenient imo  can lump all the different policies into one payment if to same insurer,btohqsg
For Dbs yuu card  can i use via apply pay and it still clock 10mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check is Citi rewards + Amaze the only paring that can convert my online purchases to in-stores?I have a situation where my Citi rewards bill statement comes on the 16th each month. My Instarem Amaze resets every 1st of the month.The gap between 16th to 1st means that  by the time I pay by bills on the 16th for my citi rewards and my spending resets  my Instarem Amaze is already maxed out ($1000).Are there other pairings that I can use for my Citi rewards card? That would allow me to spend between 16th to the 1st of the next month?,btohqsg
Shopee & Kris+ & Atome & any payments via app may help you,btohqsg
Thank you for your reply! My main expenditure is using the physical Amaze card to pay for food such as Food court (that supports pay wave) & restaurants. Any solutions for this?,btohqsg
Scan yuu member QR on the app first  then pay as per normal.,btohqsg
Spend $500 on 1-14 and spend $500 on 16-30/31,btohqsg
Fair enough but Iâ€™d want to maximise my points earned each bill month on my Citi rewards card,btohqsg
$500 + $500 is $1000  why not maximised?,btohqsg
You still earn max miles if using above method. Ie. $1000 -> 4000 miles.,btohqsg
Wait  I brain farted. Thatâ€™s true,btohqsg
In my case  Iâ€™ve spent more than $500 past the mid point of the month.Thank you!,btohqsg

Use other card when more than $500. Use excel to track.,btohqsg

Hi  can I check whether we will receive SMS for EGA if we fulfill the $2k and 5 transactions? I did mine few days back but didnâ€™t receive any,btohqsg
Between 1 day to never. As long you did it right  you should get the cashback.,btohqsg
When is your few days ago?,btohqsg
You will be able to clock 10 mpd if you spend 600 dollar using the card. And within the 600 dollars  it's all yuu  MerchantIf you spend on other categories that is not yuu merchants  your 10 mpd will be lower since those (Not yuu merchants) only give you 1 yuu point,btohqsg

Next time become O level question.Where is citi rewards + amaze?,btohqsg
Amaze converts in-store to online  not convert online to in-store. For pure online (not via in-app mobile wallet)  no need pair with Amaze,btohqsg

for restaurants that accept shopback or favepay  link the citi rewards card direct to shopback or favepay to payfor hawker stores that accept order via foodpanda self-pick  use the card direct on foodpanda,btohqsg
Will foodpanda markup a bit on the food order via apps but self-pick? I try Grab  Grab markup the price.,btohqsg
