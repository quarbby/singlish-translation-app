Hahaha recently is lag abit but at least... cheap and also   faced worse with other pricier telcos so..,btohqsg
Depends on your area. My area it's really fine.,btohqsg

can someone let me know if  I can do GIRO via my HSBC EGA ac for personal income tax monthly deductions?,btohqsg

k  thanks for sharing .. I look for it,btohqsg
Why it so hard to get maybank cc? üòÖAlso any particular cc that gives rebates for telco bills? Maybank fnf has that category,btohqsg
can easily set giro instalment payment for income tax on iras website,btohqsg
Haha. I badly want Maybank fnf cc  as I can easily maximize cashback and it suits my spending. I read in hwz that opening account and putting $10k improves ur chances  but I don't want to open 1 more account üòÇ,btohqsg
I think that only supports the big 3 local banks.,btohqsg
no ah  I used boc. think can use hsbc also,btohqsg

"Hi sifus! I spent $500 on my UOB credit card in Jan  but was recorded as having spent less than $500 for the purposes of my UOB one account.I called up UOB and was told that an online transaction I made to Awfully Chocolate  with description ""Paypal *Awfullychoc"" is an excluded transaction.Does that mean ALL paypal transactions (even when I am paying a business) is excluded?",btohqsg
Pay 25x grabpay wallet in past I would pay $1 for my starhub bill x25 times. But now you also need to spend $2100 (can scan my company qr?)Anyway  I won't order 12 grabfood or grabmart üòÇ,btohqsg
All PayPal transactions are excluded on UOB One,btohqsg
I think most PAYPAL are not included  you can see the PDF.,btohqsg
What is Paypal *Plus500  Paypal *Plus500.cometc though,btohqsg
I had assumed from this article that paypal transactions to businesses earn cashback/miles:https://milelion.com/2020/02/29/do-paypal-transactions-earn-miles/,btohqsg
2.2k? They dreaming. After I missed out on their previous challenge by 50cts I give up already. Because the stupid transitlink charged so late,btohqsg
Topping up of trading accounts on Plus500 via PayPal.,btohqsg
Quite normal for banks to exclude topping up of any trading accounts,btohqsg
Yes so the bank specifically blacklisted PayPal transactions to Plus500,btohqsg
But my paypal transaction was to Awfully Chocolate. It shouldnt be an excluded transaction from the tnc,btohqsg
should not be excluded unless the mcc is,btohqsg
Now thinking ocbc 365 as an alternative to maybank fnf. Anyone recommend? Thinking to hit $800 in telco  utilities  and food,btohqsg
Hi i am currently booking for a japan trip and i realised that the credit card im using  citibank rewards card  has a oversea currency exchange fee  if someone could double check that. So i would like to find a way to pay for my hotels without the fee and still get the points for my credit card. But i learnt that youtrip topup would not get any points. are there any other method?,btohqsg
Amaze plus any Mastercard cmrc combo?,btohqsg
Hi  what are some recommended cards for big purchases? For both cashback and miles. Thanksüôèüèª,btohqsg
Hello@ChrisHMSGfor the dbs amex card  it is able to add to Apple Pay?,btohqsg
If your are booking airticket or hotel Citi reward don‚Äôt reward you also,btohqsg
I thought Citibank rewards card exclude travel related transactions from getting 4mpd? See item 6.(ii)https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
Nope it listed on Apple Pay websiteBank issued Amex not compatible,btohqsg
But i can use youtrip onbookings.comrite? to prevent the multi currency fee,btohqsg
you can but it wiser to use HSBC Revolution or DBS Altitude to earn some rewards from it,btohqsg
You may want to compare the price between multiple booking websites. I thinkbooking.comis not the cheapest.,btohqsg
ouh because currently idh any of those and my parents dont have it aswell. the citi bank card i was talking about was my dads,btohqsg
ouh ic. I was planning to use my own standsrd charted cashback debit card to topup to youtrip and use youtrip from there,btohqsg
If you want to book airticket  Skyscanner may give you a list of websites to compare.,btohqsg
I think most of the air ticket booking websites allow you to pay using SGD currency.,btohqsg
i am jus looking for hotel rooms. My airplane tickets are already booked,btohqsg
Then You can check the hotel price listed on Agoda too or perhaps compare against the price on hotel website directly.,btohqsg
Delayed by 1 day  i will post tomorrow 8pm,btohqsg
Is it possible to cancel a credit card  transaction made an hour ago?,btohqsg
Did you make the purchase yourself?,btohqsg
You can try calling the CC company tomorrow to see if it's possible.,btohqsg
Oh no... I signed up for the dbs altitude amex last week for the 20k miles thinking that amex have the loungue access.. its only for dbs alt visa... FML,btohqsg
I wonder if it's possible to cancel the application by calling the bank?,btohqsg
Waiting for your take on budget!,btohqsg
Card arrived and activated... I was trying to sign up for the piority pass only to see that only for visa and not amex.  I guess no choice.. get my wife to sign for the alt visa as I have cpm already. Den my alt amex just hit and run on the Miles,btohqsg
I think you can hold both,btohqsg
Any recommendation which brokerage should I go with if I want to start my dividend investing journey? Moomoo ? Syfe?,btohqsg
"Any prev. discussion on the SCB's smart credit card? ""Get S$200 cashback when you activate when you activate your card within 30 days of card approval."" ‚Äî> Does it only works on those specific spending?",btohqsg
No spend required to get the $200 cashback  just need to activate within the stated period. The $200 you are free to spend on whatever you want.,btohqsg
Reason why i ask is because i accidentally book a non-refundable hotel on a wrong date through expedia. i contact expedia and they say its non reundable and they need to contact hotel and give me the result in 72hrs. i only realised wrong date right after i made the payment so the cancel request was made less than 10mins.,btohqsg
2c worth start with interactive brokers. Fees a bit higher but you save on a lot of junk fees and you have access to way more markets than just SGX and NYSE/Nasdaq,btohqsg
Example: a lot of seasoned investors recommend buying Irish domiciled ETFs listed on LSE because Ireland has a tax treaty with USA. Normally you pay 30% dividend tax to Uncle Sam if you're a foreigner but Irish funds only pay 15% dividend tax. IBKR has access to LSE but tiger  moomoo  webull  syfe etc do not,btohqsg
Webull! Check out the promo but can get moomoo as well since both zero commission brokers,btohqsg
Thank you! Will definitely check that out. Didn‚Äôt know about the 30% tax omg!,btohqsg
For sure will join webull for the rewards  just wanted to know if I should also ‚Äúuse‚Äù it. Or just get the rewards and run..,btohqsg
I intend to use it just like I used moomoo. But will see about nyse since I don't really fancy high withholding tax....maybe just use sgx,btohqsg
It is tax on dividends not capital appreciation,btohqsg
Booking.comor agoda coupled with Shopback. When shopback has promo and increase the percentage of cashback really not bad..,btohqsg
should contact the shop. If they agree to refund  you can get back your money. If you call cc bank they will ask to contact the shop,btohqsg
The shop has the right to not refund your money  all depend on the t&c,btohqsg
hi guys  was just checking the citi rewards card - am new to credit cards. what does the interest on purchases mean?,btohqsg
any amount u spend on credit card basically,btohqsg
what do u mean? is this a late payment fee or additional payment ontop of the amount i spend?,btohqsg
If you don't repay in full every month  then that's the interest you accrue. Hence  pay in full and on time every month!,btohqsg
Would we receive an email notification after submitting the hsbc Ega application?,btohqsg
Did it through the app previously (not instant approval),btohqsg
I only get the email after the application is successfully open. It took 17 days for them to process my application.,btohqsg
For HSBC revo cc  understand only the 6th transaction will receive cashback. For the first 5 what constitutes qualifying? Must it be in whitelist or anything counts?,btohqsg
That's additional cashback for everyday+ programme. I assume you have EGA account  then just do 5 fast transaction and from the next day onwards all cc transactions will get that additional 1% cashback (usually you'll get sms if you are enrolled to everyday+)As for cc 2.5% cashback  it should include first 5 transactions too  provided they are in mcc whitelist,btohqsg
Hi   1) does citirewards give points for comfort delgro?  2) can i link amaze card into comfortdelgro app? Thanks,btohqsg
No need to use amaze for comfort delgro app. But not for comfort inside the kris+,btohqsg
confirm kris+ pay by citireward card will be no 10x rwd,btohqsg
Any current promo for opening EGA account?,btohqsg
Can someone explain what the CPF ceiling mean?,btohqsg
If I earn $8k and my CPF contribution is $1.6k  meaning I can only do voluntary top-up of another $5.4k as of now?,btohqsg
That is the limit that employers have to pay you CPF until  aka if you earn 9k your employee CPF contribution will still be 1.6k (20% pegged to 8k),btohqsg
What do the $6k and beyond numbers mean tho?,btohqsg
Currently the CPF ceiling is at $6k  meaning that employers only have to pay you up to 17% of $6k currently  and your employee contribution also capped at 20% of $6k. This $6k will be gradually increased to $8k by 1 Jan 2025. You do the math lol,btohqsg
ohhh so as of now  if I earn $20k  only 37% of $6k will be contributed to CPF?,btohqsg
but in 2025  37% of $8k will be contributed to my CPF if I earn $20k,btohqsg
okie  thanks for educating Kenji :),btohqsg

Can anyone advise me on how citibank award the points when using Citibank Rewards Card,btohqsg
I have spend 999bucks and awarded 9990 points now,btohqsg
I went to mcd and buy 1 cone for 1 dollar using amaze  but citibank doesnt seem to give me the 10 points,btohqsg
Anyone have tried to apply the citi prestige to get 120k points as a existing member?,btohqsg
Ps. The cashback is in the form of the SCB reward points right?,btohqsg
Nop this $200 cashback is in the form of cash credit to your CC account,btohqsg
Should I use citi rewards card directly or the amaze card for this? Will I even be entitled for 10x miles?,btohqsg
When in doubt  use Amaze and should be eligible  i used mine for AF membership,btohqsg
Wait does this apply for comfort delgro booking? Or in general spend like in challenger  F&B?,btohqsg
Kris+ and CRMC don‚Äôt go together,btohqsg
CRMC excluded reward earned via mobile wallet ( Apple Pay or Google Pay ),btohqsg
Ah I see... That's interesting.. Shall wait for Amaze to be included in Apple Wallet.. then it will be included alr right?,btohqsg
Yeah then it will be possible as it the work around for android phoneSo basically don‚Äôt add CRMC onto Apple Pay use amaze or those accept credit card directlyLike MacDonald app which accept both credit card or via Apple PayCRMC direct credit work but Apple Pay option don‚Äôt work,btohqsg
Agoda has very nice tie-ins with DBS -> you can book via a dedicated site for 15-20% off  but not sure if the promo ended alr,btohqsg
It should work unless you are some cent balanceLet say you have999.10Ice cream $1Hence total spend is $1001.10Meaning ice cream is $0.90 which below the $1 min spendingPlease do correct me if I‚Äôm wrong,btohqsg
"If you earn 20k I'm pretty surprised you didn't bother to find out that your CPF is capped. Unless of course you are some big shot minister who ""feels rich when he looks at his CPF statement""",btohqsg
A bout a few days like 3-5 working day  hsbc will send you a email regarding the transaction I had the same issue before,btohqsg
Nice  I booked my acomms at 18% off  very significant savings,btohqsg
But note that it‚Äôs capped at $40 per transaction so book each hotel individually and don‚Äôt lump them into one big order to book if you‚Äôre staying at multiple places,btohqsg
Hi... if amaze + cmrc paywave on comfort will get 4miles/dollar?,btohqsg
If my statement is on the 15th means is from 16th to 15? Or 15 to 14th?,btohqsg
Does anyone know the cutoff/statement date of ocbc365 cc ?  Thanks,btohqsg
Im confused. Ice cream is 1 dollar how to become 90cents,btohqsg
Total spend will be 1000.10 after ice cream purchase,btohqsg
I got a big question. Get Mixue ice cream la  $1 more worth it.,btohqsg
HAHAHA i just want to see how the point system works,btohqsg
Thanks for the recommendation will try it,btohqsg
yea buddy  mixue biscult nicer also bigger portion. Cheese ice cream,btohqsg
Will I get Cashback for UOB 1 if I use it to pay for Grablater ?,btohqsg
if im not wrong because you are award based anything $1k and below  hence once above meaning $1k not earn. as the $1 push above hence it wont earn any,btohqsg
no pay later charge is qausi-cash,btohqsg
most likely yes unless comfort use another MCC,btohqsg
So I can use like Amex Cashback card to pay,btohqsg
noted  will do that and thanks for the prompt reply and advice!,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for answering my question. Tbh i expected to see at least 9991 points based on ur explanation since anything after 1000 spend will still give 1 point per dollar spend?,btohqsg
Maybe give it awhile  a bit lagging sometime after posting,btohqsg
"Hi! Sold a stock I have on vickers. Cash settlement. I used the defulat option ""sale contra"". Now I have no stock  a negative cash balance and no idea as per when I will get the cash on  my account... How long does it take for cash to be credited in the account? Thank you",btohqsg

Does Citibank cash back+ or Uob one credit card count with physiotherapy payment at hospital?,btohqsg
Hmm I debited fresh funds of more than 2k and spent 5 transactions on my cc - all qualifying  from ntuc etc.,btohqsg
If you do 5 transactions on cc  they won't be counted towards everyday+So experts suggest to use account and do 5 fast transactions instead in order to be maximize cashback from cc,btohqsg
I saw cashback credited and received sms next day only,btohqsg
Like just transfer in and out of my EGa account 5 times?,btohqsg
1 transaction in (2k/5k) and 5 transactions out (can be as small as $1),btohqsg
Actually can use their cc to spend but cause need wait for posting and everything it a bit slow hence why people say use transfer out is faster and instant which better don‚Äôt want to waste cause their 5 transaction by CC don‚Äôt earn 1% hence wasted,btohqsg
Can. But won't get 1% cashback from ega,btohqsg
Yeah that what I meant can but wasteful   I also do transfer method,btohqsg
I think can do it before month end and it will be extended ü§î my is extended until March 31st,btohqsg

Hello! Does UOB EVOL give cashback for Whizcomms internet bill?I think it falls under Utilities - but not 100% sure. If it is really Utilities of course  no cashback.,btohqsg
I got it within 1 month of card approval. It should be reflected in your CC statement. It's only applicable to new SC credit card holders meaning you should not hold any SC credit cards in the last 12 months before your application date,btohqsg
Too underrated. Support this card more.,btohqsg
yes super underrated at it been 1 stop oversea card.- spot rate competitive to youtrip- balance is withdrawable- balance earn interest- able to switch to credit card or debit card- no oversea atm withdrawal feepeople using youtrip should switch over to trust for oversea spending,btohqsg
Definitely. I would rather spot rate than having to deal with top-up wallet... Especially fraudulent activity  good luck,btohqsg

PayLah! no more $3 as of 11.16am!,btohqsg
Telco MCC probablyif you want a sure way to earn  do manual payment via the app every month,btohqsg
never test yet but i doubt so fast used up..,btohqsg
if they accept credit cardsthen AMEX TrueCashback (1.5%)  AMEX Highflyer (1.8MPD) topup grab  then use GPMC to pay on the insurer's portal,btohqsg
I think citi bank has the citi payall which can earn 1 reward point per dollar with 2% fees,btohqsg
What do you mean by manual payment via the app?,btohqsg
don't let it charge as a recurring paymentlogin and make a payment (if it allows)Like Starhub you can pay ahead of time,btohqsg
I got the high flyer card. I can‚Äôt use grab pay anymore  right?,btohqsg
Yes but I have to have the grab master card for that( which I don‚Äôt have ) . Axs wont work anymore‚Ä¶,btohqsg
time to apply for it thenand as mentioned  if your insurer allows you to pay via credit card  you can put GPMC on file,btohqsg
Still have. Maybe the store you visited is not participating in the promotion?,btohqsg
i think still have cause the app will display run out if no more,btohqsg
I use PayLah! leh in a hawker centre,btohqsg
For VISA  you have Maybank Platinum .... 3.33% with monthly spend of either $300 or $1000. Otherwise GPMC paired with those AMEX cards like what others have recommended.,btohqsg

Hi guys  I have the option to use CPF or cash for my part of my mortgage (co-owner)Is it wiser to use cash fully  or use CPF and top up MA (CPF shielding) with the cash instead?Thinking of what will generate the most interest per se. Cheers!,btohqsg
Investment property? Or one that you want to live in till when you are old? You have better investment vehicles for your cash?,btohqsg
I am looking to eventually upgrade from my current place. I was actually also thinking of putting the cash in other vehicles that may produce better returns as well  should I choose to pay with CPF.,btohqsg
If is an investment property  better to use cash if you have sufficient liquidity  and when you sell all capital gains you can keep and don't have to pay accrued interest. However if you have better investment vehicles that yield more and same risk profile as property investment  then use cash for those investment vehicles and use CPF to buy your investment property. My2c.,btohqsg
WIth the current high interest rate environment  using CPF to service mortgage and investing cash into something that earns > 2.5% makes sense. When rates decrease  you can always choose to use cash to repay the amount taken out from OA that was used to pay for the house.,btohqsg
Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts!,btohqsg
Yeah this is one of the things I was thinking as well. Thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
In Singapore  leveraged annuity is a better option than investment property  IMHO.No duties  you pay a lower interest rate than mortgage interest  income not taxable  no need to deal with tenant or maintenance or any other cost such as commission for every tenancy renewal  income + capital gain same like property  but property price may drop but annuity policy value only increases,btohqsg
Do you mean if I took the topping up of CPF route? Or did I understand it wrong,btohqsg
I mean in Singapore there‚Äôs no point in getting a second residential property for investment because of the govt policies,btohqsg
With ABSD and taxable rental income,btohqsg
IMO property is more liquid then an annuity though. And it's much easier to refinance a mortgage whereas once you've taken a  loan with a bank for the purpose of leveraging a policy  you'll be at the mercy of that bank until you close the loan. There is no bank that I'm aware off that would refinance an existing policy because the main earning from the bank is from the policy purchase. If you manage to find a bank that refinances a policy loan  you won't be able to get such special loan rates anymore. Furthermore  the loan rates on leveraging is always floating  whereas a mortgage has fixed rate options.,btohqsg
In the current high interest rate environment  it's hard to leverage on a policy because the rate of return on the policy is around the same rate as loans now. If rates continue to go up  the leverage may end up diminishing the returns on the annuity instead (i.e.  if no leverage  you'd get 3% but if you take leverage of 4%  your overall yield decreases below 3% because part of the proceeds will need to offset the high interest loan).,btohqsg
In terms of liquidity  the loan value for the policy is 90% of the first day cash value  meaning any time you surrender the policy can cover the loan amount.But yes  usually it‚Äôs on 1/3mth SORA. Floating and fixed rate policy is a double-edged sword. In current market for example  without a crystal ball to see how the rates will go  fixed rate will may work to your disadvantage.,btohqsg
Same with yield  with residential rental property  the rent is high because the mortgage is high. So your yield is not there. When the interest drops  rental also drops.But with annuity  the yield is constant so when rates drop  nett yield increases.,btohqsg
Also have to consider the barrier to entry. With a live-in primary residence  your dp for your investment residence need to be 25% of property value before adding in the ABSD 17% and your TDSR includes the interest and principal repayment.For leverage annuities  the initial single premium is about 20% and TDSR is negligible because you only service the interest. The principal will be paid for when the policy is surrendered.,btohqsg
Not sure your income bracket. The additional income tax that comes from the rental income will also add up if your bracket breaches the high levels,btohqsg
Hi Wee Loon  Can share more on how leveraged annuities can have capital appreciation ?,btohqsg
If you are lucky with a good tenant that takes care of your home  great. But if you have tenants from hell. Good luck with new furniture  repairs  paint  no rental payment,btohqsg
It‚Äôs an insurance policy on the par fund of the insurers. It comes with appreciating account value based on par funds returns,btohqsg
On top of the monthly payout,btohqsg
Hi all~ I wanted to borrow HDB loan. Do you guys think it is better to get the max year of loan?,btohqsg
While we don‚Äôt know when it will drop  it will be brought down because the govt wants you to buy bonds to raise funds for infrastructure. If the rates so high now for long  who will buy bonds,btohqsg
And in Singapore we have to worry about lease decay. Annuities can have Secondary lie assured continuously to pass down the policies,btohqsg
Leveraging is the term used to enhance investment yields by taking a loan. For example  if you purchase a bond with a coupon of 10% p.a. and the loan to value (LTV) the bank would give on the bond is 50%  then if you purchase 100k of the bond by putting in 50k of your own money and borrowing 50k from the bank at a rate of 5%  then the yield of the investment would be { [ (10% x 100k) - (5% x 50k loan) ] / 50k your money } % = 15% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.But if loan interest rate rises to say 15%  then the yield would drastically drop { [ (10% x 100k) - (15% x 50k loan) ] / 50k your money } % = 5% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.If the loan taken is larger  the impact is greater. For example  if the LTV Is 90% then on a 100k investment (coupon 10%) you take 90k loan (10k your money):If loan rate is 5% then yield is { [ (10% x 100k) - (5% x 90k loan) ] / 10k your money } % = 55% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.If loan rate is 15% then yield is { [ (10% x 100k) - (15% x 90k loan) ] / 10k your money } % = -35% yield instead of 10% yield if you didn't take a loan.*Note that the numbers used are for making calculations simpler in order to covey how it works. The numbers are not realistic.,btohqsg

Same omg  I‚Äôve been using uob EVOL for around 3 months now  my Cashback was $30+ for the 1st month  but the next two months it was dismal like $1+ üôÉ dk if it‚Äôs something wrong with the way I hit my minimum spending because I‚Äôve been tracking all of my expenses (contactless & online) and made sure I avoided the exclusions of this card‚Ä¶ still trying to figure out this card to use it optimally ü´†ü´†,btohqsg

After failing with uob  I applied ocbc 365 and got rejected. When I called  the reason was not enough income. My annual is >90k lolThey never ask for income documents too. And I have been their customer for 13 years  crediting my salary ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
üòÆ what‚Äôs the min. spending you‚Äôve been hitting?,btohqsg
"Hi guys  I have been tracking my UOB EVOL card meticulously and received $27.23 cashback instead of my expected $40 for Jan statement. Spoke to UOB CSO about it and turns out my transactions for Shopee was categorized not as ""online spend"". I paid using my EVOL card through Google pay on Shopee instead of paying directly on Shopee using the Evol card hence when UOB received this transaction from the merchant it wasn't categorized as ONLINE. Everyone pls beware!!",btohqsg
what application method did you use? SingPass or manual?try manual - sometimes it forces them to review documents,btohqsg
$600-800++ ü•≤ü•≤ just gonna experiment around :‚ÄùD,btohqsg
gotta check T&C closely. some banks categorise in-app GooglePay as online but others have a specific category for it as ‚Äúin-app‚Äù payments.,btohqsg
check the MCCs of your transactions - you may be facing a similar situation as@Samyogen,btohqsg
But if you paid directly in the shopee app using your credit card (not using their shopee pay)  it should be considered online spend right? :o,btohqsg
yes. but Shopee uses a wide range of MCCs (Merchant Category Code)it‚Äôs worth getting in touch with the UOB CSO to ask them whappen - you can use UOB Chat,btohqsg
pay directly wouldn't have this issue. It will be categorized as online spend. just need to becareful when using GooglePay on Shopee,btohqsg
Yeahh sigh I could have missed out some MCCs üò¢ I should clarify with them  thanks :‚ÄùD,btohqsg
I used in app  since I have an account,btohqsg

It works for monthly and yearly. I use the amex true cashback cc,btohqsg

you mentioned signing up last month so your first statement wont show any cashback. it should be in your next statement,btohqsg
Oh I see  thanks for the info,btohqsg
No need to get fused over catagory and just $500,btohqsg
update: CSO has reviewed with mgt and will grant those transactions as online. The balance rebate will be credited in my next statement.,btohqsg
Likely google pay is categorised as mobile contactless (same category as apple pay)  so it prob went towards the spending there. Can‚Äôt confirm but just my gut feel,btohqsg

Amex true cashback card with grabpay mastercard combo to earn 1.5% cashback on AIA insurance premiums (pay by mastercard online),btohqsg
I'm not sure.. I think as long as you show proof you have a  regular income stream should be ok. E.g. Can try submitting your past months' bank statements during application.,btohqsg
Thanks.  Will make enquiry with Amex. üòä,btohqsg
Unfortunately  there's no way to upload supporting documents during the amex application. I think that's one of the reasons why I was rejected,btohqsg
Can elaborate?  Their site use Singpass for application and thought they need us to send income document?,btohqsg
I tried both MyInfo and manual  there's no section where it asks to upload supporting documents. You only indicate your income  but they don't require you to upload any proof,btohqsg

18 months can consider BOC for 3.7% if not 24 months can consider RHB for 3.9%,btohqsg

Maybe you can break your amount into two 12mths or shorter tenure FD with 2 banks instead bec the 18mths or 24mth FD rates are lower than 12mths FD as some banks are of the view of falling interest rate.Like ocbc there is the 3.88% for 8mths or 4.08% for 8mths for 360acc.Unless ur intentions is don't mind the smaller int rate and wan to lock it in first with the view of falling rates.,btohqsg

In any case if I am at max 80% LTV for HLE  whatever balance amount I will have to pay through OA or cash right? Will HDB limit the price of the unit I can buy?,btohqsg
Its called MSR - Mortgage Servicing Ratio,btohqsg
80% LTV is based off the purchase price of the unit  that's the max u can loan  but your 30% MSR dictates your HLEYour HLE can go as high as 80% of the HDB's LTV,btohqsg
Also do take note that the remaining lease of the flat must be enough for you to reside there until you are 95 years old  if not  HDB will pro-rate the CPF OA usage as well as HDB Loan based off how many years you are off from 95,btohqsg
The saving plan from insurance is it good?,btohqsg
Any idea if the HLE is really based on monthly salary or also take into account gross annual salary? Because I am on like a 15 to 16 month package so my monthly salary actually doesn‚Äôt tell the entire story.,btohqsg
When you apply for HLE  you can fill up the monthly salary portion by annual salary divided by 12 months  HDB will then ask for supporting documents and you can just show your payslips  any contracts stating your pay or otherwise & basically just justify your higher salary.. HDB normally calls you or emails you if they don't understand anything,btohqsg
FYI  now's a good time to apply for HLE.. Valid for 6 months. During busy periods don't expect replies from HDB so soon,btohqsg
Ah shit  I fill in my actual monthly salary not the annual divided by 12.,btohqsg
u can write in :D I have utmost respect for the officers handling the cases but when they're very busy....... it's so hard to get a response üòÇ,btohqsg
But I also submitted 15 months cpf contribution history,btohqsg
if the HLE is based off your 15 month package then you're good to go  if not you'll have to write in,btohqsg
Ok then I see how much are they willing to loan before I decide if I need to appeal,btohqsg

not really  the fees still dont impact the main use case for people using it in SGD.It oly meant to convert offline to online for CRMC.no one will use amaze to topup e-wallet,btohqsg
i think people need to understand why people using amaze locally  it mainly use for CRMC trick.Go oversea still can use but you also wont be topping up any e-wallet.,btohqsg
Can get free cash advance by topping up grabpay and withdrawing,btohqsg
mostly to close this loophole. if people are abusing it.,btohqsg
what is the CRMC stands for? but i think it is quite rare to find a company to charge you additional fee on doing certain categories of transaction. they usually just remove the cashback or rewards only,btohqsg
Citi reward mastercard  they already dont reward anything in the first place but let A A mention it meant to close loophole for cash advance as amaze wallet deposit into Grab Walelt can be withdraw to bank account,btohqsg
yea  i believe is to close the loophole. hopefully it doesnt extend to more type of transation,btohqsg
people are mainly using it for thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GOO9ngIm84,btohqsg
as CRMC + amaze make it a general card,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer easier to useAmex highflyer if you already own a biz sure can combined with grab card to use,btohqsg

After the recent tiny market recovery  now in green by very small %. Started when the market was falling in 2022. CPF-OA core 100% equity  dca monthly,btohqsg
May I know if singaporean can apply for a Malaysian credit or debit card in Malaysia?,btohqsg

Can we link OCBC titanium with amaze to earn the 4mpd? Just curious why CRMC and DBS Women‚Äôs world card is often highlighted and not this titanium card?,btohqsg
I am researching which card to use to buy a MacBook Pro ‚Ä¶. CRMC and revolution 10x point is only up to the first 1k while women‚Äôs world card is up to the first 2k  in a month. Titanium is up to $12k per year. If I am not wrong  all of 3 cards rewards compute to 4 mpd. Any experts here can comment if my analysis is correct?,btohqsg
ocbc titanium only give 4mpd for some specific MCCs,btohqsg
Hi All  I received this msg. Does it mean I successfully registered for the 4.35% interest rate for EGA?HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
I got to go check the T&C carefully üòÖ,btohqsg
You will get this sms as long as you registered. Does not mean it's successful. ie if you try to register again while you are still within the last EGA cycle  you will still get the sms  even though the registration is not counted.,btohqsg
Thanks. I just got my account. Will u get another msg which says u are successful? And for the additional 1% interest  is it worth transferring money into the account now (almost the end of the mth)?,btohqsg
Anyone knows when is the OCBC fixed promo until?,btohqsg
Hi  may I ask if I‚Äôm planning to pay for my royal Caribbean cruise  should I use the Citi cashback + or UOB Amex?Thanks for your reply üôèüèª,btohqsg
Last time can. have to get a sdn or bhd to write letter for you that you are working full time for them  then can open bank account and get debit card.,btohqsg
Hi. I got this card  and every year they will waive it for me. You do have to call them though,btohqsg
Well Amex customer service is Solid! Compared to the rest of the cards.,btohqsg
Can I check if I can use Citi reward to pay for utilities bill will i get 10x points,btohqsg
Hi  I'm the new Citi Bank cash back+ cardholder  I would like to ask if I were to use this card to pay for my education expenses (about $1k)  does it mean I have already fulfilled the spending requirement within the 30 days of card approval thingy?,btohqsg
Debit card easy - can get if you can open bank account. Credit card close to impossible. Got ask before. Gladly would like to know otherwise if anyone knows how to get msia cc.,btohqsg
Thanks! For CPF and the normal promo right,btohqsg
no but if you use citi payall you can get 1 point per dollar with 2% fees,btohqsg
Hi all  I have my CPF investment account in OCBC. How to transfer to my posb. So I can buy tbill with my CPF OA.Next I had invested with my OCBC CPF OA account years ago. With the change to posb. How does it work or it don't matter?,btohqsg

If the recent treasury trend continues  T bills in 2-3 months time May go above 4% again‚Ä¶ maybe other banks then may have another promo with higher rates again,btohqsg
Hi  May I know what is dedicated web site ? Tks,btohqsg
Need to check whether have actual discount. Sometime they raise rates so to have discount. End up actually no discount. üòÇ,btohqsg
Any alternatives for ocbc 365 cc? For everyday spent + utilities,btohqsg
Education fees are excluded if i‚Äôm not wrong  so you wouldn‚Äôt hit the requirement.,btohqsg
It doesn't have rebates for dining unfortunately,btohqsg
If dining is your main concern then maybe citi cash back?,btohqsg
That I use for groceries and a lot üòÖ,btohqsg
Probably I'll check citi + uob combo  and do my calculations. Thanks,btohqsg
For groceries  I know Trust cc is good (nearby got 3 fairprice and 0 sheng siong). But need to spend $350 non-fpg (utilities excluded)  so no Idea üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi  Is it a good idea to use the combo citibank cashback for dining/groceries and dbs altitude card (miles) for the remaining expenses?,btohqsg
how useful is the citirewards mastercard compared to uob absolute / citi cashback+ card if i am not interested in the miles game and plan on converting the points earned to the $10 credit only?,btohqsg
Amaze doesn't have the best FX rates once they nerf all MC I guess I will ditch them,btohqsg
Hi all  can pls advise on how the use of Revolut card in Malaysia?1) can a basic Revolut card be use there or need to upgrade the card?2) do I need to transfer to RM or it will auto change when make payment using the card? Cos I don see any RM when scrolling for rates.3) usage only is the merchant accept visa payment?4) can I cash out if need cash? Any free incurred?,btohqsg
1. No need to upgrade plan to use the card. Unless you need more withdrawal limit.2. Auto convert.3. Yes. Or when u cash out via atm overseas.4. Yes. Fee is according to plan. Basic has like S$250 atm limit monthly no fee I think. If u want more then u hv to upgrade plan or pay fee.,btohqsg
Anyone looking at DCS cashback card? Diners club international. 5% cashback with minimum spend of $400 spend sounds good?,btohqsg
Just take note now revolut somehow not longer able to top up tng in malaysia [since ma change to visa].,btohqsg
Revolut have virtual visa card. So no problem on that,btohqsg
Hi can i ask  if we can use axs to pay for insurance? Will there be any extra cost? I got the uob absolute cash back card but prudential doesn't have amex.,btohqsg
Not sure what you mean by not able to top up tng in Malaysia. Can elaborate? Thkz,btohqsg
Thkz@jeranng. So better use this than Youtrip. Unless the merchant cannot accept visa then I use Youtrip card?,btohqsg
No extra cost. But highly likely no rewards also  just additional 1 month of credit,btohqsg
Uob absolute cash back wrote that there is cashback for insurance tho,btohqsg
"Yep  provided you use it to pay for insurance. The problem is finding an insurer that accepts amex. AXS does not accept amex  and is not an ""insurer"".",btohqsg
Maybank platinum credit card can used pay insurance to get $30 cash rebate quarterly with min spending $300 monthly.$100 cash rebate quarterly with min spending $900 monthly.Additional U also can earn linkpoints when pay bill sam machine.,btohqsg
Oh damn! Alright thankssss guys. Seems like without grabpay  uob absolute cash back is useless,btohqsg
$100 quarterly rebate for $1000 each month,btohqsg
still got other uses like hospital payment at counter,btohqsg
Hello guys For UOB visa signature  anyone tried to use it for online transactions in foreign currency? Hotel   flights booking ? Does it reward with 4mpd OR it doesn‚Äôt support online transactions for foreign currency whatsoever?Thanks.,btohqsg
Foreign currency is foreign currency regardless of what mode it's paid in,btohqsg
Do yall know any CC under Citibank/ UOB/DBS/OCBC can pay prudential insurance and still get reward?,btohqsg
So if it appears like this means I‚Äôll get 4pmd  right?,btohqsg
UOB is weird...it not only has to be foreign currency  but payment processor must be outside Singapore as well,btohqsg
yes  assuming it is processed overseas and met min $1k foreign spend,btohqsg
is ok. UOB makes us all confused,btohqsg
I will really know if it‚Äôs 4mpd only the following month  right?,btohqsg
Do you know if the payment service processor is located in sg or abroad?,btohqsg
UOB.We have to find UOB$ merchants AND merchants that process payments in Singapore toavoid,btohqsg
I usedbooking.comand it shows ‚ÄúNetherlands‚Äù so I guess it‚Äôs overseas,btohqsg
Nice! Thank you for the information  but do you have to spend alot on the card? I was reading the T&C's  actually they will award 15000Highflyer miles if we spend $10K per year. That average out to be around $834/month.So If I can get a waiver from their annual by spending 10k a year and will received 15k Highflyer miles  sound okay leh,btohqsg
It's a good card for low spenders  but Diners Club is less accepted than Amex. They have their Diners club app which you can use to pay at hawkers with DCS logo,btohqsg
Oh another question  will I qualify for my Krisflyer elite Sliver if I transfer my Citi premier miles to my Krisflyer account? Will transfering of miles works?,btohqsg
it's actually a UnionPay card. which isn't very well accepted too. Anyway UnionPay and Diners use the same payment network,btohqsg
oh wait I got confused with the other card which is an unlimited 2% cashback card,btohqsg
I‚Äôm spending around 2k a month I would say  more or less.I think if you spend around 1k a month should be fine,btohqsg
"Hi folks  can I check for DBS Altitude Visa Card  is it real that i get 10 miles per SGD 1 Spend? because I see here ""At a Glance"" says so sweet at caption but yet scrolled down to below become SGD 1 spend = 3 miles on online flight & hotel transactions.",btohqsg
"more specifically  it says ""up to""but it all depends on which promotion is currently going on",btohqsg
oh  found out it's the 10 miles is to Kaligo platform only.,btohqsg
"Credit card benefits are more ""click-baity"" than YouTube titles. The more you see  the more you learn",btohqsg
Anyone knows if Maybank Platinum Visa Often has new sign up promos like other banks?Wonder if shd wait for promos but seems like quite rare..,btohqsg
