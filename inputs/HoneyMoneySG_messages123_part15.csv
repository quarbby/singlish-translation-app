Don't think so. The $500 is in respect to previous month average balance. So it $500 more against 100k,btohqsg
u qualify for the interest but the interest not deposited on day 1. so if u just top up 118  ur overall balance will be 500 more than previous month  but your average balance will not be. OCBC count by average daily balance by end of month must be $500 more,btohqsg
if say the 382 deposited on 10th of the month (roughly 1/3 through the month)  u top up 118 on 1st of the month  ur average balance increase for the month will be 382*2/3 + 118 = ~373,btohqsg
So let‚Äôs say I just credit salary one 1st day  with draw everything on second day except 500 and withdraw the interest immediate when received before day end.. that would work right?In the sense that it doesn‚Äôt drastically increase my MAB Month on month,btohqsg
yeap thats what i do monthly  just that for me salary is end of month so i always take out the same day its deposited. i just top up 500 monthly on the 1st of the monthonly thing u have to be careful  1st of the month if it doesnt fall on weekday  the 500 that u deposit on the 1st wont be counted on that day  abit more complex so for those months i just top up 600 on the 1st to be conservative and sure that i get 500 monthly balance. you can calculate a more exact number but i just lazy and do 600 if 1st falls on saturday or sunday,btohqsg
Basically I‚Äôm trying to avoid the drastic increase of MABElse I would have to forgo 1 month of interest just to reset the MAB to the lowest possible,btohqsg
But it needs a few days for the system to records the salary crediting right?If you do it on the 27th‚Ä¶ will it be in time for 30th or 31st?,btohqsg
nope  salary crediting always will be accounted  even if its last day of the month,btohqsg
Even if you withdraw it 1 min after depositing ?Do they just look at the statement and check that a salary deposit was received?,btohqsg
yeap. correct. they have an automated way of checking if salary is deposited  dont need to keep minimum minutes or days  i usually take out within 1 hour of receiving sms that my salary deposited  sometimes even immediately if im free at that point of time,btohqsg
Oh cool so it‚Äôs different from credit card where we have to wait for the pending status to end,btohqsg
UserErickhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:dont advertise such services,btohqsg
Hey guys what‚Äôs the difference between this two funds on webull?,btohqsg
Hi. If want to charged online travel activities  overseas (in NZD)  which card to use? Lady‚Äôs / Ladys + Amaze + Ladys? PPV / Citi rewards? thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Looking at the pic.. Name and yield?,btohqsg
Amaze lady with travel category. Crmc/ppv doesn't give rewards for online travel.,btohqsg
Anybody knows which credit card other than Citibank gives free luggages for local  spending on  travel related expense? No more to  apply new card.,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to share where you plan the buy the activities? Rewards are given based on where you buy  but not based on where the activities will be held.,btohqsg
Please visit NATAS at Singapore Expo on 16-18 Aug for your dream free luggages.,btohqsg
Which is better - buying shoppe via Shopback or Heymax?,btohqsg
Do you like cashback or mile?,btohqsg
oh ya i just check its under entertainment 7999,btohqsg
Or maybe mercenary? Aka whichever the platform giving higher % back,btohqsg
Generally  cash. But which is more worth it?,btohqsg
You have to see what % they are giving back  sometimes during promo periods either platform can be higher than the other. 1 Heymax mile I would value at 1.8 cents (that's the rate they let you redeem flights)  then you do your own caculations,btohqsg
They have different offers and change from time to time. Personally if you are not into miles  I'd suggest shopback for their cashback.,btohqsg
If mcc7999 in NZD  then UOB VS(min $1k)  PPV  Amaze+CRMC  DBS WWMC.,btohqsg
Hopefully next month will have the 350 cash credit,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can I check if anyone knows if instalment payments (eg for electronics) count as online transactions and can be used to get 4mpd for Citi rewards?,btohqsg
