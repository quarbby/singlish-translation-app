Which is bad because they should come up with their own schedule,btohqsg
Sadly i cant be hired thanks to@chemcer,btohqsg
Use SGEXAMS code for 100percent discount,btohqsg
Tbh  there is nothing stopping those who got like 14 and abv to get into such JCs,btohqsg

The MrT is build for them man,btohqsg
BUT vjc at east coast thr oni,btohqsg
Build a MRT to my school,btohqsg
"It was gonna be called ""hwa chong""",btohqsg
COP is technically determined by demand and supply so if many students put that JC as their no.1 1 choice  then some if them would actually get in,btohqsg
Den they called it tan kah kee MrT station,btohqsg
Are u intending to H3 chem,btohqsg

Lmao any1 has the o lvl pure bio paper,btohqsg
I heard only 4 chapters came out,btohqsg
First time I see someone using chinese,btohqsg
HAHAHA if i take bio i wldve been so mad,btohqsg
oh last time i use but i changed back to eng lol,btohqsg
No thats a yawn bc i want sleep,btohqsg
i mean thats why my eng sucks also la,btohqsg
Not counting physics in my l1r4 so doesnt rly matter,btohqsg
Even if i consider l1r5 the last subj will be chinese,btohqsg
Wait I think my account is hacked,btohqsg
A secndary skool named after you,btohqsg
LOL... can we have someone be Harry Potter?,btohqsg
shld i add in his middle name,btohqsg
why are u so obsessed with me,btohqsg
Will u choose a poly just because near ur house,btohqsg
I read this in billie eilish,btohqsg
Pure chem paper answers but disclaimer my tutor rushed it through in like 20 mins,btohqsg
So he said mole calculations may be wrong,btohqsg
I thought I lost less than 8 marks but after seeing my tutor‚Äôs answers I probably lost more than what I thought,btohqsg
I checked some of the mol calculations answer wrong but the rest should be ok,btohqsg
Thanks HAHAH but i wan try w/o answers,btohqsg
Anyway even if my tutor rushes it in like 20 mins he would probably still have gotten more marks than me if I had 2h just to do those in syllabus lol,btohqsg
use pdf editor and cover all the answer :P,btohqsg
Hw his cher get siaL LOL,btohqsg
I wonder actk hw ppl get,btohqsg
Someone here sent the version without the answers earlier,btohqsg
Some of the answers will be marked weong,btohqsg
Eg. Liquid and aqueous state 'collapse',btohqsg
ok jay  u want to teach his tutor üòÇ,btohqsg
He‚Äôs referring to the GILS collapse in aq solution,btohqsg
They all exist as mobile ions,btohqsg
U mean there is a better word to use than ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù?,btohqsg
Giant ionic lattice structures dont collapse  they dissociate,btohqsg
Even txtbk says break apart i believe,btohqsg
His part (i) ans for beth is incorrect,btohqsg
Amount = moles. That's a fact,btohqsg
A lvls/uni 'amount' = no of moles,btohqsg
Yes hes not near fuzzy's level,btohqsg
idw distress any1 by sayin it in the o lvl grp instead,btohqsg
As in I'm pretty sure graphite is also correct,btohqsg
And should be the better answer,btohqsg
In my textbook under the section ‚Äúhow is steel made from iron‚Äù it didn‚Äôt mention the need to use argon in the process so I think o and a level learn different things,btohqsg
steel is indirectly produced from blast furnace,btohqsg
and we dont use graphite in blast furnace  but coke,btohqsg
So probably a levels ‚Äúgraphite‚Äù is considered wrong but o levels I need to write graphite,btohqsg
argon is introduced for an inert environment,btohqsg
U don't add argon into the steel wjat,btohqsg
but is to provide an inert environment,btohqsg
yeah I heard somewhere it‚Äôs supposed to prevent some unnecessary reaction,btohqsg
i rmb this qn have quite a few debate,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt think I need to know that for my syllabus,btohqsg
in certain instances if ur pig iron has high % of carbon,btohqsg
I send here for easy reference,btohqsg
u dont need add carbon anymore,btohqsg
they say manufacturing  hence any substance that plays a role in steel making,btohqsg
In which case graphite and argon does,btohqsg
Why would u think of the environment,btohqsg
Yep  so both shld be accepted,btohqsg
but ya if i was doing it,btohqsg
But that does not mean graphite is wrong,btohqsg
cambridge can‚Äôt say graphite is wrong either although the concept of it may be out of the syllabus,btohqsg
but u only realised its correct via google right,btohqsg
if i was an o lvl student,btohqsg
I know that carbon is use in small quantity in steel making,btohqsg
i wouldn't have learnt graphite is involved in steel making,btohqsg
stop arguing about it and just drink juice,btohqsg
it could have been coke  other allotropes of carbon,btohqsg
but intuitively i will be able to understand why ppl will write argon  since its covered in prelims/notes etc,btohqsg
i heard the bio paper was fucked to a new level,btohqsg
smt like 6 chapters were tested or smt tite,btohqsg
i wanna see how guai lan did seab become,btohqsg
LIKE LESS THAN 50% OF THE SYLLABUS TESTED SIA,btohqsg
i legit feel bad for this yr o level kids,btohqsg
they still have the benefit of CLT,btohqsg
i wont be complain if i was taking Os this yr,btohqsg
apart from english rappers in english LC,btohqsg
i think my year (2018) had it alot easier,btohqsg
yeah at least less thing to study üòÇ,btohqsg
my year had the fucked up huan emath qn,btohqsg
The SEQ was totally on the Cold War,btohqsg
Like the paper did the bio students did today,btohqsg
YeahQ1 female repro systemQ2 cell divisionQ3 cigarette smoke & how it affect pregnancyQ4 ABO blood typeQ5 CLTQ6 blood vesselsQ7 HIVQ8 (a) evolution  (b) artificial selection (they asked for 1 plant and 1 animal & state what economically viable feature of each is improved)  (c) with reference to a named example state the social/ethical implications of genetic engineeringQ9 EITHER I forgot the first 2 parts; (c) explain how radiation and chemicals influence evolutionQ9 OR CLT,btohqsg
Q8 was the peak of the weirdness,btohqsg
when did pure bio become an ethics exam qn,btohqsg
a lvl is quite heavy on ethics for bio,btohqsg
thank god i went poly then HAHAHAHHA,btohqsg
so the chapters tested are actually chapters u all will see a lot in a lvls  esp evolution in a lvl bio,btohqsg
2/3 of the h2 bio syllabus actually prepares one for a pre-med course in university,btohqsg
anyone here planning to go to med sch?,btohqsg
you‚Äôll have to go thru at least 4 yrs of med sch dciekwksmdkwi,btohqsg
i want to be a proctologist,btohqsg
iirc sg med sch is 5 yrs,btohqsg
+ 18 months of attachment iirc,btohqsg
so all tgt is like what,btohqsg
6.5 years to be a doctor LOL,btohqsg
And u still have to serve bond,btohqsg
I heard that the average RP of a medical school student in university,btohqsg
After u complete local medical course  u must serve bond,btohqsg
If ure rich just go overseas,btohqsg
as alot of stuff in medi boils down to practise and experience,btohqsg
Chemistry and biology for a levels,btohqsg
thats like 300-400k in sch fees,btohqsg
The course is shorter and u get to practise anywhere in the world,btohqsg
not even counting living costs etc,btohqsg
Oh. Ok then do it locally then,btohqsg
its slightly less than 90 iirc,btohqsg
I mean unless you got a scholarship,btohqsg
idk man i nvr rly tot of studying med overseas,btohqsg
ik ppl with 90rp and still nvr get into med,btohqsg
Uhh there‚Äôs only one non-bonded overseas scholarship,btohqsg
its not insanely difficult but more of whether you're suitable,btohqsg
cuz the interview is a killer,btohqsg
Rich then go study overseas lah,btohqsg
Why Th would you want to do that,btohqsg
150th ranked is what your referring to?,btohqsg
But surgeons are the ones that generate the real money,btohqsg
Medical school has a lot of nerds,btohqsg
i have nvr seen anyone flex uni ranking soooooo..........,btohqsg
damn i didnt know LaQuita Granger was a doctor,btohqsg
Hwa Chong‚Äôs medical program is really good,btohqsg
But at the same time it‚Äôs Hwa Chong so need to study the medical stuff with the higher chinese stuff,btohqsg
I see no point in getting a scholarship honestly,btohqsg
Most of them have ridiculous bonds and requirements,btohqsg
But you need to maintain a certain GPA,btohqsg
Otherwise the scholarship will drop you,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm uninterested in getting one,btohqsg
I want to spend university playing,btohqsg
Just get a degree the go work,btohqsg
Not everyone can be summa cum laude,btohqsg
dont play with the butler haha,btohqsg
story is a bit different if u do super well in a levels/poly and unis pay u to study at the uni itself,btohqsg
how do i get paid for studying,btohqsg
basically ur future is full of $$$$$,btohqsg
i wont say it is guaranteed for sure for the 'internal scholarship',btohqsg
but only the best end up in true finance,btohqsg
finance can be as wide as ur AIA insurance agent,btohqsg
i will say a considerable amount of ppl end up in the true areas of finance,btohqsg
but not every1 can get in,btohqsg
i mean for me is just study what i like,btohqsg
ya  even finance majors may not necessarily enter finance,btohqsg
It is alot easier for other majors to enter finance then the other way round,btohqsg
You can find engine sci computing majors etc in finance,btohqsg
just need to ace the physics mods more,btohqsg
Those are dominated by math/stats grads,btohqsg
Was today‚Äôs pure bio paper kept confidential or smth,btohqsg
How would anyone have today paper? Bring scanner in?,btohqsg
Some tutors take as priv candidates,btohqsg
They can scan it and send,btohqsg
iirc they only can do it for some papers,btohqsg
as not all papers can be brought out of exam hall,btohqsg
^ as in i believe where the scanned copy comes from is when the exam centre has excess ppr,btohqsg
most of the time just wait till next year TYS come out then see LOL,btohqsg
I think Thats also how schools have a copy,btohqsg
iirc by right all exam papers are classified and confidential,btohqsg
and not to be released to public domain,btohqsg
Thats y u dont see online copies of the tys,btohqsg
any scanned papers are all brought out and scanned later,btohqsg
cuz idt any teacher will risk their job over releasing o level papers,btohqsg
Hmm there‚Äôs gotta be some way since papers do come out from time to timee,btohqsg
Bruhh u see? I told u i had a sneak peak of the hist paper ytd,btohqsg
Anyone has the softcopy of pure bio paper?,btohqsg
considering seab decided to be funny,btohqsg
Does anyone have the soft copy of combined sci bio paper?,btohqsg
My maths teacher gave my class the 2019 o level paper 3 days after it was tested lol,btohqsg
all papers seem to be leaked,btohqsg
sekali next year you see all papers collected LOL,btohqsg
hello if o‚Äôlevel d7-f9  will it be in report card,btohqsg
F9 will not be. I went to check with others,btohqsg
What's this suppose to mean  was the paper hard?üòÇ,btohqsg
bellcurve gonna be gud for hist/ss,btohqsg
Imagine not having studied every topic in the syllabus,btohqsg
I tot food will come out,btohqsg
I did the tour operators one,btohqsg
Can u sneak into the bio one,btohqsg
Do u guys have the bio paper from tdy?,btohqsg
In case anyone taking O level POA tmr taken from my brother's email,btohqsg
Interesting that only two papers are affected,btohqsg
the last topic that is common,btohqsg
The last topic that is common,btohqsg
But not stated in the email leh,btohqsg
Ya combined chapter 18 not tested what,btohqsg
U see the ‚Äúcommon‚Äù here requires a context,btohqsg
Yes last chapt is not tested,btohqsg
Its highlighted in yellow i thibk,btohqsg
The last topic of The syllabus,btohqsg
common implying that it is shared,btohqsg
meaning the last topic of the syllabus of the same subject,btohqsg
Yo am i retarded or what,btohqsg
like me and you have the same subjects in common,btohqsg
Just asking  anyone got PDF file for bio combined?,btohqsg
The email is listing subjects that are supposed to have a choice of questions  but some of the questions got cancelled so no choice,btohqsg
All schools are required to teach a particular topic last,btohqsg
only one qn of mcq have no choice so just answer rest of qn,btohqsg
This is so much easier to und,btohqsg
Is frictionless a correct term in physics btw,btohqsg
Erm it is stated at the question,btohqsg
it j means no friction right,btohqsg
just note that friction is a contact force,btohqsg
Ya i think part c ur corrct since the height is same and it is frictionless,btohqsg
So same gpe n same kinetic energy,btohqsg
Im pretty sure steepness affects acceleration,btohqsg
Just say steeper so more acceleration?,btohqsg
I think both is as exciting,btohqsg
nvm i still think that Annie is right,btohqsg
theres less force balancing the weight,btohqsg
Cos you see mid point the steeper slope is lower,btohqsg
So more gpe has been lost at the middle,btohqsg
