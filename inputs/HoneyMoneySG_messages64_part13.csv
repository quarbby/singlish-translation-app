Is this the answer to my question?,btohqsg
Should work  you wait 2 days to see whether it will reflect,btohqsg
There is a way to see it under the account - details  butneed 1 - 2 days to update,btohqsg
Otherwise if wont work  no problem  you move the amount to another bank’s account  then you pay yourself with FAST  with Salary category and the description put PAYNOW SALA. I did it that way.,btohqsg
paynow uses FAST  should be ok as long as the purpose of payment is SALA - Salary Payment,btohqsg
Thanks for the response. I would update everyone which of the above scenarios count as 'Salary' under UOBOne :) :),btohqsg

Hi. May I ask  if I’m getting amaze card  what rewards card is the best to tag along with this amaze card?,btohqsg
Do we have to withdraw or sell the MMF than the coupon will appear in our account?,btohqsg
For me  I tag to  Citi Rewards. 4 miles per dollar for 1st 1000$,btohqsg
Depends on what is your spend.Amaze does not change mcc code.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/117752,btohqsg
Actually I’m currently using uob absolute. And sometimes if big purchases I’ll use my Citibank cashback+I think with amaze  and citi rewards  might be better than Citibank cashback+?,btohqsg
Looks like you are cashback person. Citi rewards is for mile chaser. Two different world.,btohqsg
Question: Whydo credit card companies charge us an annual fee when sometimes the rebates they provide are not even close to covering the annual fee? What's the point of having a credit card then?,btohqsg
So that you can spend things on credit.,btohqsg
I learn one thing is cashback got cap. Miles don't have. So depend on how big is your expenditure,btohqsg
higher miles/cashback rate has cap though cashback cap tend to be lower  lower miles/cashback rate no cap. Cashback card has more restriction on min spend and categorical cap.,btohqsg

Amaze+ citi rewards MC covers more than hsbc revo  just less travel MCCs,btohqsg

amaze+citi rewards can use for Kris+ for android phone users,btohqsg
only for the bonus categories like dining/groceries,btohqsg
so for miles chasers  best cards to go for? but not too many cards too. and plus able to pair with kris+,btohqsg
