it got a bit complicated bc someone else took the spot then they're like oh maybe we can take one hour from a prof that's helping,btohqsg

but then my faculty side is like no,btohqsg
ok context is the prof in charge of it at my faculty is kinda annoying,btohqsg
and a lot of times we feel he's just lazy to do things,btohqsg
