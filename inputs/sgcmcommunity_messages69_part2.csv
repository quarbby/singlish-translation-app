But there's other lots empty around,btohqsg
And it isn't a lot close to the lifts that it might be for someone older,btohqsg
At the end the pedestrian wins,btohqsg
Then just park other lots i guess. I mean... are you that hard up for a lot.,btohqsg
"They look stupid is enough alr. Going to ""fight""  end up both stupid",btohqsg
That's why give up after trying one time,btohqsg
The lot nice cause can protective park,btohqsg
People like that really no point. If they can stand around choping a lot  they can also stand around waiting for you to leave your car then come back and give you a nice key line across.,btohqsg

haha why u guys used the XC60 Inscription when it isnt offered in Singapore,btohqsg
The picture of the XC60 is in Inscription trim but SG only offers R-Design trim.,btohqsg
Vast difference in design styling although both are the highest trim,btohqsg
to add  R-Design trim is nicer imo🫣🫣,btohqsg
HMMMM  IMO I think the image in the article serves as a generic image to provide readers with an idea of how the car looks like in general. Hope that answers your question!😊-R,btohqsg
singapore allows removal of front car number plate?,btohqsg
any idea if i wanna shift my number plate on avante cn7  can i move it lower? to show my front grill,btohqsg
As long as you don't change the plate size  font  spacing  style etc.,btohqsg
But must be central and still visible,btohqsg
Like that i will also want to promo credit cards like Trust bank. They offer chance to win Tesla cars. 🤣,btohqsg
Unfortunately not. But you have our gratitude  I know it's not worth anything but you are always in the forefront of our minds for giveaways,btohqsg

Apparently putting text before the/reportdoesn't work,btohqsg
I’m waiting to see what he/she is going to type,btohqsg
But one look can tell  confirm spam,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the info! Have many ideas about car mods on my cn7,btohqsg
Wah so good. Each owner drove 1 000km on average only (assuming 06 owner count). Or <400km per year. What a miracle!!!!!! Must be spent most of its life in a barn ☺️,btohqsg
You get virtual hugs from Admin.,btohqsg
Unfortunately  i believe thats the wrong and scammy way to write the mileage :/,btohqsg
Can I get a new heart too.,btohqsg
Engine rebuilt but other parts of the car still receive wear and tear. Other drivetrain components still will have significant wear and tear,btohqsg
Do front tyre wear faster regardless of fwd or rwd?,btohqsg
if u get a new heart  automatically reset age,btohqsg
Why you ask me? I’m just a .. rickshaw puller ..,btohqsg
suspension and brakes componnents also will have wear and tear,btohqsg
cos... you listen to your passengers everyday... YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABT THIS CAR!!!,btohqsg
depends on ur suspension set up allignment etc,btohqsg
Yes. It comes with a new engine 😘,btohqsg
+- 10% i say its okay for rwd,btohqsg
but really depend on how u drive lor,btohqsg
Normal for front to wear more?,btohqsg
cos front does the steering and and take a heavier load during braking,btohqsg
if u dont go tiong ppl brake hard etc,btohqsg
Ah OK. That's what I guessed but then better ask than to fake know,btohqsg
Your tyre wear won't change la unless you're doing burnouts,btohqsg
