Anyone signed up NTUC Union Membership after having a Trust saving account ? I still do not have the 2.5% interest,btohqsg
NTUC Union membership usually need 2 months to process. I recall applying on 1 October and only getting the old NTUC-OCBC credit card in December. Also called up  gave cheque to FairPrice centre  and joined NTUC FairPrice as a co-op member. Too bad after a few months  NTUC card kena cancelled forcibly.,btohqsg
If your company is unionised  can sign up through them. Might be faster. Or ask your branch officials to help you check/expedite,btohqsg
Yes big and unionized company sign up tend to be faster. I am a GB/U@SME member so wait longer.Regarding Trust bankhttps://trustbank.sg/faqs/credit-card/#will-my-card-details-be-changed-once-my-digital-card-face-is-updated-in-the-trust-app,btohqsg

I am considering opening the High flyer too. I have a side hustle with its own UEN. And am invited for this card too. Haven‚Äôt hit the trigger and apply for it though.If your business spending genuinely cannot do 4 mpd  on spend  why not charge it on this card.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt attend your talk Chris due to outside Telegram commitments lol.Just wishing you a roaring success and much applause  much joy  in your panel sharing üëèüèª,btohqsg
Was browsing thru arca business activity I think I only can put this one *46100 WHOLESALE ON A FEE OR COMMISSION BASIS (EXCLUDING ONLINE MARKETPLACES)*...since I'm working with a company and 100% commission base,btohqsg
Overall I think is worth paying the annual fees for the highflyer points and free hotel stay if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
But I'm a grab & singtel users,btohqsg
Ic.. So just lucky to get invited?,btohqsg
AMEX Highflyer main benefit is 1.8mpd on Top-ups (if you know),btohqsg
Seems totally worth it - so many categories with red tapes on 4 mpd - great to have a very solid backup option of HighFlyer that give 1.8 mpd!,btohqsg
Wow! I don‚Äôt have many points on grab due to the recent nerf. What do you guys generally use grab/grab card for to earn points?,btohqsg
Very rarely lo  i only use it for Grab services lately with PayLater (to earn points)  then pay usin GrabPay (1.5% cashback with Amex TCB)I maxed out all my 4mpd cards already so technically this is the best route for me,btohqsg
This card izit good? I got business but never apply,btohqsg
Maybe buying qoo10 with grab sometime to get the qoo10 cashback. But only monthly once.,btohqsg
I've been using this  so far so good for those transactions that doesn't qualify for 4mpd. I love their app too each transaction is tagged with the miles gained. So much clearer and transparent than others that split up or unclear on each transaction. Haven't tried the free hotel stay tho. I got referral if you are interested  but not sure if got additional benefits tho.,btohqsg
I mainly use it to top up grab and when all other cards either maxed or don't qualify.,btohqsg
Disadvantage is it's in a separate highflyer account from krisflyer and yearly there's a cap of transfer over.,btohqsg
One of main reason! So tempting üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes that's the beauty of AMEX much more transparent compared to others,btohqsg
Yeah I'm confused this part... what's the difference between high flyer account & krisflyer account...,btohqsg
anyone know any free app to keep track of online & contactless payments for UOB EVOL / DBS live fresh card? Or just use excel to track?,btohqsg
Money manager is good for keeping track of expenses and cc spendings,btohqsg
it depends on your comfort level  theres a lot available of app store.personally i use YNAB  expensive but informative and good data charts if u are a visual person,btohqsg
Did anyone recently faced difficulty waving uob or otherbank cc annual fees  maybe this becoming a trend with the increasing interest rates somehow bank finding alt income sources,btohqsg
hi  i‚Äôve a upcoming expenditure of USD$800+ on MOOC (e.g coursera). Any credit card to recommend for good exchange rates and also cashback? Currently have UOB One and UOB absolute cashback.,btohqsg
I used Amex Ascend for such a spend. Maybank Barca Card and UOB Absolute Cashback are not bad options. There is no good MasterCard to use for education ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to take money out of YouTrip card?,btohqsg
hi gurus  which credit card is ideal to earn miles points for1.Car servicing2.Car parts and tyres,btohqsg
Anyone faced with double billing with CRMC + AMAZE. And AMAZE did the double claim instead of the merchant,btohqsg
UOB PPV or VS if can pay via contactless,btohqsg
