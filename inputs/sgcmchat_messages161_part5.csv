i mean the fact that they think it would be POPOPOPOP-ing,btohqsg
haha these are the type of people that think C&K is boring,btohqsg
they all aim at the exhaust for like 30secs,btohqsg
but there is genuinely nothing ear-pleasing about pops and bangs,btohqsg
only the burbles of a classic car  or a genuinely high-performance car make sense,btohqsg
okay la imo i do like the sounds it gives me like a sense of adrenaline and excitement ahh but running for it and disrupting others by revving is not a good idea,btohqsg
a very very light burble is fine,btohqsg
something like the stock M4 when it launched,btohqsg
but a gunshot pop and bang is just piss,btohqsg
adryean? you meana space d space r space y space e space a space n?,btohqsg
antilag is okay if it is being used for motorsport purposes,btohqsg
the F1 V6s have antilag. they sound absolutely amazing.same goes for rallycars,btohqsg
if there is PROPER ENGINEERING for those  it's very neat,btohqsg
but if it's a stupid flashtune,btohqsg
Honestly r35 is too overrated like when i see one i dont even care to shoot it,btohqsg
Fine i will do the rx7 one instead,btohqsg
not overrated la just more common compared to the others,btohqsg
cn i steal one of the posters,btohqsg
and hang it in my room,btohqsg
They actually just let u take it,btohqsg
But I asked the guy first,btohqsg
