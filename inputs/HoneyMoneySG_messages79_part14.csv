Just a small question on moomoo I do have to convert my sgd to usd to trade or buy right ? They donâ€™t do the exchange for me correct?,btohqsg
For me  yes. I have to change manuallyâ€¦ Last time I put SGD  increase my buying / margin power then when buy USD$1000 worth  end up my SGD cash remained unchanged and I incurred interest for â€˜loaningâ€™ that USD$1000. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You put SGD to increase the buying margin power. Then buy whatever you want  then see how much is your negative USD  then convert. Donâ€™t convert first because if got extra USD and want to convert back  you lose out the FX rates and fees.If you cover the negative within the same day  no interest owed.,btohqsg

Hi may I know which CC do accept payments to any professional services provider such as Amazon Web Service  Microsoft Azure and etc? The code will be MCC7399. Thanks!,btohqsg
Using Instarem amaze card overseas is supposed to give better rates than actually using your credit card directly right?,btohqsg
I like T Bills because you get the interest upfront via a discount. However  6 mths may be a turn off for some.Hence  i go with short term FDs with that which you can get either on Stashaway or Syfe.,btohqsg
My guess is the rates are comparative among the 3 instruments. My consideration will be the flexibility of taking out without loss of int,btohqsg
Amaze fx rate is baddd  like 2% more than normal. But the credit cardâ€™s 4mpd makes it worth it,btohqsg
Very bad rate indeed. Mine was 3.13% more. I compared against iChange. 3.13% difference,btohqsg
I just realized also!!â€‹ Isn't it better to use your 4mpd credit card directly?,btohqsg
Then there will be 3.25% foreign currency conversion fee,btohqsg
Which works out to be still better than Amaze rated,btohqsg
?? How is 3.25 better than 3.13,btohqsg
think it depends on the currency as well? jus went to taiwan  its about 2.1% spread. vs online rate.,btohqsg
Didn't say it was accurate  just quick ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Mind share Which currency was it?,btohqsg
Maybe I try to pay professional services provider using amaze then compare it with CC direct payment. Btw I am using Citi Premier Miles but I planning to sign up HSBC revolution as I can earn 10x points which equivalent to 4mpd or 2.5% Cashback.Will update u guys soon thanks!,btohqsg

If you withdraw before 14 Nov,btohqsg
Hi All I recently came across posts in Carousell selling Krisflyer miles for each 1K miles for SGD 20. Is this worth? And how do such people have millions of miles to sell?,btohqsg
Best case: you get your miles but it is against SIA T&C  could get you bannedWorst case: scam  you never receive the miles,btohqsg
u need to compare the cash rate versus getting redemption ticket through other miles via the nominee way (the miles seller) to see if getting miles from other is worth or not. usually ppl who dont have enough miles themselves buy miles for business class and above as it could be potential thousand of saving through buying from other via the nominee method ( which buyer redeem miles in their own account with you as their nominee) but like previous reply  there could be scam possiblities as well.,btohqsg
miles seller do through nominee way and it have always been the case. as for direct transfer method i guessing some bank dont required the miles transfer to be same as the bank account holder name to krisflyer account name.,btohqsg
people can use business to generate invoice and pay through personal card via card up/ipaymy for business expenses to gain million of miles and thus have so much to sell,btohqsg
Sure  but doesn't make it any less against the T&C  which was my main point :),btohqsg
t&c alot but who is going to enforce it is the question. if there is no enforcement  it is just white elephant,btohqsg
I just think it would be prudent for us to consider carefully before giving advice that that could lead someone to belittle the potential risks...we also can't say for sure whether there is heavy or light enforcement,btohqsg
it is up to individual decision to make for themselves  i sell extra miles myself as i am not using soon  as long as it is not against the law. just like how other can sell off the voucher they get from bank redemption. I am just telling the fact that what people is doing the current situation  unless people want to go complain to sia regarding this but who is going to check that every nominee is real related to the account holder or it is sold,btohqsg
Never said it was against the law :) If it were  this would be a much shorter conversation hahaAnd we can't compare it against cash vouchers like NTUC  those are very different and I hope you can see why and you were just using it as a random example.,btohqsg
Alot of stuff share here are often against t&c and are loophole  so if some cant accept it then i guess oh well.,btohqsg
for OCBC 360 save bonus points  is it also count using MAB like UOB one? which mean I can have 150K for 15 days and 50K for 15 days (assume a month with 30 days) + $501 extra on 1st?,btohqsg
Personally I view loopholes as a separate category  as those are about keeping within the letter of the T&C but not necessarily the spirit. If you're going against both the letter and the spirit (like this miles purchase example) then that's a completely different category,btohqsg
