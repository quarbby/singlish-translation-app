Hi Gurus! :) A fresh grad here who started on her corporate journey and am looking to apply for a suitable credit card & savings account!Considering between the UOB Evol card with the UOB One Account or OCBC 365 card with the OCBC 360 Account!!Understand Chris just released a video about the saving accounts yst (which what perfect timing  thank you :) but not sure if it is applicable given that my savings are under $100K!!My lifestyle is rather simple in terms of just daily expenses (transportation  food  groceries every once in a while etc.) Would love to hear yall fellow experts advice on this :) Thank you in advance everyone üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Under 100k saving  I think ocbc 360 offers better value. It has its quirks (save category rep increasing 500 a month) but all flexible on cc spend. Later on  you can explore cc offers from other banks without losing too much of interests.,btohqsg
if can't hit 800 min spending  better to get ocbc infinity and not ocbc 365,btohqsg
ocbc 360 is 3.8% if u hit salary   save 500$ every month based on MAB and spend $500 on selected credit card.Uob is just 3% on Spending min. S$500 on eligible UOB Card AND credit your salary via GIROI would go for the ocbc.And also UOB evol just got nerfed  so it's not that good anymore,btohqsg
hi everyone  if planning to apply maybank credit card  just for the 180 e capita voucher so not planning use more than $500  any negative to going for the barcelona visa card or is there better card? my thinking is jus get the 1.6% cashback for the 500 spent and the 180 e capita voucher,btohqsg
can i ask for the ocbc account  you just have to create an account  credit salary and save $500 before the month ends and u will get the interest rate?,btohqsg
OOOO will certainly research into this :) Thank you SK! :) Understand as well that OCBC 365 excludes cashback from xnap qr from hawker centers! Is it the same for OCBC infinity?& thank you@antonio191203& Wz for the breakdown! Really insightful and easy to make the comparison :),btohqsg
"based on the website  yes salary   save and spend. There's more criteria if you want more interest  but not ""worth""https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account",btohqsg
i think xnap is not working for awhile already  don't think its working,btohqsg
Ocbc infinity doesn't exclude 5814 (which is used by xnap). But ya xnap is dead for the time being.,btohqsg
5814 is mcc for fast food restaurant. so check mcc first in heymax,btohqsg
Hello! I am relatively fresh grad too (2 years back) but I chose OCBC 365 cc + 360 savings account because of the following reasons:1. OCBC 360 3.2% interest is higher if u don‚Äôt spend $500 a month.2. OCBC 365 cc has some quirks: yes it accepts transport (simplygo + grab all these)  dining (note that fast food restaurants and pseudo fast food codes like Fairprice app do not count!)  bill payments (recurring only  not manual payment)  Watsons and groceries + some streaming services. No shopping for cashback ya!365 used to be better when the dining and pharmacies are catch all. But am alright with it still cos I took over bill payments and groceries for my fam  can clear the $800 min spend consistently. Plus dining 5% cashback is not too bad too. (While Citibank cashback is 8%  it has a high $800 min spend as well and don‚Äôt have a complementary savings account). But do consider if u can get hit this min spend so as to max cashback + max interest. OCBC more appealing also now that UOB‚Äôs cc options are in shambles lol.If you don‚Äôt clear $800  choose OCBC infinity instead.3. Complementary CC options: to fulfil those spend which don‚Äôt get cashback on 365  I use CRMC + Amaze (for fast food and shopping etc) and DBS WWMC for travel spend up to 1.5k (eg. airline bookings and Klook)Hope these helps!,btohqsg
Omg!! Wow this is more than I could ask for :DDD Thank you for taking the time to type it all out L!! :) Really comprehensive!,btohqsg
Oops‚Ä¶ clearly still have a lot to learn ü§≠ but thank you everyone :))),btohqsg

Hi  may I check if anyone tried to giro their insurance and tax payments with HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
I was reading up the t&c and called HSBC twice. They gave different answers. One says that there will be a 1% cashback and the other says it's not entitled.,btohqsg
Income tax payment yes. Didn't try insurance myself but should get 1% too.,btohqsg
