Hi qns regarding HeyMax Earn 50 Miles/day fr Bus/MRT; If i‚Äôm an existing-to-bank credit card holder and I apply for another different new credit card to the same bank  I don‚Äôt qualify for the bulk of welcome bonus miles from Singsaver. But in that case  am I still eligible for bonus 50 Max Miles/day redemption on Bus/MRT rides?,btohqsg

Hi all  I planned to apply this card for my spending on shopee.. which card would be better? Currently   I have uob one card,btohqsg
Generally won‚Äôt  though I have seen certain promos which exclude employees from participation (maybe to avoid insider perception). In any case  it is usually clearly stated in the T&Cs.,btohqsg
I know Citi Prestige gives PP + 1 guest,btohqsg
If there is conflict of interest of coz staff will be excluded. Which is why i stated before using own company product have no conflict of interest,btohqsg
This is a promotion and not base product. Promotion can exclude staff participation if they think there is potential conflict of interest. What is individual bank consideration is not known to us also. Just like mall employee cant paricipate in their own mall promotion also,btohqsg
This is salary credit promo and does not the DBS Multiplier account itself lol.,btohqsg
Not keen to argue further. But my point is rather than assume employees won‚Äôt be excluded  be it base product or promotions  it‚Äôs safest just to refer to the actual T&C.Will just leave it at that.,btohqsg
If u see most tnc  it is promotion campaign that usually exclude staff and not the usual base product. Some promotion even exclude family of staff as there could be conflict of interest. My key word is conflict of interest.,btohqsg
I have Citibank cards already but not prestige card. Am I eligible for the sign-up bonus if I sign up for prestige card?,btohqsg
