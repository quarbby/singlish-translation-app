Is it even possible to get into the international trade industry in Singapore?,btohqsg
in what aspect (of the trade industry)? generally speaking or do you have a clear idea of what you're trying to ask because there are A LOT of industries that have connections to trade  it just depends on how one perceives the importance of itin fact  i think there are all sorts of local companies doing international trade-- their success or profitability is another thing,btohqsg
I'm not too sure of the specific area  I'm looking more in the general area. So this is my line of consideration:- I'm trilingual and getting towards a working knowledge of a fourth language (albeit with a thick accent)  and I'd like to make use of that skill. My language combo is English  Chinese  Japanese + Vietnamese with a strong accent- I'd like to be able to travel often for work  if possible. It's nice to have  but not really a must.,btohqsg
