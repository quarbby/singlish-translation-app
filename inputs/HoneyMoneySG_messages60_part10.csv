$3000 cap doesn't mean you need to spend $3000 per month.,btohqsg
So cap at 3k per month. So after 3k. How many mile per dollar?,btohqsg
0.4 mpd. Google is your friend,btohqsg
So does that mean if I spend 6k to 10k on airticket and travel booking hotel etc. I am better off with krisflyer no cap?,btohqsg
Yes but only for those months where u hit such spend. That‚Äôs why it has specific use cases but likely not for every month (unless u spend 6k on travel each month). Note that the 3mpd on sia kf card is applicable for sia group flights (in the context of air tickets),btohqsg
