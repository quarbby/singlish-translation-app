But too late to turn back ah....,btohqsg
Legit wanna go fuck this shit tho,btohqsg
ig u need to js get the hang of the new shit coming in,btohqsg
Probs take a little break and I'll be fine,btohqsg
But at least I settle my econs shit before lect on Thurs,btohqsg
Do yall actly do pre read,btohqsg
no matter whatever u are studying,btohqsg
I legit can kiss gaming goodbye eh atp,btohqsg
but then again if u know how to balance ur time ah,btohqsg
Thinking only 1hr on sat every other week,btohqsg
tbf i don‚Äôt do work on thurs and saturday,btohqsg
fuck valentine‚Äôs dayall my homies hate the commoditisation of love,btohqsg
Hello does anyone know how the application for PSC scholarship work? And what they generally look out for?,btohqsg
they generally look for Singaporeans who want to serve the country.To learn how to ace the interviews  watch how the ministers talk when they win the elections and learn from there,btohqsg
sorry my 2 years is enuf alr,btohqsg
I skipped most of the additional content sia HAHA,btohqsg
"He still can ""haha"" the top comment",btohqsg
He go poly take sci course equally die,btohqsg
He thinks poly sci is easier than H2 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good fking luck.,btohqsg
I was from comb sci without amath as well  definitely didn't die learning h2 chem.,btohqsg
probs just the stigma surrounding poly,btohqsg
Good I want to see him jump and die,btohqsg
Maybe the learning style not for him. Its good that he switch early rather than too late,btohqsg
it was in my face eh,btohqsg
im p sure i rolled my eyes at a couple atp,btohqsg
i cannot it was so EXCESSIVE HELLO,btohqsg
how come more ppl wanna go poly nowadays,btohqsg
i also know a shit ton of poly kids who dont intend to pursue degree,btohqsg
like ig more people are seeing poly as a legitimate path,btohqsg
but for the most part  uni is still q essential in sg for long term,btohqsg
how so in career prospects bruv,btohqsg
the appeal of being able to do smth they enjoy at a pre uni level can't be understated,btohqsg
and being able to work in that field right after,btohqsg
the issue is i find a lot of those people thinking they can make up for the lack of degree with purely experience,btohqsg
which is only half true and depends on what area they go into,btohqsg
alot of the poly kids ik call degree a ‚Äúpiece of paper‚Äù,btohqsg
got someone tell me that he doesnt like studying for a ‚Äúpiece of paper‚Äù he even dropped out of poly,btohqsg
yea  but a piece of paper that by itself gets you through some employer's initial screenings,btohqsg
esp if go govt job hor,btohqsg
nowadays ppl dont see the importance of education,btohqsg
like there's a reason why a lot of older people go back for their degree eventually,btohqsg
i think the enticing part is being able to work and earn money earlier  build experience,btohqsg
but they don't see the eventual cap on positions they can take,btohqsg
just cos of the lack of a degree,btohqsg
(disclaimer: not all industries but yes),btohqsg
I think depends more on the class & cse,btohqsg
mayhaps uh but kinda sad ngl,btohqsg
For me I really found no point in studying sec school style in JC,btohqsg
The best way is to score well in poly  go to work get some moolah  then go back study full-time degree,btohqsg
You will be a degree grad with probably 2 years experience immediately upon convo  which is a much higher standing than your peers.,btohqsg
It is true that I don't use much of the degree  so it's literally just a paper for me now,btohqsg
Highly likely I know how to maintain and use my equipment better than the profs..,btohqsg
Both pathways have their own risks. A bad A level cert that is unable to enter uni is useless for work  while a diploma is sufficient even if the GPA is stellar. This kind of case usually DAE to poly or retake As.As for diploma  might be harder to enter uni  sometimes even with good GPA.,btohqsg
at the end of the day  just make sure you know the kind of path you wanna take,btohqsg
but like now there's quite a few more IP schools  so those are kinda pigeon holed from the start into the A level system,btohqsg
I mean when you‚Äôre sold an idea through TikTok etc that you can become an entrepreneur or influencer easily then you‚Äôll start to think ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of education‚Äù lol,btohqsg
influence of social media type beat,btohqsg
But of course at the end of the day it‚Äôs not that easy in life ah and not everyone can become influencers and entrepreneurs; in fact it‚Äôs only a small number that can earn any money from it  and much less a lot of money and become rich,btohqsg
I think ironically its coz ppl dk how good it can get,btohqsg
The feeling of the world being your oyster,btohqsg
or the yolo tiktok life got into their head,btohqsg
alot of ppl in sg js be resting on their laurels,btohqsg
take things for granted in a sense,btohqsg
so they end up not looking ahead,btohqsg
which can be quite saddenjng ngl,btohqsg
Sg alr q good compared to alot of other places,btohqsg
I feel u need to get a taste,btohqsg
its like we reach first class nation so fast,btohqsg
now other countries gon catch up to us,btohqsg
we rest somemore later other countries become better than us,btohqsg
Before u decide to work 2wards it,btohqsg
But ironically to get a taste of it u are alr there,btohqsg
Ya but who will be willing to give u a tester of the high life,btohqsg
Internship i feel u more than likely only get to experience the bad,btohqsg
And also if u can secure a internship of that calibre u more than likely alr know what to do,btohqsg
u experience the bad then uk whether or not u wanna tahan the bad,btohqsg
But u dont get the good so its hard for u to weigh,btohqsg
Weak mental is unfortunately too common,btohqsg
Tendencies to have too much self pity,btohqsg
And no confidence in ur own ability,btohqsg
but snorlax gon kill me for saying tt,btohqsg
But I need to push on ik la,btohqsg
cuz i got 98 for my proj,btohqsg
Cuz I feel like it's the btr opt for me,btohqsg
Honestly i hate the chinese mentality of humility,btohqsg
I thinking probs need time to adapt to this whole lect and tutorial thing,btohqsg
If its by ur own merit just show it off,btohqsg
mine was i was actually panicking,btohqsg
cuz i didnt know if my proj was ok,btohqsg
Ya won't lie hard to feel proud of my work cuz of it,btohqsg
more often than not it leads to imposter syndrome lol,btohqsg
Showing off its for you to convince urself also,btohqsg
my mentee in RI also feeling it,btohqsg
and alr questioning how she even got in,btohqsg
I questioning my general ability la,btohqsg
I realised my logic made no bloody sense,btohqsg
hers is cos their math class got preliminary quizzes,btohqsg
Sure I'm in TM but fucking up Os doesn't mean I'll fuck up As what,btohqsg
Right or am I delulu alrd,btohqsg
as you go up higher in your subjects  your understanding needs to be more and more sound,btohqsg
in sec sch a lot of times you can tbh hand wave your way through,btohqsg
U need to reflect did u actually fck up Os or was it the actual limit of ur ability,btohqsg
If u fcked up then do wtv u hv been doin just make sure u dun fck up,btohqsg
nvm in 2 days Bedok can be your inspiration,btohqsg
But if u did ur best then think how u can improve faster,btohqsg
Its not my problem if u j worse than me,btohqsg
And if you have potential to catch up u wont be bitchin abt me hving no humility but seeing what u can learn frm more successful ppl,btohqsg
teach me how to not have imposter syndrome,btohqsg
jk i kinda just turned imposter syndrome into a form of motivation,btohqsg

Why my friends received enrollment package so fast but I haven't yet( ‚öàÃ•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•ÃÅ‚å¢‚öàÃ•Ã•Ã•Ã•Ã•ÃÄ),btohqsg
Does anyone know the end of enrollment for TP,btohqsg
They received their enrollment package like 2 days ago,btohqsg
are you going to TP to study,btohqsg
then you should ask the school,btohqsg
should I take up sports cca in jc ?,btohqsg
im scared that it may affect my studies if i take up a sport cca but i feel like i will regret not taking it,btohqsg
usually Im averaging A1 to A2 in sec school,btohqsg
after going for basketball trials the coach in eunoia wants me to join the team,btohqsg
As long as u pass ur exams ur A lvls wld be nubbad,btohqsg

What is a example of a future proof course ah,btohqsg
infact the sch will suspend u from cca if legit u cmi,btohqsg
should be those related to tech right,btohqsg
like now theres a huge layoff in tech,btohqsg
they will make you drop cca,btohqsg
Nth is truly future proof ah,btohqsg
I don't believe that there's any course that's future proof,btohqsg
omg this is so scary how yk sia HAHAHHA,btohqsg
JC in TM is basically compulsory üíÄ,btohqsg
i wld say those which cannot be replaced by tech is more likely,btohqsg
I got rejected by ny btw HAHAHA,btohqsg
But is still likely not confirmed,btohqsg
I wanna join like floristry and like uhhh people telling me it‚Äôs not future proof,btohqsg
Ur life la do what u like,btohqsg
Anyw floristry is imo smth that needs a human touch,btohqsg

Enjoy ur civil life while u can,btohqsg
But keep in mind portfolio isn‚Äôt 10 part time jobs worked  gotta be relevant & impressive for the industry you aim to get to thru the course,btohqsg
You can DSA to pretty much any sch in SG  MOE implemented many changes in 2018 for that,btohqsg
The term may be different for different institutes but the process is still the same; send portfolio  writeup & get an interview,btohqsg
Schools also can ignore your portfolio if you can prove your aptitude & passion in other ways,btohqsg
Speaking of which  florist shop yesterday one year once good business,btohqsg
