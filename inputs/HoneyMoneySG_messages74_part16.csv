Standard Chartered Credit Card Sign-Up Promotion Terms and Conditions - Standard Chartered Singaporehttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/credit-card-sign-up-promotion/,btohqsg
Clause 5a. Not too sure if this cap applies if you apply through singsaver.,btohqsg
Seem like more of a reward cap then the numbe of time u can ntb,btohqsg
Oooo yea  I read that part too and didn‚Äôt think it applies as a cap on rewards since my NTB reward was an item from Singsaver (falls under 5b. so there is no cap actly).This is opposed to a reward directly from the bank which is usually in the form of cashback on the next statement month  in which case clause 5a. would apply as a cashback capIn essence  seems like there is no cap on NTB for SCB tho if you don‚Äôt get the direct cashback reward from SCB. Thank u for the thoughts ^^ :),btohqsg

Hello  does anyone know if there will be any admin fees and charges if I use my UOB evol card in Australia?Is this recommended?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
3.25% fee. But you're getting 8% cashback (6.67% effective cashback) from the card,btohqsg
For online and mobile contactless payment only.,btohqsg
I am sure in australia can use mobile contactless as they start paywave earlier then sg,btohqsg
But evol need to fulfill 600 minimum spending,btohqsg
3.25% fx fees and visa exchange rateNote that u get 8% for only $250 on mobile contactless  $250 for online  can do local spend for the remaining $100 needed to meet $600 monthly spend,btohqsg
Hmm everyone plays this game la  don‚Äôt think banks will mind :),btohqsg

Hi I used DBS Altitude for a transaction(12 months EMI) under this promotion(https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/promotion/tc1021mustafa)would I get miles for it?,btohqsg
Since there was a promotion I thought I should use it  never realise I might not earn any miles for it. -_-Appreciate if anyone is aware of this!,btohqsg
instalment payment plan excluded as per TnC,btohqsg
Hi pros... anybody know what is the max limit for spendings in DBS alitude card?,btohqsg
no max limit  only restriction is your own credit limit but you can top up to increase it or request increase in credit limit,btohqsg
I mean as in terms if earning miles,btohqsg
it is a general spending card  u can spend 3m on it and earn 1.2m per dollar still,btohqsg
I see... maybe can use for hse reno usage... thanks,btohqsg
depend if your contracter take cc payment,btohqsg
