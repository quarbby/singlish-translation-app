it's testing basic english ability  not like o/a levels,btohqsg
😂😂😂 true though   ultimately even if they pass through cheating  they don't understand what the lecturer is teaching in university,btohqsg
some of them may not show up to lectures tho,btohqsg
and then end up like translating also,btohqsg
if you have to cheat in toefl  you probably won't even understand the final exam,btohqsg
for one of the spms math mods,btohqsg
i think was like discrete math,btohqsg
the effort required to deepfake and stuff just for it is better off actually prepping for toefl,btohqsg
the prof allow the students to bring a dictionary,btohqsg
so like it is an add on to the cheatsheet,btohqsg
SG will deem it as unauthorised material,btohqsg
honestly when he said that we were shocked,btohqsg
english reading/speaking/listening/writing test for western universities because they still think people in singapore cannot speak english,btohqsg
the best part is it's completely inconsistent,btohqsg
some unis in the states recognise sg  some don't,btohqsg
standardized english testing is all over the fking place like the UK and commonwealth countries use IELTS  which is run by British Council,btohqsg
when I did my IELTS I saw a lot of white kids who clearly did their entire education in singapore but because singapore is in china or whatever  they have to prove that they can speak english,btohqsg
yeah i took the IELTS when applying for my phd  and i remember having a similar experience,btohqsg
when I applied for australia  they accepted my A Levels as proof that I can speak english and I think they generally accepted proof that your education was conducted mostly in english,btohqsg
i did chat with the person giving me my speaking test  and even she agreed it's pretty dumb that singaporeans need to take it,btohqsg
Lmao HK is worse cuz China the IELTS cost more a lot cross the border and do it in HK instead,btohqsg
But now they close it i think only HK residents can do IELTS in HK,btohqsg
Maybe the British Council should mandate that,btohqsg

Rp still can go local uni..but need to work double hard,btohqsg
Cause RP is more of presentation and report writing..follow usa style,btohqsg
One thing I dislike about coding is to debugging,btohqsg
I am sure programmers know this uh   one single error and you potentially have to search for thousands of lines of code just to find what actually went wrong,btohqsg
Ah yes. The ptsd of every science major's coding lesson 😭,btohqsg
My lecturer told me way back in 1990s coding is even worse than that 😂😂😂,btohqsg
They have to code the interface and everything manually...,btohqsg
does anybody know how to draw boolean circuits,btohqsg
"I want to ask everyone here for comments here as you all know I am still in process of ""upgrading"" stats materials by studying jc stuff and gc functionality on emulator",btohqsg
But I not sure if my pure math material needed similar upgrades ? I checked my h2 mathematics book none of the topic I written so far needed gc functionality?,btohqsg
