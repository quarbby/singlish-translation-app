Not head down  they should inform you via email / HDB portal to submit income documents,btohqsg
You can write in / call HDB if you wish to clarify specifics about this,btohqsg
Understood! Thank you for your helpü§ó,btohqsg
Sorry for disturbing  may I know what kind of form B they require? I submitted the right hand side form  they said not this one. Headache ü§ï,btohqsg
Hi all  please note that the dyson hairdryer is a scam.,btohqsg
Yes  it is  so frustrating it keeps popping up here. Basically the person will probably ask u for a deposit to chope it.,btohqsg
Ya. This is just the acknowledgement page. Is form b1 that see employment amount breakdown or trade income for self employed,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if key collection has started for Champions Green bto?,btohqsg

Bayshore very interesting bto. Likely to be plus model,btohqsg

May I know how to renewal the HFE? As my HFE expiring on 25 June 2024.,btohqsg
One month before expiry will have renew option available on the same page as where the HFE are,btohqsg
I‚Äôve heard a few couples who need to forfeit their application due to not enough loan and there would not be any reassessment during key collection. This is based on HFE not HLE. Is it true?,btohqsg
I mean like from what I know last time is we can reassess the loan again upon the key collection,btohqsg
Some say can appeal but some say cannot,btohqsg
Hmm I see.. I just feel it‚Äôs unfair when couples are trying to plan to have a house on their own in the future but ended up being forfeited cause not enough loan now but having enough in the future,btohqsg
As i remember  u can always appeal to reassess.. the loan amount maybe reduced  but will not increase..,btohqsg
Hi future neighbors  putting here to share about HFE loan reassessment. HDB came to my school for a talk last week. Along with a staff  the CEO held a q&a.The staff clarified during the q&a that yes  there will be a review for loan assessment but it isnotfor higher loan amount. Is is only for lower amount  do not expect loan revision to be higher if it is reassessed. Their official stance is to make up the shortfall (if any) with cash or change to bank loan. The CEO then said that this is partly to close the loophole of high grant + high loan.(Edit: there also will not be an option to forgo the grant to get higher loan )I don‚Äôt have black and white  but that‚Äôs what was being said during the talk. I guess since he‚Äôs the highest ranking exec  this should be firm until further notice üòÖ,btohqsg
Its not easy for hdb to forfeited your bto. They will surely do what ever neccesary to secure u the bto. And give u the necessary alternative finance option like bank loan. For a higher hdb loan probably one need to go through an appeal process. Or else it will end up as balance flat which cause more work for them.,btohqsg
Sales of balance telegram group chat just disappear?,btohqsg
They can switch to bank loan or appeal to reassess or cough up the shortfall or cover it with their CPFOA or just not take such an expensive flat (certain ppl whack high floor thinking that they can afford when key collection comes)  but now HFE tells you upfront your loan amount by HDB so should plan with that in mind‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes. I agree. Always act based on current budget. Not future budget. Some people i know they whack on 5room. When they can only afford 3 room. Thinking in future they can get better salary or more cash in oa cpf,btohqsg
It changed to private group I can't access,btohqsg
What did u do over there,btohqsg
U don't need group to buy bto or sbf,btohqsg
Everything  can find through  Google or hdb website,btohqsg
Ya less group to answer questions also,btohqsg
Not all the answer are 100% true,btohqsg
Still have  but they banned for 10 minutes cause the bot thought that you were spamming. So sorry!! But really thank you too for the information üôèüèº,btohqsg
Well the more opinions/experience people share  the more information/knowledge we get.,btohqsg
To be honest if you do enough research  you don't need the chat to gain the knowledge,btohqsg
Now adays so much YouTube and website and information,btohqsg
Just how hard working u are to search for the information,btohqsg
If really kena ban nvm lor,btohqsg
Okay lah if like that don‚Äôt need to study so hard for a degree already  just get a degree off YouTube and google. üòÇ,btohqsg
Jialat I talk about telegram chat not degree leh üòÖ,btohqsg
I am just sharingIf u kena banNvm one u still got other resources,btohqsg
So from your pov all telegram chat knowledge  super legit,btohqsg
I like your attitude supporting telegram  group chat,btohqsg
