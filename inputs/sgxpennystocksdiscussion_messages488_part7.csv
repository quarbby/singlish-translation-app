Updates on Moya Asia.Last year results came 3rd Aug 20. (During the lunch break.)On that day 3rd Aug 2020   price opened $0.058  ran to $0.073 and closed $0.072.Recently Moya Asia did another failed break out before flushing out contra players again.This time round  I reckon the catalyst to break out should be the profitable results which should be announce no later than 14th Aug 21. If they follow last year 3rd Aug 20  it would be next Tuesday.PS: Did you know that the majority owner of Moya (more than 73%) is by Anthoni Salim of the Billionaire Salim group. His costs in this investment is about $0.07x if I got it correct.,btohqsg
Cannot get next week then buy also not too late,btohqsg
