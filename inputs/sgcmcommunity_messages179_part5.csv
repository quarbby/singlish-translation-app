Hello everyone  anyone has experience with driving a 2021 Hyundai Avante? Can share review and experience please (not pointing to websites). Thanks much ðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
Parts easy n cheap to get,btohqsg
Thks so much. Good to know.,btohqsg
Same with all the other bread and butter korean/japanese sedans lol,btohqsg
Just get a Mazda instead la...,btohqsg
The only worry is pray it wasnt a PHV car w tempered mileage,btohqsg
There's always that risk with any car you buy,btohqsg
Anyway if is a AD unit can check with TEK for servicing records,btohqsg
Same as avante can ask komoco for servicing records. If the dealer don't wanna provide then walk away,btohqsg
Thanks for all the advice. Just looking for a bread/butter car to travel between point A to B. Any Avante drivers out there who can share more about the experience?,btohqsg
i have been looking at roads and don't really notice Avantes,btohqsg
Curious  is the avante better now compared to the 09-14 avante?,btohqsg
I know the old avante engine sucks,btohqsg
So many on the road bro,btohqsg
Its a very nice car to drive as expected from the series.,btohqsg
Elantra AD and MD was a big improvement,btohqsg
