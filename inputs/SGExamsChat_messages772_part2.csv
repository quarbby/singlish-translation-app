i’m seeing a few that i nvr see before,btohqsg
"But they cant remove the ""acoustic"" in me",btohqsg
yea but it’s actually the same as the graduate mod,btohqsg
yea same thing tho just that instead of taking a diff exam etc you just do the same stuff,btohqsg
i kinda wanna be a TA for one of the mods next sem,btohqsg
btw if you wanna do research  i recommend taking mods that apply your foundation concepts more,btohqsg
bc truthfully like example QM II is very conceptual but you don’t get to apply it to real systems really,btohqsg
christophos brought ppl on a sch trip to his lab.,btohqsg
i never went uh but yea,btohqsg
no i mean like conceptual wise it’s cool to know QM and the math but even theory work wise you’re not really using it to understand systems physically,btohqsg

i'm actl dead for my WA next monday,btohqsg

even tho technically our fm wa is still h2 math,btohqsg
you guys haven't touched the fmath topics yet?,btohqsg
technically relationship between 3 planes is fm,btohqsg
but it's just like that only,btohqsg
the actual fm topic is recurrence relations then we starting that next week,btohqsg
Bruh chat gpt can't help me with a double nested if loop,btohqsg
chatgpt is pretty rudimentary in the code it can properly help with,btohqsg
the more complex you want it to be  the more you gotta break it down to basic parts and stitch them together with your own knowledge,btohqsg
chatgpt only provides you with the knowledge from the internet,btohqsg
so you’re better off searching on google,btohqsg
chatgpt’s niche is in essays and etc,btohqsg
Ye usually i will just ask to solve bugs  if u copy paste the whole qns onto chatgpt  sometimes u get weird things that is not even taught so like it is p obvious to the chers u chatgpt-ed it,btohqsg
U need to feed it w more specific prompts if u want ur code to turn out a certain way,btohqsg
I legit wanna say smth so mean but must resist because im cultured,btohqsg
yeah stack overflow also very useful,btohqsg

Well there is still the weekend + the rest of tdy  so u are not dead yet,btohqsg
Oh I realised why cause the data I want it to loop is null 💀,btohqsg
mr lim better not set some bs,btohqsg
I dun even think he will set the math paper unless he got promoted to sth now (?),btohqsg
My time he didnt even give lecture,btohqsg
i rmb for my amath prelim none of the sec 4 teachers set iy,btohqsg
he gave like 1 lecture as we starting lesson,btohqsg
For math or f math? F math should be just tutorial?,btohqsg
but he made us go for one h2 math lecture,btohqsg
Wah but how did u find out who set it,btohqsg
I was scrolling my ig archives and found sth funny  last time after each bad paper  i will post and pray for the next paper to be nice,btohqsg
