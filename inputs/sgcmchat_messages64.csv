I think he prefers to be anonymous,btohqsg
js tell him i said clean blobeye,btohqsg
Peoples privacy i hope u understand üòÖ,btohqsg
sg viral chat also u in,btohqsg
I now is doing car photographs,btohqsg
u use camera  or fon cam,btohqsg
damn how much was it u got em,btohqsg
Cus i was in a budget,btohqsg
no i dont do photography much...just not into it ah,btohqsg
have fon camera s20 can ah,btohqsg
jus picked up a new lens,btohqsg
Canon EF-S 55-250mm F4-5.6 IS II,btohqsg
This one not using lens filter ah?,btohqsg
yeah i just picked it up and took some shots in the car,btohqsg
Lai lai lai.. $200 000 BMW..,btohqsg
Interesting how the guy's trying to push it up though cause brand new the bike is 140k,btohqsg
Might as well buy from bmw,btohqsg
I think previously the guy put 200 000,btohqsg
Check out 'BMW M1000RR'  available at S$500 000 on#Carousell:https://carousell.com/p/1209083838,btohqsg
"He say it is ""THE ONE & ONLY M1000RR""Uhmm yeah.. this is the same thing with those Hello Kitty Sanrio Mahjong kits. Buy cheap sell high macam nak MATI.",btohqsg
If truly bmw oni allocated 1 to sg,btohqsg
140k for a bike is alr crazy Sia,btohqsg
Actually this one is not limited as such,btohqsg
No lah idiot  from the Carouseller,btohqsg
It is possible that only one person ordered to reg for road use,btohqsg
Because if you don't reg for road,btohqsg
Don't need to pay a lot of taxes,btohqsg
But damn 140k for a bike,btohqsg
And this is a bike people want for the track,btohqsg
I love bikes but not that much,btohqsg
this guy got problem one legit,btohqsg
panigale v4 in sg is not even 200k,btohqsg
This was what they stated from BMW,btohqsg
My Vespa can go to the track,btohqsg
Yea my bike cost me 100k,btohqsg
Cause v4 is equivalent to the s1000r,btohqsg
They will laugh and die on the spot,btohqsg
Superleggera v4r goes for 289k in Singapore,btohqsg
yeah this was what i last saw,btohqsg
this shad guy gotta watch his mouth bruh,btohqsg
Tell the fella car price in SG,btohqsg
A high spec Cayenne S in California,btohqsg
Give no attention only when they rude to you,btohqsg
Pricing of Ducati from 2021  said to have their COE capped at 5k,btohqsg
Anyway  recently some of their models are off the showroom floor. Such as Scrambler and their Supersport,btohqsg
Left would be Panigale  streetfighter  monster and multistrada,btohqsg
Then pay 1k for stealth option,btohqsg
Not sure if they have that from the dealership.. but I did remember that they had a huge promo back in NDP 2022 for all red Ducatis,btohqsg
Passion for our Nation!On our 57th National Day  enjoy celebratory $5 700 off when you book a Red or White Ducati. Enjoy complimentary COE  2-year servicing and 4-years warranty. Come visit our showroom now to experience the Red Passion.Terms and conditions apply.#Ducati#DucatiSingapore#RedPassion,btohqsg
Should be hitting our roads soon I think still in LTA/nea homologation,btohqsg
But would sound worse than before..,btohqsg
On the plus side  CBR650R coming to SG with the 650 Inline 4,btohqsg
Usually Ducati prices for the colours extra  your scrambler also you see the different colours all different price,btohqsg
In early videos sounds the same tbh,btohqsg
But would have to hear it in person,btohqsg
Also different specs for the older scramblers cus got urban scrambler and some other variant with road tyres,btohqsg
The desert sled and the regular 1100 you mean?,btohqsg
Yeah. I forgot the specific names,btohqsg
Cause the colour schemes also got names,btohqsg
Some colour schemes got other different things also,btohqsg
But in my fucked up opinion  I'd rather opt for other options than panigale for more comfort.,btohqsg
The r1 and the panigale not as comfortable in terms of riding posture,btohqsg
R1250RT  R1250GSA  Street Glide Special  Goldwing DCT,btohqsg
But I heard 3rd Gen Busa pretty comfortable,btohqsg
More of a sports tourer anyway,btohqsg
But you compare in the supersport category,btohqsg
The s1000rr one of the most comfortable ones,btohqsg
If you tune and put extended swingarm,btohqsg
H2SX also cannot compare cus more for straight line drag speed,btohqsg
But the closest direct competitor to the busa,btohqsg
Also got ninja 1000 which is positioned slightly lower end,btohqsg
But Busa also got one company making 300++hp for it,btohqsg
But also a great sports tourer,btohqsg
3rd gen got the electronics to support also,btohqsg
But a lot of busa lovers,btohqsg
Cause they're too used to the 2nd gen and how raw it was,btohqsg
But this TTS Superbusa 380hp with help of Supercharger,btohqsg
And turbo hard to install for a bike,btohqsg
Rotrex C30-94 counter-clockwise centrifugal supercharger boosts power to 380bhp,btohqsg
Supercharger more compact in certain ways,btohqsg
Show this to a car guy and they'll assume it's a turbo,btohqsg
No car meet near cny period ah,btohqsg
You hosting or Boss Rayyan hosting?,btohqsg
The 90s WRX with long vertical taillight,btohqsg
I think he talking abt the 22b,btohqsg
Because if 22b would be horizontal. If since he said vertical  I assumed Forester STi,btohqsg
The sg one with Subaru wrap,btohqsg
my neighbours WRX   nt the WRC one,btohqsg
Where got too young la hahha,btohqsg

Anything is possible at just the right angle,btohqsg
Because the panamera couldn't see the vios coming,btohqsg
How to set good example for CDC driver üòÇ,btohqsg
As he also turned out from his lane,btohqsg
And was in the panamera's Blindspot,btohqsg
Which is significant as the c pillar on them is quite fat,btohqsg
This is best example to show to CDC student when taking license üëçüèΩ,btohqsg

What is the best looking Porsche? Stock and Modified Porsches,btohqsg
To me it's the 991.2 gt3 Touring,btohqsg
Specifically in GT silver or guards red with silver wheels,btohqsg
But going back in time the 964 Carrera RS ü§åü§åü§å,btohqsg
The Porsche 911 reimagined by Singer,btohqsg
but black with orange tones are nice,btohqsg
What about this Magnus Walker 911?,btohqsg
He also has the red blue white 911s also..,btohqsg
Gotta be the singers and some rwbs,btohqsg
Apart from that I feel Porsches are better untouched,btohqsg
yeah definitely not a good look,btohqsg
wald kits on the cayenne as well,btohqsg
Not as bad as the WALD Prius,btohqsg
The 2019 one is still pretty ok,btohqsg
I think it is the wheels,btohqsg
but the ones on the 958.1 and 958.2 is erm,btohqsg
a neighbour of mine had it on his 958.1,btohqsg
