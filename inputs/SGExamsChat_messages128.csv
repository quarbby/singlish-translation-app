It’s ok even if u don’t have screenshot cause we can view deleted messages,btohqsg
I bet you keep it on your phone,btohqsg
How did you get your new DP,btohqsg
I took hundreds of pictures while I was in JC  to save them to change every year,btohqsg
smiley looks more sinister in this photo. ... .,btohqsg
I actually just asked a junior to take for me,btohqsg
He is a amdk in disguise,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA did your junior judge you HAHA,btohqsg
I find the shade quite fitting to his current circumstance KEKEKE,btohqsg
bruh there are 3 smiley rsafs inside the pack,btohqsg
Maybe the next sticker I add,btohqsg
wonder if anyone took a photo when it was really crying,btohqsg
I thought you were John Smith for a sec,btohqsg
I am going to find a chance to snap a photo after the rain,btohqsg
Looks like no one has it,btohqsg
Can give to John to set as his new dp,btohqsg
there’s a drooling one and a crying one..,btohqsg
now I feel bad for the emoji,btohqsg
Hold on I have an idea,btohqsg
...wait I just realised who u r,btohqsg
what if all of us change to that smiley picture,btohqsg
but u treated him well gj u gave him some shade from the sun,btohqsg
wait let me find I think I have the smiley pic aft the rain,btohqsg
Correction: The rate of increase of smiley’s chances of getting skin cancer is reduced.,btohqsg
By virtue of being in this group  we’re all lame,btohqsg
I’ll just take it aft term break,btohqsg
if I could get the correct angle of the sun...aft the rain,btohqsg
Darkness has fallen over the smiley,btohqsg
Even the angle is the same,btohqsg
Like the face tilt is the same,btohqsg
Ngl the John's second smiley was the best smiley,btohqsg
Smiley cares not for the opining of the commons,btohqsg
Omg I knew you were going to respond along that line,btohqsg
why does smiley talk in third person,btohqsg
all you had to do was get into a good school  shinji!,btohqsg
Every school is a good school,btohqsg
That one image of kaneki that every emo uses,btohqsg
unite all schools together with the school instrumentality project...,btohqsg
I got the idea cos the RSAF dude was shocked initially,btohqsg
Riot has promoted from Riot Game to Riot Games,btohqsg
It’s a sign that John peaked in JC2 🙊,btohqsg
This is a good sticker pack,btohqsg
Im planning on making stickers for tele,btohqsg
I am surprised u were able to photoshop this smiley even though there was a tree shadow on it,btohqsg
I used the built in samsung photo editor lmao,btohqsg
If u look closely it's pretty obv,btohqsg
I will take the chance to say me before I graduate from teenhood in less than a month’s time,btohqsg
I can comprehend it but can’t speak in it,btohqsg
Most only use knn and dllm,btohqsg
Yup I’m categorically denying it as a Hakka,btohqsg
I mean if they don’t come from the correct regions obv they won’t speak it,btohqsg
I frequently use Hokkien with frends,btohqsg
HAHAHA it must come with*Terms & Conditions Apply haha,btohqsg
What terms and conditions are we talking about here,btohqsg
The advantage of being a Hakka in Singapore is that I have a secret spoken language at my disposal... to transmit secrets right in front of people that are not supposed to be privy HAHA,btohqsg
If you think too much does tht make you thoughtful,btohqsg
Alot of off whites coming up,btohqsg
Is there any way for ppl in sgpore to gun for them,btohqsg
I used to have a proxy in usa but he no longer lives there,btohqsg

Let me play a happy song on the world's smallest violin,btohqsg
What's with the world's smallest violin,btohqsg
Why has smiley been merged with rsaf now,btohqsg
Where is the pepe and smiley merge,btohqsg
surprised no one set this as profile...haha,btohqsg
if u dont like mainstream ones just go watch tomb of the fireflies or smth,btohqsg
did you take another pic of smiley or sth,btohqsg
well that movie in particular is super underrated,btohqsg
Real ORD people don't need to post their ORD status,btohqsg
They just keep mum and silently laugh at those still serving,btohqsg
Last time ORD off I was asked if 10 days off was enough for me besides the leave I have. 😂,btohqsg
If you wanna cry like a bitch then yea,btohqsg
It’s all pretty ok I guess,btohqsg
I always get the spicy ramen,btohqsg
Can't count how many times I ate takagi ramen already,btohqsg
But yeah they taste pretty decent for their price point,btohqsg
i ordered the spicy one frm grab,btohqsg
I always go for the miso/jjajiamen but if you are conflicted just go for their own takagi ramen,btohqsg
The one near me does have a bit of taste but yes it’s only spicy,btohqsg
i liked the spice but i felt it wld be nicer if it had more s a l t,btohqsg
unpopular opinion but i kinda like ajisen at times,btohqsg
but i only get the volcano ramen,btohqsg
Maybe if it’s sold at takagi prices that’d be better,btohqsg
yeah one set can set u back $20,btohqsg
It’s better than instant noodles at least,btohqsg
This is how samyang taste to me tbh,btohqsg
Samyang has a salty taste at least,btohqsg
For me the spice is too much tht i cant taste the flavour.,btohqsg
I only eat the pink one,btohqsg
Looks like you need to do some spice training,btohqsg
and like if u get alacarte its $6.90 for the default ramen i think,btohqsg
I always get the original one instead HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Original one i cannot tahan liao,btohqsg
I think I still can tahan but like I would like a change,btohqsg
Wtf that’s so cheap for ramen,btohqsg
so i js added the whole thing,btohqsg
but like I stay in the east LOL,btohqsg

Idk how some my friends eat it like normally and im like dying,btohqsg
i used to eat dry bak chor mee but pour the soup in,btohqsg
That ramen restaurant in Northpoint got GST anot,btohqsg

"One shldnt use ""bell curve"" as scare mongering tactics to make ppl sign up",btohqsg
Cos bell curve doesnt exist at national exams,btohqsg
Why beat the bell curve when u can beat the shit out of everyone 1 day before the exams start,btohqsg
I mean technically it is not a bellcurve,btohqsg
But the underlying idea is that there's some sort of grade boundaries,btohqsg
It was debunked that it isnt,btohqsg
Guys my pringles just magically disappear after i woke up,btohqsg
Yea i even used the reset button,btohqsg
I knew i could count on my grandson,btohqsg
In ig for like 6 times,btohqsg
Go to sleep before i put myself to sleep,btohqsg
What exists is a natural bell curve  not an artificial forced bell curve.When the difficulty of the paper is very low  you will not see the bell curve because everyone will be on the upper tier.A natural bell curve of grades can be artificially created by increasing the difficulty of the paper. When the paper is harder  it is natural that only a few will do extreeeemely well  extremely poorly  and most people will be in between.,btohqsg
did someone just say no bell curve for As???,btohqsg
U will know the true power of bell curve in uni,btohqsg
Isn't regulating the number of A grades just another form of bell curve?,btohqsg
Not like top 10-15% A that type like uni,btohqsg
Also  not if the number of A grades fluctuate  and vary widely from subject to subject also.,btohqsg
not looking forward to the 🔔 curve then :(,btohqsg
Out of a highest possible of 4,btohqsg
For comparison SMU's breakpoint is 3.8,btohqsg

LMAO there are evidently mods that are more free  you chose to tag him LOLOLOLOL,btohqsg
no cuz im not profiting from it and i didnt directly send the link and its somewhat related,btohqsg
how does it feel to be,btohqsg
I got too much time liao,btohqsg
"keyword: ""more"" I mean the rest is even more free that they showed up earlier HEHE",btohqsg
To prevent such pings in the future  people who post ads should inform admins first,btohqsg
It's almost as if we should have the rules pinned back up,btohqsg
We can’t pin both the portal post and the rules,btohqsg
Best we can do is link to rules at the end of the portal post,btohqsg
erm I mean the panel session is over??,btohqsg
What sucks about discord tho is you have to manually scroll up your unreads WTF,btohqsg
But discord allows for larger communities,btohqsg
"I thought can just ""mark as read"" by clicking on the symbol or smth",btohqsg
Telegram is great that it lets you continue where you left off,btohqsg
I think the discord thing is because they plan for the chat being very fast,btohqsg
Nah  who cares about livestreaming. I mean a group of people that came together through reddit most likely do not want to reveal their irl self,btohqsg
There is a blue banner at the top that you can click that takes you to where you left off,btohqsg
Telegram < Discord in so many ways,btohqsg
The only thing is that u can’t use emotes not in the server unless u have nitro,btohqsg
Kinda buggy on the mobile app,btohqsg
Idk  it always worked for me,btohqsg
Oh replying is hell of a hassle in discord too,btohqsg
discord people and telegram people cannot live in harmony,btohqsg
i finished my bowl of prawn noodles and came to how many messages now,btohqsg
What if i orded into the course,btohqsg
What if I OOCed from the courses,btohqsg
Then you qualify for the OOC chat,btohqsg
You can but it just breaks TOS which Dekita doesn't like,btohqsg
You're welcome. I aim to please.,btohqsg
You can post like how bots post to simulate quoting,btohqsg
Idk why Discord TOS no like but w/e I guess,btohqsg
The black corners on the corner of the doge ic is giving me itches,btohqsg

Anyone have the O level LC briefing slides?,btohqsg
"Is it ok for a 13 year old to worry about o levels or some of the rants which detail unfairness in some schools in singapore  disproving the oft repeated phrase ""all schools are good schools""?",btohqsg
It is certainly normal to do so,btohqsg
It’s directly relevant to that 13 year old’s life,btohqsg
But what is the purpose of worrying?,btohqsg
And is it normal for a 13 year old to worry about someones suicidal thoughts?,btohqsg
You know it's repeated because a Minister said it right,btohqsg
Last question is it normal for a sec 1 to struggle with exams on his first year,btohqsg
'normal' a bit difficult to say.If you mean most people no. If you mean got a lot of people have to struggle yes common,btohqsg
I'll stop being annoying now =),btohqsg
To add on  it’s repeated in irony,btohqsg
When i was sec 1 i was given a rude awakening where i wasnt top of my class anymore :p so yeah while i wouldnt say its normal  i would say it makes sense that some students have more difficulty adjusting to the pace and topics than others,btohqsg
Remember to practice practice practice! And consult with your teachers and ask them questions ur not sure abt,btohqsg
r e m o v e d,btohqsg
He is not with you today,btohqsg
Nearing exams... U think its wise for intensive study now?Quite bad to intense tuition for the kid,btohqsg
Since exams are close  the intensity of study definitely needs to increase,btohqsg
U shd work up intensity lvl,btohqsg
Also some people simply don't need to study,btohqsg
I think he is much better after I took over. Having the right approach to tackle questions,btohqsg
CRAM CHEMICAL BONDING ALL THE WAY UP TO SHAPES OF MOLECULES,btohqsg
i got so confused by vsper i wna cry,btohqsg
so i gna redo it tonight,btohqsg
Anything is possible  but whether the theoretical possibility manifests is a different story,btohqsg
At least u dont have to worry abt this,btohqsg
It’s way more than u need,btohqsg
Although it’s a really nice music video,btohqsg
Actually maybe it’s worth watching for the 109.47 degrees line,btohqsg
You’ll never forget the bond angle of methane,btohqsg
i need to study until here,btohqsg
Polarity of a molecule is quite intuitive,btohqsg
Just imagine people pulling on a bond,btohqsg
but i took so long w drawing lewis,btohqsg
Eg H-O-H u can imagine pulling on the O-H bond with equal strength,btohqsg
i’ll check back in a couple of houts,btohqsg
if by 10 pm im not done,btohqsg
No  water is polar  my friend,btohqsg
Maths and angles of compounds isnt john’s forte,btohqsg
But...but... Bio is a humanities subject,btohqsg
considering i spent only 4hrs to memorise the entire phy geog txtbook for o lvls  i strongly agree,btohqsg
How do you relate to low-HDI countries,btohqsg
If your physics is good enough to do geophysics  you won't be taking O-levels.,btohqsg
Still more relatable compared to volcanoes and earthquakes,btohqsg
:( Philippines had Volcanoes erupt recently  so it's quite close too,btohqsg
Bro mathematical modelling can help u predict when tsunami coming,btohqsg
Does this mean you want to join Earth-chan,btohqsg
Thats why there is fmath  but no other further subjects,btohqsg
When in doubt  just F = ma,btohqsg
Now you know why the 12 apostles became 6,btohqsg
But then F = ma is just a derivation,btohqsg
U talk shit about filthy weebs as if u ain't one,btohqsg
Phy is the most applicable sci subject,btohqsg
How can you disrespect bio when it’s importance in the real world is emphasised especially during this period? 😡,btohqsg
F = ma is just an anagram for maf 😐😐😐😐,btohqsg
U can if they congregate in sufficient enuf numbers to form a solid,btohqsg

B-b-but we just wanna play basketball:(,btohqsg
