i need to self study the entire,btohqsg
myself within less than 3 months,btohqsg
WHEN I TOLD MY MUM... i wanted to take h2 phy,btohqsg
i need study aft i looking at this chem faking an element thingy,btohqsg
is it really worth it to take h2 physics without even having the foundation from Os üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
suffer for h2 phy or memo until u wanna die for h2 bio,btohqsg
its like a meh for me HAHAHA,btohqsg
i read thru the notes for h2 phy,btohqsg
O bio like adios in H2 bio sia,btohqsg
the o lvl phy tb still seems... ok..... i think....,btohqsg
finally someone else with our mentality,btohqsg
i already finish the paper while checking for the correct number of pages,btohqsg
me after learning one semester of python programming,btohqsg
i think can try seeing it from the perspective of whether or not you have the energy and drive to put in the effort lor,btohqsg
because for other subs  i know people getting A for h2 math without o level amath,btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ both ways i see as DIE DIE DIE,btohqsg
then there are fair share of trip science people dropping everything to take arts,btohqsg
js which one die harder and faster,btohqsg
then got people without o level bio taking h2 bio,btohqsg
harloif u go for a course in poly and then try to get into uni for a completely diff pathway how possible/difficult would it beor is it impossible for some courses/conditions,btohqsg
i actl considered going arts strean,btohqsg
but i was horrified to hear the h2 hist is 16 times the elect hist syallbus....,btohqsg
now i can actually say smt,btohqsg
but i read a while ago,btohqsg
if u get a diploma with merit,btohqsg
u can go to any uni course provided u meet gpa cutoff,btohqsg
sec 2 doesnt rly count so,btohqsg
but diploma with merit is only awarded to top 10 or 15% of cohort so‚Ä¶,btohqsg
maigadh so many ppl talking here,btohqsg
WAIT HOLD ON PUT IT IN ONE MSG MY GUY,btohqsg
HAHAHA chinese takeout u dm me if need bah,btohqsg
i think ill do thatGIVE ME A SEC,btohqsg
but then gpa must also satisfy,btohqsg
my first sem gpa alr bs,btohqsg
the uni course i wanted was biological sciences at ntu,btohqsg
yeah most likely going for bcme still,btohqsg
im from biomedical engineering in nyp,btohqsg
arts stream in jc or poly,btohqsg
answering for my own school only bc idk abt local uni  theres alot that move to differnt pathways (people in tourism  hospitality  engineering etc coming into comp science),btohqsg
each uni course has a list of relevant dippoma,btohqsg
how hard was it or is it something that's just possible given you hit the min criteria (like gpa or sum),btohqsg
oh! yea i shd go research,btohqsg
im not rly academically inclined tbh... i have thought about taking arts (like drawing  media arts game design wtv) as a career but the industry in sg a bit too small ah,btohqsg
as long as you hit min requirements HAHAH,btohqsg
humanities stronger than my sciences in general,btohqsg
SIM  thats why i said only speaking for my sch,btohqsg
UOL more specifically   their requirements allow for you to mix both a and o level grades tgt,btohqsg
but im in sci stream lolz,btohqsg
i heard the first thinf they compare is gpa,btohqsg
so i opted for econs combi in sec 2 instead,btohqsg
im not sure tbh but i can actl see myself enjoying it la (but as a career idk...),btohqsg
do what u love and you will never have to work a day in ur life- some smartass,btohqsg
do what you hate and use the money to do what you love,btohqsg
all i did was 1 assignment question,btohqsg
aiya but also i see my parents everyday work in a job that they dl js for the pay and they always stress one,btohqsg
so what i got isby right  all uni's generally wld prefer to accept relevant diplomas (& gpa ofc)but u can try to study hard enough to get in within 10-15% and hit min req for something with merit...?,btohqsg
thanks for the trophy dot user,btohqsg
if u have any free time can also  do related stuff to which field u wanna go into to show interest (portfolio basically) but rly depends on requirements,btohqsg
definitely trying my bestest (and luck) to do that ngl,btohqsg
If u do anyth as a job u wont like it,btohqsg
career wise? sigh idk mansbut hey i like going into animations / digital media,btohqsg
paket phoenix wld like to say otherwise,btohqsg
what's that (sorz im really not well read up  jus wanted to ask ard first),btohqsg
Sg uni of tech n design,btohqsg
poly? ehh not my first choicebut i guess i wouldn't mind,btohqsg
If u wan do design media and animation stuff,btohqsg
Ur job market garunteed not big,btohqsg
So if u wan hv a decent career in that field  u are better off with a scholarship,btohqsg
is that a good or bad thingi assume badcuzhard tofind jobright,btohqsg
Its not a easy path to take in sg,btohqsg
singapore's job market is catered to very specific things,btohqsg
