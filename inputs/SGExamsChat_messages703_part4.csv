the batch after me was offered music ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i tot music need take from sec 1??,btohqsg
they should make econs as part of humanities and offer it to more schs,btohqsg
econs is now not anything...it is just considered a relevant subject in L1R5 computation...sigh,btohqsg
if econs was a humanities  i would have scored 2 points better,btohqsg
tbh they can solve this 'too easy to score' problem by letting more schools offer it,btohqsg
o-level econs easy to score ah,btohqsg
my teacher told us that o lvl econs right is just a competition among us,btohqsg
coz i think the main competition is TMS and TKGS,btohqsg
not being mean but the other 2 schools were of much lower caliber (sry idk a better phrase for it),btohqsg
then my school always have record of > 90% distinction,btohqsg
but it is not that it is easy to score  in fact there is a lot of content...like the book is quite thick,btohqsg
but comparing Os and As  Os is definitely more content regurgitation and less analysis,btohqsg
My Geog teacher focuses on the weakest student,btohqsg
how does a teacher focus on student,btohqsg
my teacher just teach the class normally  dun target anyone lol,btohqsg
teach her during self study and have only extra lessons with her,btohqsg
she rejected everyone's request for consultation,btohqsg
tbh my friend lucky got me to jio...but i go consult with them only to scare them,btohqsg
that was part of LLP  Music became a elective for the batch after me,btohqsg
This is why the philosophy of if idk 80% of the batch dk works,btohqsg
Isnt combine = ss / elect something,btohqsg
Oh there is such a thing?,btohqsg
The only schs ik who don't offer it are the upper tier sec schs,btohqsg
My sch only offers 2 pure or 3 pure or combined sci (chem / bio),btohqsg
But i would rather a pure chem tho,btohqsg
Even if ur in an IP sch u shud still know what other schs have what,btohqsg
I rmbr I saw it exists but idk of any schs that does it,btohqsg
Because the way combined work is it's just one subject code then diff papers per diff combi,btohqsg
I thought it was only pure bio+combined phys/chem,btohqsg
My sec sch geog Cher took that,btohqsg
But I only found out about combined phys/bio slightly later,btohqsg
Once again the prisoners in selarang prison complex are shouting at me,btohqsg
So they can see us from inside,btohqsg
And then sometimes they will shout at us,btohqsg
From my poly  you also could see a prison  granted it's closed,btohqsg
esp since so many ppl take econs in jc,btohqsg
ik hwachong high offers econs (as like an ip4 subject) but my friend said they're removing it cause they wanna make the IP syllabus more similar to o level,btohqsg
also i heard some ip schools are cutting down on the jc content taught in ip to follow more closely to O level but i dont have a written source  its all hearsay so take with grain of salt,btohqsg
I didn't know comb+pure is a thing until my express friend told me,btohqsg
They definitely wonâ€™t until moe develops their own syllabus and paper and is able to offer it to more schs,btohqsg
The international version is too easy and not as Singapore oriented as h2 Econs,btohqsg
Speaking of which  I didn't know some ppl actly took econs during Os,btohqsg
like their sch actly offers it,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s a few here including me,btohqsg
How is it compared to the As econs,btohqsg
is it built upon the Os econs,btohqsg
Some schs have 100% dist rate in some years,btohqsg
Some of the concepts yes but answering technique is much more difficult,btohqsg
Also like I said less Singapore oriented since we using international version,btohqsg
