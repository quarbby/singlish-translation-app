One week can earn how much,btohqsg
Not too long later you will only feel numbness and frustration 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Cannot don do LLM or feel Sian?🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
I hope I won’t make mistake. Scared making mistake and got to compensate it,btohqsg
Is LLM the only platform for doing freelance delivery?,btohqsg
It's seriously not the right time to join llm,btohqsg
But guess their doing their marketing well that's y more n more pple joining,btohqsg
If your riding bike I think maybe still can  but if car and above then good luck,btohqsg
really only worth to do if it's along the way for u,btohqsg
I see. As my free hours are limited (9am-1pm) the most,btohqsg
Now many jobs in llm  the mileage fee is very discounted. And the drivers are the ones who bear the discount. Not llm,btohqsg
The price given in LLM  exclude comm right? We have to give them a cut too?,btohqsg
So unless the jobs have decent priority fees added or high demand surge  in the long run it's totally not worth the effort. Ur having to use more petrol and accumulating more mileage to your vehicle to earn lesser $,btohqsg
By right the actual price should b,btohqsg
I see. Really very little hor,btohqsg
Not worth doing unless along the way pick n drop,btohqsg
Mileage fee = $3(for 1st 3km) + $13.05($0.45*29km)=$16.05,btohqsg
So total fee by right should b $28.05,btohqsg
I was wondering should I start? I haven’t place ky security deposit,btohqsg
But llm started the stupid discount for vendors this yr,btohqsg
Discount on mileage fee  which is pushed to drivers🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Have to put in double the effort and might not even make more than b4,btohqsg
Yes. Everything so thinking to earn some pocket money 😂,btohqsg
But yet I see many pple joining,btohqsg
Wkends especially sooo many part timers do  prices get pushed down more,btohqsg
I can only do on weekdays morning 😭,btohqsg
I don't know if bikes still ok,btohqsg
I'm speaking from a car driver point of view,btohqsg
Bikes tough to ride in weather conditions n also face more danger on the rd,btohqsg
But they in a way can complete jobs faster,btohqsg
And when comes to parking prob easier n cheaper than cars,btohqsg
Nowdays more courier jobs  car jobs getting lesser. Cos courier cheaper,btohqsg
U can try. After some time u gauge whether worth it,btohqsg
By the way  don't expect much  if any back end support,btohqsg
Llm is different from grab etc,btohqsg
Llm sides with their customers(vendors) 95% of the time,btohqsg
They basically couldn't care less abt their drivers/riders,btohqsg
Make sure ur hp has lot of space,btohqsg
Cos u need take many photos/screenshot etc to cover ur backside when doing llm,btohqsg
N have to keep for quite a few mths,btohqsg
I'm just telling you what all those lalamove marketing and advertisements don't tell you. They sugar-coat everytg only,btohqsg
Min 5k monthly income. Minimum 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂😂😂,btohqsg

Those who believe and join also smoking crack,btohqsg
