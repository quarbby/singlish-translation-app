I tot amd also produces in malaysia,btohqsg
Produces is some subcontracted company called AMD-TF,btohqsg
the actual AMD Design Hub only recently started in 2021 in Penang.,btohqsg
I think oso foxconn produces for amd?,btohqsg
many stages in producing chips nowadays,btohqsg
then TSMC sends to some other wirebonding/packaging process in Malaysia,btohqsg
Finally finished making my own custom OS,btohqsg
I still have my hackintosh files,btohqsg
This doesn't seem like your own kernel,btohqsg
Wasn't mothership meant to be satire news,btohqsg
Kernel is from Samsung cuz no one dares trying to make theyâ€™re own modified one,btohqsg
omg is this tekkichickenbreast from the hit server yaki sauce tub (1.2),btohqsg
i dont watch arcane bro ðŸ’€,btohqsg
can i ask if people who grad frm cs manage to find a job after graduation since the market is super competitive,btohqsg
market is competitive but cs is still very sought after esp with how many different fields there are for it,btohqsg
you're not restricted to certain industries,btohqsg
My relative son grad got 8k,btohqsg
Feel like ai cuts ut down alot tho,btohqsg
yea i mean that's way higher than the median,btohqsg
I want ask him more during cny,btohqsg
anyway you can look through those grad employment surveys,btohqsg
Dam crazy siah  even my past tuition center cher turned private oso 8k,btohqsg
And his been teaching for like 10++?,btohqsg
But im just comparing how crazy his floor is,btohqsg
depending on what i go for  my first full job post phd can be anywhere from 5-6k to >20k,btohqsg
Phd hard to say on job prospects right?,btohqsg
it's just i gotta make sure to explore opportunities,btohqsg
Computer science jobs might be competitive next time uh,btohqsg
Thousands of students graduating there while competing against foreign talents/digital nomads,btohqsg
Still possible but difficult to go in,btohqsg
Plus post covid can remote work,btohqsg
Making it theoretically speaking possible for employees to work across jurisdiction,btohqsg
some of it is hire fast fire fastso while it's good to get a high salary young  the hard part is to maintain it past 40,btohqsg
personally  I have 1 very good NS mate who specialise in design  got retrenched during covid times. Till now cannot find a suitable job.,btohqsg
Another cousin of mine  in IT. Very high salary.9 months ago got retrenched after company he worked in got acquired. New HR ask why this person salary so high  so just fire.In most cases  fresh grads do just as well for the same job. Might as well take the pay of a late 30s or early 40s person and use it to hire 2 young fresh grads who have more energy  time and drive.,btohqsg
So while looking for a job  do consider longevity of it.Also prep your finances well early in your career. Don't overspend nor spend with the expectation that your income will always be there.,btohqsg
I mean does put some negotiating power into ur next job no?,btohqsg
also depends on your job scope,btohqsg
to be more extreme  a person with 10 years experience doing admin work is no better than a person with <1 yr experience,btohqsg
covid times  it was employee market especially with AI boom.Give another 10 yrs  where most of the sec sch students how graduate  the economy will change again.,btohqsg
my time  which was 2008. IT was the among the lowest paid. No one wanted it.,btohqsg
Just become a day trader... ðŸ˜‚My uni friend  same batch as me  got into day trading.Eventually 3 years into working... He has 150k USD in his trading account....,btohqsg
no  IT jobs are easily outsourced. It's just code.Many companies set up branches in places like Vietnam  where salaries are way lower,btohqsg
even has the guts to suggest to his manager to put him on the VSS list  for retrenchment.,btohqsg
I'm like good for you bruh... while I sobbing internally lel,btohqsg
150K USD is quite good at age 30 lol,btohqsg
in life  we can only set goals and aim for success and stability.Luck plays a much larger role,btohqsg
but then  I am not really that keen onto his risk factor la,btohqsg
Then u think not enough  then suddenly become 150k in the red,btohqsg
another tutor friend  age 35 with 4 kids.Was telling me he had only 20k usd in assets.Somehow he dumped all into Tesla  turned it to 50k  then sold and dumped all to Palantir  and at this juncture it had 10X.2 years. 20k usd to >500k usd,btohqsg
