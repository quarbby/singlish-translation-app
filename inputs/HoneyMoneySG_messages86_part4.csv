For DBS Multiplier  can we use fast transfer as UOB One? I am reading thishttps://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-earn/multiplierSalary Credit to any DBS/POSB Deposit AccountCredit your salary into your DBS/POSB SGD-denominated account via GIRO/FAST/PayNow with transaction code ‚ÄúSAL‚Äù/‚ÄúPAY‚Äù or transaction description ‚ÄúSALARY‚Äù/‚ÄúPAYROLL‚Äù/‚ÄúCOMMISSION‚Äù/‚ÄúBONUS‚Äù.,btohqsg
No  unlikely. And you should be avoiding DBS Multiplier because of it's low interest rates.,btohqsg
think can ah. At least works for posb cashback bonus,btohqsg
Someone reported before not working:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/144276Can try but unlikely ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

Maybe can work? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But the most recent data point is in Oct 23 after policy change in Aug 23.,btohqsg
Think only you can check via rose,btohqsg

It's okay  found the person already lol,btohqsg
not even a valid datapoint as putting comments of cos dun work  need to choose purpose,btohqsg
He said he indicated salary payment as purpose though. But we also cannot confirm haha.I can't test anymore  closed the account for being trash tier üòÖ,btohqsg

I participated in the moomoo 5.8% promo. I clicked subscribe now and i had the countdown timer and showing how much was invested. My 30 days ended some time ago. I called moomoo hotline and they said my participation was not captured. They will investigate. Disappointed.,btohqsg
May i ask if this SC promo is a better deal or uob one account and if there are any promo codes for one account,btohqsg
Did a comparison video here. Currently only SC Bonus$aver has a confirmed welcome promo  UOB One only has a first xxx signup reward promohttps://youtu.be/1ScSGvBkAq4?si=qOQo4--uHxBzddhY,btohqsg
I understand it'll be noob question. It's my first time doing voluntary conribution for my spouse.I registered and made GIRO arrangement everything.Just one question  where will the cash contribution go to? All 3 accounts or SA and MA only? There was no option for me to choose which account I'm contributing.,btohqsg
GIRO arrangement is only for RSTU. Top-ups will go to your spouse's SA as reserved funds for RA. For VCMA  you have to do it via e-Cashier  only via PayNow.Take note  to be eligible for tax relief  your spouse must (i) not have an annual income (e.g. salary  bank interest  dividends  pension) exceeding $4k on preceding year of top-up (i.e. 2023)  or (ii) be handicapped.,btohqsg
Thank you.I just reviewed the activies tab. It shows asGIRO Standing Instruction for topping up your / your recipient‚Äôs Retirement SavingsProbably  it will go to SA.,btohqsg
Sorry for noob question - if transfer from oa to sa  will the amount transferred become reserved or is it non-reserved  in contrast to cash top up where it is reserved?,btohqsg
Only RSTU will be reserved. But OA to SA transfers are irreversible and will not be eligible for tax relief.,btohqsg
Hi folks  quick question  I got my new UOB one card on Jan 6 this month and got a statement of around 500$. Does this mean that I won't be able to able to qualify for the min 2k spend quarterly cashback?,btohqsg
And 2nd questions  I already had a UOB savings account before applying the credit card  will I qualify for enhanced 5% cashback?,btohqsg
Would really appreciate help on these two questions  thanks you! üòÄ,btohqsg
Since it's your first quarter of receiving the card  you may be eligible for prorated cashback for monthly 2k spend tier. See tnc for details.,btohqsg
5% cashback on the card? Nothing to do with UOB One account?,btohqsg
I read the T&C  but wasn't able to find anything. Maybe I'll check with the customer care.,btohqsg
Yes  on my new UOB one card. I saw there is some extra 5% enhanced cashback for new customer  not sure if Im eligible for that,btohqsg
Going through thetnc  I found this,btohqsg
This is great  thanks for sharing man,btohqsg

Can consider signing up for UOB VI metal. The current sign up offer is not as good as last year though.,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúHospital card‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.Take note Citi bank excluded hospital from Jan 2024 onwards.,btohqsg
looks like HSBC Adv still okay,btohqsg
Think only few cards can use : UOB Visa infinite metal and UOB Reserve or citi Ultima card,btohqsg
And I think SCB cards still award miles for hospital ezpense,btohqsg
