Hi Everyone  does it qualifies the Salary Crediting component if my employer uses FAST to credit my salary to UOB One account?,btohqsg
Yes  SingSaver issue. Waiting for my Paynow reward for April Application. My wife applied via MoneySmart in May and already received it,btohqsg
Hihi  can u give a screen shot of the credit transaction of your salary? Please remember to mask out the sensitive information,btohqsg
should be ok if the purpose chosen for the FAST is Salary,btohqsg
Right now it‚Äôs still credited to POSB,btohqsg
Hi. I don‚Äôt think so. It usually has to be 1) Giro  OR 2) paynow salary,btohqsg
Something to share for those taking budget airline. Sometime it‚Äôs cheaper to book a return flight separately. Outgoing usually sgd. but return pay in foreign currency (the country u visit). The return flight is usually cheaper by a lot due to no currency conversion.,btohqsg
I would share with u mine by end of the day that qualify. Need time to pull out and mask info.,btohqsg
by right yes  but by left...,btohqsg
Hi  can someone with experience help me out here.Currently with UOB lady‚Äôs card. Can I pair it up with Instarem Amaze card to pay for foreign online (off physical) transactions  still earning bonus UNi$ - namely currently 6mpd?,btohqsg
Really? Based on your recent experience?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs great! Can officially migrate cos my employer SME and no HR dept.,btohqsg
Should get 6mpd so long mcc under your selected categories. No personal experience though.,btohqsg
Because I have checked UOB lady‚Äôs card T&C  they write to exclude Amaze*transaction for Uni$. But I also hear it can earn bonus points. So I am very confused  this asking in this group for some experience.,btohqsg
*thus asking here for experienced friends to share some encounters,btohqsg
Confirmed can. As long as mcc within your selected categories.Uob lady card does mcc filters. Not name filters. Be careful of travel classification though. Many monkey mccs.,btohqsg
Currently getting 5.14% FD 6months. Still the best FD rate for passive income.,btohqsg
Just got rejected for ocbc 365  not sure why since annual income is more than the requirementAny alternatives for everyday spending?Also first time applying for cc in sg  do we need to open an account with the bank we want to apply cc with ? Or no needThank you,btohqsg
What is your fixed minimum spend per month?  (Yes there are better cards out there)No need to open account with bank issuing cc,btohqsg

How long to get cashback from yuu card har ?,btohqsg

Assuming you're on team Cashback  you can look into DBS live fresh  UOB EVOL or POSB Everyday (not sure what your spend categories are)Will help if anyone in team Cashback can add on  I'm a miles guy üòÇ,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestionMajority my spending is on dining/food delivery   and then offline/online shopping i guess,btohqsg
What would be your recommendation for miles card ?,btohqsg
I actually follow Chris's strategy of using Citi Rewards with Instarem Amaze as my general card  then travel related expenses or after maxing that out  I personally use the HSBC Revolution (most MCCs are covered) and a general spend card (Citi PremierMiles or UOB KrisFlyer) in the event I max out these two cardsLike Cashback card  be wary of rewards cap.Unlike Cashback cards  miles card don't have a minimum spend but u need to be careful of points expiry.That said  also keep in mind the trouble of looking out for annual fees if you hold too many cards and don't utilise them often,btohqsg
I see  thanks for suggestion and explanation üôè,btohqsg
That's the best for me at the moment.,btohqsg
A question on the Citi Payall. What happens if we didnt hit the 8k. All the fee goes down the drain? Or will be refunded?,btohqsg
Wah sian means fee goes down the drain ü•≤,btohqsg
Is transferring to investments related company counted? E.g Syfe,btohqsg
UOB ladies card dont care about online or offline  they just look at the category. which for normal card you can only choose 1.But i guess pair with Amaze might get better rates when overseas at say dining category,btohqsg
No ah  you still get base points,btohqsg
Trying to leh but I seem to have only tax and insurance to pay using Payall,btohqsg
"can say ""donate"" to anyone in your family and ask them transfer back",btohqsg
The base point can get without going through Payall mah,btohqsg
Certain places don‚Äôt accept credit cards  or credit card don‚Äôt have points like insurance,btohqsg
Hmm true. Nv thought of that.,btohqsg
Hi all did anyone went for this?Singlife Secure Saver is launching a new tranche (limited) on 6th June 2023  12am:‚úÖ 2-Year policy term‚úÖ 4.10%p.a.

this guy always promote NZD FD in a Singapore forum  not sure why but maybe he is from New Zealand or is just personal preference  but anyone if want to follow pls DYODD,btohqsg
not sure what your true intentions are for the continued advertising of cimb nzd fd. why dont you specifically state that you are referring to nzd instead of posting rates and trying to get reactions from others.or are you cimb rm and need more depositsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I tot is sgd have so high interest,btohqsg
SGD not so high  this person has been promoting CIMB NZD FD for past few days..,btohqsg
the way he presents sounds so baity. out of nowhere he says im getting 5.xx% interest  best fd rate for passive income,btohqsg
He keeps saying Citi+Amaze.I keep saying CIMB SG FD.Well  it's up to you to think what you want.,btohqsg
you are misleading people  people will think you say CIMB SG FD is in SGD when u are referring to NZD,btohqsg
It's pure FD no need to do this & that like EGA.,btohqsg
since 2022 till now nzd has depreciated against sgd by 17.5% not worth it,btohqsg
its ok he got 5.14% pa for 6 monthsü§ë,btohqsg
You can look at USD FD if you like.,btohqsg
why you dont like SGD ? SGD so strong. USD now with the upcoming BRICKS currency is dropping also,btohqsg
yesyes dbs also got 7.8%.dbs india,btohqsg
That‚Äôll affect the market heavily right?,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtnow is UOB lady card expert  her number 1 card now. Can ask her anyt about the card. I'll be travelling next week trying amaze with the lady card too.,btohqsg
yes less reliance on USD cause it de dollarisation and people won't use USD and then less sanctions from them also,btohqsg
But what does this mean for Singapore?,btohqsg
won't affect much for Singapore  but imo  USD will drops once BRICKS currency is up and running,btohqsg
BRICKS will take few years.Still USD for now.,btohqsg
no matter whats the answer you get from wherever  be sure to DYODD ok. cos no one can be responsible for your money other than yourself,btohqsg
Maybe. Election coming so the currency is dropping,btohqsg
i won't give any advice for this but pls DYODD :),btohqsg
anyway  whatever is said today is no hard feelings and just own opinionsjust that as there is always someone more savvy than you  there will also always be someone less financial literate than you and they come here to learn of hacks to maximise their money.so its good to be clear on the specifics of what you are advocating for since honestly there is no consequence to you even if things go south,btohqsg
usd even 6 mths treasury is 5.43%(risk free rate). So those fixD  that is priced lower is undercutting customers. Also notice alot of USD new bond issue recently at sky high rates and nobody touching. I think likely due to massive amt of printing and yet value still similar to pre printing making everyone worried.,btohqsg
After much participation in online channels I have learned never to make any investment recommendations.People blame u if u wrong.People forget u if u right.Most importantly it is illegal to make recommendations without mas licence.,btohqsg

Mayhe this is a valid reasons,btohqsg
Recall our honey monely also got rejected before too so u are not alone,btohqsg
I have OCBC premier and I am still rejected from their credit cards.,btohqsg
You hold too many credit cards? Or terminate many credit cards before?,btohqsg
Self employed is different from MNC. It affects your credit card application.,btohqsg
How long did it take anyone who is new to HSBC to get credit card application approved?,btohqsg
Wonder if it makes a difference to call HSBC - won‚Äôt expedite the application right?,btohqsg
What card do you use? On trust card it‚Äôs considered food and dining  not groceries,btohqsg
Then what about at NTUC still under the same MCC? Still dinning?,btohqsg
I wanted to use UOB lady as my selected category is dinning but as I not sure what mcc the fairprice app is under,btohqsg
Fairprice is considered groceries for trust card,btohqsg
I will try with other banks,btohqsg
But I app always paying through the QR code in the fairprice app. For groceries shopping and at Kopitiam. So my question is the mcc different if you're making payment to kopitiam and making payment for ntuc groceries shopping.,btohqsg
As far as I aware based on OCBC & DBS  salary credit via GIRO only be counted as salary credit.,btohqsg
how do you all buy US T-bills? through tiger dont have this option,btohqsg
Is there a reason why people would rather use UOB EVOL card as compared to the ONE card? I‚Äôve seen a few messages here asking about EVOL but if you spend monthly and hit certain amount  i‚Äôm under the impression that ONE card might be a better option? ü§î,btohqsg
Sometimes u call  they will tell u got docs or something pending from your end. Or maybe the application kena missed out. No harm calling,btohqsg
depends on ur spending category. Evol cashback is 8% if most of ur spending are online and contactless. Uob one is 3.33% or less.,btohqsg
1). How about I only can spend $6xx on particular month but not the 3 months in one cycle ?2). If you spend $550  $450 $525 on UOB one card on that 3 months cycle  how much cash back you can earned?,btohqsg
can. i fast transfer to myself to uob and purpose i put salary. reference put PAYNOW SALA,btohqsg
What can the $500 spend be? Bus trips?,btohqsg
im using evol card and bus trips are part of my $500 spending. but for evol itself need to hit $600 for the cashback so thats the target,btohqsg
So any uob card considered as spend for uob one?,btohqsg
not all  the ppv not included. offhand i dont have the list but its definitely not all,btohqsg
Uob one   uob evol and uob lady‚Äôs i believe,btohqsg
So can only use the uob one card for the $500 spend requirement?,btohqsg
No. I listed 3 credit cards above.1. UOB one card2. UOB Evol3. UOB lady‚ÄôsAll 3 credit cards that I listed are eligible to get the bonus interest in uob one account if u meet the min spend requirements,btohqsg
i see. i guess if u hit to 1000 2000 category in UOB One then it make sense to use that card for higher cashback?,btohqsg
Oh ok. What items consider eligible spend?,btohqsg
Can anyone advise if I use UOB bank as a CPF investment bank to buy TBills and after auction result when will be the deduction? So far did not see any deduction from my CPF OA. Thanks,btohqsg
hmmm i just read one card benefits again. even if i‚Äôm spending $2k monthly it still make sense to use EVOL for cashback?,btohqsg
depends what u spend on. If can get more rebate by spending $600 on Evol and the rest on other cards  then why not. Think it make sense to spend so much on uob one only if u have a lot of utilities bill to pay and spend lots on shopee or dairy farm group or Grab.,btohqsg
how do i see how much cashback i got from my one card? can‚Äôt find anything on my statements last month. can‚Äôt be don‚Äôt have cashback at all :/,btohqsg
only can see bonus cashback at end of 4th statement month. Quarterly rebate to be credited only if u have bill to offset at end of 4th or later statement month.,btohqsg
ok i saw this in my ONE card statement in April:- cash rebate bill redemption $100- enhance rebate $33.99- additional rebate $26.47,btohqsg
does it make sense to stay with it or change to evol?,btohqsg
Evol Cashback is how many percent,btohqsg
effective 6.67% if spend $250 on online  $250 on mobile contactless  $100 anything so long not excluded,btohqsg
Evol will only cover $600 spending. See if u can use other cards (e.g. maybank family and friends  citi cashback) for the rest of the spending  meet the min spend and get good rebate.,btohqsg
so that‚Äôs $40 max per month. still higher than my current rebate from ONE assuming that amount in my statement is for 4 months?,btohqsg
that amount is for 3 months,btohqsg
i see. so using evol alone might not be beneficial for me. i‚Äôll need evol + some other cards to give a better rebate than ONE in my situation,btohqsg
Can use evol to topup ezlink card?,btohqsg
no. topup excluded. Can use for simplygo,btohqsg
Then what is the stored value topup for? Saw in the pdf file,btohqsg
I find uob one to be more simple. Just spent 500 and done with it. Get extra if in special category like grab/dailyFarmGrp/SimplyGo/utility. As for evol. Better rebate but more effort to track spending on mobile contactless and online. However  I think if u can meet min 600  the rebate shld be better (based on just max out one cat of online spent already hit 250 x 0.08 =20 per mth. 60 per qtr),btohqsg
I am lazy. So my card strategy is uob one + hsbc revo.,btohqsg
oh i use dbs to uob. uob to uob wont be fast mah  will be normal transfer i guess,btohqsg
Both card similar effort to track bah,btohqsg
did u open EGA as well?,btohqsg
and how do you all track ur card expenses to ensure u don‚Äôt cross 500/600? i find it pretty tough üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
ah i see. i just put my excess in t-bills and funds so think i‚Äôll review later this year haha,btohqsg
So the pdf info is wrong,btohqsg
Good to split some fund in saving acct for emergency use and some in mid term like t-bill/sgs/Ssb,btohqsg
no ah it is showing the excluded MCCs. Stored value topup is under one of these excluded MCCs.,btohqsg
the one in my uob one is for emergency lor haha. the rest in t-bills/funds/stocks so haven‚Äôt found a reason for EGA yet,btohqsg
Oh ok. Read wrongly. Then not much for eligible spend for $500,btohqsg
Thanks  yup I just called and the CSO said the application is completed  nothing pending on my side. So just awaiting their SMS confirmation!,btohqsg

"Just got off a telephone conversation with a HSBC staff member. On the website  it says ""Start a new relationship with HSBC Premier and get rewards up to SGD10 437. Plus a 1-night stay at Shangri-La Singapore  Tower Wing Deluxe Room includes breakfast & Internet access for 2 adults (worth SGD 420++ )"" and this separate from Welcome gifts section that requries ""Total Relationship Balance of fresh funds SGD200 000 in fresh funds and purchase a minimum of SGD25 000"". She has to go and check on the website herself to find out about this promotion and then told me it's a 'package'. No investments  no rewards. Very misleading.. Not sure whether I should go Premier and rather put the cash somewhere else. HSBC staff is really poor",btohqsg

I wanted to but it was sold out within an hour of launch,btohqsg
Hope I'm not being Karen about it but it's not an unsoliticited call. They call me back to specifically talk about opening the particular account  yet they don't know their promotion..,btohqsg
Actually I think the Hsbc staff should have been better trained. If their main purpose was to dangle the carrot in front for u to signup for a service  they should at least know the full details of the carrot well enough to answer specific questions.,btohqsg

Oh I thought it was like a cold call  or a cross selling. If it is a callback  then they ought to better represent their HSBC Premier product. It speaks volumes of the level of service they are prepared for their Premier level clients.,btohqsg

For most categories like Dining  transport  SimplyGo and utilities; why a lot of sifus here recommend HSBC Revolution over OCBC 365? 365 has 6% and 3% cash rebates on those MCC whereas HSBC just gives 4mpd/2.5% and if you have EGA + 1% more.,btohqsg

Hi. First time applied for t-bills. Got SMS saying I succeeded. But in the cpf dashboard  the amount deducted from my OA is a bit less than the amount I bidded for. Means what ah?,btohqsg
Deduction is based on cut off yield of 3.84%  not on the amount you bidded.,btohqsg
Ok no problem  the credit card earnings on points will still be valid even if u also earn from kris+  cuz i use kris+ quite often,btohqsg
What is deducted is the discounted amt. Example you use 1k for 6m tbill. On auction  cut off yield is 3.83 Sgr discounted $19.10. How you are deducted is 1k minus 19.10. On maturity you will get back 1k. Your effective yield minus all the bank admin fees is $19.10,btohqsg

1000 dollars (Citibank also provides points once transactions are posted so its easy to track),btohqsg
Thank you. So once max out will just change to uob krisflyer. Uob krisflyer got max out also?,btohqsg
No  once maxed out then go to HSBC Revolution (if max out  then Citi premiermiles or UOB krisflyer),btohqsg
Be warned that if you go UOB Krisflyer that means locking into SIA's ecosystem (meaning u cant use miles on other FFP such as EVA air) and the expiry ticks immediately [ i do plan to travel within 3 years so its not really a concern to me ],btohqsg
Same. Thanks alot. Don't like HSBC hahaha cheers for sharing,btohqsg
If I tag my uob krisflyer to amaze after my citi max out. Is a good idea right? Can continue to get amaze point?,btohqsg
Hi anyone calculated before which is better for local spend  crmc or instarem wallet (4x points from now until june 30),btohqsg
Just be aware 4x points is capped at $125 spent depends on what your are buying. Personally I go for Crmc,btohqsg
"This is ""my salary credit"" that qualify me for salary credit bonus interest criterion for UOB One. So if your employer use FAST  should be ok based on the descriptor of this line item.",btohqsg
You are correct. The line item qualify.,btohqsg

Hi guys  can I check  if I‚Äôm going Malaysia for 5 days 4 night  including going Genting. Is there any card to recommend for good online exchange?I‚Äôll be bring some cash  but I heard that some part of genting only take card transactions.,btohqsg
Curious too do genting and KL most shops take paywave? Long time no go Malaysia even JB,btohqsg
U book genting hotel via genting website,btohqsg
Long term maybe get a Malaysia credit card. Then use CIMB SG<->CIMB MY or Maybank SG<->Maybank MY.,btohqsg
Look to combine best credit cards of SG+MY for best rewards.,btohqsg
My hotel is free. Using points.,btohqsg
Not sure also. I very long didn‚Äôt go Malaysia & Genting already. Last went was like2017-2018. üòÇ,btohqsg
If you are already hitting $800 on Maybank FnF  can try to read this.https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-family-and-friends-mastercard.page,btohqsg
Hahaha mine even longer maybe since 2006? never step into Jb or Malaysia haha,btohqsg
I think currently the hottest Malaysia entry level credit card is CIMB eCredit Card. 12x points every 28 of the month  3x points for other days. Capped at 20k points which is MYR1670 (~SGD500) only.,btohqsg
So gamble a lot then got points or what?,btohqsg
Should try Penang. Beat the JB traffic.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt scared  visa/master should be widely accepted ü§£ but can consider setup tng account (which you can Topup with either amaze or YouTrip),btohqsg

UOB Visa Infinite metal card will turn heads.,btohqsg
Hi all  sorry can I ask for UOB one CC  if the spending pattern was 500/500/2000 for the 3 mths  does it mean that the cashback is only 50$ and not 500*3.33% + 500*3.33% + 2000* 3.33%?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know that are favepay and shopback transactions billed as online transactions?  e.g. Citi SMRT card. Are they catalegorized as online payments by UOB EVOL cards?,btohqsg
Also can UOB one CC be paired w Atome/shopback to count towards 3 mths min spend? E.g 6k payments -> use atome/ shopback to split into 3 payments of 2k to hit the min 2k spend tier per mth?,btohqsg
It takes the lowest amount. Very hard to keep track.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if using Atome is considered online payments for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg

Hello.. abit non-topic here but any MacBook Pro user here? I am thinking about getting MacBook Pro but can‚Äôt decide between M2 Pro and M2 Max. I don‚Äôt do video content or video editing. Just causal use and for studying. Sometimes I game AAA titles. Base 512GB I feel not sufficient as I want to bootcamp a Windows to play Xbox games pass. 1TB 3.5k and M2 Max 4.5k. üòÖ‚Ä¶ I feel expensive but I feel MacBook very durable than windows laptop. Maybe worth the investment?,btohqsg
New MacBook no longer boot-campable  and please   don‚Äôt game on MacBook ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†Can consider cross border (go MY) to buy   since MY price is still ard 10% cheaper   and can take advantages on FCY rebate or extra miles on some credit cards,btohqsg
Hi guys  I used revo thru favepay to pay for food places and purchased an e-card during my checkout for partial of the transaction. But seems like the whole transaction is then considered 4111 and excluded from 9x bonus points anyone encountered this as well?,btohqsg
Alamak.. game is must worz. I see YouTube and most of them said MacBook can game and better to get M2 Max.. but you know it‚Äôs >4K lol,btohqsg
If not boot-campable then how to boot to Windows worz?,btohqsg
Can game  but not under window LOL. It kinda make more sense to buy a XBox for XGP.,btohqsg
Haha boot camp is a history now.M2P is def enuf for study and casual use  but let‚Äôs not derail the topic discussed in this group,btohqsg
M2 pro is definitely enough  and drains less battery than Max. Gaming is possible but can‚Äôt go max settings on macs.,btohqsg
If there any big difference between 512GB and 1TB?,btohqsg
what food places? how u know the mcc?,btohqsg

Yea u can‚Äôt game on MacBook now that u can‚Äôt dual boot on it. My regular use I suggest just get MacBook Air. The m series chip is more than good enough,btohqsg
M2 air works on dota2 ah?,btohqsg
How come can‚Äôt dual boot? Windows 10 still can right? I see from Apple Support site de.,btohqsg
TBH - same opinion as the rest  having owned >5 macbook pros  >3 macbook airs and Xbox.You're better off getting a combo of macbook air / ipad for casual use / traveling + gaming laptop ryzen/xbox/PS5.,btohqsg
I know Intel/AMD laptop can game well  and cheaper than MacBook. I never use MacBook before  thought about trying haha. Cos I heard MacBook very durable.. >5 years still good. Battery also good. Laptop battery die fast over the period of years if left uncharged.. meaning running on battery. Not sure if running on battery affect the FPS. And laptop is heavier than MacBook also. Haha.,btohqsg
M series macbook don't support bootcamp/dual boot anymore. So youre out of luck for gaming. Better to get cheaper models on the Air for casual long term.,btohqsg
The new 15‚Äù MacBook Air ah? Haha,btohqsg

Anyone HSBC users received the unique code already?,btohqsg
Eh  paywave is unique to visa so Amex is not able to use paywave. Unless you are referring to contactless payment? Mastercard version of contactless is paypass but I guess visa‚Äôs marketing is stronger so everyone just conveniently refers to it as paywave,btohqsg
Amex has its own version called expresspay,btohqsg
Can I check HSBC ega extra 1% for Cashback and increase share the same pot of 300 cap per month?,btohqsg

300 monthly cap for everyday+ interest. 300 combined monthly cap for CC cashback and GIRO,btohqsg
For HSBC revo  the bonus 9x points is based on calendar month right but is it based on transacted date or transaction posted date ?,btohqsg
oh not the EGA bonus interest right? gave me a shock.,btohqsg
Yes  everyday+ interest is separate from the bonus interest. Bonus interest cap is up to 2mil in deposits I think,btohqsg
yes I also remember it's 2mil. phew.,btohqsg

Hi sifus  wanted to ask is the bonus interest (4%+ pa) for EGA only applicable for one time? Or can apply every month via message?,btohqsg
it depends which month u started  if last month it will last for 3 months. this month's  only 2 months,btohqsg
So this bonus interest is only for one time right?,btohqsg
there is new promo every month. But if still under a promo window then registration for new promo will be invalid. And you may want to make sure to empty the account in month just before u register for new promo to have maximum incremental balance wrt to reference month.,btohqsg

Thanks!What are the 2nd and 3rd best way?Sorry dont have citi rewards card üòÖ,btohqsg
Is it suppose to be 0amaze pts when using it overseas for grab ? I bind amaze card (crmc)to grab but so far did not see any amaze pts,btohqsg
to get the pts  u need to use the amaze card directly sirü´°,btohqsg
u won't earn any amaze points for local spends. Grab mcc is 4121  which is not excluded herehttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
10sgd above transaction then will get points,btohqsg
he talking about Amaze points  dun think Citi rewards TnC is relevant,btohqsg
when u don't see any points  are u using the card locally  or overseas?,btohqsg
Yea overseas. My bad  din know the 10sgd min.,btohqsg
probably not above $10 as pointed out by Chris,btohqsg
In thailand and malaysia can use airasia rides instead of grab  sometimes much cheaper,btohqsg
Amaze+Maybank family and friends (transport category) for Grab ride,btohqsg
The card game just make me headache.everytime.need to think what to use local and overseas. üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
My preferred cards for overseas usage is a combination of OCBC Frank and Maybank FnF. Does not apply for large payments though.,btohqsg
Hi  gurus   I‚Äôm new here  may I know I can add my sc Manhattan master to interam and use my amaze card to pay online foreign currency purchases? If do so  can get instapoint ? Thanks,btohqsg
yes  provided MCC not excluded.If paying in Jun  can make use of the 4x instapoint promo. Top up Amaze wallet using mastercard  use Amaze wallet make payment. No rewards on the mastercard though.,btohqsg
does CRMC give rewards to GRAB or GOJEK ?,btohqsg
^ yes to taxi rides/food  no to topups,btohqsg
This 1 spend with any cc is pooled right? E.g. everyday card and yuu card spending total per mth?,btohqsg
OCBC 360 interest is in today! those that tracks the 500 increase closely and need to transfer out better do it now.,btohqsg
For me I saw only the ‚Äúsave bonus ‚Äú is in from some reason. Can‚Äôt see the rest,btohqsg
That is true but depends on timing. I find it gd to use during grab urge period. Can save up to 7RM. per trip.,btohqsg
that's weird I can see salary and cc spend bonus too,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not using the card. But salary is in every month..,btohqsg
That is why the Max card is a potential game changer product to solve all these problems:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/100892,btohqsg
Yea but it also may become 1compromise lead to all your cards and with 3rd party . It's a hassle if ever shit happen,btohqsg
"the ""miles"" in this case is not the usual miles right? at this point we don't know what 1 mile is equivalent to I think.",btohqsg
Based on the FAQ: Max Miles can be pooled and converted at an approximate 1:1 ratio into air miles for dozens of the world's leading airlines and hotels. Alternatively  you can redeem them for cash at a rate of S$1 per 100 Max Miles.,btohqsg
"Correct. Not saying that this company is out to scam  but we should always be wary these days of ""new"" companies or payment methods.",btohqsg
have you done any background research on this company? somehow something just feels a bit off but I can't put a finger on it.,btohqsg
maybe it's due to one of my last bad experience with a company called Six which also had a referral scheme that started before official launch. I had so much referrals that I think I am the number one already. And guess what? after they collected all the personal data  they RESET the whole referral scheme  buy kept all the personal data collected.,btohqsg
sounds like a lot of effort and costs to pull this off. Will not be surprised if they charge any fee. But if they do then may not be worth it to use the Max Card.,btohqsg
also  many of us spend not based on which card give the most cashback  there are additional considerations eg. to make sure we meet the minimum sum for the month for any specific cards. for example if I'm clocking UOB to meet $2000 spend a month  I might use the card for purchase even if another card I own give higher cashback for a specific purchase.,btohqsg
We shall see once the product is launched. Need to do a bit of testing and review it myself,btohqsg
But for cash back card holders we need to clock min spend first so may not be that useful i guess,btohqsg
Yes. As they collected your card number as well. So it kind of worry.So probably have to take note about this. And many card have minimum amount to fulfilled not really sure how this card help too.,btohqsg
even if they do not charge you fee directly  the amount of data they collect from you is already worth a lot  if all your spending goes through them.,btohqsg
Do anyone happen to know the exclusion MCC for amaze 4% Cashback ? Thanks,btohqsg
Note also  need min $10 per transaction from Amaze wallet and 4x points max out at $125 spend per transaction,btohqsg

will get interest for jul balance if u fulfilled the min $500 card spend in jul. Interest to be credited in 2 Aug.,btohqsg
Criteria fulfilment - All follow calendar month (based on when transactions are posted)Increased interest - credited for criteria fulfilment in last month.,btohqsg
Is your UOB Evol statement month same as UOB one account calendar month? If it is not  you may need to track manually if your Evol qualified spend is at least $600 on calendar month.,btohqsg

Ask staff swipe 1k on amaze+citireward first,btohqsg
Remaining depend u want point direct to krisflyer or keep with citi,btohqsg
Depends on amount spend  and ur CRMC current limits. But overall i think 2 and 3 is a question u got to figure if u prefer earlier expiry (KF Ascend)  or store it later and transfer with other miles in ur CitiPM (beware of minimum transfer blocks),btohqsg
Thanks Queenie  i was thinking of that as well.,btohqsg
yeap  the expiry date is a headache,btohqsg

Assume your Amex is issued by American Express and not by local banks such as DBS and UOB  you can add your Amex into your e-wallet and use your phone as mobile contactless payment instead of tapping your Amex card.

Your diff is 1.7% which is perfectly ok. Given that you'll get bonus miles from your card valued at 3-5%. + 1% from instarem.,btohqsg
Is this with Amaze + CRMC? What about topping up the Amaze wallet and using that? How close is that to youtrip?,btohqsg
Amaze gives 1% rebate for overseas spend in terms of points in the app  so gotta factor that in too  coupled with whichever credit card rewards you'll earn,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt top up wallet. Can‚Äôt do that with MYR,btohqsg
whats the best interest rates now,btohqsg
I think what he meant is topup SGD to wallet and spend from wallet to get 4% rebate as points   instead of linking to CC for reward points .,btohqsg

Hi gurus  does HSBC Everyday + Rewards 1% on GIRO payments from EGA work for HDB mortgages?Ie say I‚Äôm paying my HDB mortgage via GIRO monthly (cash top up)Thanks,btohqsg

Omg!Time for me to head to HDB.Wondering if good to pay cash then get 1% rebate   then leave CPF OA alone.But I guess that depends if the cash can earn more than CPF OA,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  pls adv interest cal for EGA Apr to Jul. Eg Apr put in $150k  endJun need fund $30k. Bal $120k. At end of promotion in Jul   is interest calculation as follows: 150k x 4.xx%/12√ó3 months plus $120x4.xx%/12√ó1. Or bank only pay $120kx4.xx%x4months. TIA,btohqsg
For most people wont make much difference in the end,btohqsg
Can you confirm ? That‚Äôs like decent deal if can do for 5 years it‚Äôs like $500 savings,btohqsg
I am the one asking the qn but seems some had replied can. So I‚Äôm thinking of going to HDB and change my GIRO to HSBC EGA,btohqsg
I guess the use case is perhaps for people like me where I already used my CPF OA to pay but yet not enough so need to top up cash. So since no choice have to use case  so might as well earn the 1%,btohqsg
But if u have enough CPF to cover mortgage  then u need to research a bit more.CPF OA base interest 2.5%Right now bank higher yield saving account and money market funds giving upwards of 4%. So using CPF to pay now is better while cash stays in those instruments earning higher %But who knows next time the opposite happens where CPF OA 2.5% is higher than banks/ money market funds/ fixed income; Ah ‚Ä¶ then perhaps it‚Äôs better then to pay with cash n leave the OA alone earning higher %,btohqsg

yes for these 8% categories that are based on MCC,btohqsg
It's really a hassle when my two most often used cards (Maybank and BoC) are both not available on Gpay.,btohqsg

Which CC best to pay for pumping petrol?,btohqsg
For local use  can use Amaze+Citi rewards to get 10x points for max $1k in statement month so long MCC is not travel or other exclusions  even for offline spend. For direct conversion to cashback 10x points=2.27%. Save on fx fees if using Amaze+citi rewards overseas.Citi cashback card only gives higher rebate for groceries 8% and dining 6% and petrol 8%  and need min $800 monthly spend. Pair with Amaze to save on FX fees.,btohqsg
Can I understand your rationale for choose PM over Rewards. 1 point = 0.4 miles. $1 spend = 4 points = 1.6 miles  which shd be better than what PM offers  1.2 miles.The only benefit is PM nvr expire,btohqsg
If you're doing payall  the result earn rate is the same for both cards at 2.2 mpd,btohqsg

Just to add I watch Kelvin latest video on RSP investing  he mention FSMone. But I saw their pricing for SG EFT  there is minimum flat fee of 8.8 sgd. calculate fee for Tiger and SYFE  higher total fees about 2.1%,btohqsg
To my knowledge N personal experience  fees on STI ETF RSP on FSMOne does not cost so much.,btohqsg
Hi all  if i use UOB One to pay Keppel electric bill on AXS  I know it‚Äôs excluded from cashback  but does it count towards card spending?,btohqsg

I cancelled my Keppel electric account already after termination. The premise doesn‚Äôt appear on the Keppel electric website already so I can‚Äôt pay through the website. Am paying the final bill.,btohqsg

Anyone know if there is any hack to make payment to SG QR code? Previously was using Amex + Grabpay.. But since nerf  just want to confirm if UOB absolute + Grabpay is the only way to make payment? Xnap is not an acceptable payment option..,btohqsg

Hi all  need advice from the gurus here. UOB one account. To archive 4.2%  I know i need to clock $500 spending on UOB CC. Question‚Ä¶ if I spend $500 on the 1st of the month I will get 30 days of 4.2%pa? 15th I only entitled 15 days of 4.2%pa interest?,btohqsg
you get it for full month,btohqsg
As long as I spend $500 within the month  I will get the full interest for that month?,btohqsg
yes. i would believe all the similar accounts from other banks are like that as well,btohqsg
Is it your first month one Uob one card/account.You may have 15% cashback on Uob card if you spend $1k sgd on your first month,btohqsg
I am referring to this ?Has anyone gotten this reward of $20 by keeping csrd on file. How long does it take to fullfill this award. ?,btohqsg
Hi i first time buying T bills. Eh this competitive bid the yield i put 10%. How does it work?,btohqsg
competitive bid is the rate you are willing to accept. say if t-bill interest rate is less than 10% as what you indicated here  you won't get the t-bill application,btohqsg
Oh. Why they want to seperate competitive and non competitive bid?,btohqsg
some people prefer to set the rate they want. if non-competitive bid means whatever rate that t-bill allocate  will be what you get,btohqsg
if say the rate is 2.5% (just a possibility)  some people might not want to get that. so they rather set the rate so if it's lower than their preferred rate  they will not bid for the t-bill,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I think i understand. Because now interest rate high  most likely people dont use competitive rate. It is when interest rate low plus people using CPF  then they want to use competitive rate.,btohqsg
Hi guys  just to check  HSBC Revolution is not supported by Samsung Pay?,btohqsg
Hi experts  just have a question here about the HSBC EGA account. Currently I have monthly deductables to be billed to the account.I understand that the month after the 4 months bonus interest rates end  the best thing to do is to take out everything and put everything back the subsequent month.But since I still have my monthly deductables  what should I do to maximise my next 4 months of bonus interests?,btohqsg
If the cut off rate is more than 10%  then you will be alloted. If not  you will not get any.,btohqsg
just deposit the deductable amounts on the day of deduction?,btohqsg
but there will be a fee if we don't keep a minimum daily balance every month right? how can I avoid that?,btohqsg
Since I am depositing money for the deductibles.,btohqsg
If u depositing on the 5th month  there will not be fall under fee assuming 4th month avg daily balance is higher than $2000Either keep $2k average daily end-of-day balance for the monthor upgrade to Premier EGA,btohqsg
Hi krisflyer members  do they have bonus month for conversion from citi credit card to krismiles. Just like Qatar avios points,btohqsg
Premier EGA does not require average daily end-of-day balance?,btohqsg
is there a site or pdf that provided this info?,btohqsg
Hi  I assume u r referring to credit card sign up promotion with a spending requirement as one of the criteria.If the customer's spending hit the promotion's eligibility criterion and subsequently the spending is converted to installment plan  the customer would be disqualified because the term and conditions generally exclude spending for installment payment plan.The customer may call and check with the bank whether he/she is  disqualifed and put up the needful appeal. Outcome subject to bank approval.,btohqsg
strange I never got charged the service fee,btohqsg
If you transfer in $15k monthly to meet the total relationship balance requirement for Premier EGA account then no Service Fee,btohqsg
