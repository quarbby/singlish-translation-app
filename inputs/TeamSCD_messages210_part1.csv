Maybe your radiator fan died or thermostat stuck,btohqsg
My water temp at 80  oil at 90. But my radiator is changed  thermostat and fan switch both changed to Mugen. Before I did this change my oil would go around 100 to 105,btohqsg
Oh hmm got chance my thermostat I have yet to change too,btohqsg
Was thinking to change to spoon thermostat,btohqsg
Radiator fan I just changed like 6 months ago I think,btohqsg
The fan you saying is the switch ?,btohqsg
It's called a fan switch... Usually changed together with the thermostat,btohqsg
