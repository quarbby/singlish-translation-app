Moomoo & Tiger: T+2WeBull: T+1T = trading dayT + 1 means it takes 1 trading day to for the units to be settled and fund withdrawable back to bank.EgMoomoo if redeem Fullerton cash fund Monday 8am  u can only withdraw Tue evening earliest or Wed. Monday being 1st trading day and Tue being 2nd trading day.For WeBull  if u redeem Monday 8am  sometimes by end of Monday same day u can withdraw or by Tuesday morning next day can withdraw.This so important because your money in transit does not earn interest. So if it takes t+2  u lose 2 days where your cash could have earned interest.,btohqsg
The cash fund in webull is moneybull? Thanks,btohqsg
How u sign up giro doesn‚Äôt matter. Some services like HDB can signup eGiro where they use SingPass. Some like IRAS don‚Äôt have eGiro n u have to fill up their paper form.ImportantMost people who open HSBC bank account will open HSBC EGA. If u satisfy the everyday rewards + programme  u get 1% rebate on giro  available balance and credit card spend.So pay all GIRO bills by EGA is possible unless u have other strategies like credit card + CardUp.If u open EGA online  the bank does not have your physical signature and u need to visit the branch to provide.This happened to me coz HSBC called me up say they decline my paper GIRO application from IRAS as they cannot verify my signature on the IRAS form.,btohqsg
To addI pay by giro the followingIncome taxHDB mortgage cash top upInsuranceHDB Conservancy feesProperty taxAll of which I get back 1% about 2 working days after giro is settled and posted in my EGA.I am sure other bills by Giro will also get u 1%,btohqsg
Hi Zan  thanks for the reply.May I ask if I charge insurance and Hdb conservancy fees to HSBC credit card vs EGA GIRO ~ do I still get the 1% rebate? Thanks,btohqsg
NO!!!Don‚Äôt do thatThese are excluded categories in TnCIt won‚Äôt be counted towards any credit card point  rebates  etcDon‚Äôt do it,btohqsg
What's so good about the UOB lady credit card ?? The spending is only on specific categories. E.g  you can't get cashback on spending online such as laptops from DELL  Apple  and Lenovo.,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt buy laptops every month  but you eat every month. So for the dining - it‚Äôs a sweet deal for a mile chaser,btohqsg
if i make income tax payment via ipaymy but the amount does not fully cover the amount for a monthly instalment payment  will iras deduct the balance for the month or deduct the monthly amt?,btohqsg
In credit card world  there are cards for general spending and specialised spendingGeneral spending cards give u lower returns.Specialised credit cards give u higher returns.UOB Ladies card now gives u up to 6 miles per dollar during the promo period  it will go back to 4 miles per dollar after. So make hay when the Sun still shines and take advantage.UOB ladies card is a master card. Can combine with InstaRem .If u go overseas  InstaRem converts overseas spending to SGD. There by avoiding the 3.25% dynamic conversion fee on the card. U get 1% insta points + 6miles/dollaron your overseas travel.But if u don‚Äôt travel then this card is the highest miles card for now. If u collecting miles.Besides  u can combine with Kris+ app to increase your miles point and also take part in Kris + MasterCard challenge.If u can do all these   u Jedi-level card user already.,btohqsg
I understand now. So excluded categories (not eligible) spend under credit card will not earn the 1% spend.I thought it‚Äôs total amount spend on the credit card despite no HSBC points for those insurance amount. Thanks,btohqsg
Correct.Non eligible categories avoid spending on credit card. Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes others before u had made.,btohqsg
I need to switch out insurance premium from HSBC CC to EGA GIRO in order to earn the 1% rebate. Thanks so much Zan,btohqsg
The only credit card that allows for insurance premiums payment areMaybank platinum visa 3.33%UOB Absolute 1.7%Other AMEX cards.But depends if u can even pay with AMex.Otherwise u can use UOB Absolute to top up GrabPay MasterCard to get 0.3% then use GrabPay master card to pay the insurance and get no rewards. If u are that desperate to earn 0.3% that is. U can do this while waiting for your GIRO to be approved. But too much hassle imho,btohqsg
Same.. Called UOB and to wait few more days..,btohqsg
Any gurus here know how to earn rebates on VCMA ie voluntary contribution to MediSave ?Coz now I see only can pay using Paynow.Not more by credit cards.,btohqsg
If I add amaze with link to Citi rewards still earn 4mpd right ? Or it has to add Citi rewards card only ?,btohqsg
amaze accepts several master cards. Just make sure u default the payment to the chosen MasterCard.If u added Citi Rewards to amaze  then yes  u will earn the 4mpd up to $1k spend. This 1k is not a amaze limit but the Citi rewards 4mpd eligible spending/ month limit.,btohqsg
So like for grab etc can link amze directly also to be ease ofMind when to link which for Citi rewards 4mpd,btohqsg
I use it for their debit card,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt so I can‚Äôt advise. But I will need to sign up FSMone in the future to do the CPF shielding hack for my special account and buy into the Nikko AM Shenton bond fund.,btohqsg
First time I hear FSM1 have card,btohqsg
GrabPay MasterCard I think cannot add to amaze if I not wrong.It‚Äôs a prepaid credit card not the usual credit card,btohqsg
Ooo  I mean amaze credit card for grab rides payment,btohqsg
1% cashback on all purchases except blacklisted categoriesCan also use for SimplyGo,btohqsg
I seeU want to stack amaze rewards?But the amaze 1% on overseas spend only right?But no harm la. U can just use Amaze linked to Citi rewards locally or overseas. Overseas got extra InstaRem 1%.But make sure to meet Min spending quota for Citi rewards ya,btohqsg
simplyGo the best cashback is the SC smart credit card giving you 6‚ÑÖ without minimum spending  if I am correct,btohqsg
Eh?U only getting 1%But most credit cards give a lot more.Why u using debit card ?,btohqsg
Ya  just like some need amaze for 4mpd and some not so wondering if can just link for all expenses then no need to think when use just know except travel only . There min spending for Citi rewards ?,btohqsg
U are half rightFor SimplyGoBest card is DBS live fresh 5% + 5% eco rewards = 10%Next is UOB ONE3.33% base + 5% for SimplyGo = 8.33% for($500/$1000 per month quota).3.33% base + 6.67% = 10% for($2k/mth quota)Next is SC Smart6% for simply Go coz promo periodNext yr 1 Jan 2024 will go back to 5%  unless they extend.,btohqsg
Wait  I forgot about UOB EVOL 6.67% for SimplyGo alsoBut the is one need to be mobile contactlessIf take out card n tap won‚Äôt get rewards. Need to pay thro phone,btohqsg
Will still get rewards  only 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
Don't earn enough to qualify for credit cards,btohqsg
I see.I can‚Äôt advise on debit cards since I haven‚Äôt done research which ones give the best rebates.,btohqsg
UOB evol gives 0.03% on SimplyGo?,btohqsg
Sorry my bad. UOB Evol on SimplyGo will get 6.67% when pay by mobile contactless. My 0.3% is referring to SimplyGo using the card itself,btohqsg
is okay  thanks for your help anyways,btohqsg
Oh yaThat sucks. My friend kena before this 0.3%. Once bitten twice shy.He never bring the card out anymore.,btohqsg
If the GMPC was topped up from a credit card  you cannot use that balance to pay for insurance anymore,btohqsg
Anyone know if I get any miles if I top up YouTrip card with Citi Premiermiles card?,btohqsg
I think cannot since this is considered prepaid wallet.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks a lot. üí™üèª,btohqsg
Any top ups to anywhere generally do not have rewards...,btohqsg
The rate seems better than moomoo?,btohqsg
Intraday rounding error.Fullerton cash fund is the same across all the brokerages. Check the ticker symbol.Tiger usually updates their rates quiet fast  then I notice moomoo and WeBull follow.,btohqsg
Not true  just not thought axs  if direct on insurer web still can,btohqsg
Yes like I already said simplyGo the best cashback is the SC smart credit card giving you 6‚ÑÖwithout minimum spendingThe other 3 cards you mentioned need to meet minimum spending which our transportation spending is probably less than $100 per month,btohqsg
https://help.grab.com/passenger/en-sg/360038784491-Why-can%E2%80%99t-I-use-my-GrabPay-Card-at-some-merchantsI suppose someone has to take the risk and try it out ('selected insurance providers'). Then again  one could always contact Grab support to transfer the top up back to your bank account if the insurance payment doesn't work.,btohqsg
Why are you still using Grab? They are trash now!,btohqsg
If I use XNAP - HSBC REVO at food centres  will I get 4mpd?,btohqsg
