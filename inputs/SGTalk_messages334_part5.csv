isn’t the point of earning more to provide your offspring with a more comfortable life than you had,btohqsg
My kids should suffer like I did,btohqsg

How many points did he have at the start?,btohqsg
Not necessarily but depends on how you wanna educate your kids lah there’s no right or wrong some parents wants the kids to learn the hard way or smt,btohqsg
For me I take already sure go to toilet. My stomach can't take it,btohqsg
maybe should put milk in your coffee or drink 😳,btohqsg
But he tiongxim. Does that add pointsM,btohqsg
So what can he do to add points?,btohqsg
I think the question is  would you treat you child the same way your parents treated you,btohqsg
the yes or no to the questions are quite self-explanatory,btohqsg
Maybe my childhood quite not bad,btohqsg
then your mami and daddi did a good job in raising you,btohqsg
if I treat them exactly my parents treated me  they’ll be Ralph Lauren and designer kids,btohqsg
But I’d want them to help in household chores,btohqsg
but if you were to raise them up just as you were  why wouldn't they help you out?,btohqsg
I didn’t touch household chores at all as a kid,btohqsg
so I’d want them to learn how to do them,btohqsg
but if your parents were to ask you to do them  would you have done it,btohqsg
i'm pretty sure it's a yes right,btohqsg
Depends on what first because I cannot carry heavy things,btohqsg
thanks  proving my point.with positive communication  even if you're not accustomed to that lifestyle  you can still do it.so no reason to be a jail warden for your kids!!,btohqsg
