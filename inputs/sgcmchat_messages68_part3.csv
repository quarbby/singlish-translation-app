The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is certainly changing the automotive industry  and it's possible that the passion for car spotting could decline in the EV era.One reason for this is that electric cars tend to have a more uniform design compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. EVs often have a sleek and aerodynamic design that is optimized for efficiency rather than style. This may make it more difficult for car enthusiasts to spot unique and interesting cars on the road.Additionally  the sound of an engine is often a significant factor in the appeal of traditional cars  and EVs are much quieter  which could lead to a reduction in the excitement of car spotting.However  it's important to note that the EV market is still relatively new  and there will likely be a wide range of designs and styles for electric vehicles in the future. As EV technology continues to advance  there may be new and exciting features that car enthusiasts will appreciate  such as innovative charging systems or high-tech autonomous driving capabilities.Overall  it's difficult to predict the future of car spotting in the EV era  but it's possible that the passion for spotting unique and interesting cars may shift towards other aspects of the automotive industry.,btohqsg

If anyone wants to start assetto corsa or pc car games this is a good way to start 🙈Can try to nego as much as possible cos i know its quite an old pc  but can still run things decently🙃,btohqsg
just because mobile phones are a thing doesn't mean house phone aren't,btohqsg
if there's a market  there's someone that will make them,btohqsg
i.e the recent surge in optional manual transmissions,btohqsg
yes. like for instance CB400 Revo doesnt have a pillion bar cover like the older Spec versions have so one of my S4 brothers drew up a carbon fiber sketch and got it manufactured on demand.,btohqsg
why get over your ex when you can just lead a car chase all across the island and die in a crash at 230 instead,btohqsg

𝙃𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙖 𝘿𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙖(translated as Worldly Treasure from Malay)Maserati GranTurismoTrying out my Sony A6000 for edits for the first time  I'd say it's alright with the kit lens  though its limitations are becoming clear with more use.It's been raining so much these past few days so I wanted to capture the lack of warmth with the tones of the background (done in Lightroom). Last pic is a concept that is warmer overall but decided not to do.What an cool car to see in person  in my neighbourhood carpark no less.∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆#sony#sonysingapore#sonya6000#maserati#singaporecars#v8#photographyhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CpcQH-VuC3t/?igshid=MWMzM2Q4ZmE=,btohqsg
