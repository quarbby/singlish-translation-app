Hello! I‚Äôd like to ask a question regarding timeline for application for completed SBF.May I know if this is correct/realistic?:1. February -  HDB SBF exercise2. ‚Å†April - results3. ‚Å†June - HDB appointments4. ‚Å†August - key collection5. ‚Å†September - BSC rectification6. ‚Å†October - start of renovation7. ‚Å†December - completion and moving in,btohqsg
it really depends on your ballot number ya. it's not a guarantee thing. also the unit you applied for. if it's fully ready  you can expect to move in by 2025. if it's new project & still under u/c  then you need to wait. SBF is not only new units. together with repo old hdb units as well.you also need to consider renovation timeline. depending on your house. if it's 2R can expect 8 weeks. the bigger the house the longer you may need to wait.one thing for sure  you must manage your expectations because you're not the only one that wants to move in fast üòÖ someone else situation/timeline may differ than yours.,btohqsg

Where to find individual chat for specific project?,btohqsg
Which ones are you looking for?,btohqsg
Hello  do you be know completion date of hougang citrine?,btohqsg
Should be Q1 this year based on the Estimated Completion Date (ECD). If you haven‚Äôt received the appointment means HDB hasn‚Äôt cleared the inspections yet. ECD is usually the earliest date they may be able to handover the keys. There‚Äôs another date which is the Delivery Posession Date (DPD) which is when HDB must contractually handover the keys otherwise they have to compensate the buyers.,btohqsg
Edited my reply for more clarity,btohqsg
Should be at least 1 year to get to key collection.,btohqsg
Does this mean the unit im choosing is without bedroom walls like the white flat concept or?,btohqsg
Haha i noticed that all sbf projects dispaying the same thing üòÖ,btohqsg
What does repurchased flat mean tho? üòÖ,btohqsg
Repossessed by HDB or the owners divorced or cancelled their flat application,btohqsg
Hello  can I check for SBF  the application is by estate? Eg if there are 4 projects in Yishun available for SBF. Am I able to choose from all 4? Or is it by project! Thank you in advance,btohqsg
Does sbf also follow the prime..etc MOP period?,btohqsg
"I think only for those unit u clicked with ""^"" this symbol",btohqsg
as far as I know  it wont  since all are old projects prior to oct 24,btohqsg
Hmm  how do we see the application rate,btohqsg
"Hello all  can I just clarify that the ""number of units"" is = to current available units for SBF for this exercise?",btohqsg
Bto and sbf units are separate,btohqsg
Yes  so meaning for eg  as per above  AMK there's total of 47 units available for SBF?,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone know where to find the sales brochure for the individual sales launch for sbf ?,btohqsg
Hi  all these 15-45 years lease only for seniors?,btohqsg
disclaimer: here‚Äôs what i think.. but i may be wrong.these are repurchased flats so lesser remaining lease. but you need to have the lease cover you until at least 95 years old.so min the age is 50 years old. i think in singapore  50 years old not considered seniors yet.,btohqsg
Is the grant for sbf base on new flat or resale flat,btohqsg
yes and but they also have the option to buy 99 years lease but that really depends on circumstances,btohqsg
ya i was looking at it also. but i really dont know as younger singles whether can apply anot.,btohqsg
cos resale can buy older flats but just that grant and cpf usage etc will be affected,btohqsg
not sure if sbf is the same,btohqsg
Is the grant for sbf base on new flat or resale flat?,btohqsg
also wondering the same. but i guess will be new.cos resale grant is alot more. and the sbf price is closer to bto.,btohqsg
hi guys   need advise . if havent married yet   just put NO or still put yes,btohqsg
"""no"" since you have yet to obtain marriage certificate",btohqsg
Anyone knows where to check the income ceiling for this feb 2025 bto projects?,btohqsg
Based on BTO grants and not resale grants,btohqsg
Does a stated remaining lease of 62 years indicate that the flat is new?,btohqsg
It is not new. But repossessed by HDB. So you can buy it if it covers the youngest buyer to 95,btohqsg
Hi can check   just an example   my grant is $30k and combine cpf OA is $60k   total 90k   can this 90k be used for downpayments?,btohqsg
Hi can check   just an example   my grant is $30k and combine cpf OA is $60k   total 90k   can this 90k be used for downpayments?,btohqsg
under the price there will be a * to indicate its a repurchased flat.. scroll down to see,btohqsg
No. Resale is sold by current owners  hence have factors like more grants and COV to be considered.,btohqsg
My bto complete in 2028 or end of 2027. Can pm me your name? So i can refer to in the future.Currently surverying IDs haha,btohqsg
price not the same thats why more grants provided,btohqsg
was reading the t&c and came across this,btohqsg
It means you can‚Äôt use the grant to pay down the cash portion. Example if you take a bank loan  part of the downpayment needs to be in cash  not cpf/ grants. That is the portion you can‚Äôt use the grant for.,btohqsg
