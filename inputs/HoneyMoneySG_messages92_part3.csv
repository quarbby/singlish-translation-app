It have to be under their own name as mention quite a few time before when u ask question about krisflyer membership. U CANT CLOCK MILES USING THEIR MEMBERHSIP OR THEY CANT CLOCK MILES USING YOUR MEMBERHSIP,btohqsg
Ok thank you sir for helping me.,btohqsg

Hi can I clarify/double checkI have a UOB ppv card. For first $1110 I get 4mpd on spending. Afterwards 0.4mpdIf I buy a $1.5k item  $1110 of it would earn 4mpd and the remaining would earn 0.4mpd right? Don‚Äôt need be single receipt less than $1110 right?,btohqsg
Does ocbc 365 cc has any promotion. Can't seems to see any  should I wait longer for a promotion to be out then sign up. I just created a 360 acc,btohqsg
Any option traders here? Would love to connect :),btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry for the confusing term ‚Äútrader‚Äù. While I‚Äôm a net option seller  I don‚Äôt trade. I average about $1k USD a month now. I would love to connect with like-minded people.,btohqsg
Nice! I hope the journey‚Äôs been well for you!,btohqsg
For those that apply for Citi card via Sing saver  am I guaranteed a ipad rewards if I hit 500 within a single month spend?,btohqsg
why not trade on the daily? do you know how to do TA? or what other confirmations do you use,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a question of why or why not. I‚Äôm doing it this way because it suits my investment style and it would be quite windy to justify it right here.,btohqsg
you trade on patterns? or which indicators or analysis do you use?,btohqsg
Just simple MACD and RSI but most importantly on underlying I don‚Äôt mind getting assigned on.How‚Äôs your options trading journey?,btohqsg
just macd and rsi is able to keep you consistent monthly? thats awsome!,btohqsg
While I don‚Äôt think using those indicators are what contributed to my consistent profit  I believe overcomplicated strategies in investing does little good to majority of the people. See many major successful fund managers out there. They have boring portfolios but they have double digit returns track records.,btohqsg
You sell cash secured puts and then sell covered call if assigned?,btohqsg
Yes  while it‚Äôs not as capital efficient as say like verticals or condors  it helps me make decent income monthly so I am contented with it.,btohqsg
I have btc in hard wallet. Which platform is recommended if I intend to sell and withdraw to my bank?,btohqsg
Hi all some food for thought.With the closure of SA next year  some of you are thinking of setting aside FRS of 426k at 55 to with $4460 at 70 hoping to live until 100 so he will collect $1.6m.but do u know that your 426k given to cpf at the age of 55 of compound 4% for 45 yrs would become $2.5m. so u think u r ripping cpf off by living longer but actually cpf still wins if they can generate 4% yield yoy with ur money.,btohqsg
Same food for thought  where else can find an almost risk free $4460 payout for 45 years with 426K investment?,btohqsg
Am I still consider a new customer for opening SC Bonusaver if I'm holding to SC Esaver account ?,btohqsg
100 years old? Seriously not even sure if the person brain is working properly even if manage to live that long.,btohqsg
Will i earn 3mpd for uob krisflyer + amaze for dining spend in thailand?,btohqsg
Interest earned $426k x 4%  = $17040 per year or $1420 per month.How much we can get per month from CPF if have $426k in RA after retired?If the amount is more than $1420 per month. I believe that remaining amount given to members will be withdrawn from $426k. The interest earned next year will be lesser because smaller amount in RA?,btohqsg
A win-win situation. $ for the next generation.,btohqsg
Yeah agree. Win win for everyone. Good for normal people to get monthly fixed guaranteed income and good for government to have enough $,btohqsg
If I have HSBC life insurance  am I still eligible to be a new customer for ega and credit card promotion?,btohqsg
yes  new. Join the flash deal tomorrow 12pmhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/174576,btohqsg
I apply SC card through singsaver on 18 dec till now never receive $300 reward . Is it normal ?,btohqsg
Food for thought  slight correction to your calculations:426k compounded at 4% for 15 years with no withdrawals is 775k775k compounding at 4% but withdrawing $4460 monthly will only last you 21-22 years of withdrawals.So if you live till 100  you‚Äôre indeed getting a better deal from CPF than if you were to try and DIY your own CPF LIFE.It‚Äôs even worse if you tried to DIY CPF LIFE payouts starting from age 65  you would run out of money by the time you‚Äôre 80.,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. For the qualifying spend here clauses here with payment to insurance company means that HSBC life insurance payment can be used to clock the spend?,btohqsg
Thanks for the calculations. Though I still wonder why people are still so against CPF Life,btohqsg
Lots of numbers flying around.I also dunno whose are accurate whose are inaccurate.,btohqsg
You're welcome to double check my numbers üôÇ I used the following calculators:https://www.360financialliteracy.org/Calculators/Savings-Distribution-Calculatorhttps://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator,btohqsg
I‚Äôm for CPF life (but just at FRS levels).So I‚Äôm with you‚Ä¶.. hahahaha.,btohqsg
I can understand if someone is against it as a matter of principle cos it's a forced insurance scheme  if they say they want to control what they do with their money etc. etc.But if one accepts the idea that it is an insurance scheme  then naturally some must win and some must lose for it to mathematically work out for the cohort  and so if one's calculations show that everyone is losing badly either 1) something is very wrong with the system and no one has noticed 2) the calculations are wrongüòä,btohqsg
Question.  Do dividends paid out to SRS accounts add to the annual cap automatically (tracked as contribution)?,btohqsg
I also think that while we may have a lot of attention and energy to manage our own investments right now  by the time we get to 55/65/70 we may just decide to heck it and settle for a guaranteed return instead üòÇ,btohqsg
some need to wait up to 5 month   some is quick processing ( only if its stated ) else mostly is 5 months,btohqsg
