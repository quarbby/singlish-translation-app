üéâPika World Daily Review ‚Äì 4 November 2022üéâüß∏The Bond Yield is screamingüí∏Even as we see the volatility index calming  bond yield continued to hammer the equity market as stocks fell broadly on Thursday  with investors digesting a new reality that rates are likely to remain elevated for extended periods.Technology stocks bear the massive brunt of the risk-off sentiments  with Dow performing the best. The two-year treasury yield rose to 4.699%  a record multi-year high  while the 10-year yield rose to 4.123%. This supports the dollar and adds pressure to many MNCs with a bulk of sales overseas.üçÑThinning profit margin: A headwind aheadüî≠The strength of the dollar is providing a fresh headache outlook for companies who are having a large customer base overseas. Moreover  as interest rates rise  slower economic growth means poorer profit margins due to interest expenses eating into the margin.While sales are likely to rise higher given the inflation that pushes prices  profit margins are hurting for many companies  with the costs rising faster than what they could transfer to consumers. This means earnings growth tends to moderate  and the valuation of stocks has to come down to meet the new reality.Already  many companies have communicated such an outlook to investors as they provide weaker guidance for the next quarter.Pika World maintains the outlook of earnings recession as the next catalyst for equity pricing re-rating should economic demand materially adjust downwards.üßÆPaypal: Good result  poor guidanceüî´Pika World continues to be hurt by the stock despite good progress made for its latest earnings report. The downside comes from its guidance below estimates  sending its shares to tumble in the after-hour.The company is now focusing on ‚Äúprofitable growth‚Äù with an eye on ‚Äúcost discipline‚Äù as its CEO outlined a plan for massive savings in the coming year. It also has a $15 billion share-repurchase program.Pika World maintains its position on the counter while expecting more pain ahead as the macro environment softens.üìÆWhat‚Äôs on the menu today?üìñAt 8.30 pm  we will have a string of job data. Most important is the Non-Farm payroll  which we expect a meaningful decline to 200K from 263K in the prior period.Average hourly earnings for YoY in October should decline to 4.7% from 5% in the prior period.Unemployment should see an uptick to 3.6% from 3.5%.It is essential that we get a terrible job report so that the Fed can tone down on its monetary tightening stance.It is 4 November  Friday  at 8.55 am in Singapore and 8.55 pm in New York. It has been a volatile trading week  and Pika World wishes all friends a profitable trading week!,btohqsg

Citigroup downgrade Nano.$Nanofilm(MZH.SI)Citi downgrades Nanofilm to 'sell' as it sees a 'challenging path ahead' for the groupCiti Research analyst Jame Osman has downgraded his recommendation on Nanofilm Technologies to ‚Äúsell‚Äù from ‚Äúbuy‚Äù previously.In his Nov 3 report  Osman explains that the downgrade comes due to two key factors.First  the analyst expects the deceleration in Nanofilm‚Äôs topline momentum to persist in the near-term. Uncertainty over the trajectory of a recovery in the industry‚Äôs value chain also poses a key downside risk  he explains.‚ÄúThe deceleration in Nano‚Äôs revenue growth (at 10% y-o-y for the 9MFY2022 ended Sept 30) was concerning to us particularly given the comparatively low base in 3QFY2021 due to previous supply chain delays pushing out FY2021‚Äôs seasonal peak production into 1QFY2022 ‚Äù Osman notes.He adds: ‚ÄúManagement attributed the 3QFY2022 weakness to value chain disruption in China  including key FATP players such as Foxconn. Management expects this to persist into 4QFY2022  while an eventual recovery may be predicated on its key Customer Z‚Äôs supply chain strategies in China going forward.‚Äù‚ÄúThis poses downside risk to current expectations for Nanofilm given its significant production exposure in Shanghai  in our view ‚Äù he continues.Second  Nanofilm‚Äôs plans to scale up its production capacity across several markets are likely to mean front-loaded gestation costs. The costs are also likely to put pressure on the group‚Äôs margins. At the same time  revenue contribution from Nanofilm‚Äôs potential new customers will contribute meaningfully only from FY2024 onwards.On this  the analyst has cut his earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the FY2022 to FY2024 by 8% to 18%. The lower EPS estimates are mainly to factor in lower revenue growth as well as lower margin assumptions.Osman has also raised his weighted average cost of capital (WACC) assumption to 8.3% (from 7.5%) factoring a higher risk-free rate of 3.5%. His terminal growth rate assumption is also lowered to 2.0%.On this  the analyst has slashed his target price to $1.55 from $3.18.‚ÄúDespite the 54% year-to-date (ytd) share price decline (versus the Straits Times Index‚Äôs 3% decline)  we now anticipate further headwinds ahead driven by an uncertain demand recovery as well as margin pressure from capacity expansion plans ‚Äù he writes.‚ÄúIn our bear case scenario  we see a further 47% downside from current levels [of $1.79 as at Nov 2] ‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúOur revised target price and FY2023 EPS imply a P/E ratio of 14x versus [an] EPS compound annual growth rate or CAGR of 8% over the FY2022-FY2024.‚Äù,btohqsg

With the Federal Reserve  European Central Bank and Bank of England all delivering a supersized 75 basis point rate hike in their latest policy meetings  analysts warned about the economic risks of rapid rate rises that could take a toll on energy demand. A fresh rally in the dollar also pressured oil prices  as well as lingering uncertainties surrounding China‚Äôs Covid Zero policy. These demand factors have recently overshadowed a tightening supply outlook ahead of winter  with OPEC+ implementing large output cuts from this month  while the European Union ban on Russian oil is set to take effect in December.,btohqsg

Everyone to keep ‰∏âÂäõin watchlist.(Earlier call out when price $0.087 to $0.090)I believe this is going to be one of my power calls come 2023 similar to the below gang- LHN call $0.099 (3-4x)- Hanwell call $0.198 (2x)- GKE call $0.067 (3x)- PanUnited call $0.280 (1.7x) etc and many more.This counter more for investment than trading at this point still. But I see it getting liquid soon and as we all know liquidity comes at a premium.Meantime  those who have holding power can consider hard. Do your own research too.The very least  put in your watchlist.I‚Äôve scanned and did plenty of research and there‚Äôs plenty of catalyst coming for this IMO.Will share more soon.DYODDHave a nice weekend,btohqsg
