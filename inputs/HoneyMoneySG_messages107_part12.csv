I just need to make sure that I do the exceed the total amount of taxes I am supposed to pay?,btohqsg
Hey i got money but dont know what to do invest,btohqsg
OK. I had same thoughts. Giro once set and they will occur deduction on specific day. If the CardUp deduction  which is most likely after the Giro deduction date  you need to key in the amount that you need to pay all remaining amt after offsetting the amount that you will be deducted from Giro of the particular month.Hope my long sentence is well understood.,btohqsg
Hi all.. talking about GIRO.. I've my hsbc ega giro for dbs credit cards approved yesterday.. my dbs cc payment due date is 20 may.. do u think the giro will take effect or I need to manually pay this month?,btohqsg
If u already receive the dbs statement before the approval  I don't think it will giro this mth.For my uob statement  it will state giro payment if that statement will be deduct via giro.,btohqsg
Ahh I see.. I will pay off my bill then,btohqsg
Will I be eligible if I had closed my webull account previously and re-open it for this campaign?,btohqsg
Ya dont risk it. Better pay now. Next month only giro,btohqsg
Is it worth while to convert SGD to USD for the mmf USD 5%?or mmf SGD 3.6%?any1 done the calculation is it worth the conversion?,btohqsg
Depends on your view on usd/sgd and also the fx spread applied.I would generally say don‚Äôt convert unless u have use for the foreign currency upon maturity.,btohqsg
Assuming you convert SGD to USD and convert USD back to SGD within 30 mins or less  how many % was loss in FX spread?,btohqsg
Anyone receive qualfied sms for hsbc everyday reward for the month of June 24?,btohqsg
True  for now I don't have use for USD. Just attracted to the high interest 5%.But for longer term like 6mth or so  if u constantly get the 5%  it should outweighs the fx spread?,btohqsg
But the April SMS covers until 31 May. So should be ok I guess?,btohqsg
What about expected usd depreciation if US cut interest rates,btohqsg
Not sure how many % the spread they charge you  but I know credit card charges 3.25% fx spread. You earn 5%/2= 2.5% in 6 month  then‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Yeah. Cover only til May. Wonder if the promo continue to June and beyond?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know which credit card is good to apply?I do travel quite alot and most of my expenditures are in overseas.,btohqsg

Noob question on Amaze. I‚Äôm using iPhone  so can‚Äôt use the Apple Pay function to store the amaze card for transactions. That means I can only use Amaze by tapping the physical card during payment? Thanks.,btohqsg
hi all  for cardup  can i still use the recurring payment promo if i signed up using referral? and also  can i change the promo as and when or it will be fixed from the first payment?,btohqsg
iPhone user here too  the only way to use amaze for us is to tap physical card,btohqsg
Hi All  just to check. I have been in 6.8% promo in Moomoo and getting the daily interest. is it worth to redeem the daily interest and park it in GXS to get more interest? Any body tried out this?,btohqsg
does anyone know how to turn off auto pay for trust card?,btohqsg
Ya  contactless not possible for your case,btohqsg
Online say can store in apple pay  not so sure if is accurate. Do check again for more info,btohqsg
Hi Mouse Hunter  may I know how many days did it take for you to receive the bonus interest at the end of the 60 day holding period for this Moomoo 6.8% promotion ? The last day of my 60 days was last Thursday  I have not received the bonus interest till today.,btohqsg
Unfortunately you ask the wrong person. Moomoo has never good to me. For every moomoo promo I participated  moomooalwaysmissed to release the rewards to me and I have to keep chasing them via chat many many times. Moomoo always admitted they missed to give me the rewards.,btohqsg
Because they are mouse. They won‚Äôt like mouse hunter,btohqsg
Mine always on time at day 0 plus 1  but my spouse random  sometimes 0 plus 1  sometimes need to ask manually,btohqsg
Thanks. I wait a few more days and if still didn‚Äôt receive then will take Mouse Hunter‚Äôs advice to ask Moomoo.,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you know if UOB lady's travel category includesTrip.com?,btohqsg

there is fx risk   1 month ago sgd to usd is 0.7322 and now its 0.7417So yes there is such risk involved,btohqsg
like month i just brought voo valued at 3000sgd   even though it went up in terms of value   but overall when converted back to sgd i am still making a loss because i purchase usd at 0.736 but now its 0.741,btohqsg
I believe u need to use their portal to convert sgd to usd.The rate is not favourable,btohqsg
i was using ibkr it is the market rate at the time i was changing SGD to USD,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt u transfer in usd cash?,btohqsg
u see the 2 numbers i circled?Thats the fx risk that could happen,btohqsg
There‚Äôs something that I want to clarify about this Altitude card. For local spend  you are awarded with 1.3mpd.The miles are awarded based on single transaction or the total amount of month end statement?If I paid $9.90 for a meal  I will be awarded 1 DBS point only?If my monthly statement is $99.90 for local send  I will be awarded 19 DBS points?Am I right or I‚Äôm missing out something?,btohqsg
You will earn 9.9√∑5x3.25 = 6 (round down) DBS points for $9.90 transaction when it posts. Minimum $1.54 local transaction for 1 DBS point.,btohqsg
Hi  just want to ask  for the Citi Rewards + Amaze card  if I use the Amaze card to tap on SimplyGo transactions  will it be rewarded bonus 10X points? I'm aware that Citi Credit Cards can't get bonus points for SimplyGo,btohqsg
Am I right to say that I will need to spend at least $1.54 per transaction to get 1 DBS point? Lesser than $1.54  I will get nothing DBS point?,btohqsg
Nowadays if below 5$.. I use air miles card.. above 5$ then use uob preferred visa,btohqsg
1 thing I dislike about hsbc 1 travel is card point will expire after 3 years.Not like citi premier miles or dbs Altitude card. No expire,btohqsg
