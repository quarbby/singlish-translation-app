Economics is a social science  not arts,btohqsg
It is very useful neverthelessJamus Lin is econs graduate üòÇ,btohqsg
But for A levels they classify it as arts,btohqsg
demand and supply as in higher demand but lower supply == higher cost,btohqsg
how do I start learning hakka,btohqsg
HAHAHA I‚Äôm honoured that you actually remember I‚Äôm Hakka lol,btohqsg
tried to speak to my grandaunt but i didn't know hakka at all,btohqsg
Ermz the only reason why I was able to pick up Hakka was because my grandma‚Äôs MT is Hakka  so it started by like asking my Mother what my grandma was saying  and I picked it up.After my grandma passed away  I maintained it by switching to Hakka rather than Mandarin to speak to my mother.,btohqsg
HAHA tbh language abit hard to pickup unless you will be using it,btohqsg
So are you going to pick it up or did you just give up ayyyy,btohqsg
What you can do is learn languages online. You can arrange for 1 to 1 sessions with a teacher who can teach you everything. I'm learning cantonese now through online lessons. Best if you can read Chinese characters well,btohqsg
I‚Äôd be surprise if there are Hakka courses available,btohqsg
I have to  for my grandaunt,btohqsg
I want to know what she's saying,btohqsg
Hakka is always one of the last thought of dialect,btohqsg
Personally  I find Singapore cantonese is not really what I want to learn. I prefer the guangzhou dialect,btohqsg
Let me see if the website i use has it,btohqsg
Ye  start one word by one word.,btohqsg
I can't find any on the website I use  but I found a malaysian on another website,btohqsg
My teacher for cantonese is amazing. Expect to spend some time though. They use Á≤§Êñá not normal chinese for example‰Ω†ËøëÊéíÈªûÂëÄÔºüIn mandarin it is ‰Ω†ÊúÄËøëÊÄéÊ†∑ÂïäÔºüThey also teach you how to translate.I want to learn Shanghainese next. I can only speak a few words of shanghainese so I want to learn more.,btohqsg
Translate as in  read a mandarin text in cantonese,btohqsg
Ye  they might politically be classified the same main language but there are vocabs that exists in some dialects but not others.,btohqsg
Very. The best way to learn is to talk to a native. And force yourself to talk. Books  online materials only get you so far.My cantonese teacher always corrects my pronunciation. And he also introduces the six tones with yutping which most cantonese speakers won't know.I can't find a suitable one from Guangzhou so I had to find one from Hong Kong.,btohqsg
The syntax is different and the vocabulary can be very similar but can be very different,btohqsg
If you know mandarin  it may be to your advantage  but it may be to your disadvantage.,btohqsg
Although I think it is an advantage overall,btohqsg
Ya i fully agree with the first point. I cant keep still n focus on books or materials for longer than 1 min anyway too,btohqsg
Okay then maybe learning from a family member in daily convo is effective i guess?,btohqsg
Yep  I figured out why I couldn‚Äôt find a Hakka translation for some Mandarin stuff after I took a Chinese Linguistics mod in Uni. I was looking for something that doesn‚Äôt exist. HAHA,btohqsg
Because your cantonese would be mandarin based which is bad. You will rely on mandarin vocabulary which is wrong.For example  in cantonese  ËèúÂçï is called È§êÁâå. Or change money is Âî±Èí±. It is very different.The syntax is also different. The expressions are also different.For example  you cannot say Âêó in cantonese. It is ÂëÄ,btohqsg
For example  ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàdoesn‚Äôt exist in Hakka  why in Hakka is ÂÅö‰ªÄ‰πà  which is also What in Mandarin and Hakka. In Hakka  whether it is Why or What depends on how you phrase the question.,btohqsg
My family can't speak well. They would call a school ‰π¶È¶Ü which is archaic. It is like mandarin  Â≠¶Ê†°.,btohqsg
Or say malay words in between,btohqsg
Actually i find that interestingLike they actually have synonyms for chinese vocabs,btohqsg
No wonder many malaysians say something like that in mandarin. Thanks for the insight,btohqsg
I tot peranakans are majorly teochew,btohqsg
What do you mean by synonyms for chinese vocabs,btohqsg
Well  my great grandfather married a woman from Sanshui or Sam Sui  Foshan  Guangdong. That's where the term samsui women comes from,btohqsg
Not always. But I am still learning so I'm not amazing.Sometimes it is easier to explain in english. For example  ÊÉ≥ in cantonese only covers 'want'. Not 'think'. Think is Ë´ó,btohqsg
My father isn't. Only my mother is. Not sure if I count,btohqsg
But my parents don't speak much mandarin.,btohqsg
Not even malay  because they somehow chose chinese over malay for MTL,btohqsg
The whole pass down heritage on Father side is a social construct,btohqsg
I find it hard to communicate with hongkong ppl or cantonese,btohqsg
I don't identify as peranakanBut my family loves mee siam for Chinese New Year. And curry. Not really any chinese food,btohqsg
Okay lah They still can speak english so is fine,btohqsg
Because HK cantonese has it's own twist. And although there are some english loan words  suprisingly most are borrowed from mandarin. Some from the other chinese languages,btohqsg
HAHA funny thing is  if I were to follow the pass down heritage from Father social construct. I am a Hakka  but I learned my Hakka from my maternal side  and I speak better Hakka than my Father lmaoz,btohqsg
Min nan hua is very complex actually. My paternal grandfather is from Fukien. One character can have multiple pronunciations.I prefer cantonese as that is what my maternal side speaks. I don't spend much time with my paternal side,btohqsg
Their tongues like entangled when they speak chinese,btohqsg
