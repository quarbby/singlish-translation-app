For my television  the sensor must not touch anything to make the television screen less laggy.,btohqsg

Tele dating bots is so funny,btohqsg
maybe it's cuz last day also so more spack,btohqsg
Day 2 the bag check had three lanes max and each lane only had one security guard and ig with the crowd confirm delay,btohqsg

Outcome of tradition being less important than results,btohqsg
I'm fortunate in the sense that my parents still speak hokkien to each other so I can still pick up bits and pieces  but I cannot imagine fully english speaking families,btohqsg
"at most it'll end up in history textbooks   ""canto was once a commonly spoken dialect in sg""",btohqsg
This funny   my mom's Hakka and my dad's teochew but both of them conversate in Cantonese,btohqsg
For some reason that generation is insane sia,btohqsg
FR and when they were dating back then  they spoke in Chinese instead,btohqsg
My dad can speak malay Chinese English Cantonese hokkien,btohqsg
But fluent to such an extent?,btohqsg
I think in sg the more commonly spoken dialect is hokkien?,btohqsg
