Sometimes not even my fault my family blame me cos the tv aint working,btohqsg
And all they have to do is switch the hdmi or off and on it back,btohqsg
For my television  the sensor must not touch anything to make the television screen less laggy.,btohqsg
My family never considered the fact tht the tv is more than 10 yrs old,btohqsg
i guess they'll figure it out if there's something they really _want_ to watch,btohqsg
like for me  i learnt my tech skillz cos i needed to bypass my family filter to get to some sites for erm  research,btohqsg
And then they start blaming the internet service provider. Sometimes i just sit at the side and laugh until they ask for my help,btohqsg

For me when I went on day 3   and the auntie didn't even make me drink the water,btohqsg
They dk what the fuck an ita bag is,btohqsg
Check in check out system shit,btohqsg
last time I heard before covid it was barely 15 bucks,btohqsg
Tele dating bots is so funny,btohqsg
maybe it's cuz last day also so more spack,btohqsg
Day 2 the bag check had three lanes max and each lane only had one security guard and ig with the crowd confirm delay,btohqsg
Day 3 more slack cause there were 2 guards per lane,btohqsg

"Lol I can imagine next time sec sch VIAs be like "" learning how to speak dialects from elderly"" project",btohqsg
The elderly be us tho haha,btohqsg
Outcome of tradition being less important than results,btohqsg
I'm fortunate in the sense that my parents still speak hokkien to each other so I can still pick up bits and pieces  but I cannot imagine fully english speaking families,btohqsg
"at most it'll end up in history textbooks   ""canto was once a commonly spoken dialect in sg""",btohqsg
This funny   my mom's Hakka and my dad's teochew but both of them conversate in Cantonese,btohqsg
For some reason that generation is insane sia,btohqsg
FR and when they were dating back then  they spoke in Chinese instead,btohqsg
My dad can speak malay Chinese English Cantonese hokkien,btohqsg
But fluent to such an extent?,btohqsg
I think in sg the more commonly spoken dialect is hokkien?,btohqsg
I rmb in pri sch rite my  class clowns always say chao ji Bai,btohqsg
