I thought commands are all in malay?,btohqsg
Wow!! Haha bold question thou i would have this question in mind too,btohqsg
Are ALL commands in malay or only some?,btohqsg
Why a bold question? Nothing about race. Race and language is separate,btohqsg
Wow  you must be an expert at Bahasa Melayu,btohqsg
Knowing a few commands â‰  expert,btohqsg
I thought they would speak full sentences in malay,btohqsg
Actually try learning a new language for real,btohqsg
Malay is not that hard to pickup,btohqsg
Yeah you don't have to learn an entirely new alphabet,btohqsg
Jawi is the written form of malay in arabic from my understanding,btohqsg
Well  malay is more traditionally written in jawi  right?,btohqsg
Do u write and converse in traditional chinese,btohqsg
Or doth i spake to thou in english,btohqsg
Traditional chinese is just a script. But I use trad. More often than simplified,btohqsg
An anomaly hahaha noth more than that,btohqsg
Im assuming u use simplified to converse w other,btohqsg
Coz most ppl dont use trad,btohqsg
Not really. Because many people can read both,btohqsg
Must be i hanging out w wrong ppl then,btohqsg
HK  Macao  Taiwan  many overseas Chinese communities uses traditional in general,btohqsg
Singapore is different. In mainland China most people can read both,btohqsg
Because they learnt it that way,btohqsg
Idu why care about other countries hahah when the convo was about local context,btohqsg
Even in Bahasa Melayu  they changed the spelling in the 70s,btohqsg
Yeah  Brunei widely uses jawi for example,btohqsg
in bmt are you supposed to shout for every single sentence?,btohqsg
I think some of us still do in traditional characters.. out of interest for the locals. As for taiwanese and mainland chinese nationales   they use traditional characters,btohqsg
btw what is a good score for aq essays?,btohqsg
Depends who. A lot of people in mainland China  particularly Guangdong  due to influence from HK  prefer traditional over simplified. Also many older literate people use traditional,btohqsg
I think I am underperforming if I want to do well,btohqsg
R u referring to history or gp?,btohqsg
Oh shit. I actually forgotten whats that. Ok bye n all the best,btohqsg
6-8 range is quite decent for j1,btohqsg
from my recent practices it's usually above 6,btohqsg
but then my first time doing I got like 4 for it,btohqsg
Hey u improved! Well so u still hve time to move up,btohqsg
Given 'back to the teacher' haha,btohqsg
U keep reminding of ur age haha,btohqsg
ya i messed up during my test though missed a good score,btohqsg
Gosh i dun even recallwhat it is,btohqsg
Is okay. U sound anyhow better than me when i was there? Lol,btohqsg
some of the younger gen got the ability to read traditional too,btohqsg
it's not too different  especially if u grew up taiwanese dramas with traditional chinese subs xd,btohqsg
one of the lesser known variants,btohqsg
Ya cos it interests them. Like my sis lor,btohqsg
my grandma used to speak a little,btohqsg
my impression has always been that it's malay with an english accent and hokkien loanwords,btohqsg
But some peranakan Chinese seem to speak more closer to standard Malay  likely because of influence from school (learning malay as MTL) or growing up,btohqsg
yeah  most are born in malaya after all,btohqsg
