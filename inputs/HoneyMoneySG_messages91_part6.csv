i think i know what you mean. if true  still got a long way for me to said age hahaha.,btohqsg
let's wait for details loh.. i am also best guessing onlyBUT think about it.. if ONE WAY street topup RA cannot withdraw  which sane person would topup,btohqsg
got.... many people don't wanna manage investments (at young or old age),btohqsg
Do you have any DBS/POSB savings account currently? Or have you updated your income?,btohqsg
But you get higher monthly payout for life.According to the Ministry of Finance  a CPF member with three times the Basic Retirement Sum in 2025 can have an estimated monthly payout of S$2 530 (US$1 880).By comparison  a member with four times the BRS next year - or S$426 000 - can receive an estimated monthly payout of S$3 330.,btohqsg
Employees after 55yo only contribute to MA and OA,btohqsg
Means your CPF contributions last year have hit the annual limit.,btohqsg
i think most people (especially those in finance chats and learning over the years) can do better than CPF Life return rates.,btohqsg
Basically your financial dept screws up.. they didn't keep track of cpf payment,btohqsg
or u have more than 1 job / cpf contribution source... or you go and voluntary contribute?,btohqsg
Playstore also will have malware one,btohqsg
the refund is due to excess mand contr  vol has another cap i think,btohqsg
during 2023 the CPF mand contri increased from $6K upwards. likely HR compute wrongly and gave you AW CPF based on 6K*12 months and so it exceeded the annual mandatory CPF cap,btohqsg
"Yes  but I still have alot of ""older"" friends who are too ""lazy"" to invest.  So this will be good for those people. Or for those who really got alot of spare money outside of CPF  then CPF money is nothing to them and they may choose to do this",btohqsg
SA savings will be transferred to the RA up to the Full Retirement Sum  and continue to attract the same long-term interest rate.DPM Wong said the remaining SA savings will be transferred to the OA  but members can voluntarily transfer their OA savings to the RA at any time to earn higher interest and receive higher retirement payouts.Otherwise  members may choose to keep those savings in the OA  where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.The long-term interest rate  which applies to the SA  RA and MA  is currently set at a minimum of 4 per cent  while the short-term interest rate applying to the OA is currently held at a 2.5 per cent minimum.‚ÄúAs a principle  only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate  and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate ‚Äù MOF said in its statement.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/budget-2024-higher-cpf-retirement-sum-ceiling-from-2025-among-slew-of-changes?utm_medium=social&utm_source=telegram&utm_campaign=sttgOK I could be wrong after reading this...,btohqsg
The maximum cpf you+ your employer supposed to contribute is $37 740. However  your payroll personnel calculated wrongly and contributed more than $37 740.This happen if you earn more than $102 000 annually.,btohqsg
the principle makes sense though. otherwise how to give long term interest income to short term liquidity,btohqsg
MOF telling you... YOU WANT 4%  YOU MUST LOCK IN!,btohqsg
Free lunch is over. Now is reality. Want more? Then lock in,btohqsg
The changes in CPF is to benefit for the majority of the people who use CPF as it is without hacks.  For the rest of us  we just have to figure out again on how to maximize the benefits under the new system.,btohqsg
Hais MRSS top up to parent no longer attract tax relief too‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
well said. like if UOB closes the salary hack  we just gotta accept it  because it is a hack to start with.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGso now top up SA to reach FRS as early as possible or top up MA first?,btohqsg
make hay when sun shines... sun set then accept it...,btohqsg
"As the phase ""7 years of bountiful harvest and 7 years of famine"". Be ready to adapt and thankful we have room to maneuver while other countries are going into recession.",btohqsg
I confused.. so we still can top up now?,btohqsg
why don't top up thou  you hit FRS earlier  you still can take out at 55 mah. you still have 4% SA,btohqsg
ya no shielding but u still can earn 4% in your early years,btohqsg
No more SA shielding but top up to SA now still enjoys tax relief and 4% compounding until 55yo,btohqsg
I wonder those shielded and above 55  all closed SA and go to OA too?,btohqsg
What's the confusion? Lol. Nothings changed before 55.,btohqsg
I did SA shielding 3 months ago & managed to set aside 293k. Now  Dy PM announced to close SA for those above 55. No more 4% risk free interest for me.,btohqsg
still got 10 months free lunch la,btohqsg
Compounding take place best with time to let it compound   now SA will close at 55 years old the run way is very much shorter.,btohqsg
Govt urging u to let it continue compounding in RA üåö,btohqsg
You still can save to ERS at $426k but cannot withdraw. That sum  in the government‚Äôs eye  is more than enough for retirement. Not to make extra money from cpf ‚Ä¶ üòÖ,btohqsg
RA i dont really like cuz cannot withdraw as and when .. lol .. i guess cannot have your cake and eat it ..,btohqsg
now this is a bad idea if it can only lead to CPF Life.,btohqsg
Top up SA or MA? I am below 55 but next month OA will be wipe off cos I need to buy house,btohqsg
Hi all can i check if citi rewards plus amaze can pay for season parking and town council?and how to go about it to enjoy the miles,btohqsg
So when u sell your financial product after 55  the money goes to RA or OA?,btohqsg
I think if U have hit FRS. It will go to OA,btohqsg
I thought can withdraw as long u have BRS inside (with housing pledge) until age 65 before CPF Life starts,btohqsg
Hi guys  did anybody successfully top up snack using Amex TCB or UOB Absolute Amex? Not sure why mine kept encountering error,btohqsg
Means if have not hit FRS  it will go to RA?,btohqsg
I thought so too ORIGINALLY  but now i think they are making it rigid.Principle being..you want 4%  must be locked inyou want withdraw anymore  only give you 2.5%,btohqsg
Frankly for those who aren‚Äôt aware of shielding and do not have ers amount in SA  there‚Äôs really no change as SA balance will be emptied to RA at 55,btohqsg
Now it‚Äôs going to be tough to hit ers amount,btohqsg
The summary really is only 2.5% account is ATM-like withdrawable4% is only for retirement lock upWhich frankly makes sense as a gov system pov,btohqsg
RA can be increased only at its formation during 55 year old and then manual transfers/top up later.Assuming you‚Äôve invested using SA to begin with. If invested with OA then it will go back to OA as per old rules,btohqsg
