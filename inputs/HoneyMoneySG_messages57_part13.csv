Morning folks  a quick question on Instrarem Amaze .. I remembered there was a promo for 4 points for each S$1 of local spending linked to  Instrarem Amaze Wallet. Can I confirm that now Instrarem does NOT  award points for local spendings even if linked to Amaze Wallet?,btohqsg
Yes it only for oversea spend,btohqsg

You get 1.5% for first $25k  as stated.,btohqsg
First $25k gets 1.5%  subsequent $5k (up to $25k) gets 2.5%. That's how you read the table.,btohqsg

Hi  has anyone here applied for HSBC credit card through the Instarem promo?,btohqsg

No lah. Titanium offers 4mpd up to 13335 per membership year. U can get both pink n blue card to double it but that means splitting the bill. Also  some rolexes are 30-50k,btohqsg

How does moneysmart track the sign ups uh?When I signed up for a card through singsaver  they sent an email.But money smart didn't send anything  so I'm wondering how to claim my reward,btohqsg
There is no answer to this. It depends on how much you value a mile. Google ‚Äúvalue of a mile‚Äù,btohqsg
Really no point lor (unless one travels frequently). U get the card to enjoy atas experiences and hotels  end up selling vouchers on carousel ü§£,btohqsg
I guess u need to ask yourself if u will need to spend $2.6 or force spending to get the miles. Then what do u intend to use the miles for. Will u be able to accumulate enough miles before the expiry to redeem what u want. Generally miles are only most valuable if u redeem for long distance biz class flight,btohqsg
I am more of a cashback person and end up selling away the miles i have and buy normal economy class for my travel. I use the money i get from sales of the miles to fund part of my travel,btohqsg
Might as well get a gd cashback card then?,btohqsg
I always max out my cashback card before i use miles lol,btohqsg
get the cash savings. There are other ways to get/buy miles,btohqsg
How/ where do you sell miles?,btohqsg
At this rate it is an easy decision to choose cash savings,btohqsg
U can go to forum or platform to post  or look for people who need miles before u convert from bank point to miles. Discuss a rate among u and buyer to sell your miles. Nothing hard here. Just need suitable rate and mutual agreement. General it range from 15 to 20 dollar per 1k miles,btohqsg
Do your own calculation and research before setting the rate  nobody can know how much u value the miles to be honest,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if citibank smrt card counts shopback payment at a physical store as online purchase?,btohqsg

Amex plat charge if you‚Äôre buying at THG (7.8mpd for first 16k  3.5mpd for the remaining)otherwise amaze + UOB KF for 3mpd  if MCC is 5944  and require min spending of 800 on SIAManhattan if you prefer cash back but there is a cap per quarter IIRC,btohqsg
But this is only possible if I purchase at thg right?If grey market this option is not worth right?,btohqsg
Grey market depending on MCC lo.i am assuming you‚Äôre buying from THG or Rolex directly (that‚Äôs why I have disclaimer of 5944 mcc),btohqsg
Hi guys  Can check whether DBS Woman's World card  the online spending include *Travel Category*  like air ticket  hotels etc?,btohqsg
Yes 5944 too thanks! But  grey  might have surcharge when using cc,btohqsg

Hi gurus  for uob ONE account to hit the 500$ monthly spend  paying for SP bills with my Uob one debit card is counted  yes?,btohqsg

Depend on the card company  some can some cant but there is nominee system to sell away the miles in this way,btohqsg
