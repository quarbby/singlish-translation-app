Amaze is a few % charge also since cannot get dbs point no meaning to link to wwmc,btohqsg
1 more question I have on Amaze.What is e diff if one chose payment source from Amaze Wallet (need top u) vs Credit Card inside Amaze directly to pay?,btohqsg
Erm amaze wallet is like youtrip,btohqsg
amaze wallet no CC rewards but lower FX  but not low enough compared to usual travel cards. Got cashback though,btohqsg
Cannot. The ONR only ISP can make specific configuration changes. Honestly SingTel home broadband is not that great lol,btohqsg
You need top up to it. Topping up of amaze wallet doesn't earn you any rewards on your CC.Amaze link to CC  slightly worse rate but earn cc rewards.,btohqsg
I need to buy furniture that going to cost me 2000. Which CC I can use to maximise cash back ?,btohqsg
use amaze wallet gives very good rate ah,btohqsg
Not all cards can earn rewards with amaze.,btohqsg
last time I used in JP the rate not as good as youtrip  and I was making bigger purchases so the cashback doesn't make sense for me,btohqsg
I sell away all their router and got my own  just that the onr is too old Liao n Singtel only provides one free if it totally stop working  n the onr they having now on their website is same as what I have now‚Ä¶. 8+ years of old tech and still so expensive wth,btohqsg
I talking about Amaze wallet not Amaze+ card,btohqsg
Yes I used amaze wallet in JP  not linked to a card. The spread I noticed was around 0.5 - 0.75% higher,btohqsg
Annoying af  I see that other telco their ont n onr also need to through them n no third party‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Hahaha. Jump to VQ.. used almost 10 years only got 1 downtime that was unscheduled,btohqsg
Amaze got cash back rewards via ? How to redeem the cashback? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Hi all  doesTrip.comSG got foreign  transaction fee I booking air ticket use UOB lady card?  Anything to take note? First time usetrip.com. Thx in advance.,btohqsg
I hope I understand correctly1. Amaze wallet ~ better FX rate no credit card rewards.2. Amaze CC ~ slightly worse off FX rateWith credit card rewards.Dbs Ww will not earn as excluded so no point at all.If UOB Lady Sol  then will earn rewards.Is this correct? Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
All in the tnc for the site just read it up,btohqsg
1. Personally will recommend using trust instead2. DBS WWMC excludes amaze specifically so no rewards. Solitaire will earn  provided underlying MCC code fulfils criteria,btohqsg
Correct UOB Lady Sol will earn provide you used it at the category you chose,btohqsg
Cashback doesn‚Äôt make sense ~ is it due to cap or better rate w Youtrip?,btohqsg
Thank you üôèüèª for the Amaze Card information sharing. Well appreciated,btohqsg
There's a cap per transaction for the cashback capping out at $500  if it works for you can just use amaze wallet but I recommend reading up on the exact cashback t&c first,btohqsg
Hi  I am pending about $200 on my UOB VS to hit the $1k for this statement month due to a shorter month (new card). Was wondering if I can use that to buy vouchers like FairPrice? I saw the MCC  seemed like it‚Äôs eligible via contactless but not sure if vouchers are allowed or it doesn‚Äôt matter since MCC is eligible.,btohqsg
Hello gurus... anybody tried shipping electronic item from US to SG? Which shipping platform you all are using? Thank u in advance!,btohqsg
Found a good read on Amaze fx rates and whether still worth it üëçüèº TLDR; fx rates are not as favourable as before but still lower than credit cards  therefore still worth in the premise of using it to earn rewards from your CC.https://milelion.com/2023/03/19/what-is-amazes-real-foreign-currency-transaction-fee/https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/instarem-amaze-card-review,btohqsg
Paid with linked card or Amaze wallet? Cuz this transaction only show the fee.,btohqsg
Oh so all ShopBack paylater payment method with Citi rewards + Amaze card get charged 1%?,btohqsg
Yes. Pay with amaze wallet don't have.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if DBS woman‚Äôs card got digital card provided after application? Or need to wait for physical card,btohqsg
Is there any charges for topping up the amaze wallet with credit card?,btohqsg
Can only add to mobile wallet. Don't rmb seeing any digital card option after signing up in digibank app.,btohqsg
Thx. So can add to Apple Pay,btohqsg
Can add to wallet and use if no cvv? I don‚Äôt remember so.,btohqsg
Anyone knows what's the best transfer promo from TD now? Tiger  moomoo or webull?,btohqsg
no fees if topup using mastercard,btohqsg
Since there is no reward  use your dbs card to top up to Amaze wallet then as Amaze wallet gives a better fx rate (vs linking it to a cc),btohqsg
Does the credit limit of my other credit cards affect the potential credit limit of new cards that I‚Äôm going to apply for?,btohqsg
Good morning! Just to check If paying by Kris+ using CRMC + Amaze at G2000 does it counted as 4mpd?,btohqsg
Does anyone is spending on shopee/lazada qualify for the dbs xmas spending campaign?,btohqsg
I have existing esaver account.  May I know how to get effective 3.6% rate? Simply deposit money into the account? No other actions needed eg. Salary credit  credit card usage  investment...?,btohqsg
No hoops to jump. But the high bonus interest is only for incremental fresh funds.,btohqsg
Thanks  cos in the t&c it is not explicitly mentioned,btohqsg
With moomoo giving 5.8% on the fullerton sgd liquidity t+0 fund  it should be safe to put money there to try it out for abt 30days right,btohqsg
Hi all  if I buy MacBook on shopee and use UOB One card to buy  it will get the bonus cashback?,btohqsg
"In my opinion  if you really want to invest  i dont think investing for 30 days or short term horizon  means you fully understand how investments work.In order to fully leverage the term ""investments"" you have to first understand why investments benefits even more when it is viewed in a long term horizon!",btohqsg
Yes. Provided you pay with card not top-up and pay in full.,btohqsg
Are there a better code than 1.85% for recurring mortgage payment using cardup??,btohqsg
