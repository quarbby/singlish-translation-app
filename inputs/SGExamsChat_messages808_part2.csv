They asking me do eye excerises,btohqsg
I also got a lazy eye that's so lazy it forgets to move,btohqsg
I can roll my eyes at the doctor very well,btohqsg
idk if it could be due to my eye condition i tend to squint too much then maybe result in astig,btohqsg
Oh i had a lazy eye too but went to correct it when i was 15,btohqsg
I can roll on of my eye well,btohqsg
Damn i do all of those,btohqsg
I never corrected it so that's why they keep the SNEC shit,btohqsg
Oh wait when i meant correct i meant surgery,btohqsg
I just say my course can liao,btohqsg
Cutting the muscle of my eye or some shit idk,btohqsg
I am too broke for that also it's like months of down time,btohqsg
I only had to be blind for like 2-3 days in which i stayed home,btohqsg
After that its back to normal,btohqsg
I need to do my readings,btohqsg
Reading Judith Butler rn it's so fucking dense,btohqsg
Also who tf would wanna transcribe Judith Butler into brailleWhat a waste of money and paper,btohqsg
omg this is a damn solid reply fr my friend,btohqsg
she is right coz just some background is pharm has actually to some not small not great extent damage my mental health and i hv not fully recovered from it,btohqsg
sth that my parents take it like a small matter,btohqsg
lol SIA jobs -- over a 100 applicants,btohqsg
idk how linkedin does its count,btohqsg
but i believe it prolly only counts those applied through linkedin,btohqsg
mr lim say they offer fm with 3h2s so they don't kill the fm students now or something along those lines,btohqsg
but yeah for fm is mixed 4H2 and 3H2,btohqsg
i may have taken FM if they did not force 4h2,btohqsg
is there such thing as PFMe?,btohqsg
btw CAG does not have entry level roles:-(,btohqsg
Last time yijc had one  now it disappeared after like arnd 2022 or 2023.,btohqsg
But i think jpjc and others shld have,btohqsg
TM it only appeared fr 2024ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Coz before that FM need take 4H2  I really dk why they put it as such,btohqsg
FM now is quite more relevant to those taking engineering ever since they removed conic sections and math inductions for multivariable calculus,btohqsg
I would say FM is sorta quite useful for those taking STEM subjects,btohqsg
But actually i believe i failed the selection test coz the whole paper was proofsðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I considered fm coz my mum told me it is easier than h2 math,btohqsg
I would have died at the proofs qns,btohqsg
Then went for the selection test and realize for myself that is bs,btohqsg
It is definitely easier than h3 math uh but more application based,btohqsg
fm looked like it'd have been fun to do,btohqsg
H2 proof is minimal + more straitforward,btohqsg
Regardless fm still need take with h2 math,btohqsg
So is like either ways  would die anyways,btohqsg
Oh it's like a req isit,btohqsg
From the subject combis right  h2 fm is always paired with h2 math,btohqsg
Yea and most sci students take h2 math anyways,btohqsg
Cus like it builds up from fm,btohqsg
Why would someone take fm and not h2 math,btohqsg
Haiz if only i can share these tips with those science camp ppl,btohqsg
fm basically speedruns h2 math first,btohqsg
