Can I ask for Maybank Family and Friends credit card  is the ringgit spend counted into the 5 categories chosen?,btohqsg
So ringgit doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs within the chosen 5 categories?,btohqsg
If ur spending is within the 5 chosen categories  try to use amaze card to reduce the fx fee. If ur spending is not within the 5 chosen categories  then u can use f&f card directly  it will go into the 6th category.. Make sure u hit the min spending of 800 for that mth.,btohqsg
Within 2 months from end of the quarter.,btohqsg
Gotta try. I heard many mariott properties dont qualify for 4nf.,btohqsg
It may not even be eligible. Many marriot properties are not full pre-payment.Better off with accor properties if u want to do 4nf,btohqsg

Hi guys need help for starter  what basic card should i use for collecting miles? Spending more on daily usage like groceries food and stuff,btohqsg
Usually people do UOB PPV  UOB Ladies  Citi Rewards + Amaze. Also depends on how much u spend,btohqsg
Please be mindful that Citi Rewards Card (CRMC) blacklists Travel related transactions such as MCC 4121 for ride hailing. Whenever I takes Uber in USA  i manually switch my card paring to my other Mastercard (OCBC 90n) that give miles before booking a ride,btohqsg

I might be wrong. Amaze shows is travel related. Happy to be corrected,btohqsg
mcc 4121 is not travel related based on citi rewards tnC,btohqsg
doesn't matter since no points/miles for instalment,btohqsg
