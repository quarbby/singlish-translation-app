Nevr seen internship pay 3 to 4k one,btohqsg
This was part of the criteria,btohqsg
that’s my stipend after passing qualification,btohqsg
Part time job 4K a month,btohqsg
Either the boss don’t know how to correctly pay people cause it’s a startup,btohqsg
Btw is the “k2” in your bio referencing a mountain ? Idk much Chinese,btohqsg

You have to do in the office,btohqsg

I have a friend that used to help with setting up of exam venues,btohqsg
As part of a moving company…he was tasked to setup tables and chairs for ite east,btohqsg
He said  sometimes got 3hr break,btohqsg
Start at 8 end at 4 but most of the time got at least a 2hr break in between  moving tables and chairs at a exam venue,btohqsg
Yup  sometimes they end at 3,btohqsg
Yea  transportation is free as well,btohqsg
The company truck will bring him back to his nearest mrt station,btohqsg
…bruh hong Kan lah the uncles,btohqsg
My job also…the SingPost truck drivers  all the wack as uncles,btohqsg
I see them enter the compound like their grandfather road,btohqsg
Speeding  cutting people off  jam breaking…driving over curb  scraping against gate…,btohqsg
It’s like a very direct reputation hit   unlike movers…they always shift ppl at diff parts of sg,btohqsg
I also see a lot of shit working at SingPost,btohqsg
Now I know why packages sometimes come crushed  even broken,btohqsg
The ppl all wayang one  I’ve seen packages get dragged by the trucks,btohqsg
Then I see with my very own eyes  the driver get out pick up the driven over package…open the rear of the truck and just toss it back in there,btohqsg
At least you got this kind o go briefing,btohqsg
I work for nearly 3 months  everybody looks like a supervisor…idk who tf is my actual supervisor,btohqsg
When we end shift  the supervisor is not even present,btohqsg
Honestly cause pat time  I would do the same shit,btohqsg
Cause part time  cannot later Kenna blacklisted,btohqsg
My supervisor at SingPost told me  if I get blacklisted at my job…it means I will never be able to apply for a job at a SingPost establishment again,btohqsg
The problem with this is  a sizeable amount of high earning warehouse jobs are under the jurisdiction of SingPost,btohqsg
Even not high earning  a good portion is operated or jointly ventured by SingPost,btohqsg

I see them kneeling and begging to a supervisor (not mine),btohqsg
But they always got a lot of loopholes one,btohqsg
