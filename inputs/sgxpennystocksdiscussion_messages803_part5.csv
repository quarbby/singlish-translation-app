China Rebukes US After Taiwan Strait Near-CollisionChina’s foreign minister defended its navy’s actions after it sailed a warship into the path of American and Canadian vessels conducting joint exercises in the Taiwan Strait on Saturday  saying the so-called ‘freedom of navigation’ patrols are aggressive towards Beijing.In an address to a host of global defense officials at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Sunday  General Li Shangfu said Beijing was unconcerned by what he called “innocent passage” but that it must “prevent attempts that try to use the freedom of navigation [patrols]  that innocent passage  to exercise hegemony of navigation.”Li’s comments follow an incident on Saturday in which a Chinese warship reportedly came within 150 yards (137 meters) of the US destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Canadian vessel with which it was conducting exercises.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
