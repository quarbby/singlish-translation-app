I think we both know a good app to search for brake pads,btohqsg
Then from there you can reccee,btohqsg
For bread and butter cars great upgrade over stock,btohqsg
If you want ceramic  red stuff,btohqsg
Brembo has many replica one 😅,btohqsg
Change to yellow stuff at max can already,btohqsg
You don't need insane stopping power,btohqsg
Unless you want it for aesthetics or you track your car a lot,btohqsg
That 2k can go somewhere else,btohqsg
Sometime change big caliper  pump also must change.Example If the pump is 14mm stock.Even if change to 4 pot. Not much different.If change pump to bigger diameter  more fluid  better braking power too on stock caliper.,btohqsg
Pads rotors and hose line good enough for day to day use,btohqsg
Bbk doesn't add stopping power as such,btohqsg
It's more to reduce brake fade,btohqsg
Then just spray your caliper for ✨aesthetics✨,btohqsg
Maybe pump never change😅For motorbike big difference.4pot320mm rotor19mm brembo pump1 finger braking.,btohqsg
Just changing master cylinder makes a world of a difference,btohqsg
So if just change brake pads + ssbh  braking efficiency will also be improved?,btohqsg
brake fluid and brake pad will help to restore ur braking perfomance,btohqsg
They want you to post fake items on harouhell,btohqsg
Lol. Must be vigilant and don't fall for such nonsense - J,btohqsg
Honda City very light..  Brake pads and +SSBH will help but you must check your brake fluids as well. They need replacement too.,btohqsg
So even if the rotors are not changed  changing the above mentioned still can improve braking efficiency?,btohqsg
Don’t forget proper tyres can help too,btohqsg
That's why change a starter motor cost so much nowadays   smart engine designer😜😜😜,btohqsg
Lol while engine come out suntan ?,btohqsg
Best stopping power is a tree,btohqsg
These days is use other cars to brake,btohqsg
