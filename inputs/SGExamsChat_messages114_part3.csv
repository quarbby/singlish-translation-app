But of cos i havent known the local rules for mnc very well lah whether anot they need to adhere to certain proportion of locals in their advisory board,btohqsg
Fully agree esp to all younger ppl,btohqsg
Imagine you accidentally date a elite Chinese family,btohqsg
Oh ya haha their culture is talk good . Local culture quite workaholic,btohqsg
Maybe they borrowing their lens n mindset if they wanna tap into the western market in the long run,btohqsg
Dating market still prefer local/own ppl in my view,btohqsg
How come Singaporean so good in studies but not so good in getting ceo positions ah,btohqsg
Anyone can advice me on amendment of exam,btohqsg
I want change my humanities combined to A math,btohqsg
Any tips whether i should do that,btohqsg
You should check if your desired poly ELR2B2 includes humanities,btohqsg
Ang moh will no longer be the superior race,btohqsg
I would say is more of corporate bias that's why.,btohqsg
So to answer your question  Singaporeans are actually qualified for such positions  but the companies just don't want to appoint Singaporeans as CEOs most of the time,btohqsg
We have Singaporeans with angmoh degrees and some got experience working in angmoh countries,btohqsg
by referrin to scholars  are u referrin to just bonded scholars  or including those bond-free uni scholars also?,btohqsg
speakin of that  do bond-free uni scholars even matter,btohqsg
Can choose from them to hold important posts,btohqsg
Then make angmohs as advisors with no decision making power,btohqsg
I am sure our local people  mix of scholars and non scholars  have the capability to make important decisions with advice from a board.,btohqsg
The board can consists of angmohs and cina,btohqsg
But all non locals in advice only board,btohqsg
Once there is no need for such board  we can really take off from there,btohqsg
For MNC no choice because they need someone from their origin country to oversee  but they also need local people who knows the culture here to advise and make decisions too,btohqsg
For important sensitive govt related companies  it's best to have 100% locals,btohqsg
What will be the superior race? The horse race?,btohqsg
You could get hic hic hic hic as the result,btohqsg
We are all humans tho. Haha,btohqsg
LOL why you single out those two,btohqsg
Because got yandao or chio people there,btohqsg

U need to go SEAB and get the customer service to help u,btohqsg
And u need to pay extra for that,btohqsg
Why not just add on. U can choose to appear during the exam or not also can.,btohqsg
Cause now left like 4 month,btohqsg
Hehe sorry then you may need to fill me up on the background info,btohqsg
How prepared are you for amaths and combined humans respectively?,btohqsg
Cause if i focus on humanities now idk if can anot,btohqsg
Not sure for A math too,btohqsg
I feel just apply for both subjects,btohqsg
U can choose not to show up for the subject u dun want to take,btohqsg
So if i choose A math,btohqsg
Maybe i wont attend humanities classes anymore,btohqsg
Like Dont know to focus on A math or humanities man,btohqsg
This is still true lor even todayActually seasoned businessmen in sg also kowtow to the chinese businessmen.,btohqsg
