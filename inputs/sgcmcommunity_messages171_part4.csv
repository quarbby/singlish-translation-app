Drove one before.. its damn bad,btohqsg
vios on the roads now driving like they have a V8 engine in them,btohqsg
"""The All-New Vios is equipped with a 1.5L powerplant  producing 107 bhp and along with it a 12 sec acceleration within 0-100km/h""https://www.oneshift.com/articles/news/the-allnew-toyota-vios-launched-in-singapore#:~:text=The%20All%2DNew%20Vios%20is%20equipped%20with%20a%201.5L more%20frugal%20within%20its%20class.",btohqsg
Considering the 118 is doing 10.8s... the vios is nt too shabby,btohqsg
Ya la  Toyota strength is never on its acceleration. They always market themselves as reliable only,btohqsg
I always think Toyota like a turtle  durable but slow and old,btohqsg
At least Vios nw more lookable,btohqsg
When it come to design and car feature they like damn slow to change,btohqsg
I feel like it is still playing catch up to other brand  especially when compared to Mazda or even honda,btohqsg
They will wait till other brand do first then slowly change it after a few years later,btohqsg
quota increase who bet coe up?,btohqsg
Increase means more ppl fight n buy,btohqsg
sometimes i wonder what is LTA real purpose of releasing more quota.. to earn more $$ or to really hope to bring it down,btohqsg
if they really sincere about it  PHV allocation would be similar to taxis and not bidded,btohqsg
Maybe cause no minister in charge  that is why no drastic changes?,btohqsg
Think covid held back a lot of things,btohqsg
They suppose to kill off COE cars for PHV and make it yearly inspections,btohqsg
Now they killing off all diesels n petrol taxis first,btohqsg
im quite worried if they kill of diesels,btohqsg
ltr no spare parts for SAF vehicles..,btohqsg
Army should be exempted from the carbon thing,btohqsg
in army got 1 time the saf veh emit black smoke,btohqsg
But must add a condition that it cannot resell into 2nd hand car market cos their coe not bidded,btohqsg
actually PHV cars shudnt sell back into resale market,btohqsg
now got alot cars idk odo fake anot  cus they quite common PHV models,btohqsg
I think 140k for cat A,btohqsg
Don't trust odo  can easily amended one,btohqsg
i know some cars u can check odo thru gearbox as well,btohqsg
so if ur gb and odo tak match,btohqsg
Why sg carmart don't want do pre purchase inspection for us,btohqsg
Buy new car then no need to go through all these,btohqsg
Then they release at a time when cars expo coming  those dealers just bid to secure some for the fair,btohqsg
Diesel will remain for SAF n Commercial,btohqsg
Can keep Coe for how long?,btohqsg
Next yr another 1% gst increase,btohqsg
Not even 3.30 I see the pre-bids start to come in already,btohqsg
What is the interest now for car loan?,btohqsg
I wanna see if cat B and open cat will break again cause of Velfire release,btohqsg
Some banks go 2.98 while some still 2.78,btohqsg
May I know how much is the down payment for new cars? And how much the interest now roughly  and how to count the monthly repayment,btohqsg
