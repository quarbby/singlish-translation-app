progressives and republican both dislike bitch pelosi,btohqsg
People who ‘mug in the end’ in JC usually end up dying at a levels,btohqsg
Ok  let's not tease kumar anymore  sorry kumar,btohqsg
Must be all the offerings ur worshippers have been giving u,btohqsg
U mean I worshipped u Yao Teck?,btohqsg
Need me to call the polize,btohqsg
I'm burning my A level H2 Chem paper as offerings,btohqsg
anyone able to get the a lvl ppr tho?,btohqsg
Any brave soul wanna try this chem qn?,btohqsg
what is lewis acid base reaction,btohqsg
A Lewis acid is an acceptor of electrons,btohqsg
was i trying to say he is 'a student'  or an 'A student'?,btohqsg
Every reaction is either Lewis acid base or redox? So since there’s no change in ON means it shld be Acid base,btohqsg
Anyone pls share me the chem paper pls,btohqsg
i wanted to ask cos someone just rekted bell curve for the quiz,btohqsg
just needed to confirm cos i drew the mechanism out,btohqsg
The formation of water should already be a lewis acid and base,btohqsg
between H+ and OH- produced from o2- and H+,btohqsg
Wait i thot there is no such thing as H+ ions in acid,btohqsg
According to my chem O teacher he said that H+ is the wrong term,btohqsg
So is basically a subsitute ah,btohqsg
its just more or less accurate i guess,btohqsg
cos in reality the H+ will react with water to form H3O+,btohqsg
but like water is everywhere also,btohqsg
H3O+ is kind of a waste of time,btohqsg
It's just used to make things fancy,btohqsg
anyone have h2 maths paper frm today,btohqsg
anyone knows how much would be a safe score to get A in h2 math?,btohqsg
U got ur pay alr ?,btohqsg
They said hindu officers will get earlier coz of the deepawali and what not,btohqsg
This one we'll need to ask theother officer from our squad,btohqsg
Idk oso hahaha nvm ah i wait till the actual payday first,btohqsg
At least 90 i would say,btohqsg
Can change meh if u below 75 or what,btohqsg
Do u even know if its 75,btohqsg
Nvm yall wont get my point eitherways hahaha,btohqsg
99 for B  100 for A,btohqsg
This one I agree cos like scoring an A in H2 Maths is like getting almost everything correct,btohqsg
I would be extremely  extremely surprised if 50% of all candidates for H2 Maths got ‘almost everything correct’,btohqsg
Which is why A cannot be 90,btohqsg
Because 50% of people get A,btohqsg
okay thank you for your reassurance john,btohqsg
Dude I did well for H2 Maths (like almost all correct) and lost like at least 15 marks for both papers and I got a B,btohqsg
But then this is in 2018,btohqsg
I lost about 30mark in total Liao from paper 1 and 2,btohqsg
You don't even know your raw score  you can't say for sure how many marks you lost,btohqsg
I wouldn’t consider losing 15m per paper ‘almost all correct’,btohqsg
i think i’m at 70% total lol,btohqsg
this one should be A haha,btohqsg
True that but Ye... was the type who checks the answers side by side so Ye and I was in the batch with the most people taking A levels so bell curve,btohqsg
