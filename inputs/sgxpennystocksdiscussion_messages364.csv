Be blessed to you and family!!“For “whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved.””Romans 10:13 NKJVhttps://www.bible.com/114/rom.10.13.nkjv“And God is able to make all grace abound toward you  that you  always having all sufficiency in all things  may have an abundance for every good work.”II Corinthians 9:8 NKJVhttps://www.bible.com/114/2co.9.8.nkjv,btohqsg

I thought they are supposed to have negative test before they can board the planeBut come here shn so many positive caseWhat test they take before coming? Driving test ah,btohqsg
SG don't have the hinterland of mainland China unlike HK.,btohqsg
Other countries: it is easy to get a pcr test report without doing a pcr test.On arrival  the pcr test at changi is not the same pcr test as the one conducted at end end of SHN. Supposedly the end of SHN is more accurate. At least that's what the swapper told me.By then  it's already 14 days since arrival.btw I just finished my SHN few days ago.,btohqsg
So many so zhunNegative then the days before coming here became positive,btohqsg

"So happy!  !  !Iranian President Ahmadinejad was interviewed by Larry King  the mouthpiece of the US CNN  and he suffocated the US name with regard to the China-Japan Diaoyu Islands issue!  The Chinese leader learns his way of speaking!Larry King: Mr. President  the interview time is over  but I still have a few questions to ask you. I don’t know  can I?Ahmadinejad: Yes.Larry King: Still on the issue of nuclear weapons  will Iran really not develop nuclear weapons?  Is this something we are very worried about?Ahmadinejad: I would like to ask  which countries in this world have dropped atomic bombs on the territories of other countries?  Who else besides the United States?  Would you please point it out to me?Larry King:............Ahmadinejad: The world should worry more about the United States than Iran!  Not only did Iran not drop atomic bombs on the territories of other countries  it also has no nuclear weapons!  Why should you worry about Iran?  Just because you are ""worried"" about this country  you will hurt this country. What kind of logic is this?  Just because of the so-called fears of the Americans  the United States has harmed Iraq and Afghanistan  caused the people of these two countries to suffer  and then harmed Iran. This is the American logic.  As long as I worry about him  I will hurt him. I suspect that this kind of thinking is not a normal person's mentality  at least this person is sick.Larry King: The United States dropped the atomic bomb on Japan because it was a just war. The world knows that this is a blow to fascism. This is of positive significance to the early peace of the world.Ahmadinejad: I did not say that it was not an anti-fascist war  nor did I say that it was an unjust war  but since it is anti-fascist  why don’t you drop atomic bombs on those who engage in militarism in Japan?  On the head  but on the heads of people (hundreds of thousands) of innocent people?  Is this the democracy  freedom  and human rights that Americans often talk about?  Now  I ask Mr. Larry King to tell me again  do you still think that the US bombing of Japanese civilians with atomic bombs is a just battle?  Are you sure it is an act of justice?  ?  ?Larry King: The elimination of fascism is of course a just battle!  The whole world is very clear about the nature of the war between the United States and Japan. Is there any doubt about this?Ahmadinejad: But I have doubts.  I would like to ask the United States and Mr. Larry King  since the eradication of Japanese fascism is a just war  all the crimes committed by Japan in the past should be corrected. However  why the Japanese occupation of China’s Diaoyu Islands has not been returned to China yet.  Put management power in the hands of the Japanese?  Why do the Japanese still claim to own the Diaoyu Islands  and why does the United States still support Japan's continued occupation of China's Diaoyu Islands?Larry King hesitated  intermittently  flustered and incoherent.  .  .  Then he pulled out a sentence: ...that is a Sino-Japanese affair  I am not sure.Ahmadinejad: Americans always pretend to be confused at critical times  just like you are now.##AnyChinese should forward it.",btohqsg
