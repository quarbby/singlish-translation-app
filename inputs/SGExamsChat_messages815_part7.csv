Think he jumped too many lvls frðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Idk what kinda yellow lvl he played before even,btohqsg
But sometimes I legit think I'm a sadist,btohqsg
I legit wondered if bro played maimai w 1 hand or smth,btohqsg
that means said friend doesn't really have a stable foundation to be skipping levels,btohqsg
So idk what the fuck he's on,btohqsg
But I was so amused by it I'm gonna drag him to the arcade again aft As lol,btohqsg
I RLY WANNA SEE HOW THE FUCK HE PLAY SIA,btohqsg
Idg how people play the damn hard master songs,btohqsg
And my field of vision is damn narrow,btohqsg
Ain't no way ppl sight-reading that shit,btohqsg
they do sight-read but not on the spot cuz they practice the moves they have to clear the track song,btohqsg
I cannot will my body to move that fast,btohqsg
tbh alot of charts can be broken down into predictable patterns,btohqsg
stuff like note subdivisions  delayed sliders  spins,btohqsg
95% of rhythm game music is in 4/4 and a very linear groove,btohqsg

But tbh u wun be driving for more than 30min on most occasions so shld be fine?,btohqsg
The vision of me right now and with glasses has no different its only when I have to rely on that one bad eye is the prob,btohqsg
Coz for me my glasses is high on astic so i cant wear my glasses for > 1-2h  i will get giddy,btohqsg
