hey guys  can i confirm something ‚Äî if we use CC to pay for premiums and debit the CC bill via our EGA account through GIRO  we'll still receive the 1%? i watched this video earlier and it's a direct GIRO from insurer to EGA,btohqsg
Yes but does urs allow cc payment?,btohqsg
i recently paid some premiums (annual) on CRMC. had to use CC for first payment (i think ‚Äî through a broker). managed to send the GIRO form on 5 oct to citibank to deduct from HSBC EGAgot my first statement month for CRMC it's stated at 6 oct though my card got approved on 9/9/24not sure if the interbank GIRO will be set up on time. i think 4-6 weeks?,btohqsg
oh anthony i updated with some context. thanks!!,btohqsg
Giro setup we won't know for sure. Check ur Citi statement on how it will be paid.,btohqsg
yup! okay got it. thank you!i think i read somewhere in this group or reddit the citi statement will reflect that itll be GIRO or something,btohqsg
If i using the amaze paired with maybank F&f and using the amaze go to Malaysia supermarket so this is under Which category? Or i using the Maybank f&F directly shopping in Malaysia supermarket  so this also under Which category? Both of them is what the difference?,btohqsg
if groceries one of your chosen categories and not yet exceeded 312.5 spend in groceries category both Amaze and Maybank FnF directly are under groceries category. Suggest use Amaze to reduce fx fees.If groceries is not one of your chosen categories or exceeded 312.5 spend in groceries use Maybank FnF directly and be under MYR category.,btohqsg
Thanks for reply  then what the difference?,btohqsg
If the groceries not one of my chosen still can earn 8% cash back for the card??,btohqsg
Yes charge directly on card for ringgit,btohqsg
So meaning is I spend this card directly in Malaysia totally will get the 10 category together  right?,btohqsg
Does anyone use Card Up to bypass nerfed MCC codes? Which card would you recommend to link and can payment be made immediately?,btohqsg
How did u get conclusion u get 10 cat? U need to choose your 5 bonus cat and ringgit/idr is automatically inside,btohqsg
Oic  so if i still already hit up to 312.5 in groceries categories  so the same if i directly use in Malaysia,btohqsg
will clock to myr category so long mcc not excluded (even if not in the 10 categories) and not in the 5 chosen category or exceed 312.5 in a category  but myr category maxed out at 312.5,btohqsg
Now i know why they say max can earn 150 per month. 125 is for 5 category and other 25 is myr/INR spend,btohqsg
So if i using the Amaze in Malaysia so consider in sgd or myr? If spend in groceries both also same category? Or amaze under online  fashion  f&f card under groceries,btohqsg
Yes  paid via GIRO must be shown on statement. Usually 2 statement months after applying.Best is if you apply eGIRO to pay the company directly with HSBC EGA then when you confirmed your card is setup to be paid using GIRO then change to pay with your card.,btohqsg

Amaze dun change mcc  so will be under groceries category. Only start counting to MYR category if exceed 312.5 in groceries category and charge in MYR (using maybank fnf directly),btohqsg
Sorry l don't understand the max spend for each cat for the  fnf card  how come is $312.5? It's supposed to be $800 min spend on 5 categories  so l thought each will be $160? Also  can l spend $800 on just 1 of the cat to get 8% cashback if l can't accumulate $800 min with the other 4 categories?,btohqsg
25 rebate cap per category. 25/8% =312.5,btohqsg
So even if l spend $800 on 1 cat l can only get $25?,btohqsg

If I use alipay tied to ladies card to pay a Chinese travel agency  do I get 6mpd?,btohqsg
I think alipay may modify mcc and make it not eligible for UOB lady travel,btohqsg
Which card should I use then,btohqsg
oh i see! thanks Melyn. let me look in thisBest is if you apply eGIRO to pay the company directly with HSBC EGA. also damn.. i paid for my CRMC last night through AXS estation :')i suppose the 1% cashback on EGA applies to eGIRO and GIRO?,btohqsg
Sorry i remember wrongly. Alipay is varied while WeChat pay mcc is fixed 5999.,btohqsg
So the travel agent should be 4722 and hence can use ladies card? üôè,btohqsg
Nobody can confirm. U can always try out with small amt first before paying full amt,btohqsg
Am I right there isn't a way to check current month average balance for uob one account please,btohqsg
