Is it better to do TYS papers or other schools‚Äô prelim papers for o level preparation?,btohqsg
I personally would recommend past O level papers  not the prelim papers of schools,btohqsg
prelims are higher than o levels if u need the reaffirmation that u can do it,btohqsg
But the style and the phrasing of the questions can be very different for prelim papers,btohqsg

However  it only works with Apple devices,btohqsg
So yeah Apple want you to spend more on them,btohqsg
I was surprised that airpods worked at all on anything other than iphones,btohqsg

Without one  you're guaranteed to get micro scratches on your screen over time,btohqsg
Last time I use screenprotector  and I drop my phone. The screen cracked instead of the screen protector üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
