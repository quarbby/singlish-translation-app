hello all. wanna ask if will lta fail inspection due to camber issue?,btohqsg
even tho it‚Äôs just 1 wheel?,btohqsg
No idea man. It is a hit or miss. See the inspector's mood,btohqsg
Why only 1 wheel got camber,btohqsg
i change my rims & tyres & did alignment,btohqsg
the guy did everything swee swee then only 1 side of my wheel is out of the fenders,btohqsg
everything just nice except for this ü•π,btohqsg
Cos not supposed to have 1 wheel like that,btohqsg
U might wanna go to an alignment shop or what ask why is like that  issit an alignment issue or what,btohqsg
very slight  the rest of the wheels are just nice at the fenders there. then this one pop out slightly,btohqsg

hmm i think normal  i have noticed that on other cars too,btohqsg
need to start measuring underneath to rly find out thoüòÖ,btohqsg
like 1 side out of the fenders?,btohqsg
time to go do alignment again to see what‚Äôs the issue i guess,btohqsg
yea or at least the axles not centred,btohqsg
think my car got slight discrepancy as well,btohqsg
but could be just where i park is not even ah üòÇ,btohqsg
bothers me a bit but not too glaring,btohqsg
but on that topic  mine both side poking like urs or a bit more so shd be fine hahaha,btohqsg
when i full right turning got some sound  coming from my front wheel also. the opp side of this wheel set. not sure if it‚Äôs the rim scrapping the caliper or what or is some joints actually fucked ü§°,btohqsg
someone got the same issue also. he say he damn lucky pass inspection cos the guy good mood. by right fail ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
but if the difference for urs on both side too big  no harm checking üëç,btohqsg
Maybe give to mechanic to check. I would worry shits might happen like axle dropped out or drive shaft loosen,btohqsg
from the back angle my front also looks like that,btohqsg
planning on heading down tomorrow to go check asap,btohqsg
ahh for inspection shdnt be issue then,btohqsg
Like a grandpa aged toyota starlet,btohqsg
This is a cool small car. Actually wanted to get a Starlet.But I find it too small for modern family commitment.,btohqsg
The slightly newer starlets actually very big inside,btohqsg
Without modern safety features  the amount of space they can squeeze out is actually damn big,btohqsg
On the outside look smaller than a swift,btohqsg
some car look small on the outside but very spacious inside,btohqsg
The inside with boot space can fight a golf.,btohqsg
I not sure about how big the colt is tho,btohqsg
I see my friends fit full size bicycles,btohqsg
But front wheel removed of cus,btohqsg
u top down  can fit a tree,btohqsg
I know bigger than the old Starlet.Colt if want more space should go for Colt Plus Turbo. Colt Ver R is without butt so lesser space at the rear.,btohqsg
So when u say starlet small  when u drive colt i abit errr....,btohqsg
now Mit dont sell car anymore,btohqsg
But i'm team subie  so..  yay i guess? LOL,btohqsg
but the convertible colt look cute,btohqsg
i tot is render or what,btohqsg
it looks so funny  in a cute way,btohqsg
"is like colt saying ""i can be a miata too!""",btohqsg
but 100k in 2008 is damn expensive for tat car,btohqsg
i think mx5 also around that price,btohqsg
coe i think was like 10k only,btohqsg
wait for the 10 year cycle to drop,btohqsg
