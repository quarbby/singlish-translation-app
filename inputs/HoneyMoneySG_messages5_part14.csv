Do note FOREX is high risk  high return. This is not for beginners and i do not recommend,btohqsg
You can check with those who invested with SamTrade,btohqsg
they all have great returns  then suddenly not able to withdraw money,btohqsg
I told peoples not to invest in these instrument until saliva also dry,btohqsg
KskLook  I know you are passionate about FX trading and it may have made a lot of money for you (that's absolutely good for you). But I care for my subscribers and group members such that I don't even talk about FX trading because of the risks involved. If you want to promote this kind of money making activity  here is not the right place.Like@boontee86said  let's just move on from this conversation. Any further discussion on this will trigger a ban from any of the admins,btohqsg
Anything also can happen on these FX trading. I am a victim of Samtrade.,btohqsg
Have you read any due diligence post on Samtrade?,btohqsg
I even have friends with million frozen,btohqsg
Sure  crypto is fine. I will ask@wilflareto keep an eye on it,btohqsg
I think I will just stop here. Just want to warn guys here as long as you are not trading with your own $  then u are subjected to Hugh risk.,btohqsg
Not sure if you even watch my channel?,btohqsg
Anyone here owned amex gold kinda tempted to get it because it's gold..... And currently sitting on 60k annual income,btohqsg
not very well known or well used in singapore,btohqsg
as the AMEX Platinum Credit Card gives better perks for dining if you are willing to shelve out $140 in terms of annual fees,btohqsg
CPF medisave top up capped at 8k? if want to top up more per year cant?,btohqsg
received a check refund from CPF for excess amount,btohqsg
Yeah not much benefits and slapped with an annual fee  not something I would look into,btohqsg
Most likely your CPF contributions from 2021 income exceeded the CPF Annual limit of $37 740,btohqsg
For 2022 onwards it is not a concern anymore as you can VCMA up to BHS  ignoring CPF annual limit,btohqsg
Noleh  how much we can top up to MA per year,btohqsg
The best strategy for crypto is use only 1-5% of your networth (u likely can take it if it goes to zero). Then  if you fear holding the crypto since it can go to zero but could go to 10x (assymetric bet)  when your crypto goes 2x  sell halve the quantity to get back your initial investment  and hold the other half - this is called ‚Äúplaying with house money‚Äù.  If this crypto goes to 10x  u wont make 9x (10x - capital) but u will make 5x.  I think this is a safer less greedy strategy. One youtuber calls this the ‚Äúlittle old lady‚Äù strategy.Then rinse and repeat on another crypto you think can 10x..,btohqsg
Sadly I don't qualify for the plat CC as it's a 80k annual income card I'm only 60k,btohqsg
Noted. I personally feel that there are other credit cards (30K income req) that will beat the AMEX Gold card hands down. So just my opinion that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going for the gold card.,btohqsg
Just my own opinion  choose the card to complement your lifestyle not the other way. Maybe grab card is already good enough üòÜ,btohqsg
same idea here  though with several cards  I now mainly use Grab card + AMEX as I really don't want to keep track of messy stuff like merchant categories. whatsoever,btohqsg
Hi  besides DBS Altitude n Citi Premier  which other credit cards allow free access to airport lounge? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Stand Chart Visa Infinite and CIMB Visa Infinite too,btohqsg

Hihi! Worth to sign up UOB absolute card?,btohqsg
Because card benefits are guaranteed while investment/trading returns are not,btohqsg
you referring totomb.finance?for anyone jumping in  as usual please DYOR.tomb was hacked before and was only rescued by a billionaire Harry Yeh. what that translates into  only time can tell but please do your own risk assessment,btohqsg
This is just scratching the surface of crypto farming lol. And of all farms  the farms in the fantom ecosystem are very degen very risky and not suitable for average retail investor.,btohqsg
U can bring your msg to the official telegram group chat of tomb finance not here lol. Totally irrelevant,btohqsg
Hi does anyone have any introduction or recommendations onto DCA into s&p 500?,btohqsg
Must maintain any AUM to have access?,btohqsg
Must maintain any AUM to have access?,btohqsg
Anyone know if there‚Äôs anyway to topup cro with cc other than thru grab?,btohqsg
Anybody heard of ellufa before on crypto?,btohqsg
No need  purely apply for their card based on income level,btohqsg
you are topping up fiat (SGD)or buying crypto with CC?can use Revolut,btohqsg
some would say avoidunless you are applying for a job therewhich it seems to pay pretty well,btohqsg
I do use Revolut but only plan to go into Gold and not the Crypto,btohqsg
cakedefi suck  30% apy but it is inflation coin,btohqsg
Another good card for this is Maybank FnF (8%) + Amaze (1%). But because of the cap and specific categories it is quite difficult to track  but rewarding if you can hit those requirements,btohqsg
PM LEE ADDRESS:10 pax group size75% return to officemask wearing outdoors OPTIONAL!!,btohqsg
I'm so sad chicken is quitting YouTube,btohqsg
don't be sad. you still have@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
I think it is a good reminder to everyone that behind any personality is a human made of blood and flesh. A human could only take on so much damage from critism  doubt  judgement etc. End of the day  Don't shit on people when they are already down. Be nice  or just mind your own business. You never know what the other party is going throughI wished CGS a good journey to take care of his mental health in his comments section and return whenever he is ready. He is still a great inspiration to the Singapore Finance/Online Content Creator community.,btohqsg
what happen to him actually ?,btohqsg
Too many keyboard warrior bash about him. Even though everything he do is very transparent and real.,btohqsg
