Depends on your needs . If u think 1 room can put double deck bed the lower one can pull out another bed to totally sleeo 3 pax ok. 1 toilet .Means 3 pax if all 3 working office hrs need to wait for the others pax to finished right?So 3 pax is enough for some but 3 pax in flexi 2rm is not suitable for some,btohqsg
