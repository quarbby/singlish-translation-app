The HSBC Revo card cannot be used for lounge access? And also they have changed the MCC right  so can it be used for booking air tickets because it's under travel options...,btohqsg
this is seemingly a straightforward question  but to answer it would be actually distilling all the tips and tricks of this community and perhaps even ACCM tricks..,btohqsg
TLDR: you need to break it down into $100k sizes and do hoops and tricks to earn the max interest in each bank's high interest rate accounts,btohqsg
are dbs accounts/cards worth holding? currently im keeping 100k in uob one for p.a. interest and transferring out the extra balance into my existing dbs account  but dbs cards/rewards dont seem very competitive anymore,btohqsg
These cards not linked to bank account. Interest for unpaid balance.,btohqsg
no interest if u pay fully bill amount on the CC statement by due date,btohqsg
OK  if I didn't make any purchase of the month will there be any interest amount that I have to pay?,btohqsg
Except the miles what's the difference between citi premier miles and citi rewards mc?,btohqsg
No. If previous balances all paid.,btohqsg
Citi Premier = Citi Points (never expire)Crmc = Thank You Points (expire after 5 years of your card approval date),btohqsg
So as a beginner in credit card  which is the best credit card for accumulating miles and lounge access?,btohqsg
you can hit to those specialised cards (4mpd and 6mpd). but those cards do not have lounge access (i think). I would say crmc with amaze cause blacklist in nature.only generalised spend card (1.1mpd and above) have lounge access. personally i took citipm cause never expire and have 2 lounge visit as a starter,btohqsg
So it's between  citi premier and citi rewards right?,btohqsg
citipm = 1.2mpd (local)  2mpd (overseas)  x2 lounge access per yearcrmc = 4mpd (blacklist),btohqsg
What do you mean by blacklist?,btohqsg
So crmc can't be used for the complimentary lounge access?,btohqsg
you “don’t really need to be careful” when using crmc with amaze cause all can except the usual exclusions (insurances  utilities  fines etc).Conversely  a whitelist is something you need to be careful. Specialised Whitelist cards are HSBC Revo  UOB KFNOTE: There’s an updated list of merchants that will incur 1% additional cost (i think) when you use amaze linked to crmc.,btohqsg
CRMC doesn't come with lounge access,btohqsg
Usual exclusions and travel based MCCs...,btohqsg
Can citipm liked with instarem amaze?,btohqsg
oh yes crmc cannot use for travel MCC also. sorry about that!!!,btohqsg
Ohhh okok  so citi premier miles is the best for travelling right?,btohqsg
Yes but no bonus if local spend,btohqsg
U can jump the hoop for each bank or just simply nego a rate with your bank rm to get a privilege rate,btohqsg
So using citipm locally can't earn point?,btohqsg
The 1.2mpd not in terms of TY points.,btohqsg
What's the difference between citipm and dbs altitude card?,btohqsg
https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.htmlhi all  i emptied my uob one saving account on 31 dec so that my end day balance on 31 dec is $0  all these so that i can be eligible for the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion.i then put back in the 100k on 01 jan.however  on my uob tmrw app  it is recorded that the 100k was taken out and put back in on 02 jan.would i still be eligible for the promotion?@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
"It should note that by ""for travelling""  we refer to travel-related expenses like your hotel booking  airline booking  klook etc.",btohqsg
If you pay for a restaurant overseas as a part of your travel  that is Dining (assuming it's not in a hotel..),btohqsg
Yeah  I also meat by air ticket booking. Can used for Airbnb too?,btohqsg
should have emptied by 30 Dec 10.30pm  as after that it will be dated 2 Jan,btohqsg
Citi PM? Yeah you get 1.2mpd for that  but there are probably better cards. See what you have!,btohqsg
What's the difference between citipm and dbs altitude card?,btohqsg
Yeah  i know there even more better cards but I want a card that can be used for both miles and complimentary lounge access  so I was said that citipm is the one...,btohqsg
DBS Alt - 1.3mpd (in blocks of $5)Citi PM - 1.2mpd (blocks of $1),btohqsg
Can you breakdown into simpler terms?,btohqsg
can earn miles using 4mpd/6mpd cards  get lounge access pass using citi pm/dbs alt,btohqsg
"""If I spend $67  how much of the $67 will earn miles?""",btohqsg
oof :( how does it work? is it because 31 dec is weekend? transactions dont get updated?if i emptied on 30 dec 1030pm and only put it back in on 01 jan  it means i wont be earning interest on 30 and 31 dec?,btohqsg
dbs alt can get 1 DBS points every $1.54,btohqsg
Hmm  that's good. But the maintenance of those credit cards are difficult?,btohqsg
oo interesting information  didn't know about that,btohqsg
For UOB rising dragon promo  i transferred 1.6k on 2nd Jan  if i transfer separately another 98.4k today/tmr. I’ll still be considered eligible for 100k fresh funds right? Meaning seperate transfers. ( i know need to be incremental compared to earmarked 31st balance),btohqsg
What cards can be used for a beginner and earning miles without minimum spend for air tickets booking and hotel booking?,btohqsg
transactions on sunday/PH are dated next business day.If empty on 30 Dec before 10.30pm. 30 and 31 Dec will have $0 balance  can topup additional balance earlier in the month to get max interest for $100k monthly average balance,btohqsg
got it  everyday i learn something new... only sunday/PH transactions will be updated the next business day right?saturday transactions are updated immediately?,btohqsg
Hi  Was wondering if there’s any efficient ways to spend remaining  $1-200 for the min $500 spend for UOB ?,btohqsg
