amaze wallet seems to be swamped with top ups  have top-ups from different cards stuck pending for some hours,btohqsg
Grab within JB even a few km already 10rm. I think no issue.,btohqsg
Ya ppl rush to top up wallet first,btohqsg
Later i need to rmb to top more too haha,btohqsg
It is fine to msg anytime during the month of participation.Even if u SMS in on 10th June  the funds u had from 1-9th June still earns the promised rate.,btohqsg
if I understand correctky  top up with Paynow is still foc. no need rush to top up with master and visa.,btohqsg
Lol mastercard can get 1 percent from ega for me,btohqsg
U all pro. I never found a proper usage for amaze wallet other than just to cash out the amaze points.,btohqsg
For new open account on 28th May  I registered on 30th may  it entitle till 30 june  right? Or I still need to register on June again?,btohqsg
Every one withdraw from uob1 tomorrow?,btohqsg
I just received a letter from uob,btohqsg
Because i keep emptying out and then put back in for their promotions,btohqsg
they nid ur money to invest,btohqsg
So for those who r doing the same trick i am being your sacrificial lamb to show u at most 9 months they will do this liao,btohqsg
I think you also triggered off some AML flag too,btohqsg
Just use Chris's  pulled from his latest video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZMVJSrNnkðŸ’´ Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amaze,btohqsg
100k and 150k movement surely will raise suspicion la.. But thats how we r playing the game according to their promotion rules ma.. Especially previously was end of month balance,btohqsg
Are they even still relevant. Itâ€™s a backup to my YouTrip. lol,btohqsg
i use revolut becus can withdraw excess,btohqsg
You put this is it in uob ladies account?,btohqsg
Do u do the 2359 thing?,btohqsg
I also draw out 150 to 200 pay ocbc rewards outstanding sum,btohqsg
Then 28th. I put back...u draw. Out large sum.. but must able to put it back quickly,btohqsg
I've been rotating my funds around for a long time (not uob tho) but never kenna. It's common with so many high yield saving accounts giving bonus interest for only incremental balance. I don't see why others didn't kenna? Did you have other suspicious transactions?,btohqsg
Just big lump sum movement out and in at our so called right timing to maximise the high interest and promotions,btohqsg
I think they will check why $$$ go out of yr uob account,btohqsg
Erm... 200k also won't trigger if there's no STR. 200k to the banks is small cash flow.,btohqsg
360 is the first 3 numbers of his account number lol,btohqsg
Uob one acct la. Just the starting account number is 360.. Cannot be show all numbers ma,btohqsg
Be careful if this is uob ladys account. You may not be awarded 6 miles for your spending,btohqsg
Thats what i thought too.. But now it seems otherwise..,btohqsg
I've hit max daily limit of 250k... Nothing happened. Not once or twice.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if buying a private property  paying mostly cash instead of loan  which cards is best to do so? Prefer Cashback over miles  but open to miles suggestions.And when paying the first 25% is to the law firm right? Still new to this  please advice. Thank you.,btohqsg
Good for u. I am just sharing what happened to me when i just moved the 150k out for the very last time,btohqsg
But why you move out $$,btohqsg
He just explained in the very first message he sent lol,btohqsg
Did you keep moving it to different accounts under other people's name? And did you receive money from different account under many different names? That could be one red flag for the bank.,btohqsg
Still waiting for hsbc ega Jun promotion...,btohqsg
I really see no reason why a bank will want to terminate your account if you had only transfer your money among your own name with different banks... I'm sure the banks have been seeing this commonly.Even player A & B should work fine in theory otherwise many here will kenna already. Lol,btohqsg
When u move to other bank the big sum... what you do with the $$ there,btohqsg
Yea he just suey to kena this. A lot have been doing this for dunno how long never see any issues. Or maybe got other transactions that got flagged,btohqsg
Why the letter didn't say how the bank is sending back to you your balance  usually there is this line,btohqsg
Prior to this did you get calls from Uob first?,btohqsg
Hi  just to ask about UOB big saving payout promo  my funds are supposed to be earmarked by today. But till today  I checked my funds have not been earmarked. Does that mean Iâ€™m not enrolled into it?,btohqsg
When did you register and make the fund transfer? You transfer exactly the fresh fund amount or calculate to the detailed of your March MAB,btohqsg
It is luck  doesn't mean the rest are safeBanks have been closing accounts since years ago and the amount transferred usually not super big too..,btohqsg
Ohh my bad. I checked I register on 8th May and my funds hit on the same day too. Seems according to the tnc. Should be earmarked by 28june,btohqsg
Yea if thatâ€™s the case should be June,btohqsg
How you know he never haha,btohqsg
Yes. Asking about why i moved all the funds and where my funds come from etc,btohqsg
