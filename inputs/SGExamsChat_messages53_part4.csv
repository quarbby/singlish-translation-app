Lol pw really is luck sometimes,btohqsg
But it's sweet when the slackers get the B,btohqsg
If u suay suay get external examiner during op,btohqsg
Usually the last grp members to present get the hardest qns,btohqsg
I’m still proud of being the only 1 A student out of 9 students from my class that is under this shitty teacher. My secret? Get resources from ppl under good teacher ayyy,btohqsg
1 of the examiner was my physics tutor,btohqsg
"I rmb my pw op i got asked""What are aspects of your project work other groups can learn from?""Then the audience all laugh",btohqsg
Consult other tutors got this sticky situation of “go ask your teacher for permission first” then cue own teacher “why can’t ask me?”,btohqsg
I just flamed other grps work,btohqsg
So I just get the resources can Liao,btohqsg
Wow I’m amazed you got A for being undiplomatic,btohqsg
I rmb 5 of the audience members (they were the same grp) laughing at my answers,btohqsg
4 out of 5 of them got B in the end,btohqsg
I paused like 1min  and gave 4 points,btohqsg
Ok la but must admitPw was fun,btohqsg
Just that the work one has to do is dumb,btohqsg
Pw was never meant to be practical anyway,btohqsg
There’s another way to approach this  he can just highlight the challenges faced in his project and talk about his innovative workards without flaming,btohqsg
The remaining 3 points were flaming,btohqsg
Carry quite a bit but B,btohqsg
Then 3 people A in the group,btohqsg
Anyways I just tell myself that I dun need the A haha,btohqsg
I still remember my PW OP  first shift  first day  about time  fucking nervous  go to assessment room  -thank my lucky stars internally-  2 assessors  1 my OGCT  1 my CCA IC  I’m like Wah 马票都没有那么准。,btohqsg
I only remember writing the wr and stuff,btohqsg
My grp was quite op in writing WR,btohqsg
PI was hell  EOM was fun  I&R because there’s a new development after we finish our WR in the topic we’re covering  I naturally found an easy I&R to write and it’s fun.,btohqsg
We maxed out all marking points with 2.5k words,btohqsg
And were forced to increase it to 2.9k,btohqsg
PI was fun with Mrs Toh as your teacher,btohqsg
Tbh looking back at it PW wasn’t high workload,btohqsg
It is just because that we are so anal that we keep revising drafts,btohqsg
I wrote OP for my group mates instead,btohqsg
Must contribute by playing to your strengths,btohqsg
Big part of PW is redoing things to make it better,btohqsg
My group leader and I did 80% of the WR,btohqsg
PW is the definition of semula,btohqsg
But the other 3 carried OP,btohqsg
I wish Uni research papers worked that way,btohqsg
So it’s all fair and good,btohqsg
But now looking back at it 1 year is more than sufficient to complete everything,btohqsg
I mean that’s the point right,btohqsg
??? Uni research is about redoing to make it better,btohqsg
In uni you ‘technically’ can rush your essay in 1 week and at some point you just submit it in,btohqsg
Can but ain’t nobody gonna read a draft like your PW tutors,btohqsg
Can  just that less time is spent on each individual essay,btohqsg
You can get feedback so IDK what this guy is on,btohqsg
Well I Guess I’m unlucky with my profs then  with the exception of 1  my other ones have only been a research proposal is the Max I’m reading (aka 1 page outline),btohqsg
You put less emphasis into each essay  I feel,btohqsg
It's probably because it's not their research.,btohqsg
Are you doing your own research or their research,btohqsg
