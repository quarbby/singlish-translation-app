not sure cos its a friend's friend sooooo,btohqsg
N Levels English is near impossible to fail unless you donâ€™t even do the paper at all,btohqsg
And even if you fail English  as long as your emb3 < 19 you can still go sec 5,btohqsg
nitec phasing out liao  now is 3 year higher nitec,btohqsg
im last batch nitec for my course,btohqsg
I guess that's better for people,btohqsg
If not nitec to hnitec to poly is like 4 years,btohqsg
does np accept rallysicksg teleconsult mc,btohqsg
Well my 2 years in NS are NOT COUNTED SO I AM NOT going to be 25. >:(,btohqsg
Actually idk how old i am at this rate,btohqsg
Hi what happens if I barely fail English olevels like E8 (I have my eae it's d7 requirement) I think I did really badly for my English,btohqsg
I think all poly course needs at least d7 English,btohqsg
My paper 2 was very bad,btohqsg
P1 31/70P2 15/50LC 12/30Oral 18/30I calculated roughly,btohqsg
I get 42% which is E8,btohqsg
Dae works only if u fulfil minimum requirement,btohqsg
based on the answers circulating around,btohqsg
Hi my friend in rp got his EAE offer for engineering with E8 english- I think it depends on the batch,btohqsg
how much did your friend usually score for his English in prelims ?,btohqsg
I am not sure sorry but his English is not the strongest ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I would say don't think so hard for now  go prepare for your other papers and relax if you don't have any other papers. O Levels isn't the end of the road. There are still other ways to achieve your goalðŸ’ª,btohqsg
dw abt ur results. Study hard for remaining paper.,btohqsg
From my understanding is  you can still enter jc or poly but in your first yr of jc or poly  you have to retake O level English again,btohqsg
Stress will make you burn out easily and unable to concentrate for next paper,btohqsg
Idk if applicable for poly but one of my china friend from jc kena that before,btohqsg
He had to retake O level English during his J1,btohqsg
You probably would only obtain those offers if you appeal directly with the institution. But it's not the end of the world ya  the education system today is not the same it was 10 years ago.,btohqsg
Nope. U can still enter poly w d7 based on poly website. Some course ask u to retake and some wont but u have to do English express language course in sem 1 at least fr np,btohqsg
It is bruh   I keep thinking what the point of studying if can't make it anywhere ...,btohqsg
There is a lot of pathways now to achieve your dream. Don't just stop at O Levels friend :),btohqsg
I myself took a slightly longer route  being a NA student and going to poly. I still end up in studying in a University.,btohqsg
it's even more wasted to not keep working based on an assumption of yours,btohqsg
there's nothing absolutely concrete indicating how you did that,btohqsg
Cross the bridge when the time comes. For now do your best for the rest of your papers. What's done is done.,btohqsg
No point crying over something that's done already,btohqsg
I've been there before  and I told myself that I gave my best  and whatever results come my way  I'll just take it in my stride. Couple of my classmates cried because they didn't get the result they wanted  but they took it in their stride  did what they could and came out a better version of themselves.,btohqsg
business courses need C6 i think,btohqsg
yup but i think to grad w a diploma from business  media  early childhood  etc  u need to retake ur english during poly years,btohqsg
why are you so sure about your paper 1 score?,btohqsg
i think op sees tuition centre ans key scheme,btohqsg
where got answer scheme for essay?,btohqsg
sci and maths paper last year,btohqsg
31 points means 10 points for essay and sw maybe it will be higher?,btohqsg

Bell curve exists and don't worry too much- things will be different,btohqsg
And besides the answers are not fully confirmed,btohqsg
Bro I just released I underline the editing one instead of circling,btohqsg
I'm getting 0 for that now ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Or wld they let it slide for underling the errors ?,btohqsg
bro stop stressing and focus on ur other exams,btohqsg
