Anyone familiar with using Kris+ for travel spend? Since it uses Google pay  the MCC code will be the travel agent? Means HSBC revolution would be the ideal card to pair with Kris+ cause CRMC excludes travel?,btohqsg
MCC is retained (so ya... avoid CRMC),btohqsg
Yep. If u spend at travel related stuff  will earn miles,btohqsg
OK thanks for the replies! Now need to find a card that gives bonus miles for travel/online  does not exclude gpay or travel  with as high a monthly limit as possible ü§î  sounds like DBS WWMC is the choice here,btohqsg
Which cash back card is best for paying medical (not hospitalization) expense?,btohqsg
Will I earn 4mpd on getgo using hsbc revolution ?,btohqsg
So kris + is not considered as online spending? Is it under travel category?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs considered online spending  but the mcc remains the same,btohqsg
So Kris+ is a wallet app that uses Gpay. So the original merchant MCC is retained.. meaning depending what you buy on Kris+ the MCC is different. Should count as online,btohqsg
But because it uses Gpay need to check if the card excludes mobile wallet payments,btohqsg
So amaze + crmc won't work cos the Mcc remains the same?,btohqsg
For travel merchants yes. For example  Eu holidays or CTC travel. At least from the way I understand and the replies I have gotten from experienced folksFor dining and the rest of the merchants on Kris+  CRMC + Amaze works,btohqsg
Have cash to pay for fully for hdb  it is stupid to pay fully for hdb? Or taking a loan is better,btohqsg
Do you have cpf OA to pay down the loanÔºü,btohqsg
Pay cash is good   no more loan...,btohqsg
Not much cpf  don‚Äôt have a stable job  I think I might have problem securing a loan too,btohqsg
Whether it is better to pay for a HDB flat in cash or to take out a loan depends on your personal financial circumstances and goals. Here are some factors to consider:Interest Rates: If the interest rates on your savings or investments are lower than the interest rate on your HDB loan  it may make sense to take a loan and invest your money elsewhere. However  if the interest rate on your loan is higher than the return on your investments  it may be more financially prudent to pay cash for the HDB flat.Monthly Expenses: If you take out a loan  you will have to make monthly payments towards it. You should consider whether you can comfortably afford these payments without compromising your other financial goals.Opportunity Cost: If you have a large sum of cash that you could use to pay for your HDB flat  you should consider the opportunity cost of using that money. Would you be better off investing the money elsewhere  or using it for other expenses or financial goals?Risk Tolerance: Taking out a loan involves taking on debt  which may not be suitable for everyone. If you are risk-averse  you may prefer to pay for your HDB flat in cash and avoid taking on debt.Ultimately  there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. You should consider your own financial circumstances and goals before deciding whether to pay cash for your HDB flat or take out a loan. It may also be helpful to consult a financial advisor or planner for guidance.,btohqsg
Depends on your ability to invest. Or you want peace of mind of being loan free. No right and wrong. Depends on your situation and your feelings.,btohqsg
Hi all  why for the Ayam Penyet no Cashback of $1.80? It's under the qualified hawkers for DBS $3 Cashback,btohqsg
You should buy the more expensive item first.,btohqsg
What are the alternative to secure a loan besides  having a jobüòÇ yes I do feel investing is way better than paying cash fully for hdb,btohqsg
Illegal money lenders  also known as ah long.,btohqsg
While having a job is a common way to secure a loan  there are alternative ways to do so  such as:Using Collateral: You can secure a loan by providing collateral  such as your home  car  or other valuable assets. This way  the lender has a form of security in case you are unable to repay the loan.Co-Signer: If you don't have a job or a good credit score  you can ask someone with a good credit history and stable income to co-sign the loan with you. The co-signer becomes responsible for the loan if you default on the payments.Peer-to-Peer Lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to borrow money from individual investors. The investors review your credit history and decide whether to lend you money. This can be a good option if you have a good credit score  but no job or income.Savings Accounts: You can also consider taking a secured loan against your savings account. This way  you can use your savings as collateral  and the lender can provide you with a loan based on the value of your savings.It's important to note that each of these alternatives has its own risks and requirements  so it's important to research and understand the terms and conditions before applying for any loan.,btohqsg
Ahh icic thanks for the info,btohqsg
Actually although on paper the usual advise is to consider whether investment can earn more than the interest   I think in reality many people choose not to pay in full because it feel more safe to have some amount of liquid cash on hand.,btohqsg
"If its HDB loan there are other ""benefits"" too. Eg. If one of the couple pass away the other don't need to pay. You can Google for more info.",btohqsg
