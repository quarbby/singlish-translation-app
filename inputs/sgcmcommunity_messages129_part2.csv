Unless you have a very easy to move car,btohqsg
Because dealers also don't want their money tied up in the cars,btohqsg
Also if you're selling to a dealer you're still unlikely to get a very good price unless your car age is <5 years,btohqsg
As the market prices are indeed high but dealers are buying at low prices to be able to have enough wiggle room if the car cannot move quick enough,btohqsg
