Unless the EV charging has matured sufficiently well enough  there is no point buying an EV car as it will likely be nightmarish to keep waiting for it to be charged to full capacity especially in public places ex shopping malls while still having to pay for parking there. ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
Or the sniper on the bridge that take beautiful pic of Ur car,btohqsg
I dun like pump Full in sg. No benefit and add weight to the car. I always pump in 25-30L range. If got vouchers then only need $60 spending,btohqsg
Some I saw is at IKEA one car waiting for the charging point,btohqsg
Or I wait till almost empty the. Use two voucher min spent 120 to get 8 dollars off,btohqsg
i wonder if anyone here shakes the car,btohqsg
Yea! That way we maximise our savings,btohqsg
Too Low your fuel pump might not like it and starts to heat apparently â€¦ or so I heard,btohqsg
With the rising petrol price   120 SGD won't be very low maybe just 1/4 left,btohqsg
Sorry sorry I meant if you run your tank until it is almost empty,btohqsg
