Big bird told me 2.65% bonus interest for public HSBC EGA Jan/Feb reference month December.,btohqsg
Yeah but can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs unexpected.,btohqsg

Check if you received this SMS,btohqsg
I registered for the Nov window  but did not get this SMS. Seems like it's a toss-up,btohqsg
Doublecheck both SMS and HSBC app notification (bell button),btohqsg
New UOB salary credit promo doesnt allow individual to paynow . Not sure if this affect the new promo only. Hopefully it doesnt affect the salary credit hack for normal UOB one account interest,btohqsg

Very disappointed that the reference mth is Oct... Hopefully the public promo at the lower rate uses Nov or Dec as the reference month...,btohqsg

I would like to waive the annual fee of Standard Charter Journey Credit Card. Via mobile banking  it didn't allow me to do. Anyone knows how to do it? Thanks,btohqsg
Can call their help line but many ppl didn't get waived,btohqsg

Even smart they playing punk and introducing $90 fee,btohqsg
For SCB  only use their prudential visa signature to earn points for my prudential policies.,btohqsg
And they are delaying the bonus for SCB Smart so that we have to wait till April to cancel üôÉ,btohqsg

Hi  has anyone received the monthly bonus interest for UOB stash acc today?,btohqsg
Weird  I did not receive the interest today üòî,btohqsg
Most likely you withdrew fund and below ADB Dec compare to ADB Nov.,btohqsg
I called Uob in Dec and was told I can withdraw the excess above $100k. Their info over phone incorrect sia,btohqsg
You must withdraw all interest on the same day otherwise it will affect your month ADB and you will miscalculate of your ADB after a day of interest withdrawal.,btohqsg
Are there 2 different product / promotion?  I didn't receive sms nor notification  can participate?,btohqsg

No clue. Haha. Depends on the actual tnc,btohqsg
I also have $100k in stash account. So we cannot withdraw a single cent or no bonus interest?,btohqsg
So long your current ADB is equal or higher than last month ADB.,btohqsg
May I check if I have both UOB One and EvoL  which one should I can cancel? Understood either card spending will be eligible for the one account bonus interest,btohqsg
Depending on your spending. Calculate which one gives you more cashback then cancel the other one.,btohqsg

CPF FRS video update coming in at 5pm,btohqsg
Maybe hsbc really wanna looks like they are special,btohqsg
My guess is they want to gauge the response from the BTL offering  before going public,btohqsg
Hallo ppl  eg u are currently paying HDB loan and ur employment contribution can cover that loan and u have 30k in ur OA  but u don't wish to pay down the loan (2.6% can be easily beaten)  it actually make sense to invest into endowus rite? (100% equity portfolio). Any blind spot that I could potentially miss out? (No plan to OA > SA  as the investment return from endowus may help me pay down the house earlier).,btohqsg
Anybody else faced a similar issue with their SC 360 points?,btohqsg

Anyone encountered this : I just received a credit card from DBS out of nowhere. The card is not in my account when I check. I didn't apply for any new cards. Rather disturbing.,btohqsg
Yah loh  I should not have even attempted here Dec spending promo  so then Jan might get a lower amount,btohqsg
I am going to make a big payment of $1 520 for flight tickets of me and my friends. I was thinking should I use Citirewards to accumulate miles but I have already hit $1k with this card? On the other hand  was thinking  should I use SC Simply cash Credit card which gives 1.5% unlimited cashback without cap? So not sure which one will be better,btohqsg
Citi Rewards don't give bonus for flights in the first place,btohqsg
Greattt  thank you for prompt response ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Could you provide the link? Couldn't find this.,btohqsg
Yes  but risk of going below 2.6% p.a. also. Anyway best to take as long as possible to pay back.Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Wrt trust cashback  for overseas spending  good. Local spend  debatable and lil bit tricky.,btohqsg
Just saw the email. But is it 2.9% + 1% =3.9%? No T&C,btohqsg
Based on their pattern  maximum also 2.70% p.a. bonus interest + 0.05% p.a. base interest + 1% p.a. Everyday+ rewards bonus interest.Maximum 3.75% p.a. EIR.Only scared this part:Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered for the December EGA Bonus Interest Promotion & November EGA Bonus Interest Promotion.,btohqsg
I got fee waiver with SCB like 3-4 months ago  but that is my last card with them,btohqsg

Hi guys  I recently used my Amaze card at a store. The first 2 times the payment was declined and 3rd time it went through. However  I found out that the transactions actually went through to my citi credit card and I called the bank as well to verify that. Anyone encountered this before?,btohqsg
What I know for journey man credit card they usually don‚Äôt allow waiver. They probably know a lot of people get the card for free lounge access,btohqsg
For the CPF Top-up using EGA  do you guys apply eGIRO redirected from CPF?,btohqsg
What does the transaction say on your Citibank statement?,btohqsg

Called the bank  they  also said its charged and asked me to check with merchant,btohqsg

Lucky i got some locked in at 3% earlier. Would have done more if i had more capital. Now bank interest rate is getting close to that.,btohqsg
yup it is a bet that in the long term  short term interest rates will dip below 3% p.a. if that makes sense..considering it is puttable anytime at 100% back to government.,btohqsg
oh i got this email too.. it just says 2.9% p.a. with no full details..likely that is unattainable one..>$2m and premier jade customer?,btohqsg
The only downside is the reference month is Oct instead of Dec.,btohqsg
Understand Grab rewards is not as great compared to previous years.However I have a deposit payment of around $3k to make for an ID that allows Grab or Paynow. Is it still a good idea to use Grabpay? Seeking some opinions.,btohqsg

It‚Äôs upside for me. My Oct adb is lower than my Dec adb,btohqsg
Topup with Uob absolute still got 0.3%. So $9 Loh.,btohqsg
But is there any reward points for top-up and payment? I guess no more right?,btohqsg

Yeah SMS into BTL in the afternoon Liao. No fish prawn also ok,btohqsg

Can Amaze + Citi Rewards still be used to pay Healthhub bills to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Citi rewards works for healthhub without amaze,btohqsg

Hi gurus. Any advice if this Tiger Promo is worth going for,btohqsg

hi all  for purchases in shopee sg  to get the 4mpd do we directly use Citi Rewards card or still need to use Amaze+Citi rewards?,btohqsg

Direct Citi rewards should be fine,btohqsg

Thanks  if join today and insurance due today can still make it please? would Amex krisflyer ok for the credit card please? Thank you so much üòä,btohqsg
For cardup transaction  it will take a few days for payment to reach so most likely won't make it in time.Amex Krisflyer can work but rewards is not worth the fee.,btohqsg
You can.. the voucher will be issued within 5 mins once you deposit the equivalent amount.. and you can transfer out after the voucher is issued,btohqsg
Thanks so much üôè which card would be worth please?,btohqsg
As this is a public forum  no one can advise you. You'll have to do your own research and make your own call. Good practice is to analyse your picks  diversify  DCA and review.,btohqsg
Yes. If you plan to use it.,btohqsg
Cannot. But usually no issues if late by few days. Check on CardUp FAQ to see which cards are eligible for rewards.,btohqsg
The credit bureau report can just go in check? I thought is when u sign up credit card then they will send u or either u pay to get the credit bureau report?,btohqsg
Need to pay if there is no free one from another credit card application,btohqsg
Do u know if any hotline can call to check?,btohqsg

Oic.. Tot max out the miles then use other CC,btohqsg
Every bank has1. Reducing balance BT2. Upfront fee BT3. Term loanMust read the tnc properly focussing on the term EIR (effective interest rate) which all banks are required by MAS to publish unambiguously.Lower EIR the better.,btohqsg
Now we know how they do it. Tokenised cards can be sent to applepay?????A credit card fraudster who bought S$65 000 worth of Universal Studios Singapore tickets has been jailed.That's almost 800 tickets:https://cna.asia/4fK9o4T,btohqsg
Those Fraud transaction.Many leaked info in cc. It is not hard to obtain by scammer. Cc system 16digit is a bit obsolete in terms of security.,btohqsg
Pray his sentence don't lighten ever lol,btohqsg
I heard got debate on this before.If I were u I would play safe and put start of month.,btohqsg
https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/singaporeans-fall-further-into-credit-card-debt-as-rollover-balances-hit-record-high.7093537/Insane how much CC debt rolled over. These people should never be eligible for CCs lol.,btohqsg
If you do it on the eve of CNY  you get $5+. After CNY  you get few cents. The amount depends on when you start.,btohqsg
Honestly don't make sense if open on 31 Jan and get 31 days of interest.DP on UOB Stash account:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/258961,btohqsg
Or else how we get those rewards. üòÇShld thank them.,btohqsg
We need to hope that these people don't end up bankrupt to continue supporting our CC rewards üëÄ,btohqsg
can also if not getting higher rewards (miles/rebate) on other cc,btohqsg
I know some banks use calendar days per month to calculate adb. They don‚Äôt care when u open.But I don‚Äôt know which banks use which method. So I would always play safe and assume the most conservative way to dividing by number of days of the month always to determine adb.Especially when adb is relied on for calculating interest / future interest  I won‚Äôt risk it.,btohqsg
Yup. I also just assume that they calculate directly by calendar days in the month whether open on 1 or 31. To be safe.,btohqsg
Interest paid. Of course is based on how many days the month your money is actually inside. Haha.No bank will pay you 31 days interest if u only put one day.Can‚Äôt remember who wanted to argue on this for cimb poorly worded tnc but no way that would happen. lol.,btohqsg
Anybody know what is this means ?The contact would tell Nai how many USS tickets to buy  and send tokenised credit cards to the Apple Pay app on his phone.,btohqsg
My belief is that someone is somehow able to send a ‚Äúcredit‚Äù card using Apple phones to each other without the need to further authenticate. That‚Äôs why can scam.,btohqsg
That means those  who kena fraud transaction n credit card companies refuse to waive/cancel the transaction  are able to use this news as a prove to request the bank to cancel the fraud transactions charged using Applepay. CorrectÔºü,btohqsg

Did u managed to find out? I also can't find not sure is it the a/c number they emailed,btohqsg
Last day the interest is 0.05% of 3k+  not 3%  about 14cents.,btohqsg
Is that your dp? Fresh opened on the last day of month with 100k?,btohqsg
yeah i guess is proof of concept.. but whether or not will be accepted is another thingbut it certainty shows ApplePay is not proof of CARD PRESENT transaction...recently also got news those China scammers got caught trying to buy Ipads/Iphones at Istudio/Challenger with other people's cards in their Applepay (which led to the stupid suggestion by 'officials' for shops to check physical card when using Applepay),btohqsg
Please search the chat for the debate  actual DPs are more valuable contributions. And as I mentioned  I would personally assume it's calendar days to calculate MAB.,btohqsg
Ok but login id and the email a/c dif though,btohqsg
They take user id..not a/c no.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not 3%  anything below MAB 10k is 0.05%. Last year  I deposited 100k 30Oct and I got 28cents interest for month of Oct.,btohqsg
So you opened the account on 30 Oct?,btohqsg
Yes (mistake‚Ä¶) peiseh ‚Ä¶ I opened early 2024. I mistaken you asking me whether I deposited 30 Oct.,btohqsg
Anyone has a OCBC 360 account referral code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
thanks for the DP but i am sure there will still be people who doubt you.For me  i always assume KIASI and the worst case. Why take the risk when you can get the CONFIRMED result doing on the first few days of the month,btohqsg
Invalid DP. Seehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/258961based on Queenie's do.,btohqsg
that's 2 days interest for $100 000 at 0.05% p.a.Good evidence.EDIT: debunked.,btohqsg
As long as the account was freshly opened on 30 Oct* and not earlier  the DP is valid üëçüèªBut if opened on 1 Oct  and deposit on 30 Oct  it is NOT the same and DP is invalid.,btohqsg
Not true as that is base interest  bonus interest always posted next month leh,btohqsg
Forgotten about this part.M Serverany bonus interest earned on 2nd Nov?,btohqsg
I open stash late mar  bonus interest come in apr leh. Base interest is last day of month. So those who claim is based on full month just dont know how it work for stash,btohqsg
so by right you should get2 days of $50k @ 3% = $8.204 days of $50k @ 3% = $16.44Total Bonus Interest should be = $24.64but you only get $5?,btohqsg
50 k not 3 percent eir,btohqsg
but $5 interest is like 0.6% p.a.?,btohqsg
First 10k is 0.05  next 30k is 2  next 30k is 3  last 30k is 5,btohqsg
ok given these stats.. still cannot reconcile why you only get $5 bonus interest... which day exactly did you open your stash in march?,btohqsg
26 mar ah if i recall correctly,btohqsg
Zero because Oct MAB is lower the Sep MAB.,btohqsg
Just calculated  you're right!12 Mar - opened UOB Stash account28 Mar - 50k deposited30 Mar - 50k depositedMar MAB - 15k (bonus interest of 1.95% p.a. for the 5k above first 10k for 20 days)Base interest - $0.41 (15k √ó 0.05% √ó 365 √∑ 20)Bonus interest - $5.34 (5k √ó 1.95% √ó 365 √∑ 20)#dpfor UOB Stash account opening,btohqsg
haha she just said 26th marchback to Excel!,btohqsg
I saw 12 Mar based on the statement.,btohqsg
I say if i recall correctly lol so maybe i am wrong. That is not my statement  is my player 2,btohqsg
Anyway  i know mab only start from day u open for uob stash,btohqsg
oh ok..so TLDR... stash ADB is based on number of days the account is opened for in the opening month?,btohqsg
Yes like ladys for bonus uni dollar,btohqsg
Some people just din count the fact that bonus interest credit next month and make statement loh.,btohqsg
And also he has the account in Sep with higher MAB than Oct  which totally negates all his DP already.,btohqsg
This happen when people dont know how stash work. Must maintain mab or increase. That why if put for earmark must totally dont touch stash de or withdraw only bonus interest the day it is credited.Base interest can never be withdraw during earmark as it count toward the month mab which make it higher by default,btohqsg
Does Maybank family and friends card work with amaze for local spend? Like converting offline retail to ‚Äúonline shopping‚Äù?,btohqsg

how u know he had account before oct?,btohqsg
Alot of people often claim certain bank acct no bonus or not working for them without knowing the criteria of each bank acct.I myself being earmark alot of time also will make stupid mistake like register wrong acct number de lol.,btohqsg

How much do you have? Like 50k  100k  150k etc,btohqsg
For lower range of saving like 50k  I think there is merit of bonus saver. UOB one shines when u get close to 150k,btohqsg
Are you able to fulfill UOB credit card spend of 500?,btohqsg
Hold on ah. I have some time so lemme check some info,btohqsg
Ok  bc i use bonussaver but then learned that a lot of their categories decreased,btohqsg
does anyone know if theres a way to download citibank statements as excel/csv?,btohqsg
Not really.. UOB One account with lowest tier (less than $30k) with $2k salary credit and $500 card spend is already better than SCB Bonus$aver  which you need to fulfill $3k salary credit...3% p.a. + good cashback/miles card vs 1.05% p.a. (honestly you throw into anywhere also better)And to increase to 2.05% p.a. you need to spend $1000 on their no rewards card...,btohqsg
Ya I noticed SC interest dropped to 2.85% pa,btohqsg
Where got 2.85% p.a.... the only good thing is if you are new to Bonus$aver account  can get $150 if maintain $20k upon account opening (or AirPods 4 if maintain $50k) and credit salary.,btohqsg
I would say avoid Bonus$aver at all cost... Never insure or invest with banks (if you're not a üê≥)...,btohqsg

Hi everyone  could you please advise on the best place to park a 50k fund?I‚Äôm open to taking some risk in exchange for higher returns.I‚Äôm currently considering the following options  but I‚Äôm unsure which offers the best interest rate at the moment:1. OCBC 3602. Fixed Deposit3. GXS Boost Pocket4. Chocolate Finance5. moomoo / Tiger MMF,btohqsg
These are mix of savings and investment accounts. Definitely investment accounts will give you higher return for higher risk. Do you require your capital to be protected?,btohqsg
Yes  I understand. There is no need to be capital guaranteed. But of course  I‚Äôm expecting a higher return if going for non-capital guaranteed investment. Let‚Äôs say capital guaranteed makes 3-3.5%  non-capital guaranteed makes 3.5-4%. If it‚Äôs just an extra 0.5%  I wouldn‚Äôt take the risk  because not really worth it.,btohqsg
Hi All  need some help. I hold few positions of CSPX Ireland domiciled etf on IBKR. Just curious to know  if I sell these positions is it tax free like US stocks or is it taxed for the capital gains? Pls help. Thx,btohqsg
Hi is the HSBC live+ promo here for new to bank or new cardholders or for existing cardholders?,btohqsg
If you can fulfill salary  save and spend criteria  can consider OCBC360. If want hassle free  can consider Choco Finance. That is my take,btohqsg
Yeah  it seems like not many alternatives nowadays.,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong it‚Äôs combined. But better check with CS again.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check on online transactions relating to Citi Rewards card? For MCC 5816 Digital goods (Games) done online  does it count for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all experts. Can I ask  which card is good for paying insurance premiums? Haha,btohqsg
Eh what perks can I get from using Maybank card to pay insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Maybank horizon  0.24 mpd.Maybank VI  1.2mpdWith maybank VI  spend above 3k  one limo ride,btohqsg
Has anyone transferred in stocks from 1 brokerage to another for the rewards? (I.e. tiger -> moo moo) Is it worth the effort and rewards!Please advise shifus! üôè,btohqsg
Eh any min requirements for Maybank VI? Haha,btohqsg
$150k income. This one quite strict,btohqsg
Wow but in summary  only Maybank cards can still earn points or air miles for paying insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Maybank Platinum Visa  3.33% cashback (tiered  insurance can only make 50% of spend  can use CardUp to make up for the other 50%),btohqsg
hello everyone  UOB one card payment to AXS dont qualify for the min $500 spend criteria?,btohqsg
Many thx for the info. So if my intention is to earn miles from my insurance premiums  the Platinum Visa is not the card to do for  correct?,btohqsg
So Maybank horizon would b the best choice for insurance premiums if I want to earn from insurance premiums? Or any card tat goes through Cardup can earn miles?,btohqsg
Cards like UOB PRVI  1.4mpd for Cardup,btohqsg
Use HSBC ega giro 1% rebate easier,btohqsg
Why just get 1% when you can get miles AND the 1%?,btohqsg
To me ega  just do one time then no need think so many,btohqsg
I also do 1 time and get BOTH 3.33% cashback AND 1% cashback. Nothing to think about.,btohqsg
hi guys i‚Äôm new to this and tried to apply for citi rewards as my first card  got rejected  gx credit score as i only started working last year  do they only allow those with more than a year of salary?,btohqsg
Hi. Is there any sign up promos on the trade broker platforms (i.e. Webull  moomoo  IBKR) and also referral codes for 2025?,btohqsg
Hi shifu  any idea where can I change my coin without any fees?,btohqsg
2% lol. just lazy to move funds around. might just close this and move to something more useful,btohqsg
usually spend them at shengsiong or those accept coin place. easier,btohqsg
yeah sian i missed it lol,btohqsg
Eh I like to use Citibank cards as their miles wun expire until u want to use it. But to ask all the shifus here  what is a better card to use and earn miles? Haha,btohqsg
Citi reward with amaze it is 5 year expiry from card issue month,btohqsg
Ya I heard of amaze before  but in comparison with cardup  which is better?,btohqsg
Hi experts  I‚Äôm thinking of investing my SRS using poems. May I ask what‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äúamundi msci world ii ucits etf‚Äù vs ‚Äúamundi index msci world a12s (c)‚Äù which are both available on poems?,btohqsg
I use Citi PremierMiles card to earn miles for now. But dun know if I should consider other cards for this purpose,btohqsg
If you have only worked less then 6 months  you may want to opt for cards without income requirements or secured credit cards ($10k fixed deposit).,btohqsg
2 different things. You might want to be specific in your original question.,btohqsg
oh eh if i am looking at earning miles  can only use cardup?,btohqsg
If u dont want expired miles dbs altitude is 1.3 mpd. Normal card will be uob privi 1.4 mpd. High end card will be various bank like dbs vantage etc,btohqsg
You can check out CardUp calculator for eligible cards. We are not sure what you are asking for now lol. Why mention CardUp when you talking about earning miles?,btohqsg
"does transferring money  from DBS account to YouTrip via Paynow classify under ""payment"" category for multiplier interest calculation?",btohqsg
hello all  any credit card promotions now? thanks in advance!,btohqsg
For other spends  Citi rewards+ amaze is a much better combo,btohqsg
eh my main qns is wanting to know how best can i earn miles? i didn't know on what is cardup until it was mentioned here  so i am not sure on how i can use cardup to earn miles as well. sry for the confusion.,btohqsg
What's the point of using the UOB One card if you cant spend at least $500 on it? Might as well put everything on the UOB Lady's to earn 0.4mpd on the non-bonus category spend?,btohqsg
Hi  I am about to apply for a credit card  is it smart to let the bank decide the credit limit or is it better to decide on our own. Second question  will my credit limit with Bank A affect me if I try to apply another credit card for Bank B? Thank you,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/ejWZOXCykbgSuggest you watch other videos on the same playlist to find out more about certain cards.,btohqsg
Then you won‚Äôt get the UOB one rebate. It needs min $500,btohqsg
I usually let bank decide my limit. Limit from one bank does not affect limit from another. Although i recall there was some agreement betwen trust and standard chartered.,btohqsg
I see  thanks for the insight!,btohqsg
Easiest is to let the bank decide. They have their way to calculate the credit limit  and they may just give you what they calculated if you over requested. Best practice to keep credit limits high.Credit limits are separated for each banks. They are more concerned if you are applying multiple cards in a short time  have defaulted/late payment before or if you are new to credit cards/loans. All are recorded in your CBS profile.Just make sure you pay off your bills inFULLevery month. If you can't then just don't get a credit card.,btohqsg
Thanks for all the reply  I heard from somewhere that all the bank share the same pool of credit limit (so if bank A used it up  bank B can‚Äôt issue it anymore). So this is a misconception?,btohqsg
No such thing. See second para of my earlier reply.Only same bank different cards share a pool.,btohqsg
You still need to hit $500 minimum spend monthly on UOB One Card to earn cashback.,btohqsg
Hi everybody  do you guys still know if ride hailing apps like Gojek and grab work with hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
Indirectly it will affect as each bank has a risk exposure framework to determine each individual maximum unsecured exposure across all FI in SG. May not be apparent if you have only v few cards/unsecured loans.,btohqsg
It is not a pool but maximum unsecured exposure across all FIs in SG.,btohqsg
And even you consistently pay your minimum payment amount but if your outstanding balance  exceed 12x your monthly salary  your credit facilities will be suspended until you bring down your balance below the 12x.https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/explainers/ongoing-credit-checks-and-requirements/borrowing-limit-on-unsecured-credit,btohqsg
Hi all! May I know which miles credit cards are best for paying at gain city?Okay to apply new cards.Currently I have the following cards:UOB PPVUOB LADY‚ÄôSUOB PRVI MILESAMAZE + CITI REWARDSDBS WOMENS WORLD,btohqsg
Hi all For the Maybank singsaver promo of 650 spend for 2 months.. means 2 billing statement of minimum 650 or 650 spending in dec and jan since my card approved mid dec.Tks,btohqsg
UOB PPV ($1110 mobile contactless)AMAZE + CITI REWARDS ($1000)if still not enough  then apply UOB visa signature  HSBC revo (with fave),btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think DBS Women‚Äôs world work with favepay,btohqsg
I think Gain City offers Shopback and Atome. You can also use DBS WWMC through these platforms.,btohqsg
Hi may i ask which trading platform has the best referral bonus for trading US shares atm?,btohqsg
Not applicable if your annual income is above 120k.,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to seek your expertise. Not sure if there is a maximum transaction cap at single transaction level (example: paywave only support up to $200 without signature)For uob visa signature and uob preferred platinum visa.If i mobile applepay $1k per transaction  will i still be eligible for 4mpd?Thank you all,btohqsg
"Can I check.. for the Fairprice (NTUC) app payment... it is consider ""online""? Or consider ""contactless""? So can use EVOL? or DBS Safra card?",btohqsg
Yes you can. In my recent memory  I did paywave close to 2k before no issue.,btohqsg
Hi guruJust wonderingCan I pair shopback to amaze(citi) or uob lady‚Äôs card and will it still earn point?,btohqsg
Only earn base points  i.e. 0.4mpd so please don't.,btohqsg
Brain fart moment reading it as cardup,btohqsg
Should get 4mpd. No need amaze for Citi rewards if using with shopback I think.,btohqsg
Can just link directly to Citi rewards no need amaze,btohqsg
Hi all  DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard can earn 2% cashback on mrt/bus ?,btohqsg
The transactions you paid was for Schools and Educational Services; and Utilities RELATED that were not eligible for UNI$ rewards.The transaction category is based on service/goods that you purchased  not based on the payment intermediary. And we found that purchase were not eligible for rewards.Above massge is reply from uob bank . Im not earning UNI$ for my cardup education service payment ( using uob prvi miles master card ) . Got any idea ?,btohqsg
I think uob card cant use for cardup services,btohqsg
Did you use some special promo code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Oh yeah you are right ? cos i use master card promotion code . Thats why i think,btohqsg
Ya I think there were some discussion previously that no rewards given for using these codes cos the MCC will fall under education (excluded by UOB),btohqsg
You means uob card can't use for master card promotion code,btohqsg
Not that uob card cant use for the promo code but that using those promo code u get mcc that from cardup that is not eligble for rewards,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Yeah thats why i only pay 1.53 % cardup fees using master card promotion code .,btohqsg
With no reward then become net loss loh,btohqsg
Using Special promo code  rewards are not guaranteed. Their mcc areMCC 6513 and MCC 8299,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Oh you means bettet dont use promotion code and pay normal fees 2.6% cardup fees .,btohqsg
Visit Cardup website for more info.,btohqsg
"So end up no rewards. Should have read CardUp's t&c before doing anything. They literally stated that ""card rewards not guaranteed"" and there are already DPs that stated MCC will be 6523 and 8299 for Rent and Education for these promo codes.",btohqsg
Hi. Is there any current promotion for existing citi customer applying for citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Yeah i saw . Just test . This is my risk . Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Or use an eligible Visa card  1.85% fee promo code.,btohqsg
Yeah i saw . Just test . This is my risk .Thanks üôè,btohqsg
In the future   better dont use promotion code . Pay 2.6% fees üòÅ,btohqsg
I read already . But what i understand the T&C are 50% 50% . Anyway thanks bro,btohqsg
Use Visa recurring 1.85% or master card 2.25% unless you have ocbc card.,btohqsg
"anyone knows if i can just spend 4k in the first month to be qualified for  UOB PRVI Miles Card signup promo regarding ""26 000 miles: Spend min. S$2 000 spend per month for 2 consecutive months from card approval date"". my maybank card  that requires 2 consecutive month  managed to get the promo when i spend double during the first month",btohqsg
You should re-read both t&cs.Spend $x per month for 2 consecutive months from card approval date VS spend $x within 2 months from card approval date are 2 different things.,btohqsg
They even underline the 2 consecutive months,btohqsg
my maybank was first 2 consecutive months as well,btohqsg
So you spent $1.2k on first month only or you spent at least $600 on both months each?,btohqsg
i spend 1.2k on the first month and got it few days after the purchase,btohqsg
U want to challenge bank tnc go ahead loh  bank have the right to not give u the promo gift,btohqsg
maybe it was just a maybank thing lol,btohqsg
If they decide to claw back rewards  they still can. Best to not take chances with the t&cs.,btohqsg
lolMaybe they will ‚Äòplug the gap‚Äô soon,btohqsg
Honestly if they only plug the gap is better than claw back from OP and plugging the gap ü§≠,btohqsg

actually this promo was many months ago when i first applied. now i see their promo is spend x amount within 2 months already,btohqsg
Yup.. that's why when I searched the latest card promos  it says first 2 months instead.,btohqsg
hi  want to check on the electricity retailer. which one is the cheapest as for now,btohqsg
Hi  my CPF MA has reached max $71.5k  would like to check when can I top up the additional $4k for 2025? Can I top up now?,btohqsg
BHS is $75.5k. You have not reached max.,btohqsg
Just to update doesn‚Äôt mean u earn above $120k means u definitely won‚Äôt be affected by the MAS 12 months unsecured interest bearing balances rule.I have a human with total balance transfers exceeding 12 months income with non HSBC banks.HSBC reduced the credit card limits of this human. I think HSBC tightened their policies recently.,btohqsg
U have to do it NOW,btohqsg
So that human earn 120k but have rolling balance on their cc until even other bank reduce their limit. Must have owe alot sia üßê,btohqsg
MAS is regulatory nallunsecured accounts will be suspended. Ie they cannot even use their cards.For those above s$120 earners action by FIs are discretionary and up to individual bank to take preventive measure to reduce their risk.,btohqsg
Yeah but confirmed something changed at HSBC recently.All along we have been like that. Suddenly kenna slapped.,btohqsg
About 14 months of last updated income total bts for that human,btohqsg
Maybe their numbers are looking that good. Hence the preemptive measure.,btohqsg
Top up before your employer‚Äôs monthly medisave contributions go to your cpf account. Dates depending on your employer,btohqsg
A thought if I have achieved FRS and I go topped up BHS to the new limit. Future contributions into MA will overflow into SA but since SA has FRS amount  it will overflow into OA. Is that correct? So it make sense to top my MA with cash to gain tax relief benefit and not using OA to transfer to MA?,btohqsg
Yes  no point to transfer to MA lol,btohqsg
Do not use CardUp RECURRING185 now as the promo rate will only apply for Jan payments and not the stream of payments after.Please check the fees paid display and you‚Äôll see.I have shifted my payments temporarily to iPayMy for now and it seems they do not restrict the promo till end of Jan for now.Additional note. iPayMy using UOB PriviMiles is RISKY. It may or may not work so consider using non-UOB cc to do the iPayMy instead as UOB has excluded iPayMy in TnC.If you have Citibank cc and can do at least $5k in payments  can consider to use Citi PayAll.,btohqsg
Just reapply when the new promo code gets released (if any),btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Can transfer from OA to MA?,btohqsg
If your just an avg consumer  don't go for the cheapest... Go for the one with the highest rebate with the shortest term. Eg. $150 rebate for 2yr plan is better than $200 for 3yr plan.,btohqsg
Major culprit should be balance transfer instead of credit card spendings.,btohqsg
All debts are good if it can help you increase your networth at a rate higher than the costs incurred. üòâ,btohqsg
Also depends whether he want to lock in longer time at current rate or now.,btohqsg
What is the promo code for Ipaymy to get lowest rate for Visa card n master card ?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg

The ipaymy website does not show the promo code. Is it no promo code required to enjoy 1.85% using Visa card ?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can advise me whether to top up my spouse SA to FRS even though she is 45,btohqsg
What are you trying to achieve?,btohqsg
To earn the 4% as early as possible  not tax rebates,btohqsg
By the way is it possible to transfer from my OA to her SA? If cannot  am ok to up up cash to earn the 4% early,btohqsg
Can. Minimally you must have BRS to transfer.,btohqsg
Oh ok  so it make sense to do that early?,btohqsg
I no need money in OA now so ok to do that,btohqsg
Depends on your goals and needs in the short and long term. You have to calculate and make your own decision.,btohqsg
Just that she has 70k more toFRS and she is 45,btohqsg
My aim is to top up early to earn 4% rather than for me to earn the 2.5% in OA,btohqsg
not doing SA topup to save on income tax?,btohqsg
End state  both to have ERS by 55,btohqsg
Cannot cos she is earning more than 8k annually,btohqsg
Highly unlikely. With the annual CPF contribution limits  and with FRS of 4% p.a. interest  it's very unlikely to meet 4 x of BRS.,btohqsg
That's why need to intervene to top up for her now to earn the 4% interest early so that the chance for her to reach ERS by the time she reaches 55 is higher,btohqsg
SCB internet banking seems to have some issuesapp cannot access at allwebsite is very very slow,btohqsg
You are right... But my point is that (for my own case) if the power consumption is pretty low like below 400kWH every mth  the difference between different suppliers (say 0.1c difference) only results in 40c savings per mth. That's like $9.6 over 2yr period... Rebate amount upfront already win. So go for the one with highest rebate.As for locking down prices  it's hard to predict if prices will go up or down... If the rebate given for 1yr plan would be higher as compared with 2yr plan on annual basis  I would surely go for 1yr plan so every year can get more rebate  which will be much higher than the cost savings I could get from any price difference.,btohqsg
Is topping up by cash to CPF  MA instant via FAST. Ie within minutes. Any advice,btohqsg
Current ERS as of now or ERS of 10 years time? Which is not published yet but can extrapolate.Reaching FRS is one thing. Reaching ERS is a big ambition.Because once you reach the FRS  you can‚Äôt top up and need to rely solely on contributions so am wondering how you plan to reach ERS in SA at 55,btohqsg
Almost instant  takes a while for CPF to reflect the top up,btohqsg
Hi! Silly question but does points/miles reward cap increase with a supplementary card?,btohqsg
Cos she is still working and working can continue to contribute to SA and OA  ERS in 10 years will be higher  but good to aim there. From my projection  it is achievable but  definitely may need to top up either via cash or from my OA,btohqsg
Yes but you can only top up to FRS. So anything beyond that will be pure contribution. That limits the inflow into SA due to the max contribution per year.,btohqsg
If a 45 year old reaches FRS in SA today  based on 4% interest  the compound effect on CPF will attract 100k interest.This will be 315k in SA  taking into account yearly contribution of 15 to 20k  can reach ERS by 55,btohqsg
Even if the CPF is split between SA and OA  by the time she reaches 55  all will be diverted to RA and can still reach ERS then,btohqsg
The limit is due to CPF system and I cannot control but at least  I can aim for her to reach ERS by 55 with intervention to her SA now,btohqsg
Hi gurus  anyone who applied for maybank credit card knows how many days it usually takes for approval?,btohqsg
Let me know if this makes sense :),btohqsg
Probably prepare 2 weeks for card to reach you via snail mail,btohqsg
Thanks! Guess can't make it in time for cardup payment then üòÇ,btohqsg
You will definitely get close to the ERS.BRS in 2027 is $114 000. If extrapolate for another 7 years  it will be about $140 000 (plus/minus). So ERS will be $560 000.But it sure beats doing nothing about it.,btohqsg

Same for me. No statement in the app.,btohqsg

Hi All  Just curious to know. It  seems IBKR has the lowest fee for US trade. I plan to do around 5 to 10 US stocks trade monthly and trying to see if I can use IBKR. But each time currency conversion fee is $2. How to avoid this? Will it be a good idea to convert more SGD and deposit as USD and use it then and there? Right now I‚Äôm planing to use GXS to earn interest on the SGD. pls help. Thx,btohqsg
Picking up on this old discussion for bit more guidanceFor cardup payments around education mccCan still use UOB priv without any code ? Still worth it ? .Or entirely ignore uob cards and should try to switch others ? Any suggestions ? With cardup where can still earn miles or any better alternative  for cardup itself,btohqsg
If you already know your quantum of trade (how much USD you will use)  just convert it once from SGD to USD and then use it. Convert SGD to USD on IBKR as they have the best rates and you will lose money on other services,btohqsg

If you use the recurring code  you will still get a discount on Jan payments.What you can do is set it for Jan/Feb/Mar first then amend the code when and if CardUp updates for Feb/Mar payments. What I did personally was just use iPayMy since recurring discounts work there and I don‚Äôt want the hassle. You do pay an extra $1 in fees per payment using iPayMy due to a fixed $1 extra charge per payment.UOB has explicitly excluded iPayMy but there are dp that it still works for now. If you want to use UOB cc on iPayMy  it is with the knowledge that UOB can stand by their TnC and not award points or cash back.,btohqsg
