Yes that’s why I’m thinking how is it considered as offset the annual fees?,btohqsg
It ok leave it this way,btohqsg
Can UOB PPV or UOB Signature ViSa be used for petrol spending?,btohqsg
Somebody mentioned this in chat history before. Can do a search.,btohqsg
looks more like a loss of $383 and oppprtunity cost of using other cards with higher earn rate,btohqsg
citi payall fees is high and the promo is bad,btohqsg
can use say uob prvi/dbs vantage for cardup/ipaymy instead?,btohqsg
dun see how to justify the annual fee,btohqsg
Can i use instarem amaze card in Jb ???,btohqsg
Can use anywhere in this world.,btohqsg
you have to work out the rates... the previous payall promo was about 1.2 cents per mile if you include the $80 grab voucher.,btohqsg
citi prestige is already one of the easiest cards to justify its $545 annual fee already because of the 25k renewal miles which at 1.5 cents per mile valuation is already worth $375.You just have to figure out how to extract another $170 of value from all its other features.Suggestions:1. relationship bonus miles2. unlimited priority pass3. 4NF4. limo after spending5. payall promo,btohqsg
For 4NF  can this be 3 star hotel? And payall count for limo spending? Assume that you have this card,btohqsg
1. yes 4NF can be any hotel as long as it meets 4NF tnc.2. OF COURSE  payall with fee counts towards the $12k required limo spending.glad to see you are asking all the right questions!,btohqsg
I will just drop one more tip:I DO NOT use Citi Prestige for any normal spending at all.I ONLY use Citi Prestige for:1. Citi FX Spend Promos2. Citi Payall (during promos)3. 4NF hotel bookings4. OTA Citi promo codes,btohqsg
My relationship bonus is like very little  how I get to much lol,btohqsg
> 10 years + citi payall,btohqsg
Hmm but the percentage is same for me 15%,btohqsg
then the relationship bonus would be determined by your payall amount,btohqsg

Hi..may i know what is the best card to buy dairy farm vouchers? i dont have yuu card,btohqsg
Yuu card limits at $600 so it is also not the best if you need more. Charge it into UOB One if you can use it to maintain quarterly spending.Otherwise use existing cards which reward grocery purchases. Citi Cash Back  MayBank Family and Friends ($312).UOB Ladies card with Family selected also works for $1k.,btohqsg
