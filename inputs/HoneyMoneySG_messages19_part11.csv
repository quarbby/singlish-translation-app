cannot use amex top up revolut,btohqsg
How about using grabpay in msia üëç?,btohqsg
I am not sure about this.. wouldnt it trigger a forex transaction for this? It may end up counter intuitive..,btohqsg
For simplicity.. maybe just have a citi cash back + plus amaze.. citi cash back + no min spending..,btohqsg
Is it worth it when you convert grab rewards points to krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
GrabPay card's forex fee is 0.8% iirc. Lower than most banks  but nothing compared multi-currency cards,btohqsg
Hey all  I need to hit $500 spend by tmr for SC SMRT card to get $300 cashback  but my funds that I made with the card 2 days ago (bough e-capita vouchers) is still listed as 'unposted' in the app  will it be counted as $500 spend even if its still 'unposted' after tmr?*SC hotline is terrible  am trying to contact them since the morning and unable to,btohqsg
It is same mcc as ezlink,btohqsg
Have call bank to ask already,btohqsg
Trying to call since morning :(((,btohqsg
I didnt know same as ezlink...thanks for this!! Fairprice vouchers via shopback should be no issue right?,btohqsg
But now ecapitavoucher got promotion with dbs card,btohqsg
Bought the fairprice vouchers  but funds still 'unposted' in app  anyone knows where to find the SC live chat? Their hotline is literally useless,btohqsg
It will take a few working day for pending to become posted,btohqsg
guys i have a question if i want pay my insurance with axs be it physical machine or axs online with my uob1 debit card can it still qualify under the uob1 acc spending?,btohqsg
Curious. I just got my Amaze cashback and it says it went to the Amaze Wallet. Where can i find that to spend it or does it go back to whatever card is actively assigned to the Amaze card?,btohqsg
Just watched the video  need some clarification. Previously@ChrisHMSGmention Citi reward doesn't include travel category as eligible spending. Let's say I go JB and swap Amaze + Citi reward on retail shopping or massage  do I still get 4mpd?,btohqsg
"Go to where u select card to use  select ""Amaze Wallet""  use Amaze card to use the cashback",btohqsg
For this  we will not get any bank exchange rate charges right as it will be based on amaze exchange rate only uh,btohqsg
It will follow Amaze FX rate,btohqsg
yes 4mpd so long mcc not excluded. Travel category refers to flight/hotel/car rental etc. which are excluded in the TnC for citi rewards,btohqsg
Awesome  then I don't need to swap my card when I go JB.,btohqsg
If I use my amaze card to insert instead  it will also count right? For 4mpd,btohqsg
As I‚Äôm going to korea where they don‚Äôt accept wireless payment.,btohqsg
So citi+amaze combo can also be used to pay hospital bills and insurance premiums?,btohqsg
So we need to top up minimum $20 in the amaze wallet first to use the amaze card and get the cashback,btohqsg
Are we able to transfer out the money from amaze wallet?,btohqsg
if i used UOB one card to pay singtel bill via mysingtel app  a) does it count under the min $500 spend criteria for interest bonus?  b) is it eligible for cashback also?,btohqsg

Base on other YT channel  they can use Youtrip in korea. So I guess Amaze works as well,btohqsg
These are the standard no reward no matter what.,btohqsg
Anyone know what card I can use to top up Tribecar?,btohqsg
Good news? Seem like lesser rewards?,btohqsg
So instead of amaze+ Citi  is it better to go for YouTrip + Citi instead? Or better for amaze + Citi as it will convert everything into eligible spending for 4mpd except travel related.,btohqsg
So u getting this Maybank Visa?,btohqsg
You can't topup youtrip with Citi. It's bank transfer or paynow i think. Has not been using youtrip for a long while.,btohqsg
My main oversea spending is JB  so I'll just citi + Amaze and wise card. Wise card is more of a safety net incase I run out of cash in JB and need it immediately.,btohqsg
Like in the video  alot people used youtrip to convert SGD to Yen first.,btohqsg
nice. I was not sure now this can help contribute to  plan for monthly clocking on UOB one card + account,btohqsg
If i am not wrong  insurance premium is counted for interest bonus but not eligible for cashback.,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt use wise yet so not sure about it. All along using YouTrip pair with grab and UOB absolute,btohqsg
yup  now the grab side nerfed youtrip topup...,btohqsg
Ya lo that‚Äôs why switching to amaze haha,btohqsg
Can pair Amaze with grab card?,btohqsg
Why this time amex tcb offer [Nov] so late still have not cash rebate the offers like utilities offer  telco offers and online shopping offers? Anyone has same issue? Normally just a few days.,btohqsg
Depends which hospital I guess? And if u pay it via healthhub app or sth?,btohqsg
Tried it when i first got my Amaze card. Doesn't work,btohqsg
How do u guys top up youtrip?,btohqsg
Can i check if DBSWMMC on apply pay  does it earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Helloooooo!Is anyone using SIF Gosavers Acc? How is the experience like?,btohqsg
