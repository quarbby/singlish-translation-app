Actually to me more prefer to drive big cars. Probably due to this fear of collision,btohqsg
And the reality is many cars are getting larger in size too,btohqsg
No matter how unsafe  still safer than motorbike,btohqsg
Some people are just biased haha... biased towards unreliable conti cars like AR,btohqsg
it is not that. there are situations beyond your control. best is adequate protection. that is why mopads are not allowed on highways,btohqsg
correct! makes you practise defensive driving which is a very good habit,btohqsg
well that's just the risk you could be willing to take 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Defensive driving means always be prepared to stop,btohqsg
Until some like to play jam braking,btohqsg
there's a certain element of risk involved with every car you drive no matter what  just need to be in the right frame of mind and have the relevant skills to manage and get out as safely as possible,btohqsg
point A  to Point B loh  looking at Hr-v (or Vezel) or Shuttle for bigger space,btohqsg

The Mercedes 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé Is Now The Most Expensive Car Ever Sold,btohqsg
Ok. Have fun sourcing. Many choices to pick from these models,btohqsg
Rich man’s game. This league is different. The mentality is ownerships or leaving behind a legacy.,btohqsg
And Thier speed limit is higher then us,btohqsg
I think is 100   I think is only sg express way limit is at 90 haha and the lowest of all,btohqsg
I know many sg friends like to chiong msia nsh.,btohqsg
Cause 110Ma and ppl will give way Singapore is 90 but ppl drive 80 and don’t give way,btohqsg
Give what way? Jam brake lah.,btohqsg
between 3 years old car (i.e. 2019 - lowest COEmostly) and 7 years old (i.e. 2015 another year of high COE)  which onemakes better sense?,btohqsg
From business sense  take whichever is the lowest quantum cost.,btohqsg
I enjoy driving in Malaysia too. Feels safer,btohqsg
Buy the7 yrs old one3 yr later scrap. Take parf value and scrap valueprobably COE drop.You can buy EV or many other face lift cars,btohqsg

Most probably your dashcam is draining your car battery . If u drive everyday this will not be an issue,btohqsg
