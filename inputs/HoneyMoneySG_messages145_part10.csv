"#DPWell used Citibank credit card (over $10k per year) Annual FeeDialed into Phone system. Key in details. Press 2 ""if you are calling with regards to Annual Fee Waiver""No other option  directed to Phone Officer who proceeded to very kindly waive the annual fee after doing ANOTHER security verification.Then after waiving the annual fee  Phone Officer politely went on to offer well  err.. ridiculous 2.5% Fee or 3.99% p.a. reducing balance 6 months Balance Transfer. No hard sell  just offering.I declined and thanked her politely for the annual fee waiver. End of call.(I still don't know Citi algorithm. Sometimes can hit the automated phone system and waiver done without human intervention. Sometimes forcefully directed to Human Officer. BUT  still no issue for annual fee waiver regardless).",btohqsg
Of course they want to find ways to marketing maybe if when their offer is good than can take up also mah.,btohqsg
citibank and UOB haven't wake up their balance transfer rates yet.. disgusting.maybank and cimb and hsbc still decent circa 2% EIR,btohqsg
"I always got hit with human officer to waive the fee  ofc with BT ""offer"".",btohqsg
Today called to waive dcs vicom card AF  after my waiver request via app got denied. Cso said can only waive if I sign up for their Mastercard. I said ok loâ€¦as long this is the criteria to waive,btohqsg
Thanks for reaffirming my decision not to sign up DCS Flex..anyway HSBC Live+ extended.. no need DCS Flex liao,btohqsg
DCS flex has no cat restriction  just pure $400+ online & $400+ paywave. Itâ€™s perfect for me ðŸ˜„DCS vicom card is purely for vicom discount every 2yrs lol,btohqsg
Yup  8% with cat restriction and quarterly cb,btohqsg

Citigold promotion - any one familiar how long I must commit the funds to successfully get the iPhone,btohqsg
Tnc never say? Usually is 6 months lock in for gifts.,btohqsg
Read SingSaver T&C  no explicit mentioning  plus I used ChatGPT to analyze,btohqsg
So contact SingSaver to clarify since there is no dp,btohqsg
If I have participate in HSBC ega in Oct. For dec I can't participate?,btohqsg
From my belief it is:1. Keep aum until gift fulfilment date for singsaver gift2. But Citigold will have penalty if you donâ€™t maintain aum while being Citigold customer3. Citigold will impose penalty if u close Citigold within 6 months,btohqsg
If you referring to Bonus Interest promo  cannot,btohqsg
Makes sense  many thanks. Am trying to weigh opportunity cost while placing funds with them,btohqsg
Iâ€™m curious why u wanna do singsaver promo for Citigold. It ainâ€™t that great from what I read. Since u cannot double dip.You either get1. Singsaver giftOr2. Citibank giftNot both,btohqsg
Sometimes it's still best to read the T&Cs carefully and not rely too much on AI.,btohqsg
This is also only half the story.Citibank side will have own lock in period,btohqsg
I do not see any restriction on receiving Citibank offering. What the T&C seems to indicate that one will be getting gifts from both sides,btohqsg
Where u saw can get both side,btohqsg
Read this with clause 8 (above screenshot)  so to play safe  better deposit 250k before end Feb for Dec account opening  and maintain it till singsaver rewards are fufilled.,btohqsg
Still cannot  tried Microsoft edge  Firefox  Chrome ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Yeah I had my suspicion too  SingSaver verification and awarding of gift dates,btohqsg
But I'm not going for Citibank NTB promo... Why should I be subjected to their T&Cs so long as my account is in good standing order?,btohqsg
Both on desktop and mobile? Like literally different devices,btohqsg
All priority banks will have early closure and minimum aum requirements.,btohqsg
Yes  this I understand. But that is a seperate matter and won't affect rewards given out by singsaver.,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t say Citibank side will affect singsaver rewards.I said Citibank will still have their own lock in period.,btohqsg
Hey. Question for savings accounts.Say I already have some basic savings accounts. To get more interest  I were to open those high interest rate ones.Does that mean I need to meet minimum amount in EACH account otherwise I got charged for service fee? In a way  some money got stuck there?,btohqsg
Some of the accounts don't charge fall below fee in the first 6 months  and also don't charge closure fee after first 6 months.But better to decide on what accounts to keep  especially if keeping minimum amounts on certain accounts can affect greatly (i.e.  move you down a tier).Not good to close savings account too often also  the bank might decide to terminate any relationship.,btohqsg
Not too sure how different banks treat that... But for DBS  as I'm under treasures  fall below fees for other accounts are waived.Best is to check with the bank directly.,btohqsg
