i had math tutor b4 and all he did during tuiton was tell stories. idc whether he wrote assessment books. he can't teach. it was grp tution somemore. i quit within a few months,btohqsg
my prev tutor was sm btr,btohqsg
this was in pri sch btw,btohqsg
ask him work in rice field instead of u,btohqsg
my pri sch el tuition teacher sold mlm products during lesson,btohqsg
i cant rmb if he charged so much because he was a uni graduate or was he also studying for a phd,btohqsg
so she would give us worksheets and then go to the other room to peddle products or convince people to join the mlm,btohqsg
but ngl i preferred her lessons to like those structured tuition centre ones,btohqsg
cause she would give me stuff that i actl found interesting and intellectutally stimulating,btohqsg
ye my current math tutor does do that which is gud,btohqsg
not charging goddam 200 per hr tho lol,btohqsg
ok so she rented a unit at katong shopping centre,btohqsg
and the unit has 2 rooms,btohqsg
1 room would be all the kids doing worksheets,btohqsg
then she would go to the other room to discuss mlm stuff with other adults,btohqsg
like there was this dude from the chess store downstairs that always came to discuss the mlm with her,btohqsg
and she once even peddled to us,btohqsg
kiss my ass uni grad wab charge 150 per lesson,btohqsg
she said that this probiotic thing was good for digestion and we should ask our parents to buy,btohqsg
her daughter went to nygh and her son went to vs ip,btohqsg
she got teach a bit but not much tbh,btohqsg
in p6 she suddenly bailed on us,btohqsg
saying her son had his own psle,btohqsg
then my mom and my friends mom got angry,btohqsg
and she accused us of being ungrateful,btohqsg
"because she introduced our moms to the mlm and the products but they were ""backstabbing"" her",btohqsg
she also had beef with another tuition centre owner,btohqsg
i think the mall management got involved,btohqsg
now she's not teaching tuition anymore i think,btohqsg
i need some real help  im feeling unproductive not because i dont want study  it is because i dun even know how to study,btohqsg
last time i spoke to her she was paranoid that her maid was trying to steal her items,btohqsg
just making my stress disorder worst,btohqsg
my comp and ipad in front of me but i just dunno how to study,btohqsg
her parents quite well to do also,btohqsg
Nope im in a ridiculous uni course 4th y lol,btohqsg
legit Australian or parents frm sg then move there?,btohqsg
the tuition teacher in her 40s rn. she's australian but come to sg because her husband is singaporean. then her children born here also,btohqsg
ask her go bck to her country,btohqsg
honestly for me is i force myself,btohqsg
if not just take a break today,btohqsg
i need to somehow get the drugs + doses  drug-drug interactions  all conditions in the syllabus  contraindications  all in my head,btohqsg
i will just have to force something to work at this stage coz it is nearing recess week already,btohqsg
so itâ€™s a memorisation thing or what,btohqsg
apparently the new curriculum is much harder than the older one,btohqsg
my tests are 8th mar  27th mar  5th april  1st wk of may ,btohqsg
by time i mean u can take a few day break,btohqsg
and start to think of how u wan to approach these topics,btohqsg
either through hard code or understanding it,btohqsg
how i used to memorise is through repetitive wring,btohqsg
ya bro i think my sergeant,btohqsg
