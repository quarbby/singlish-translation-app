I will be spending 5 digit @ Mount Alvernia next mount. What is the best card cashback to use to pay for this?I have Citi Cashback+,btohqsg
u can PM me i still have 4 invites,btohqsg
I used heymax to search ShopBack. It says ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù. Sounds like it won‚Äôt be Dining category even if I used ShopBack in a restaurant?,btohqsg
shopback uses a range of MCCs  and usually follows the MCC of the merchant if using shopback pay (but not always)the only guaranteed way to find out what MCC your particular shopback txn is  is using dbs block card method,btohqsg

Hi guys any recommendation for a good cash back card?Scenario: I‚Äôm getting a new phone and would like to also get some cash back on then purchase,btohqsg
Currently I am looking at the SC Smart credit card and the OCBC frank card,btohqsg
ocbc frank is not good because of the rebate cap. SC smart only award bonus points for specific merchants  none selling phone.,btohqsg
Then ocbc frankThe contactless paymentIs it just link the credit card to samsung payThen use samsung pay to payThen is consider contactless payment?,btohqsg
yes if tap the phone at contactless machine. but low rebate cap and high min sum in a month makes it a lousy card,btohqsg
But it mention 8% cash back?,btohqsg
Coz due to the cap problem? 25?,btohqsg
There is no way to get 8% on the card given the $25 rebate cap for local online/mobile contactless  ($25 for spend in foreign currency) and min $800 monthly spend.,btohqsg
Oo coz I also seldom use credit card oneüòÇMy goal is get first user reward onlyüòÇNormally I go those stall under hdbNo chance to keep use credit card d,btohqsg
Hi.anyone know if ShopBack cash back any cap?,btohqsg
I m interested to know too,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I‚Äôm using CardUp linked to Citi rewards CC to pay for car loan let‚Äôs say 1ksgd. Do I get the 4 mpd for the first 1k or just 1mpd ?,btohqsg
if you're referring to the cashback displayed in-app for online voucher purchases  or the cashback % displayed on shopback QR standees  nopethere is a daily cashback withdrawal limit though,btohqsg
1. Uob Amex Absolute: 1.7%2. Amex true cashback: 1.5% (cashback within month  no need wait till next month)3. Amaze +CRMC: 4mpd4. 1.5mpd/1.4mpd/1.3mpd/1.2mpd card (need be from citibank  standard chartered to be rewarded from spending in hospital),btohqsg
Using phone contactless payment at 7-11 store on uob evol card is eligible for the 8%? I tried search onheymax.aiit written only 1%. Do anyone know which am I eligible?,btohqsg
How much did you lose since you cancel?,btohqsg
Or maybe try AMEX platinum card,btohqsg
Hey guys  is OCBC GSP12 safe and worth it?,btohqsg
Dont ever cancel. Can do an absolute assignment and sell it to relatives/friends if there's cash value upon maturity,btohqsg
I just went to look through Citi Cashback+ T&C. Seems like hospital MCC they will award 1.6% cashback too,btohqsg
It is 3.5% pa for 2 years lock-in.I think it‚Äôs decent if u don‚Äôt want to bother with investments or shifting money around.,btohqsg
2 years is a long time‚Ä¶ a lot of things can change by then. It‚Äôs really for the strong hands with lots of spare cash to make this worthwhile,btohqsg
Especially with today‚Äôs shortened business cycles,btohqsg
cimb fastsaver non lock in already 3.5%,btohqsg
Yeah be very very sure you won't touch the money for 2 years.. you try to get out of the 2 year plan  sure lose money one.,btohqsg
Hmmm but t bills is 3.75% for 6 mths  and if rates do drop  prob stocks will hv much higher returns by then,btohqsg
hence my reasoning in the latter part of my sentence.,btohqsg
nope its like hsbc ega base on one specific month prior  if ur new its starts from 0,btohqsg
Heymax did tell you why only 1% if you click n see the details.,btohqsg
Rhb 1 year fixed deposit 3.6 to 3.68%U can consider if dont keen in moomoo or chocolate.,btohqsg
üëç Online or via RHB banking apps. I happened to enquire.,btohqsg
ex  u want the exchange rate from sgd to usd to be as low as possible  $1SGD = $1 USD best.,btohqsg
Morning all  is there currently no way to pay with amaze on the iPhone? Couldn't add it to apple pay and there's no NFC for Gpay?,btohqsg
This reminds me of quite a few people being fearful of the RMB and China/BRICS taking over the USD as the default trading currency of the world. You can search my views in this chat history on why this will take a long time due to many factors discussed. Congratulations to those who have kept their faith with the USD and earned super interest thru fixed income  FDs etc since last year. The easy trade had been made though  trade with care,btohqsg
So u put one time 10k   u receive 3.5% for every month for this 10k?,btohqsg
only way is to switch to android phone,btohqsg
nope  need to use physical card or android phone,btohqsg
You put it $10k  you get monthly interest about= $10k x 3.5% x (31 days/365days)=  $29.72,btohqsg
Well noted  what I wanted is to be covered until 65 only.  üòÇüòÇ  so 1m for death and TPD  and 300k for critical illness. HSBC premium only $980...,btohqsg
ok this one no right no wrong.. i think this way.when you buy term life.. do you want:1. to confirm be able to claim (leave a legacy behind) = buy the more expensive term life till 1002. almost impossible to claim unless unexpected event = buy the cheaper term life till 65/75.Note if your cover ends at 65... it also means when u need it the most  you are not covered.... think carefully.,btohqsg
