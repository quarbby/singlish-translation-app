If not my tourism lorms 0 alr,btohqsg
Tbh i hv no idea what q4 is but i wrote abt ngos  host communities and tour operators,btohqsg
Seab pls have mercy on me,btohqsg
This time i got lazy so i only studied tourism üíÄ,btohqsg
I was telling a lot of people that food lorms wouldn‚Äôt come out but in the end they kiasu still memorise,btohqsg
Good thing I didn‚Äôt waste my time on food,btohqsg
Yeah exactly no food lorms at all,btohqsg
Just rmb vaguely can smoke and do well,btohqsg
Well like I said from2014-2016they tested gateway 3  3 years in a row,btohqsg
Tho the food databased qns were wack,btohqsg
They tested gateway 3 for 2018 and 2019 so this is not the 3rd year yet,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt risk,btohqsg
Oh i got that for prelims and its easier,btohqsg
I was thinking benefits and risk,btohqsg
Me not studying weather or what i wrote,btohqsg
I go for the 50/50 ü§©,btohqsg
I almost got a heart attack when I saw the clt for geog cos it said don‚Äôt do the question which starts ‚Äúthe benefits...‚Äù then I thought that question was a PT lorms question and I thought it‚Äôll be canceled and we had to do food lorms,btohqsg
Tbh food gateway 1 lorms wld be easier,btohqsg
They wldve asked abt excess and inadequate consumption,btohqsg
I would rather not that cos I‚Äôve alr memorise so much plate tectonics,btohqsg
Understand some and smoke then can,btohqsg
Libya civil war is the only one i know,btohqsg
Well in the end food gateway 1 didn‚Äôt even need to study,btohqsg
Lmao i cant memorise examples how am i gonna do gp if i go jc,btohqsg
So good thing I barely studied it,btohqsg
Well I guess it would‚Äôve paid off,btohqsg
I knew that the question had to be mostly plate tec and plate tectonics lorms thanks to clt,btohqsg
Anyone pls share me chemistry answer key today‚Äôs h2 exams thanks,btohqsg
Sun moon lake in taiwan  2am  2000 deaths,btohqsg
Anyway I guess once I go JC I can say goodbye to easy econs paper,btohqsg
Its example for why time of occurrence affects the extent of earthquake,btohqsg
Jc got no mcq and the mark scheme is much harder to get marks,btohqsg
Lol but u wld hv an advantage since ur olevel econs is good,btohqsg
The tb gave sun moon lake tho,btohqsg
I want to see if it‚Äôs possible to start studying H2 over the hols and then see if I can take a level early in J1,btohqsg
But might be a bad idea,btohqsg
Well anyway some A level concepts my teacher gone through in class,btohqsg
So I sort of know o level stuff and more,btohqsg
And I want to take full advantage of what I‚Äôve learnt,btohqsg
The teacher judges him for it,btohqsg
Listens to econs podcast every night and repeats it during recess,btohqsg
Dont u listen to econs podcast,btohqsg
I stopped a while ago alr,btohqsg
He says he might not get A1 lmao,btohqsg
If he gets A2  I get D7,btohqsg
But anyway o level econs doesn‚Äôt need ppl to study like me just bs and probably can get A2,btohqsg
Like the mark scheme is so lenient even people who get F9 for prelim they improve to at least B3,btohqsg
@chemcer  this is you @ geography lel.,btohqsg
Well I feel sorry u wasted the opportunity lol,btohqsg
If i get E8 its on my cert,btohqsg
