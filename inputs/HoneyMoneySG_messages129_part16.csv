I think u misunderstood. I'm not telling people what to do. If u refer back to my post  I said 'Given xxx  I would yyy'. I am sharing what I would do and laying out the reasoning.,btohqsg
If you have monthly premiums  then Maybank Platinum Visa  whether with CardUp or not.,btohqsg
Thanks what about HSBC revo/ Citi cashback with ega instead,btohqsg
Why HSBC Revo card/Citi Cashback card? I pay my Maybank Platinum Visa card through GIRO on HSBC EGA for additional 1% cashback as well.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution + EGA will get you 3.5% Cashback. No annual fees  no min spending. Cap 1k for insurance monthly/yearly premiums,btohqsg
I bought the 1 year T-Bill using my CPF OA fund earlier this year. Can i ask what do u mean by being notified? Wanna understand your expectations to better share my experience,btohqsg
I thought HSBC REVO is a miles saving card,btohqsg
Where's the 3.5% cashback from? Assuming 1% is from HSBC EGA  where's the other 2.5% from?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is a points saving card. Points can be converted either to miles or for shopping.,btohqsg
insurance excluded from earning any points/rebate,btohqsg

I recently bid for the 6-month tbill that had auction date on 29 Aug and issue date 3 Sep. Just wanted to find out if there is any way for me to see the status of my bidding  as I don‚Äôt see any change or update when I check my cpf-is account on ibanking and my cpf dashboard,btohqsg
Did u submit a Competitive or Non Competitive Bid?,btohqsg
If until now still haven‚Äôt deduct  something is wrong,btohqsg
I‚Äôm guessing I was unsuccessful then,btohqsg
Ohhh ok. Is your bid above or below cut off yield?,btohqsg
Hi  just like to ask if the McDonalds in-store n McDelivery are the same and would I get rebate if I used my uob one debit card.,btohqsg

For insurance premium be it life  car  health  travel  etc‚Ä¶ there are plenty of exclusions on credit card getting cash rebates  miles etc. Anyone has any suggestion which card does not have exclusion or what do you all do to clear this obstacle?,btohqsg

are we allowed to use cashback for mortgage,btohqsg
how do you justify paying the fee to cardup versus the miles received ? which has higher roi in monetary terms,btohqsg
Depends on your valuation of mile then calculate from there. Short answer is that if yours is below 1.25c per mile  its usually not worth.,btohqsg
Is there any formula to calculate your valuation of miles?,btohqsg
old article but gives you an idea of how to calculate,btohqsg
With mortgage on CardUp  I charge more than $60k into the Vantage card annually so the annual fee waiver is guaranteed.I get free hotel stay plus 10 priority pass visits for my family when we fly together.The fees if using promo code till end of December is 1.75% HOME175 and will see if they offer something else upon expiry.I pay via giro on EGA so I get 1% cash back.Essentially I‚Äôm paying $0.0075 service fee per dollar for ~1.5miles.,btohqsg
