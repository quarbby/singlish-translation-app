When u say that I feel like we didn't go through the same primary and secondary school system,btohqsg

87/90 for median for an exam LOL,btohqsg
I couldn't do pri sch maths as compared to sec sch math lmao,btohqsg
Never gotten an A for pri sch maths,btohqsg
sec sch math is easier bcoz we learn algebra to solve pri sch math things,btohqsg
Linear simultenrous eqns are just model methods without drawing it out,btohqsg
Primary school math is actually very easy,btohqsg
But students may not have the ability to think through it.See long question,btohqsg
is just too much nonsense inside that 1 qn,btohqsg
why beat around the bush when u can come straight to the pt?,btohqsg
To see if u can identify the important info in the question,btohqsg
If not every question is just computation,btohqsg

If it’s possible to run away from my part time job after getting my November pay,btohqsg

Technically you can after you got your pay but the company may blacklist you if you MIA.,btohqsg
Its inconsiderate and would cause alot of inconvenience,btohqsg
So if you need to leave. Inform them in advance.,btohqsg
Better not toBecause if you suddenly MIA  you can cause many people to do extra work at very last minutes. This can be damn tiring and annoying,btohqsg
And if you get blacklisted  probably might be super hard for you to get another job,btohqsg
If you have no show for work and it will just leave a record in your future work.  And that is one of the  worst thing that can happen other than  getting blacklisted..,btohqsg
don't u do it Qis...if u hate ur job  just inform them IN ADVANCE that u are resigning that job. Don't disappear out of a sudden else they think u sus,btohqsg
Speaking from my own point of view as a boss:Any of my employees no show for 3 times with no valid reason I will just straight fire them.,btohqsg
and like what@Neonpotassiumoxidesaid it's gonna affect ur future carrer and u're gonna have a tough time looking for a job in future,btohqsg
And one more thingBecause of COVID-19 pandemic  a lot of people lost their jobs  and those taxi drivers now very hard to earn money. These groups of people now very hard to feed themselves and their family members.You should appreciate that you have the job. Don't ever do foolish actions  or else you will regret it throughout your whole life,btohqsg
If u wan to focus on study just tell them NICELY and they will understand. Like how I allow my employees to take a year break to study :))) so yeah,btohqsg

and in the first place@simpfor029you should really have considered whether u really want this job?,btohqsg
YesBut if she get blacklisted  I think her studies may get affected as well (e.g. the school doesn't want her because of irresponsible action),btohqsg

if she wants to go jc  rn she should be studying her a** out  of it bc Sec 4 they're gonna go very fast,btohqsg

@simpfor029I hope you better think properly after you have read our answers to your questionIf you do foolish actions and hence unable to get any jobs at all  how are you gonna feed your parents  especially if you're their only child?,btohqsg
Just submit your 2 week notice for resignation or request for break,btohqsg
