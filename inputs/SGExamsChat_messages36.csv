Well unless u sign on pilot,btohqsg
U can ask them to sponsor ur studies,btohqsg
You all using spf as a safety net,btohqsg
I planned out all these routes,btohqsg
Sign on a very good vocation without uni degree is actually ok,btohqsg
Ok but A levels will have lower pay,btohqsg
So u will eventually want them to sponsor u to uni,btohqsg
