What type of card is Citi rewards?,btohqsg
Have you read the T&C for CRMC and HSBC Revo? Do you know which MCC qualify and which don't  for each card?,btohqsg
okay so 60months it is thank you so much!!,btohqsg
Applied late last night  next day 1PM approved,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs online  CRMC should be able to get you the 4MPD  but it‚Äôs not a whitelisted merchant for revo,btohqsg
ok  thanks for letting me know about the revo whitelist!!,btohqsg
received email. max is 3.3%  need to transfer $3k monthly. might as well do t bills or other banks,btohqsg
Uob also drop to 3.4 liao,btohqsg
No lah those privilege customer acct rate,btohqsg
I guess there there isn‚Äôt much benefit to take up privilege banking as the perks offered is not much.,btohqsg
For me  if it opens additional ways of generating passive income. For now  I will exploring investing in money market or income funds.,btohqsg
Honestly would advice against using SA to invest if you're planning to. Only 40% gets above OA (not SA) 2.5% but it's hard to beat risk free 4%.,btohqsg
The video is focused on the additional 1% interest on cumulative 60k.,btohqsg

I use Endowus  StashAway and Syfe. All have investment guide inside. Choose one that suit your risk profile and time horizon. Try out with smaller fund first if you are not confident.Some comes with investment educational tips which you can learn.Take others recommendation as a guide and don't follow blindly as others choice may not be suitable on you.,btohqsg
Hi. May I ask normally how long does shopee take to post the transaction after a buy transaction?,btohqsg
Oh sorry though u meant the money.yes  it should come up on your CDP account. (I just checked and not in mine yet).,btohqsg
How do you compare with FSM1 and Poems?,btohqsg
Oh.. one more thing. Does topping up shopee pay wallet does it count as a valid cc spend for uob one?,btohqsg
I noticed usually post 3 working days but it varies,btohqsg
Google search shows that shopee pay topups was excluded..üò≠,btohqsg
Hi  I need 8 buy trades on moomoo to get the free stock bundle. Anyone can recommend what to buy. Best is can buy and sell as I only have $1k balance in the account. Tksüôèüôè,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check if the average daily balance calculation and monthly average balance calculation are the same? You are taking the sum of the balance in the month/number of calendar days,btohqsg
Yes. Sum of end of day balances divide by number of days in month.,btohqsg
For uob one account  can i fulfill lvl 2 then fulfill lvl 1? Cos i put my salary in first then hit $500 and the app says i hit lvl 1 only,btohqsg
For SC credit card users  do you pay the outstanding balance or the due ? My outstanding balance is lower than the due and the difference is exactly my cashback amount.,btohqsg
Follow statement... high chance should be paying ur outstanding,btohqsg
The sequence is not important. But you definitely must fufill both within the same month to gain the bonus interest. If you only fufill lvl 2 requirement  then you will not get the bonus interest from lvl 2 as lvl 1 requirement is the pre-requisite.,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming. I shall monitor for afew more days as my app shows i hit lvl 1 when i have done both,btohqsg
UOB will take around 2 days to update and it may delay with weekends. Especially for the $500 credit card spending  get it done asap before that and not on the last day.,btohqsg
Haha invest with me I split 90/10 with u,btohqsg

Does the Lady‚Äôs Card amount towards a category count on the monthly $3 000 SGD cap based on thePost Dateor theTransaction Date?Reason I ask is that the post date is in March  versus the transaction date is in Feb  so I would need to know if I have hit my quota,btohqsg
Hi. I made an online txn (via a website) but selected apple pay wallet using uob evol. Is it still considered online or other spend?,btohqsg
as long as you don‚Äôt tap any terminal  it should be online assuming you don‚Äôt spend on any evol exclusions.for a peaceful experience  can live chat with UOB cso after it have been posted to verify online spend or others,btohqsg
If it is not in UOB Evol exclusion list  yes it is an online transaction because the transaction is done on an online platform and Apple Pay is a payment mode supported by the online platform,btohqsg
Tks. Yes. I know. There is a 30/90 days period I need to maintain the min amt to get the free stock . Just not sure what to buy.ü§î,btohqsg
Hi all. Scoot website checked in baggage is 20kg for $45 for flight bought thru scoot website. If i book my flight ticket viatrip.comthen i go to scoot website to purchase baggae allowance of 20kg  will it be $45? Costrip.comcharging 20kg for $56.80,btohqsg
What is the reason that u dont book from scoot directly,btohqsg
wow pre covid times i always buy 20kg for $23. now price doubled... crazy...,btohqsg
iirc it will be 45$  i remember that trip or whatver has markup,btohqsg
if you scared can buy those penny stock  the last time i brought something a few cents only,btohqsg
Ok. Tks. I will take look.,btohqsg
but those penny stock   will have low volume   so u can consider it as a loss. And if yours is by trade count  then buy the penny stock x 1 for whatever the trading count requirement is,btohqsg
