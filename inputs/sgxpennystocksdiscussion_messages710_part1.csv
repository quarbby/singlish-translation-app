🙆🏻no change👆🏿.. geo geo may consider start collecting near• 1st S 365•2nd S S 310 to 330 zone,btohqsg
Good read for Geo Energy. Looks like a good flush to collect some for the mid term.Key words:- Coal rush! Energy crisis fires global hunt for polluting fuel- Difficult winter- coal market remaining strong until at least mid-2023  if not longer- coal has been embraced as the go-to energy source in the energy crises arising from the war,btohqsg
TG is what? Is it bg🤣,btohqsg
Golden Energy at 720 now  feels like a good entry price too,btohqsg
hope Gear fires up. Both can go up together. Coal play not over yet.War not over,btohqsg
720 bounce up should be fast  flushed many already,btohqsg
So far their dividend yield for 2022 is 24%. ($0.09)very amazing this one. PE 2xSBB as high as $0.355.Hence  i do believe GEO is flushing because they next result   we can expect even better numbers. Demand for coal still good due to the war.,btohqsg
Later we should see 375 flipped up i believe,btohqsg
