to avoid high management fee in endowus?,btohqsg
The first time I did a trade using endowus using my OA I was surprise at the fee too. But lucky I did a lump sum,btohqsg
So it seem for SRS  POEM cash plus is a good candidate.Looking for trading platform to do long term DCA. waiting for ages  IB not approved yet.Anyone use moo moo for long term DCA? Do u think the fee eventually will be huge after 10 years?,btohqsg
Guys  check with u all  there will be no tax relief for voluntary contribution to Medisave account if the annual cpf contribution of 37740$ is exceeded?,btohqsg
Hey Alvin  depends on your assessable income too,btohqsg
Yes for year 2021. Only from this year onwards  this rule is removed.,btohqsg
Refer to this video on why I use POEMs over Endowus for SRShttps://youtu.be/A7ayhwNiQv4,btohqsg
It's just a one-time fee for moomoo. But Syfe trade would be better for DCA now due to two free trades,btohqsg
ic. Still trying to figure out where to park my DCA fund since it‚Äôs long term. Too many choices until I confuse üòÇ,btohqsg
It‚Äôs either cash DCA moo moo or cash to SRS then POEM buying S27 like what u have share. It definitely helps since min is 1 lot and for SRS long term investment  liquid is not a issue for me. S27 best is can use SRS.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Learn some new stuffs from this video,btohqsg
Are you still DCA in syfe custom diamonds account? You didnt mention it hereg,btohqsg
Not anymore since i'm doing Syfe Trade DCA  will update in the next Syfe video,btohqsg
I think my current POEM account is management account.It seem cash plus is currently running a promotion and there‚Äôs no fee for US stock less than $2000?,btohqsg

I see. What about syfe custome cspx ?,btohqsg
Or endowus adviced portfolio is better ?,btohqsg
If you know what you want already then you can use Syfe custom,btohqsg
Robo advised portfolio is more for people who don't know what they want,btohqsg
Hi guys  for citibank rewards card online purchases. Is school fees considered an online purchase  if not which other card is a better option?,btohqsg
Usually excluded. If accept amex  you can use AMEX True cashback or Uob absolute. If not you can use them to topup grabpay and then use grabpay Mastercard to pay,btohqsg
I just got cashback for my UOB absolute. Any idea on where I can find it? I am able to see it on my transaction history and how to claim/redeem it?,btohqsg
Hey guys  the question regarding - buying individual stocks in US from Singapore  How we can avoid estate stocks if we exceeding $60K  any idea or suggestion to do this ?,btohqsg
Cashback accrued in current bill cycle willBe credited to your account at the next bill cycle. Look out for the 1st or last item in your bill.,btohqsg
Yup. I see the recent cashback but will be funds be deposited into my rewards section or? üòÖ,btohqsg
Eh. Sorry  this one then I no idea. Hahaha. I usually just based on last month spendings to see whether the following month cashback is accurate.,btohqsg
Just wanted to ask  if it's possible to get better credit cards (with more perks) solely by spending more and paying on time? or is income the main factor? for example if i were to spend 10-20k a month and pay on time every month but my income is only 5-6k  would i be able to get better cards that are out of my income range?,btohqsg
another question  if you only earn 5-6k  how could you spend that much sustainably?ü§£,btohqsg
just a hypothetical question  parents money  company entertaining expenses etc? üòÖ,btohqsg
Firstly  what are the better credit cards that you are eyeing for? Most of the prestige credit cards come with non-waiveable annual fees which don't make sense unless you can utilize all their benefits.Secondly  banks still look at income mostly. Usually from 30k  the next tier is $120k per annum,btohqsg
so just by spending and paying on time isnt enough?,btohqsg
credit card perks is designed for the mass market or at least a group of targeted audience. paying on time is a must for consumer because the interests accrued is crazily high. of course the bank love it when consumer does default on their payment as it is much easier money,btohqsg
Any thoughts on Revolut or Hugo Card that invest in Gold?,btohqsg
If I just buy cspx from syfe  need to pay rebo fees or have totally free 2  trade a mth?,btohqsg
Yeah like what@summertonsaid. It is expected to pay on time so no extra benefits to qualify you for higher tier card.Anyway my suggestion is always to sign up for the entry tier cards and the signup rewards to build some credit history with the bank and CBS first so they recognize you as a good customer  then proceed to upgrade when your income allows,btohqsg
Syfe wealth need to pay 0.65% p.a.Syfe trade cant buy CSPX  but can buy VOO/SPLG at 2 free trades per month  no robo platform fees,btohqsg
Just curious why not buy nasdaq?,btohqsg
Just curious why not buy nasdaq qqq?,btohqsg
My guess is because of the expense ratio  but let the experts tell why.,btohqsg
One is top 500 companies in USA  one is focus on Tech,btohqsg
