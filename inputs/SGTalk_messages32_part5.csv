Comments from Ho Ching:Yah  we can joke about hosts and hostesses.But seriously  folks  instead of blaming others  let’s hold the mirror to ourselves.When the familial lane was open before March this year  Vietnam was a low incidence country.So folks who came in on whatever pass have been in Sg for a while.If any one of the visitors have covid  they are likely to have caught the virus from someone among us.Don’t demonise others.The Delta virus is highly infectious.The pandemic this year is not the same as the pandemic last year.We know Delta is much more infectious.It may also transmit faster and more efficiently as an aerosol  compared to last year.They could come in via arrivals  or they could come in via fishing vessels delivering their daily catch.And they could hop  skip and jump to anyone anywhere.All it takes is one super spreader to seed a huge cluster and cause a large community outbreak with the potential to overwhelm.So don’t demonise folks who get infected.Just focus on lessons learnt.One important lesson:Don’t bar hopDon’t doctor hopDon’t socialise intensively.If we wish to eat with others  don’t just eat with different groups every day just bcos the rules don’t forbid it.Keep a separation of at least a week between events or groups  better still keep a 2 week separation or even a three week interval.Do so until daily unlinked cases drop below 1~2 daily  and the linked but unquarantined cases drop below 5 daily.Don’t play play  bcos this can kill many innocent folks.Yah  we can throw a tantrum and get upset about sudden changes in rules.But the virus doesn’t care about our tantrums.If we cannot work together to eat and play safely in these 2~3 weeks  we will be whacked like any other country which had gone through desperation and despair when hospitals are overwhelmed.The virus doesn’t care whom we try to blame or demonise.They just do their hop  skip  and jump to light fires faster than we can immunise our folks.So get out of our pampered tantrums and whining blame game.Hunker down and be serious in protecting each other and helping each other.,btohqsg
Bad news  also good news since those restaurant will have to give more discount,btohqsg
