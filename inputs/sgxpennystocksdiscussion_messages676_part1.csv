"🎉Pika World Corporate Insights 12 July 2022🎉🧨Gap stocks dropped💣The stock fell in the late trading hours after news of the exiting of its CEO. While the stock prices had been trading at the peak of $25 in May 2021  it has fallen hard by more than 70% over the past year.The fall in stock price has not been a surprise. One factor is the general sour sentiment in the consumer discretionary sector  particularly the retail industry  on a backdrop of high inflation and recession worry  dampening consumers' spending.Gap and Old Navy are the leading brands' beneficiaries in a pandemic era where people prefer a more casual fit. Still  as the economy re-opens  a more formal wear demand reduces the need for such casual wear.It is a challenging sector to be in.💊Twitter Saga – A mixed bean🕹The fire heats up as Elon Musk ditched the acquisition deal. Twitter's lawyers fired at Musk for calling off the deal and deemed it ""wrongful"". Without a doubt  the shadow is cast on Musk that he is alleged to have breached the obligation of the purchase contract  and this had put pressure on the stock price.Analysts are now piling down on Twitter stock's price to fall further by another 30% as the hope of the deal evaporates. Pika World will avoid the counter at the moment too.🧸Equity market wobbles🛳The general market sentiment is weak given the new waves of Covid that are hurting the stock market. In addition  China is experiencing a new wave of infection  and concerns that it could lead to more restrictions as the new variant is proven to be more infectious.The resorts and travel stocks are among the leading counters to fall  as we see counters like Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands hammered during the session. Counters such as Nike and Starbucks  which do not have significant sales from China compared to the Casino counters  also experienced a pullback.It is a period of uncertainty in the equity market as we move towards the release of CPI data on Wednesday. Till then  investors are likely to be on the cautious foot.It is 12 July  Tuesday  at 9.15 am in Singapore and 9.15 pm in New York. Pika World wishes you a fruitful day ahead.",btohqsg
