just my 1 cent opinionNot answering to your queries directly  as much as i love this shares shoot up at least $0.030 within this month because i have purchased some at 2 series. will amos move up remain a big question mark to me.Here are my reasons:1. I believe disposing 61 million shares through market is not one or two days work especially since this counter is not active at all except recently. As such we may have to look at data especially before 14 June2. Has the founder fully disposed his shares as of now? If no  i think i can sign a relief as i am convinced he will continue to dispose his shares and some big shots will continue to pump money in for him to dispose  which i do expect the price to go up,btohqsg
Ya man sudden so much selling,btohqsg
Danny hasn't fully disposed off his shares  based on ytd's announcement,btohqsg
oh so is due to this...suddenly all so red,btohqsg
JT hit wc 87 can start to kio already  85-87,btohqsg
Thanks for your insights.1) He dumped all on 14th June. There was heavy selling price action but BBs absorbed it . 144million shares exchanged hands that day and the biggest unusual volume for a long time2) Nope  he still have about 130 mil shares to dump.ultimately  who absorbed his selling. thats the main thing.,btohqsg
Leader t5 held at 113  will it rebound from here,btohqsg
Collected Miyoshi $0.038  Collected Hyphens $0.32. DYODD,btohqsg
TG MT and JT - bad closing !!,btohqsg
Wasted nv in. Buy dm instead,btohqsg
That will be great if he still has. Because yesterday saw this piece of information,btohqsg
Oh so u not vested in JT ah,btohqsg
Collect back after its done selling,btohqsg
Long time never see green body,btohqsg
SgYuancan help to chart Sheng Siong? Thank you üôè,btohqsg
just speculating  the person who absorbed his selling most likely can be the management. despite sgx rules stated cannot hold more than certain percentage but with the help of whitewash  bvi  i believe it is still possible,btohqsg
Tomorrow LW announce something then can go other way,btohqsg
Hyphens Pharma.Today T+4- Look the volume candles followed by almost non existent selling. (MM remove liquidity to flush contra players)- Confluence of uptrend support line and 20MA support.- Fresh uptrend with increasing volume each spike candleThis one  the players are aiming upwards as I recently sold 305 lots to then during the T spike.(Likely because not many are playing this counter)$0.32 is a good price to collect. Collected back some earlier too. DYODD üôèüèª,btohqsg
Danny still has 133m shares deemed interest,btohqsg
corrected the amount of shares he have,btohqsg
Anyways  i dont think he will be dumping all. hes just cashing out some IMO. Anyways  BBs wont mind absorbing $2.5 mil worth of chips. They should have some intentions on this one. The unusually high volume on 14th says it all.,btohqsg
Yup same thoughts  collect and hope now üôè,btohqsg
Danny Lien sold his chips and the BBs took it. Just a matter of time the BBs. need to play it up.,btohqsg
They will have to play it up  just matter of when. Hope it is sooner  than later :),btohqsg
