Guess what? The uncle took a Mercedes S class as a replacement vehicle. LOL,btohqsg
I also need a new car,btohqsg
Bang C class claim S class as replacement vehicle,btohqsg
you want him to bang you? 😏,btohqsg
But nicely done  my friend found out after that the uncle works for his father in his company..,btohqsg
So I guess things didn’t turn out super well after..,btohqsg
$29k for that rear knock… more ex than knocking a taxi,btohqsg
Hahaha give me a break bro.. am still young. Need to save my moni,btohqsg
Bruh. That was probably the most ridiculous claim I’ve seen. Based on his damage..,btohqsg
I think knock taxi rear  they only claim $2k,btohqsg
I probably banged him at >30kmh while applying full emergency brake,btohqsg
his whole rear changed to carbon fibre isit,btohqsg
Hang on let me have a look,btohqsg
or isit he and his wife go book 10 session chiropractor,btohqsg
Myalgia > claim 4K (done at private hospital)Transport cost for medical > 300$Legal case > 4.3k,btohqsg
If he asked for insurance claim… the breakdown can be ridiculous,btohqsg
Driver’s claim> neck strain x1 day MC - 4K sgd>medical transport claim > 300$>COST OF REPAIR (most ridiculous) was 8k sgd> replacement vehicle X 13 days > 2.1k sgd> legal cost > 4.3k,btohqsg
His backside like that can claim 8k,btohqsg
I think he claim until engine mount hahaha,btohqsg
This one I need to seek my insurance company’s advise first,btohqsg
That one I think 1-2 days can repair,btohqsg
LOL 1 DAY Mc 4K WHO WANT TO BANG ME NOW,btohqsg
He exports to japan to repair ah,btohqsg
everyday someone bang me for 365 day i whole life no need work alr,btohqsg
He bang u u 1 month don’t need work Aso bro,btohqsg
Claimed me for 4K for 1 day MC,btohqsg
When you guys drive.. be careful. I think there’re a lot of dishonest people in the world.,btohqsg
internal structure might be damaged rear crumple zone might have been impacted,btohqsg
Tell him to come here  we can introduce him for meetup session. $5000/meetup,btohqsg
u go talk to ur insurance company see what they say,btohqsg
If ever *touch wood*  you’re involved in an accident  if you’re really not sincere in doing an honest claim for private settlement  don’t say you’ll settle for private settlement then subsequently go behind their backs and claim insurance,btohqsg
4k a knock i everyday cte jam just slam brake,btohqsg
I may be young  but I have a lot of friends who runs their own workshop.,btohqsg
I know taxi claims are ridiculous,btohqsg
So I know how these kinda things work.. my friends from multiple workshops have advised me accordingly.,btohqsg
So I kinda know he’s trying his luck,btohqsg
bro taxi is fking bad one legit,btohqsg
they claim 1 week mc kind,btohqsg
Whatever it is…. Ur next renewal is screwed,btohqsg
Based on damage  rear crumple zone wouldn’t have been impacted,btohqsg
bro you bang taxi one time 15 mins later 4 taxi drivers  surround you,btohqsg
Because the dent was only on the door. If you know the structure of a freed  you’ll know where the rear crumple zone is,btohqsg
Biggest thing to be thankful for is that I wasn’t hurt  nor was anyone seriously hurt and/or dead,btohqsg
Money can always settle.. money can settle > it’s not a problem..,btohqsg
If money cannot even settle > then I’ll never forgive myself. If I take a live and can never return one > this I’ll never forgive myself,btohqsg
So just a learning point :),btohqsg
money can settle  all you need is  29k,btohqsg
Lucky this guy I bang alr  I straight see if he has PHV sticker hahaha,btohqsg
If he PHV he confirm claim me 2 weeks MC,btohqsg
No problem find until got problem. Say PTSD easy claim.,btohqsg
