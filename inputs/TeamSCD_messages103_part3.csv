Even if you step till your pedal break you canâ€™t change HP figuresâ€¦,btohqsg
I only drive 180 on swift before,btohqsg
Singapore speed limit is 90kmph only,btohqsg
How fast u wan to be,btohqsg
Swift was never build to be fast,btohqsg
Is to be small n fun,btohqsg
not fast.. but will feel fast?,btohqsg
small tracks with tons of corners best,btohqsg
Johor circuit is fun for swift,btohqsg
I had one and it's not super fast,btohqsg
and the VVT kick is audible and can be felt. Which isn't a great replacement for Vtec  but it's fun enough,btohqsg
Go 99 bend and you will understand ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
It's a very good first performance car la. It's a no brainer why it's a very good first car for track goers,btohqsg
Tyres are cheap  maintenance is cheap,btohqsg
and can keep up with more powerful and heavier cars through corners,btohqsg
geh siao  my car no livery,btohqsg
Go track can run many laps more than turbo counterparts,btohqsg
S1k is a good example. 9hrs no problem,btohqsg
If suzuki ever made a cheap   NA convertible  i might jump ship,btohqsg
if they can keep the 900+kg and put in the 1.4T or 1.6NA from the swift sport,btohqsg
it'll make you wonder wtf is a S2000,btohqsg
but if got chance  can try the new swift sport,btohqsg
if i had money  i'd have gone for it,btohqsg
Felt even better after installing door stabilisers,btohqsg
i was even poorer back then,btohqsg
Yes bro. Even more so for 4 door. 2 doors probably your structural rigidity already there.,btohqsg
i nv understood the need for it,btohqsg
some say have  some say no use,btohqsg
Push your car enough you should feel it haha,btohqsg
So you can feel flex at the edge of the doors?,btohqsg
Not at the doors per say. But the whole chassis will feel more as one,btohqsg
It's sorta like making another structural point but making the doors 'connect' with the body,btohqsg
Let me see if it's cheap enough to buy,btohqsg
You just need a pair haha,btohqsg
Any pics of the door stabilizaters?,btohqsg
Never heard of such thing beforeðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but i need to do more research to see which brand is good,btohqsg
It's like this. Aisin door stabiliser,btohqsg
Hmmm..time to go n check it outðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
There's this too. Motion control beam. But I havent researched much about it yet.,btohqsg
Can be used as baton also ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But this is installed behind your front or rear bumper. So I don't think you have enough time to take out to whack people,btohqsg
It got worse after the meet,btohqsg
But the eyes not nice. :(,btohqsg
Hor u say roi car eyes not nice,btohqsg
But just not nice to me. Cause smol. HAAH,btohqsg
