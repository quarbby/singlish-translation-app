I have a specific query regarding CPF and taking out loansCurrently  I am self-employed and have already been making contributions to my CPF Medisave. I am contemplating a voluntary top-up to my CPF account  mainly because I'm looking into the possibility of taking out a personal/house/credit card loan in the near future.I wanted to ask:- Does having a higher balance in my CPF account  due to voluntary top-ups  have any positive impact on my eligibility or the terms I might receive for such loans?- Would you recommend a CPF top-up in my case as a strategic move before applying for these loans  or would it not make much of a difference?,btohqsg
1. Loan quantum is based on income and credit history  not much in CPF balance. Though more OA is useful to pay and reduce the loan required.2. Only do CPF top-up when you need the tax relief  not for loans,btohqsg
any cons for Citi Reward + amaze?spend 2.5k monthly can get 10k miles,btohqsg

7.8% for the $75 001 to $100 000. eir is 5% for the 100k,btohqsg
Its like income tax. Not the mWhole 100k gets 7.8%,btohqsg
Hi Everyone  I have a sensitive question about CPF payments from employer to employee.any gurus well versed in cpf conflict resolutions?,btohqsg
can anyone advise how citipayall works? i have to pay for a rent online in foreign currency for 3 months. (arnd 2.2k sgd per month) should I use citipayall to earn miles?,btohqsg
Cimb for new customer also 6months 3.5% only. Wouldn't tbill be a better choice?,btohqsg
I remember Mouse Hunter remember someone asked this question before.,btohqsg
how do i search it up pls,btohqsg
T bill money is lock  CIMB money more flexible and liquid,btohqsg
Eh then if I'm earning more than 102k annually. The max amount that will attract CPF contribution is only 102k. And with the increment of the OW ceiling to 8k  means effectively I take home less each month as the 8k will be subjected to deductions and employer contribution is capped at 102k. Doesn't that make it essentially a pay cut? Can I think about it that way?,btohqsg
No difference actually. Because when u get your bonus  u will get more cash than previously (assuming bonus amount unchanged compared to the past).,btohqsg
I see thanks. They should really increase the annual ceiling. Increasing the OW to 8k makes no difference tbh,btohqsg
We actually had some analysis of this. There is actually one group that would benefit.Those earning between $6-8k with bonus under $30k to under $6k respectively.Because this group never hit the $102k annual wage ceiling  with the changes they actually get more cpf contributions from employer (net gain).,btohqsg
Hi useing citi payall for my rent I juz read about cardup  juz to check with u all which payment can earn more miles point?,btohqsg
For cardup  you can use this website to check.https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculatorFor citi payall  login to Citi apps n choose Citi payall  it calculates and shows you the miles/points you will earn before your make final submission if it is non promo.,btohqsg
Isit more wroth it to use cardup than ciit payall?,btohqsg
Provided you use cardup promo code.,btohqsg
Unless you have no bonus at all,btohqsg
For unsecured loans the credit rating agency have no access to CPF  they only care about your source of income and existing debts if any.for housing loan the banks and HDB have access to CPF,btohqsg
Hi  just opened a UOB one account last month. Managed to spend the min 500sgd and credit salary. Believed that the bonus interest will be credited the first day of next month  which is yesterday but I don‚Äôt see the interest being credited. Is there anywhere to check?,btohqsg
Holiday a bit delayed I guess. Wait a bit.,btohqsg

Good morning  for UOB lady card + instarem amaze combination  if selected category is dining and the lady card is binded to instarem amaze  after using amaze to pay for a dining bill  will 6MPD still be rewarded?,btohqsg
Yes provided the place u use at. Has dining mcc coded.,btohqsg
This condition applies to whether i use the lady card organically or via instarem amaze card yeah? thanks!,btohqsg
Yeah.For my lazy household members  I usually get them to use amaze so I can switch the linked MasterCard for them in the background.Amaze does not change the mcc of the merchant although it makes all transactions online (only upside no downside in my opinion),btohqsg
Thanks for this! Was worried that there may be some downside restrictions  but based on your explanation I dont think there is any üëçüèª,btohqsg
Only cards like uob krisflyer which rely on merchant name (amaze messes that up) u need to be careful.,btohqsg
