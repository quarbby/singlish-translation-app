True enough.. but if motorbike really took something like this  higher chances the item will damage. Later on  must bare the item costing as well. Jialat.,btohqsg

Make sure u make a call b4 heading down. Swipe arrive . Report CS of oversize item cannot deliver. If not cash order  u can receive 50percent compensation,btohqsg
"Already done call b4 proceeding. My sop since last 2 years ago.. hahhaa.. sender mention ""flower  small only"". Lol.. so many pattern",btohqsg

Wahhhh? Restaurant is it? That’s why I don’t come early or on time. I come 5-7 mins after the pick up time. But then along the way must “catch up lost time”. But if come after that but still must wait  then something wrong. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg

All these platforms always protect their customers 1st,btohqsg
We dun take some will take the order too.  From last time covid days till now all platform is the same.,btohqsg
That’s why I usually take screenshots of the map if got jam or heavy traffic especially on weekends ( + peak hour ). Saved my arse so many times. Just my two cents. But at the end of the day  it’s driver’s preferences.,btohqsg
Only ma fan thing is every month need to do “spring cleaning”. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
I last time also like that but when talk to the cus service really tired just wait or this may pattern,btohqsg
I might as well take job go off better,btohqsg
While waiting usually I will take screenshots of my watch and outside the restaurant. After collect order  do the same thing. Then just update them. Once 40 mins orders in a day  I racked up $24 just on waiting fees alone. 😅😅,btohqsg
I hope don Kanna this type again,btohqsg
I’m time sensitive  coz like you time is money to me. 🙊🙉🙈 Coz I’m doing this after my FT job. Not to shake leg and wait for their food.,btohqsg
Need to keep up with the times lahh Bro. Adapt to survive. 👍🏽,btohqsg
I just hope if there is cus in this group pls don’t book pooling if urgent or need delivery foodSpare a thought for the delivery personIf really book pooling if late don complain to cus service alsoCos they will hold their salaryWhat if got ppl urgent need the money for food for their family or other thingInside this money not only ur order money is the driver hard earn 1 week salary,btohqsg
