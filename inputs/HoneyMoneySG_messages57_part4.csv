Does anyone knows the UOB One account branch code? I open the account online and provided 001 branch code to my HR. HR said the salary bounced due to wrong code so I didn‚Äôt receive my salary. üò± now asking for the correct branch code. Thanks for advise,btohqsg
Hi guys. Abit confused here. If I paired my UOB ladies card with amaze card and select fashion/ dining as my 2 categories for lady card‚Ä¶When amaze convert my spending into ‚Äúonline‚Äù does it auto qualified  for fashion category? üòÖ online shopping,btohqsg
AFAIK  the online/offline part doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs the MCC that counts,btohqsg
"The category is ""Fashion""  not shopping or online shopping.",btohqsg
They need to find way to use the $,btohqsg
Would like to know which card is good for Grab topup now.,btohqsg
Only uob absolute give 0.3 percent rebate for grab,btohqsg
Firstly you need to let us know what is the purpose of topping up Grab wallet? Grab gives minimum rewards to customer for using their service. Charge Grab transactions to credit card directly will be a better choice n earned more rewards..,btohqsg
For PAYNOW. Cannot change to credit card payment.,btohqsg
Any Maybank credit card still give miles or rebate for Grab top up?,btohqsg
To add  online or offline doesn‚Äôt matter for uob lady‚Äôs card.The reason you hear so much about converting to online via amaze is coz of citi rewards card  for which one of the main types of purchases that it awards 4mpd for is online purchases.,btohqsg
Any card that is more advantageous to use to pay for getgo?,btohqsg
If u use cc to top up u cant use the top up balance for paynow,btohqsg
Unless u talking about paynow to merchant,btohqsg
But rebate is only 0.3 percent  pretty much equal to none,btohqsg
But no other way to get any rebate for PAYNOW transaction right?,btohqsg
Depend on what merchant u talking about. Those with sg qr code can use xnap. Those pure paynow might not be eligible if the paynow is not company paynow,btohqsg
Yes i know  some small stall paynow qr is invidual not under company. Grab paynow can only be used on paynow qr link to a company that is what i am saying,btohqsg
You may want share with us which merchants n what service or product you plan to purchase. Then from there we can brainstorm.,btohqsg
I tried using Grab to scan the QR code and it recognised.,btohqsg
Well then do what u happy with.,btohqsg
I tried scanning the QR code using xnap and xnap does not recognise the code.,btohqsg
Is it sgqr. There are other qr code that does not.,btohqsg
Do you have photo of the QR?,btohqsg
Do you guys know if these discounts on Citi rewards card are automatically applied or do we need any promo codes?,btohqsg
So I called HSBC as it was suggested in the email  and they asked to email the proof of SingSaver form submission. Today I got a call from HSBC confirming that I‚Äôm eligible and will be receiving my gift in 2 weeks üòç,btohqsg
It'll be hard to tally the numbers on ur CC statement and SimplyGo app...,btohqsg
I guess it's automatic. I should wait for next Monday as I want to purchase two cans shoes in Zalora,btohqsg
what is the best card to earn miles for online spending but in USD  cause i spend alot very month on amazon US site. i already max out the 2k on my dbs woman world card every month. need another card intro.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how I can make payment for Standard chartered simply cash credit card? I logged in to the app and seems like I have an esaver account as well but then I tried to transfer money into esaver via DBS account to make payment  it doesn‚Äôt go through at all.,btohqsg
U gotta add payee (credit card number) in ur savings a/c.. then wait 12-18hrs before u can start paying ur credit card from ur savings a/c...Same with ur esaver a/c...,btohqsg
Different banks will have different UI/UX  so play ard with the various bank interface...,btohqsg
Question on HSBC revolution card. I just received my first statement. Spend is around $270 but the reward points is only around 360. Is it because the bonus 9x points is credited one month later? The transactions are on mainly groceries,btohqsg
Yes. The 9x point is awarded one month later before month end,btohqsg

Anyone manage to earmark UOB 1 account for Jul this month?,btohqsg
Registered last month and suppose earmark this month. Now already 26 still yet to earmark,btohqsg
Means u can't withdraw out the money,btohqsg
Last earmark promo  this is the latest,btohqsg
Does Instarem supprt google pay or Apple Pay ?,btohqsg
yeah the logic is the same.. it will deduct by 31st July... today only 26th july,btohqsg
Google pay for now  apple pay should be coming soon,btohqsg
It used to earmarked by 21 or 25,btohqsg
This time was so late  just wonder anyone in the same boat,btohqsg
i recall i took part in a previous cycle..The earmark was late by a few dayse.g. supposed to be 31st January  it was earmarked only on 5th Feb.. but no issue it doesn't affect interest calculations,btohqsg
Hi  do anyone know how much do I need to spend to waive off the fee for citibank cashback plus card?,btohqsg
