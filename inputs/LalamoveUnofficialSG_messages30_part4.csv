Just attended the LLM training app update. They are aware of the rates   filters and also notes issues. Apparently they are working on it to rectify as they are aware,btohqsg
The rates they going to compensate?,btohqsg
Suddently so mqny order with surge,btohqsg
Not sure. Apperantly they know that rates dropped and could be due to the Google mapping. He said management is looking into this matter . Be patient lol,btohqsg
At least they looking into it.. Better than they ignore,btohqsg
At least they say they look into it.,btohqsg
Not been doing llm as rates sucks don't waste time,btohqsg
Apparently now must call restaurant before heading down. If restaurant didn't answer have to ask cso to unassign ðŸ¤£ like this can don't do tai cheong @ HV since they don't answer phone one,btohqsg
Cso told me have to call,btohqsg
Call when it is a parcel pick up. For food I don't think need to call,btohqsg
Restaurant not open and number listed there no answer. No compensation also,btohqsg
Shld just pick up and cfm drop off ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

I want to watch it again,btohqsg
Becuase i tot it was different.. the youtube woman voice  i rmmbr the training was a man voice,btohqsg
How many hours do u guys drive a day?,btohqsg
All along from last time actually supposed to call  and they will maintain that and tell u only that becos if anything happen its the only way u have an argument against customer,btohqsg
And they can only tell u if restaurant dont pick up ask cso cancel becos they cant tell u if dont pick up just go and see wat happens ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Next time don't go lol. Wait for restaurant or lala to call then go,btohqsg
Now been more than 7 business days since I cash out but still no news,btohqsg
Do you guy call customer to pick up n send items?,btohqsg
Seems abit troublesome for food items,btohqsg
Since some of them are credit orders,btohqsg
Downloaded this lalamove helper... omg auto took jobs once you put your criteria,btohqsg
Was trying and took like 5jobs within my citeria,btohqsg
Can dont call  but if item too big/send mia and you wanna call cso they wont compensate,btohqsg
My first few orders i call. But if pick up job while riding how to call sia lol i dont have handsfree,btohqsg
If you have dispute  they will ask you to send proof that you called. Screenshot call log. If donâ€™t have  gg.,btohqsg
If user cancel means the driver or the client cancel?,btohqsg
