Adrian  just take note when you are buying tickets for your family you are earning miles in two ways and in two buckets:Two Ways:#1 the card you use to pay for the tickets should be giving you some kind of rewards (miles or cashback)#2 the ticket you buy should give you miles for flying that distance (based on the class of ticket  you earn üòµTwo Buckets:Personal Bucket+ miles from Way #1 goes to your own personal (even your family members‚Äô tickets that you paid with your own card)+ miles from Way #2 of your ticketFamily Individual Bucket+ miles from Way #2 of each family member goes to their own accountso what happens is that you may end up with a bunch of ‚Äúorphan‚Äù miles in your family accounts because it‚Äôs not sizable enough to do anything with them - and no  you cannot transfer their miles from their krisflyer account to yours,btohqsg
