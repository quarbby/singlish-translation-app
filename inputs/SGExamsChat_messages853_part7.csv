https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/alfa-romeo-and-jeep-dealership-to-close-by-juneWhich brands do you think Komoco will bring in using the old dealerships?,btohqsg
My theories as to the potential candidates:1. Hongqi (FAW is the only one of the Chinese Big 3 to not yet have any presence in the Singapore market  or the Southeast Asian market as a whole. I expect that Hongqi would be popular amongst the rich Chinese set in Singapore)2. Leapmotor (Chinese EV brand with partial Stellantis ownership)3. Xiaomi Auto4. Genesis (Hyundai's luxury sub-brand)5. Vinfast (Vingroup has been INSANELY aggressive in terms of overseas expansion. Singapore might be a stepping stone to a bigger foothold in the Southeast Asian market outside Vietnam),btohqsg
guys i heard if you take Mechatronics or robotics diploma(poly)  its hard to find a job  Is it true?,btohqsg
If your education ends at a diploma  it will be hard,btohqsg
but what if i were to join Universities  would it be okay to apply for other engineering bachelors like Mech or Electronic engineerings,btohqsg
The field of Mechatronics/robotics is niche but there is demand.The prob is  there is not enough demand to the point they would choose someone whom has a diploma for most cases,btohqsg
if i take diploma in electrical and electronic engineering would it be better for the future jobs and education,btohqsg
More diverse field so yea I suppose,btohqsg
But triple EEE would be more desirable,btohqsg
Well honestly what you should be worried about is getting good gpa to get to uni  not the diploma that will get you to uni,btohqsg
With sufficient gpa you should be able to join anything you want,btohqsg
They have to consider whether AI can automate it lol,btohqsg
Same for university courses   certain degrees in the US has been less and less useful as time gonna pass,btohqsg
Psychology is okay   can still be a counselling team member,btohqsg
Biology can still help you prepare as hospital staff,btohqsg
you donâ€™t do a psychology degree expecting to realistically work in psychology unless you do a masters,btohqsg
The rest he mentioned are indeed useless I think,btohqsg
biology is still ok bc industry labs have sufficient places but the ceiling is a bit low,btohqsg
Watch me study a physics degree but go do an office job like hr,btohqsg
but degrees that are more focused on the science itself (social science included) often have to rely more on the applied skills side to secure smth,btohqsg
