I cant study anymore after being analed in the butt like that,btohqsg
Physics made me realise i can never be a multibillionaire,btohqsg
Meanwhile the china guy beside me was like askinf qns,btohqsg
I was this close to yeeting the coke bottle,btohqsg
The guy beside me went to the toilet 3 times in 2 hours,btohqsg
Also edwin distracted me when the paper started,btohqsg
HOW MANY THINGS IS HE LOSING,btohqsg
We dont talk about him he's a lunatic,btohqsg
Bruh who is taking his stuff i swear,btohqsg
He is just an extremely careless person who doesnt have any regard for his items,btohqsg
I want will figure out where his cheat sheet is,btohqsg
I want to figure out the one day he actually does his own cheatsheet,btohqsg
3 years in and im willing to bet he hasnt done a single cheatsheet himselr,btohqsg
And also he has only submitted one lab report for 2198 currently.,btohqsg
As much as i wanna say there is someone else who is worser,btohqsg
This is not even meeting the basics,btohqsg
People already sent him their reports for him to basically copy already,btohqsg
He just needs to change the values,btohqsg
But apparently its still too hard,btohqsg
The worst I've seen was him asking me for my grp mate phone number for cc5,btohqsg
I think someone told me he confessed his love interest on someone in IG as well,btohqsg
i don’t but i know people who do,btohqsg
so i kinda have an idea,btohqsg
have you tried looking at the mods they take?,btohqsg
In terms of math  i feel:CE<CS<DSAI,btohqsg
Would be doing some modules shared with EEE,btohqsg
The man who is gonna take 6 years in physics at this point,btohqsg
I actually wonder why he wanted to take phy tho...,btohqsg
Meanwhile wyatt and i are one week away from finishing all our core mods phew,btohqsg
I think we lost our sanity at exam hall B,btohqsg
i mean yes but tbh stats is super unavoidable for anything computing related,btohqsg
Even ntu lost and found cannot find,btohqsg
tim liew was out for blood today,btohqsg
I actually was able to do 2 qns from his pyp,btohqsg
I finished the paper in 2 mins,btohqsg

Flip q1  cannot doFlip q2  cannot doFlip q3  oh looks like pyp  but still cannot doFlip q4  i cant even do the first part already and all the subsequent parts relies on part a,btohqsg
Q3 is trick qn cus no fixed pt,btohqsg
I learnt what gu mile told me,btohqsg
i swear all the weird ones come from jc,btohqsg
Because i decided to just copy the pyp wholesale,btohqsg
He told me he poly i swear,btohqsg
Well poly would be a good answer because,btohqsg
He took 3 years for A levels anyway,btohqsg
Might as well tell people poly,btohqsg
