CDC issues guidelines on COVID-19 vaccination after allergic reactionshttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-us-cdc-vaccine-guidelines-after-allergic-reactions-13809572,btohqsg
*KEY POINTS from Singapore Medical Association on COVID-19 VACCINE WEBINAR (19TH DEC 2020)*(1) Currently approved for use for individuals *aged 16 and above*. Currently *not* approved for use in *pregnant women  profoundly immunosuppressed and history of anaphylaxis*. Breast feeding can receive vaccine but *need to stop breast feeding for at least 1 week*.(2) *No need to do serology before * administering vaccine. Individuals with past COVID-19 infection can also receive the vaccine.(3) *Vaccinated individuals who develop ARI symptoms will still need to undergo SASH / COVID-19 PCR test* as the vaccine is 95% effective and not 100% effective.(4) Vaccinated individuals can still be carriers and can still transmit the virus/infection (*no clear data yet on whether it can prevent asymptomatic infection / transmission*). Vaccinated individuals can still be infected with COVID-19. Hence the need for continued measures like mask-wearing  early testing and safe distancing measures.(5) *14% of recipients of vaccine can develop fever* (approximately 1 in 7) : hence the *need to have staggered vaccine schedule for HCW to avoid disruption to manpower* (for service continuity: HCW in departments will be scheduled to receive vaccine over a period of time). HCW working in high risk front line fields will be prioritized.(6) Vaccines stocks will arrive in batches : not everyone can be vaccinated immediately. *Priority for HCW and vulnerable individuals*. *Polyclinics will be the main vaccination sites for first phase*. Vaccinations will be on *appointment basis only* to ensure prudent use of available vaccine stocks (in the context of the ultra-cold-chain and need to minimize wastage). Please await more information.(7) *Lymphadenopathy* has been in a small number of vaccinated individuals : most of these cases resolve spontaneously within 7 to 10 days.(8) *Patient information leaflet and consent forms* will be developed and released by MOH at later stage.(9) *Vaccination does not lead to false-positive PCR test*. There are serology assays available in Singapore which can differentiate between vaccine immunity (S-protein Antibody positive and N-protein Antibody negative) and virus immunity.(10) *Pfizer vaccine will be thawed to fridge temperature (2 to 8 degrees) before being sent out to Vaccination Providers* : these thawed vaccines can be kept in normal fridge temperate for up to 5 days (patient scheduling will be used to minimize wastage). Vaccination Providers do not require ultra-cold storage facilities (their current vaccine fridge will suffice).(11) *Current recommendations: COVID-19 vaccine to be spaced away from other vaccines (example flu vaccines) by at least 2 weeks.*(12) If an individual *missed second dose* of COVID-19 vaccine (more than 21 days)  there is *no need to re-start the course*. The individual should just proceed to *receive the second dose as soon as possible* (even if it is delayed).(13) *No evidence of post-vaccination antibody dependent enhancement (ADE)* (I.E. no worsening of disease in vaccinated individuals aka Dengue Vaccine).(14) Currently *no evidence of vaccination resistance*. *Duration of vaccine immunity : still awaiting more data* : but serological studies of neutralizing antibodies in naturally infected individuals show at least 6 months duration. COVID-19 vaccine unlikely to be ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù (likely flu vaccine).(16) *Vaccine takes approximately 5 weeks to achieve full immunity* (3 weeks for vaccination and 2 weeks post-vaccination). Now would be the best time to vaccinate Singapore as community cases are low and we can organize mass vaccination exercises safely and efficiently. There is no guarantee that we can hold off a second wave of infection even with current measures. It will be difficult to organize a mass vaccination exercise if there is an outbreak in Singapore. Hence now is the best time to proceed with mass vaccination.(16) *FAQs being developed by MOH will be released at a later stage*,btohqsg

Update on Yinda. Today opened above the downtrend trendline(or triangle) but didn't manage to close above it n above 2 MAs resistance. PA showed price came to 82 & buyers came in again. Already at the apex of the triangle(I didn't draw the bottom line. You imagine yourself). Monday is the deciding day. T+4 over. MACD histogram reversing up. 82 got buyers support. Lim pei ka li kong  the chance of an upward move is much higher.,btohqsg
Lim pei ka li kong why I add Broadway 161 today?. Earlier on I saw 160 got buyers. Price went to hit 162 & dropped to 158/159. Then at 159/160 no trade for nearly an hour. Market not bullish. Nobody willing to buy especially on a Friday. Then after 4pm got willing buyers eat 160 & 161. For 1 hour nobody want to buy. Why suddenly got willing buyers especially today is Friday market closing soon n  T+4 on Monday?. My guess is BBs eat one. So when 161 ate up  in my mind I can imagine the chart should be quite nice liao. That's why I add. Now look at the chart. Price near to 165 resistance. Closed with a very nice setup. This kind of setup can lead to a long white candle. Monday is T+4. Can Broadway  do it?. We will see hah...,btohqsg
Selling of shares to raise money?,btohqsg
