Everybody would either get A1 or fail,btohqsg
"A1 is bc they see full chinese they go ""yeah looks correct"" fail is bc they use google translate and the google translate fucks up everybody's answers (jk)",btohqsg
so interesting. so its local syllabus  local grading system  foreigner setting qns and foreigner grading,btohqsg
She said there are no plans to align the Singapore-Cambridge GCE examinations grading system with that of the UK system.While the SEAB engages the University of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) to set and mark the papers  the standards and award of grades for the subjects are determined by SEAB and MOE in consultation with CIE.Subjects such as mother tongue languages are set  marked and graded locally.,btohqsg
