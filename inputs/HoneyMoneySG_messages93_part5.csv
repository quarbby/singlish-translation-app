Sorry I got confusedThank you so so much üíï you guys been so wonderful! üèÖ,btohqsg
I suggest to just transfer back the 100k now  at least you'll get 4% p.a. interest this month. That's about $220 instead of $397 for this month. If can transfer more also  then can close the gap a bit more.,btohqsg
How much more to bank in other to get back all my interest?,btohqsg
How much more to bank in order  to get back all my interest?,btohqsg
If you want to hit almost 5% p.a. for this month  you will need to transfer in at least 430k today and keep until 1 Mar morning (to be safe).,btohqsg
Wow! That‚Äôs a lot! Noted. Thank you Melvyn üòä,btohqsg
How long does it take for HSBC EGA account to get approved. I registered online on Sunday till now still no news no email no confirmation.,btohqsg
Ah you don‚Äôt mean / do you mean 5%pa on $430k?I think it‚Äôs only worth it for the $100k as anything above UOB one account $100k be earning 0.05% is that correctAlbeit the promo of $558 for $100k fresh funds,btohqsg
If you registered online and it doesn't get approved instantly  then you have answered one of the qns with an answer that is unsatisfactory to the bank.They will call you within 2 weeks and once they clarified on your answer  it will open within 1 week.That was what happened to me.,btohqsg
Do you happen to know if it's straightforward to go to the branch directly to apply? I was directed to an online form for a callback (cos the usual online form says I'm not eligible) but also haven't heard anything after filling in that callback form haha.,btohqsg
Means you already have an application. Go branch no use  I tried also. As long you have an existing application  they will see that one only. When did you apply?,btohqsg
That's the weird thing  I never applied though. Currently only have revo card with them and nothing else,btohqsg
Oh. If you have any credit cards with them then you need to apply through branch. Good thing is signature will be there already on the day off account opening  so can just send out your GIRO forms le.,btohqsg
Pardon me. Does salary credit count as new funds?,btohqsg
Yes. If your salary 20k/50k/100k can register with it alone. If not can just top-up the difference.,btohqsg
If you have revo only  cant apply online with instant. I visited branch for manual EGA account opening  and cant use immediately due to need to link in hsbc app. Was informed will be done within 2 to 3 working days. Waited more than 1 week with repeated calls  chat to hsbc to expedite,btohqsg
Having Revo =Existing customer. means u have to go down to branch physically to apply for ega.That's what I did. Need about 40min at the branch to get all the paperwork,btohqsg
Overall not pleasant experience opening EGA account at branch,btohqsg
I emailed them said forget it after waited 10 days,btohqsg
hello  i just did a FAST transfer from DBS with salary payment as the purpose to UOB one account. wondering roughly how long will it take for the account to acknowledge this 1.6k salary credit as it‚Äôs coming end of feb in a few days,btohqsg
Mine was online. Need to do call on zoom. Really strange,btohqsg
At this rate might as well just stick to a cashback only card,btohqsg
Just use both miles and cashback. Whichever better for the spend. Don‚Äôt have to only use one type.,btohqsg
Check tomorrow. As long as you follow the exact steps  you don't need to worry.,btohqsg

I am given advice to buy gift vouchers  eg. Ntuc gift voucher  can buy online immediately thru their appAnd i believe u actually could have less than 2 days. Becos the merchant take 1 or 2 days to post... so u shd clear it by today..,btohqsg
Cold Storage buy rice and oil now.,btohqsg

Cold Storage usually post same day or tomorrow.,btohqsg
Is there anyway to easily hit the 800 spending for the UOB Kirsflyer card to clock 3 mpd?,btohqsg
Risky. My recent 7-11 purchase is 1 day. But you can try.,btohqsg
Can use Uob one credit card on medical/dental and does it consider to hit the monthly spend of $500?,btohqsg
Have you read the uob one card terms and conditions?,btohqsg
UserYashkuhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:wrong place,btohqsg
Never mention medical/dental exclusion in the terms and conditions.,btohqsg
Use your UOB One physical card (insert card or tap doesn't matter) to buy vouchers at Cold Storage. Should post same day (but don't risk it by doing it very late at night).,btohqsg
Any review on latest EGA promo ?,btohqsg

Yesterday transfer 30k to ccbc 360 account and within 5 minutes made the fd.Today found out average monthly balance is increased too.I thought fixed deposit made from ocbc 360 account not counted towards the MAB counting purpose.Fyi for everyone.(FD/TD is also counted towards monthly average balance counting purpose  if the fd made from same account),btohqsg
What time you did the fd?,btohqsg
the average monthly balance is the number reflected on ocbc ibanking? What is the as of date?,btohqsg
