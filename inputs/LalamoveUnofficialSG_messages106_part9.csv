with bag   can filter immidiate order location also i guess,btohqsg
I no bag also can filter,btohqsg
Everyone have this since the update of the app a while ago  nothing to do with lalabag,btohqsg
Looking closely  I did not have the immediate orders option  my apologies,btohqsg
But what is the difference between Now or immediate,btohqsg
Now FP giving free bags  LLM still want us to buy,btohqsg
Personally  the user interface to filter for the locations was quite clunky  so this new ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù makes no difference to me scrolling down the list of jobs available.,btohqsg
Instead of those names they came up with  I‚Äôd personally rather something like District 9  56 etc‚Ä¶ and show the exact address.Having the address on one single line with line feed  then unit number on the next would be a LOT tidier than this implementation.,btohqsg
Just to keep track of how far I‚Äôve clocked in mileage  I just tried to key in the locations manually in Google Sheets and have it total up the distance I clocked just for the Start-End of the day. Good for tracking my odometer too.,btohqsg
Not full time doing LLM so got time üòõ,btohqsg
"for now this ""feature"" is a bit too clunky.if anyone wanted to know where the ""Now"" jobs are  the app already is sucking power from the phone for geolocation  why not base on that as default... cos 20 minutes later i'm in Bukit Batok instead of Pasir Ris  why would i want to see ""Now"" jobs starting from Pasir Ris? lol",btohqsg
Yes. Some even the job come out u press no chance to bid even,btohqsg

Old pillows. Not too thick  so you can roll them up to keep things upright.,btohqsg
Yah  make sure ur box or thermal bag is packed so won't topple,btohqsg
GLASS bottles - break one  you pay for the product.some places may have a LOT of cardboard you can tear to try to pad the bottles from each other.eh.... this one primary school problem solving leh. the soup question was still quite ok leh.... glass bottle  you think you go over a hump  or pothole  the glass will not crack?,btohqsg

Alcohol delivery if it‚Äôs those online whisky etc seller ok. They sell alcohol come with the boxing. But depends. Kena soju can cry  especially lose packing. Scared break,btohqsg
I self ban the alcohol seller at lower delta one. Waste my time  arrive there or drive halfway cancel order.,btohqsg
Textile centre level 2 the alcohol guy not bad  just the parking headache for drivers. Riders should be ok,btohqsg
