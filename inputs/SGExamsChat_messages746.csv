"Boy oh boy where do I even begin. TMJC... honey  my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you into the paint and strike admiration into students. Your silky smooth facilities around the campus  and that gorgeous canteen. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you be demolished. We had a rough start  but we never gave up hope. You are even amazing outside of school  sometimes I even call you daddy. I forvever dread and weep  thinking of the day you will one day die. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could leave a legacy on thd school. You have given me so much joy  and heartbreak over the years. I remember when I first joined JC and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched Aquila win in orientation because deep down  my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas  you did  my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2019 was a hard year for us baby  but in 2023 you made history happen. You achieved higer than expected results. I was crying  bawling even  and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words  ""WE ARE TAMPINES MERIDIAN OUR STORIES WILL BE TOLD"" Not only have you changed the game of JCs and the world forever  but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older  but still the goat  my goat. I love you pookie bear  my glorious king  Tampines Meridian Junior College.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èü´∂üèª",btohqsg

CNA conducted a social experiment with 20 Primary Five and Six pupils from schools across Singapore  to find out the biggest contributor to stress for them. Here‚Äôs what we found:https://cna.asia/3Vz01hX,btohqsg
Social experiment.. it ain't even a study just an experiment bro,btohqsg
Na even the reference is a survey oni,btohqsg
I'm no saint but I dont think anywhere on education has such results...99%?,btohqsg
def more than 1% doesn't give a shit about psle scores,btohqsg
but they definitely surveyed a sch like raffles girls pri lol,btohqsg
the pic says parents though not kids,btohqsg
p sure there are more parents thinking its impt than kids,btohqsg

Real‚Ä¶a lot of parents have this mentality PSLE highest stake exam,btohqsg
True and not at the same time depending on how u are seeing it,btohqsg
But actually tho  how is 20 even gonna tell anything  must as well dont do,btohqsg

When they called me out for searching on genocides,btohqsg
Were you like blacklisted or sth lol,btohqsg
Oh ya I thought you said sth along the lines of that but couldn‚Äôt find the msg,btohqsg
I think alot of people have the consensus that PSLE is the most difficult national exam,btohqsg
Because N/O/A level are muggable  if you do enough TYS and study hard  it is very possible to get a good score,btohqsg
But for PSLE  they can literally test out of the box questions,btohqsg
first thing when i open discord,btohqsg
thats a skill issue on her part,btohqsg
homework is so trivial that i can do it after the teacher collected it/j,btohqsg

don't call my gen the skibidi toilet gen,btohqsg
i feel like ik some ppl who use their brains actl,btohqsg
Tbh i feel partly gen issue partly just being at that age ppl do stupid shit,btohqsg
ngl i used to be mad at my ex bsf for treating me that way but i also mad respect at how she managed to pull it off and i admit defeat,btohqsg
Coz looking back every gen got their own dumb shit,btohqsg
I'm running low on ideas for animal of the week,btohqsg
broad category but that gives me smth to work with,btohqsg
i have so many ideas but i need to focus on some first,btohqsg
Ngl ml is fun with friends,btohqsg
wait isit same girl that ik,btohqsg
Valerie should i do the animal of the week on cute dog breed or the fierce fierce kind,btohqsg
finally an appropriate context to use this stickee,btohqsg
i legit wanna make some joke about genes,btohqsg
Eh atp it's not if but when she gets preggo,btohqsg
"""oh fuck who is the father""",btohqsg
ok but last year promos legit got 1 qn damn funny,btohqsg
"can't wait for ""i love cjc jokes"" rae to respond to this comment",btohqsg
"""Bob and Sally have a son  William  William's blood type is O  but both Bob and Sally have B blood type. Bob is worried that William is not his son. Using appropriate diagram(s)  prove whether Bob is correct.""",btohqsg
when this came out in promos i was üò≠inside,btohqsg
I see the qn iw to pastaway,btohqsg
spoiler alert is that there's a 25% chance their kid has the O blood type,btohqsg
so based off blood types alone we can't deduce that william isn't his biological son,btohqsg
Bro what is this beef with sgexam disc,btohqsg
but then of course not much people in this day and age would use blood to determine if someone's biologically related to them,btohqsg
I got cursed to go back to tele,btohqsg
Like wtf i have been in sgexam longer than most of them bruh,btohqsg
have y'all heard of swallowed twins,btohqsg
ik its not the right term,btohqsg
then the child comes out is only 1 child,btohqsg
yea but its good enough haha,btohqsg
But got remnants of the other twin in the surviving twin body,btohqsg
so got this old woman many years ltr got like stomach pain and they thought shes preggy but then ended up it was her twin,btohqsg
cause the fetus in the uterus cant eat,btohqsg
but the remnants are really just... remnants,btohqsg
uh there's photosynthesis but my understanding is rabz cause its taught in y6,btohqsg
Its only cause the twin and the mother absorb the other twin,btohqsg
so in theory if its done completely then there's no remnants,btohqsg
Isn't there some kerbs cycle shit,btohqsg
I rmb hearing alot of ppl flame that,btohqsg
but like vanishing twins explained is that,btohqsg
and another twin thats like super weak and have a lot of deformities,btohqsg
I rpt 100 child of god,btohqsg
Its usually from dna deformities making it unable to survive,btohqsg
the other twin and the mother js absorbs the twin,btohqsg
Basically the other twin is js too weak and dies ah,btohqsg
the body has to get rid of the deadbody somehow and it gets reabsorbed,btohqsg
Last man standing game kinda exists for baby sharks,btohqsg
iirc when the twin is absorbed it js stops developing,btohqsg
depends on your definition of die,btohqsg
"they start ""eating"" each other in their mother's womb",btohqsg
it cant even survive on its own,btohqsg
so i dont consider it to have lived then,btohqsg
you're jealous cause u ain't me,btohqsg
WTF IS A CRABS CYCLE üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
Kinda dies first before being reabsorbed tho,btohqsg
but i wouldn't have considered it to have died,btohqsg
but if you wanna use the term die = stopped developing then yea igs,btohqsg
RACIST  CAUSE I INDO IS IT!,btohqsg

I dont really have a good shot because i was pretty far,btohqsg

Unless it is very very big,btohqsg
ALL ELITE SCHS MUST BE ELITSIT,btohqsg
This is why bmtc sch 4 is the most elitist,btohqsg
I was complaining to my mum about stuff,btohqsg
The only way to survive is being an elitist yourselfüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
My mum is a lowkey elitist,btohqsg
Coz she only brag to her own children lol,btohqsg
Is there even a difference between elite and elitist,btohqsg
It depends on the students and it would to generalized if we say elite sch students are all elitist,btohqsg
There are some that really are üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
This is my warm up for my gp lesson tmr,btohqsg
there will always be someone even more elite,btohqsg
Worse thing is tmr qn is on translation,btohqsg
So im confirm gonna see elitism appear somewhr,btohqsg
"""There's always a little girl somewhere in China who can lift more than you""",btohqsg
To build a democratic society based on justice and equality,btohqsg
I also feel people dk what meritocracy is abt,btohqsg
Think there is always elitist everywhere,btohqsg
How to get motivation to study,btohqsg
Hence we gotta subjugate em and beat down that talent. Have em work in sweatshops,btohqsg
My mum told me the only way out of this is become an elitist,btohqsg
But idk how does that solve any problem,btohqsg
It is idk against my own personality,btohqsg
but no effort confirm no result,btohqsg
Then she was like ‚Äòthen dont complain  the world is full of elitist‚Äô,btohqsg
ever realised the reverse of diam is also a word?,btohqsg
Aint that the lifestyle they been brought up? I mean can we fault them for thinking this way?,btohqsg
and the four letters of diam  was used to teach kinetic particle theory,btohqsg
Idk about the past but actually tbh,btohqsg
My father always told me that it's not the parents fault nor the child if the child don't want to put in hardwork.You can't fault either because it's life. Some people are born to be hardworking  some are born to be lazier,btohqsg
Her elitism actually motivated me and was the reason why i managed to excel in As,btohqsg
What is ur understanding of elitist,btohqsg
Though once i literaly got fedup and was like ‚ÄòA level i will beat u‚Äô tho i know it aint happening,btohqsg
Like looking down on those below them + bragging their idk higher status on those not as intelligent,btohqsg
and why is being elitist = be succesful,btohqsg
But tbh most elitist do end up successful (but not all),btohqsg
what do you understand by elite and what do you understand by elitist,btohqsg
quarks and leptons more interesting to read,btohqsg
why isit u assume everyone who goes elite sch = they are elitist,btohqsg
They grew up in a environment that pushed the elitist rhetoric so much they could not accept their future legacy to not be one..that's why,btohqsg
well life have its own ways,btohqsg
Bruh this is some Sky Castle shit,btohqsg
I see my interactions w them,btohqsg
pre 2017 it was thispost 2017 it isn't,btohqsg
They believed so much that being a elitist meant you were always going to find competition. Competition that could be used to motivate or push you to work hsrder,btohqsg
Some are really a headache to be working w,btohqsg
quarks and leptons are easier to understand as fundamental particles,btohqsg
they like to suka suka change,btohqsg
You can't change mindsets  that I what I've learnt after being brought up in Singapore and the online world,btohqsg
I feel like u are just making up words at this point in a sesquipedalian puddle of gobbledygook.,btohqsg
No matter how hard you try  you will never change mindsets. You can only force actions which in scenarios forces mindsets to change,btohqsg
That's the only way to effectively change mindsets,btohqsg
I just read them to teach lol,btohqsg
Very real! Just needa accept it nd figure a way out,btohqsg
I suspecting they may bring to H2 Physics soon,btohqsg
For bio the bane of our existence is idiots who name their discoveries after themselves,btohqsg
No you dont figure anything out because at the end of the day. You don't have any more say than them,btohqsg
As in u need to somehow find a way to blend in and work well w them,btohqsg
For someone to be forced into a mindset change  that someone must believe they are being forced on by a authority figure that is better than them,btohqsg
Cant be u sulk and then idk what,btohqsg
Brownian was a biologist who somehow got his name into Physics,btohqsg
No point because blending or working with them only builds onto their mindset. Best is to ignore and let them live their life on their own terms,btohqsg
Ah this one is a pickle  technically science wasn't rlly a thing tbh,btohqsg
But in the working world  we always need to work in teams  we cant just ignore them,btohqsg
So we just need to figure something out,btohqsg
U can find Decartes and he will give you a headache,btohqsg
This is vaguely in my memory,btohqsg
it refers to brown stuff moving in the toilets,btohqsg
If they have a elitist mindset and work in a team. More often than not because of their mindsets  you can force them to potray their elitism in their work. The moment it happens  I don't think bosses take kindly to that,btohqsg
Neh my physics memory not that bad to believe tht,btohqsg
Unless I'm not accustomed to the working world but openly showing you are a elitist is never going to help you,btohqsg
The chance of your boss being a elitist is extremely high and I'm very certain a elitist person that talks down on you would not want you to do well in any compacity,btohqsg
Idk if some are like showing double personality,btohqsg
My grandmother can run faster than you,btohqsg
"she just thinks anyone who goes to an ""elite"" sch would naturally be elitist",btohqsg
I meant that is what I see as an elite school,btohqsg
"u responded to this with""In my definition  schs with IP/IB""",btohqsg
The floor is made of floor,btohqsg
IDK U SAID UR SCH IS THE REAL ELITIST,btohqsg
Its your word against your own,btohqsg
The thought I'm having is that a elitist will always wind up over performing because they constantly want to feed their ego they are better. This in turns them on the spotlight and becomes the target for every more higher up elitist in a company. It's a good chain system no?,btohqsg
Kuro do u think u have an elite background?,btohqsg
Theres people who are elitistthey think that they are the best so they dont try,btohqsg
Doesn't that just make u a civil servant?,btohqsg
(rgs girls who say im not qualified to teach GP cuz im not from RJC),btohqsg
In my parents definition  only their schools are the elite schools,btohqsg
Kuro u come from BME NP bro,btohqsg
because I'm too lazy to go work in corporate,btohqsg
And previously from JC one siol,btohqsg
And they are real elitist coz i think they more invested in my bro‚Äôs jc coz his sch more elite than mine,btohqsg
my sister thinks shes doing well but shes not,btohqsg
But bosses only look at two things  their competitors or those that don't try...so either way to a elitist boss  both are going to falter.If you are a elitist and try to size up to bosses  you will become a targetIf you don't try hard enough  the bosses will also target your incompetency,btohqsg
Wiat no she thinks that shes doing better than me,btohqsg
Entrepreneurs aren't failures in any ways even societal views it as sucess lmao,btohqsg
not entrepreneurJust lazing around all day,btohqsg
because she says that shes from RI so anytime she doesnt do well for papers it would always be better than me getting an A in EJ cuz RI papers will always be harder than EJ papers,btohqsg
But to be fair  different people have different expectations,btohqsg
Elitist can also be lazy what,btohqsg
So LITERALLY she thinks in ALL circumstances she is better than me,btohqsg
In fact a lot of em are lazy cuz they smart what,btohqsg
see if she gets 8 distinctions also then we talkoh wait she nvr even get A1 for HCL,btohqsg
laziness is the correct way of life,btohqsg
she used that excuse on me,btohqsg
Both scenarios of someone overperforming and underperforming puts you in the spotlight to become a target for enlitist bosses.Both overperforming and underperforming just also so happens to be traits of a elitist,btohqsg
RGS papers harder than CHS paeprs,btohqsg
So for example if YT retakes A Levels again  puts in even more effort  but his results do not improve  he has reached his actual potential?,btohqsg
is worse than her 80% for amath,btohqsg
I actually did RI chem and phy paper and it was q easy,btohqsg
thats why i say my sis is elitist,btohqsg
That's my base take on elitist people  seem like a close and shut case to me,btohqsg
because she is from RI she thinks she better than everyone,btohqsg
Bro I am too tired and too old for this shit.,btohqsg
RI prelim papers are not that toughmakes it easier for students to apply scholarships,btohqsg
when she hasnt proven herself yet,btohqsg
Yea wait for her real results that are actually more comprable,btohqsg
that's why just be lazy mah,btohqsg
Lmao a lot of ppl they sick of that just go into academia,btohqsg
seriously why you guys comparing the school notes. I seen so many sch stuff for Maths and physics over so many years,btohqsg
Assuming they can write and think la,btohqsg
Ok my mum didnt stay on RI coz she dw meet same people but if she did  she would well be thinking the same,btohqsg
i feel its just the RI brand only,btohqsg
She wants us go RI but none of us made it,btohqsg
if she doesnt go overseas uni,btohqsg
she will just not go uni at all,btohqsg
cuz local unis are beneath her,btohqsg
she literally told my parents that,btohqsg
She wan the overseas scholarships lmao,btohqsg
my fam is considered middle-upper tbf,btohqsg
Huh then what she want do w A level cert,btohqsg
