@Ryannnnnnnnnnthe natural selection jokes in sgfollowsall chat is way too good,btohqsg
you should teach us your ways,btohqsg
how the hell do you find such good stuff,btohqsg
@LonelyreaHELP READ THE RP CHAT LOL,btohqsg
My chem cher will not start until there is silence,btohqsg
Sometimes gotta learn to tune it out,btohqsg
I straight up just go and do other work if Cher haven't start yapping,btohqsg
But not when the teacher is already present,btohqsg
That's what I did for chem,btohqsg
There was literally no value my chem cher could add to my lesson that would make me want to stay in class,btohqsg
I was like 4 tutorials ahead or smth (tbf this is just ejc things),btohqsg
The lecture-tutorial pace was so bad,btohqsg
We finished covering the whole chem syllabus by j2 term 1,btohqsg
But tutorial wise we just started on alkenes,btohqsg
My class tutorials is damn fucking behind,btohqsg
Cuz we did one chem chapter per week,btohqsg
Most shld be doing nitrogen compound alrd,btohqsg
Pon every chem lesson that isn't practical,btohqsg
My class still at fucking carboxylic acid,btohqsg
Cher check tutorials go thru so slow,btohqsg
So just decided to take a break,btohqsg
And the worse part is organic chem can literally be simplified into two big areas,btohqsg
I used the time to go try memo the reactions sia,btohqsg
I dun think i had any subjects that are particularly slow,btohqsg
U don't get to play with chemicals tho,btohqsg
And I got a chemical burn,btohqsg
Maybe needa find a cause of thisâ€¦,btohqsg
Please dun drink chemicals in the lab,btohqsg
There is also a reason why normal water is not to be brought in,btohqsg
But that can be a good sign in a sense that the cher is not forcing things,btohqsg
And adapting to the class pace,btohqsg
Speaking of which i was pleasantly shooked when i got to sit in the HOD class after prelims when classes combine,btohqsg
I feel like I have two feelings: sleepy and high,btohqsg
I don't really have a healthy in between,btohqsg
I am in a bad position to say this coz i too procrastinated seeking help until it became really really bad  but i think u should speak to someone,btohqsg
my parents will just say I'm not eating/sleeping enough,btohqsg
cause after this lecture I have 2h free period,btohqsg
then I want to go outside to buy stuff,btohqsg
It is always easy for them to say these  but ur health (including mental health)  is urs and very important,btohqsg
And it feels like it is going to affect ur acads too,btohqsg
(If u trust ur school counsellor) maybe that can be a starting point,btohqsg
Else there are also ample external sources,btohqsg
Wah ur breaks are really long,btohqsg
Like ur parents are not qualified to talk u out of this,btohqsg
