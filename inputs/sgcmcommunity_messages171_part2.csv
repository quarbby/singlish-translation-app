Proceed claim your insurance  the insurance should chase his insurance then he Jialut,btohqsg
Gotta be careful cos you may end up using your own insurance to pay for the repairs. If he refuse to report to his insurance company  you may have to bring him to court,btohqsg
gee wonder what GIA is doing when ppl is providing video evidence..,btohqsg
Make the report but donâ€™t send for repair until both insurance settles,btohqsg
"In the event of one party choosing to make claims  insurance companies then do the necessary investigations to establish liability when deciding whether to penalise the insured motorist.""In cases of late or no reports  the insured motorist scores an own goal "" Mr Ho said. ""The practical option is for claimants to make a claim against their own comprehensive motor insurance policies. They benefit from having their vehicle repaired quickly and leave it to their insurer to take on the effort of resolving the liability with the other party.""If the claimant's insurer considers that its insured driver is not at fault in the accident  his annual premium should not be affected just because he reported an accident.""",btohqsg
Actually not lol its likely a misunderstanding  going by what you said later.,btohqsg
Is he paying for the repairs if you repair at his ws?,btohqsg
Yes  the most important part is you make a report with your own insurance company within 24hrs,btohqsg
If he is paying for the repairs provided it's done at his ws  then he is actually going for pte settlement and you have to make sure he is paying  by confirming with his ws. Just that he might be guarding against you jacking up the costs if you repair at your own ws  and he trusts his own. To him  by refusing to repair at his ws  you are the one refusing pte settlement.,btohqsg
Claim for accident is not just repair cost,btohqsg
When i get hit before  my ws suggested me $100 per day of downtime add on to repair cost  accounted in invoice,btohqsg
I see  if he's willing to compensate for loss of use then actually can consider but if he's not willing to  then claim insurance le,btohqsg
Just claim him can Liao settle . Dun need to bother about other things,btohqsg
