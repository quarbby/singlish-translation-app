Five things to take note of before heading over to JB this weekend - CNAhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/what-changed-johor-bahru-covid-19-travellers-2614091,btohqsg
Where got worth it? First weekend hit 7 orders  won't get $50 voucher  only next weekends hit 7 orders then get $50 voucher. In total  you need to do at least14 orders to get $50 voucher.,btohqsg
It's 7 orders per day for fri-sun then can get,btohqsg
If any of the 3 days u don't do 7 bike order u won't get,btohqsg
They won't attract pple do all the bike orders lah  cos more bike orders mah,btohqsg
So that low price pple also take just to complete the incentive,btohqsg
grabpandaroo incentives and surges all concentrated on weekend. dont think the $50 petrol voucher can compete  7 llm orders will definitely block out the lunch/dinner peak hours.,btohqsg
All llm incentive is not high 1 lah,btohqsg
I just do usual job. If hit mission or incentive then take,btohqsg
Won't purposely take low price etc just to hit. Not very worth it now that petrol more n more expensive,btohqsg
But that's my own opinion lah,btohqsg
Have u all ever sent wrong food order b4,btohqsg
Missing food item yes...but not wrong food order,btohqsg
What happen then ? Kenna ban ?,btohqsg
No order chit no description....i don't even know wat food they ordered ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Just go back and resend the right one....luckily nearby...no complaints were made.,btohqsg
Good day all. Check with you guys  the latest jobs donâ€™t provide any description upfront yes? Or is it just me?,btohqsg
Unless we scroll to accept the job. ... it donâ€™t happened previously.,btohqsg
Like this must add extra stop charge and also distance fare. N if restaurant in cbd n u out of cbd have to add extra cbd chargw,btohqsg
I kena b4  told resto got extra charge they say ok. Then live chat Cs tell them to add accordingly,btohqsg
