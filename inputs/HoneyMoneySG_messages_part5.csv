Bear in mind uob one is one of the trickiest card to use because of the spend tracking effort. But high effort high rewards!,btohqsg
Chris  are you using UOB one?,btohqsg
Yes  I am. One of my earliest credit card videos toohttps://youtu.be/16FDXulNF9Y,btohqsg

Question why would 1 have so many credit card.. how to pay all annual fees or meet all min monthly expenses?,btohqsg
Mostly for signup bonuses.Don't pay annual fees  just waiveOwn it but dont have to spend on it until necessary,btohqsg
Then at the end of the free waiver year? We cancel it?,btohqsg
Request to waive again if you need.Cancel if you don't need. Fees are pre-charged so when you cancel the card  the charges go away too,btohqsg
I thought of this.. but it will not help with my credit score.. might get bad credit score because of cancelling cards,btohqsg
Does not matter permanently. It will only impact temporarily. Don't have to place so much emphasis on credit score unlike in the US,btohqsg
Oh  I thought it's a also a huge deal here.. like for house or car.. it just means we can get a bigger loan? Or I'm understanding it wrong?,btohqsg
I believe in singapore the only loan we should get is the Housing loan for the low interest rates.And if we're living within our means  then the loan quantum should not have a huge impact to our finances.,btohqsg
Therefore that only applies for Bank housing loan.. not HDB loan.. right?,btohqsg
If siblings join together to buy a flat(HDB) for rental. Is that possible? Or there are many red tapes for this such as the MOP or 1 door lock rule?,btohqsg
The t&cs are complicated but the short answer is No for rental. Hdb is primarily for own stay and not for profit.Applicable schemes for siblings are Orphan scheme and Joint singles scheme,btohqsg
Hi guys  any questions or feedback for recent videos will be welcomed! Trying to be more active here to engage my community!üëç,btohqsg
Or even new video ideas related to my niche,btohqsg
I would like to learn how to manage a lot of credit cardsüòè,btohqsg
or maybe some advice on how many credit cards to have,btohqsg
üòÇ recent videos on CPF and HDB really have little to do with foreigners like me,btohqsg
How about taking loans to invest into the right tools.. and how to pay back the loans.. üòÑ,btohqsg
i would like a run through of IBKR platform and perhaps sharing of your portfolio there or ETFs/stocks that are interesting to invest in üòä,btohqsg
is that really legitimate in Singaporeü§î,btohqsg
This is quite subjective to individual though.I like to separate to active vs passive cardsActive: day to day use (we are limited to how much money we could spend)Passive: signup bonus only  12 mths later a new customer.,btohqsg
Understand. But these are priority issues where young singaporeans lack awareness of. So yeah  i need to address that market.,btohqsg
Yes  will be doing a in depth broker series on how to use them like a pro,btohqsg
cool  I only know how to buy & sellü§£,btohqsg
I'm not a loan person to be honest and my exposure is so minimal so that may not be the right time yet,btohqsg
alright! i'm using IBKR now  its okay but gosh the interface sucks! will be interesting to see what your opinion is on actively managed ETFs like ARKK! perhaps you could share more over a video.,btohqsg
Sometimes all we need in a broker are very simple priorities:1) how to buy/sell2) how to check whether order placed/order history3) how to deposit/withdrawThe rest are good to have features,btohqsg
If u could also  compare USA financial advice(everywhere on tiktok) vs Singapore financial systems,btohqsg
Chris  thanks for the DBS Taka credit card intro. Just to confirm this is applicable for existing posb and dbs account holders? Kindly advise.,btohqsg
I just found things in Takashimaya so expensiveüòÇ,btohqsg
Hey Chris and guys  not sure if it would be relevant but below topics can help:‚ÅÉInsurance (Buy or not to buy  what types  coverage  which provider)‚ÅÉBudgeting (healthy % allocation for expenses  wants  savings etc for different ppl at different stages of life)‚ÅÉFurther studies or career transition for working adults (skillsfuture  work study programme  professional conversion programme  is studying part-time masters worth it etc)‚ÅÉCrypto? (Though I know previously you have mentioned you are not yet ready to touch on this topic but i feel there is not much information in terms from Singapore context yet),btohqsg
To add  how to understand technical charts as a layman,btohqsg
Thanks Xin Yi  all these are good topics and I have noted of them. For those that are not my expertise  i will take some time and learn about them and then share my learning to provide a layman/beginner opinion,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I came across this investment platform (loan your money to start ups or SME) that says returns can be up to 24% in a year. Would you be able to share more about this?https://smartfunding.sg/investors/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=reach&utm_content=site-keywords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpreJBhDvARIsAF1_BU2wX_lvaltpI7VoVVGdk2piKNFa-kBW8HV7UdjBL3xmuxZrrvGeYsYaAgKdEALw_wcB,btohqsg
I really doubt this  even without looking into it. Just the basic logic  if it's easy and safe for  these start-ups to make 24% profit yearly  then they have no need to borrow money from retail investors,btohqsg
this looks a bit like P2P lending in China years ago  which eventually turned out to be a disaster for investors,btohqsg
chris  can check for signing up revolut  what do i need to provide. can just use singpass only or still need to upload cetain doc?,btohqsg
Your analysis is in place  I agree with your point of view,btohqsg
Usually for such P2P loan business  is high risk high return. I won't go for it but if I do  just go for more established ones like Funding Societies where there are lots of reviews on the internet.Also this is no different from lending money to your friend. Only lend out how much you are willing to lose,btohqsg
It's been a long time since I started revolut (2019 maybe). Let me click on my own link and check,btohqsg
How much money did you make?,btohqsg
$10 every month from 20% transport cashback,btohqsg
No singpass from what i see,btohqsg
meaning need to upload some doc to establish identity?,btohqsg
