hello  iPayMy sent an email saying that Visa cards will not earn miles from making mortgage and loan payments.What Mastercard miles card is good for this?,btohqsg
ok that one only 1.4 miles per dollar spent..,btohqsg
my current OCBC voyage is 1.6 miles which i use on ipaymy for mortgage repayments. is there a better Mastercard for miles?,btohqsg
Are you using those 1.5/1.6 mpd cards,btohqsg
No other Mastercard has higher earn rate that works with loan payment. Unfortunately.,btohqsg
ok roger that  thanks so much for the advice Anthony,btohqsg
"welp  so the ""for now"" message didn't last too long for ipaymy",btohqsg
Means master card also cannot ? Loan n education are totally not allowed regardless of what cards are used?,btohqsg
It only says visa and unionpay cards. Master is ok. For now.,btohqsg
I've been using iPayMy mortgage to clock my min spend for BOC Family VISA in order to enjoy 10% cashback for dining. Guess this card is useless now.,btohqsg
This will make lots of visa cards' value proposition drop. 😅,btohqsg

Can I take it to mean my scheduled payments in November would still be accepted? Only those scheduled payments in December and beyond would no longer be processed?,btohqsg

Anyone has issue tallying hsbc ega 1% cashback?  It seems that they gave one weird sum a while ago and now nv give anything anymore..,btohqsg
It can take up to 14 day to credit the 1 percent giro cashback,btohqsg
It’s damn hard unless you do your own excel.And they admit they might miss out or calculate wrongly too.Was told to inform them and they will credit next day.Happened to my wife..Jialat mans….,btohqsg
Icic.. I just find it weird cos there is no credit after 11 oct.. and I've been using my cc quite often and there are 2 big sum giro payments..,btohqsg
Hey guys the current 5mpd by dbs altitude  can I usetrip.com? Because they gave examples likebooking.comExpedia but never writetrip.comso I am worried it won't be counted.,btohqsg
Like to check anyone experience requesting Citibank to change their rewards visa to Mastercard. Was told they need to review my request and sent me invite email when approved. Is the waiting period long? Wanted to change to pair with amaze but now have to wait,btohqsg
Can. Got 5mpd for all mytrip.combookings in Sep.,btohqsg
You can just apply for Mastercard version and keep visa one :)Use one with amaze for offline and the other one for online,btohqsg
That is good idea. I was wondering why they need to review and I need to wait for  invite email.,btohqsg
With Citibank rewards excluding travel related expense  I was thinking to use Citibank premier. It may not have the best miles per dollar. At least they got the other perks like 2 lounge accesses. I tot of Citibank prestige but the high annual fee is consideration.,btohqsg
One sec. Lemme get the sales pitch from madam Mt 😝,btohqsg
Btw  cuz pts in Citi don't pool  have u considered something like HSBC t1?,btohqsg
elo guys  im still contemplating CSPX or SPYL 😭 im confused about the fees on the brokers  is complicated 😭 If I'm investing only around $200 per month for these ETFs  which one is better 😭 Do I still do it every month? quarterly?,btohqsg
Perhaps you can join uob?Lady soli - travel diningPrvi - ntb bonus + 4 loungePpv - any terminal with beepVs - fcyPoints pool too,btohqsg
May I ask does travel related expense that are excluded by Citi rewards include those tag to Amaze cards for overseas usage?,btohqsg
Yes. As long as mcc travel  all are excluded.,btohqsg
Oh so any other recommended cards to pair with Amaze as uob also stop issuing rewards for their cards,btohqsg
Can I cfm as long as we have acc in paylah and we book through heymax  we should get it right?,btohqsg
"Did you usetrip.comvia ""shop with max""?If yes  it worked.",btohqsg
Why did ipaymy do the same thing thou?,btohqsg
