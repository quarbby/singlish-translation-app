My apologies  guys  the story of the radicalised 16 year old still lingers in my mind.,btohqsg

Al Jazeera English: Singapore teenager arrested for plotting attack on Muslims.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/27/singapore-arrests-teenager-for-plotting-attacks-against-muslims,btohqsg
I wish it was fake news but nope.,btohqsg
where they even get all the money and resources to plan the attack one,btohqsg
He was trying to livestream it like the actual attack.,btohqsg
I still have sleepless nights after that revelation.,btohqsg

im just p much lost in my studies anyways,btohqsg
It's not rly that fun when u self study :'),btohqsg
And don't forget U nid pay for Ur own exam fees,btohqsg

I like to say my school has a lot of retards but itâ€™s still bearable and eve enjoyable,btohqsg
Ah that's not as bad as mine :>,btohqsg
btw did anyone here take that?,btohqsg
kinda wna know if it's worth a shot for uni,btohqsg
havent heard of anyone that done that but am thinking of taking h2 math as priv candidate,btohqsg
I know of one that done that in this grp,btohqsg

You need to take it with 2 other H2s and GP if u want to use it to go to uni  by the way,btohqsg
only reason i may take it is to support for my crypto,btohqsg
to boast to others that they get As for 11 years straight,btohqsg
