I recall HSBC does also levy the 1%. If you‚Äôre using the Citi Rewards card  I recommend charging through Amaze for the same SGD amount but processed in SG to avoid the 1%.,btohqsg
Gosh... how do we know if a purchase will have such fee? I'm using smrt card.,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt know  Citi can‚Äôt tell you either until after the transaction is completed. Just assume buying from any foreign site would likely attract that 1% fee.I‚Äôve heard some Cruise bookings are processed overseas too. Apple iTunes/AppStore certainly does.,btohqsg
It is an sg website with .sg and charge in sgd. Really surprised,btohqsg
DBS charges this fee as well,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs difficult to say sometimes. Like newegg and iherb have sg websites too  but I think their payment processor is not in sg.,btohqsg
Anyone know if samsung sg website will incur? üòÇ,btohqsg
i applied DBS live fresh card. but realised not as worth as HABC Revolution card.. what are your opinions?also what other cards you recommend according to these:my spending habits are usually around- Transport MRT/Bus- groceries- Online spending / mobile contactless,btohqsg
I use my UOB One for transport  utilities  and other purchases to make up the min 500 spend.Then miles cards for the rest,btohqsg
Does Insurance premium contribute to the min 500,btohqsg
How do I interpret this. Is insurance premium recurring on CC counted in the UOB One Account min 500 category.,btohqsg
Is point 2/3/4 the exclusions as mentioned in point 1 ? But point 3/4 doesn't sounds like exclusion to me.I am reading as point 1/2/3/4 are what contributed to eligible card transactions.,btohqsg
I used to use Live Fresh card as well. Changed to DBS Women's World and HSBC RevolutionOnline spending: DBS Women's World cardMobile Contactless/Groceries: I use HSBC Revolution card now.,btohqsg
insurance payment is eligible to uob one account bonus interest but not the uob one card quarterly rebate,btohqsg

I m using OCBC 360 account. I created a saving goal in it where certain amount are taken from my main account every month. I want to ask whether the amount withdrawn into this saving goal is still being counted together with my main account for the overall OCBC 360 interest calculation?,btohqsg

Wanted to share a fraudulent attempt this morning which happened to my hsbc card. 7am - received a potential threat via sms by HSBC bank asking me to confirm the threat. 8am I blocked my card and 8.30am there was an sms saying 2 failed attempts of charging from Uber Canada. In the end I call up hsbc and they said yes the sms warning was indeed detected. Now they will replace my card since it has been compromised  so for the ppl who received such sms do quickly block the card to prevent such fraudulent transactions.,btohqsg
Does using UOB One card to topup Grabpay wallet  count towards the1. 500 spending for UOB One account for interest rate benefit  or2. the 3.33% quarterly rolled up spending rebate?,btohqsg
I see these days SingSaver/MoneySmart promo require u to hold onto the CC for 12 months  else they can withdraw the gift‚Ä¶.has anyone tried cancelling their Citi CC within 12 months? Any repercussions?,btohqsg
i was lucky to get 3 year fee waiver for Citi cash back + card,btohqsg
I just wanna cancel  to reset the clock for rewards next time xD but afraid if i cancel within 12 months  they may reject next time (cause of that TnC),btohqsg
yes  will reject cancel between month 0 to 12  13th month allowed to cancel. But risk annual fee being billed to your statement.,btohqsg
i was lucky to get 3 year fee waiver  so no fee on my 13th month statement. I went ahead to cancel. So the 12 month period waiting starts until i become new customer again next year 2024,btohqsg

ü§îü§îü§î Did you store your credit card details using password manager?,btohqsg
What password manager you are referring to? üòä,btohqsg
Why a password manager though when it can be any other platforms,btohqsg
https://cybernews.com/best-password-managers/how-do-password-managers-work/This article provides good background reading info. As this topic may not be related to the forum topic  may be the folks wanna consider discuss this at a more appropriate forum. üòä,btohqsg
Interesting read  I do use 1Password myself and store some of my cards there  but I  don't think CVV is often stored [and hopefully the case for other PM?] and thus  quite unlikelyBtw  LastPass is notorious for a few major security incidents last year.And yes off topic but... not sure if there's an appropriate forum for it üòÇ,btohqsg
I personally appreciate the sharing. Thanks.,btohqsg
CIMB Visa Signature: hi. I applied for this card recently via MoneySmart. Upon completing qualifying spend of s$988  will be able to receive sign up gift of s$280.do you have any idea if spending in retail shop in Japan using this card is considered qualifying spend?Thank you :),btohqsg
"When comes to fraudulent attempts  I honestly think the highest 2 likeliness is strip/RFID skimming (usually overseas) or storing of CC details on ""not as reputable"" online shopping sites (not saying that reputable sites are invulnerable  but it comes down to risk).To reduce the likelihood of skimming  would suggest to switch to contactless pay on smartphone/watch (if possible)  or use cards like YouTrip  etc to limit the amount of money they steal.For online shopping sites  don't save the CC details on the site and opt to key in every time. Additionally  use a password manager to fill the data  which also protects you against keyloggers. The likelihood of your data on a password manager being compromised is lower than on non reputable sites. If can  use more reputable sites  don't because cheaper on a certain site then risk getting your CC details stolen.Also some good cyber hygiene tips:1. Have different passwords on all sites2. Use a password manager instead of keying in passwords3. ALWAYS have 2FA. Most sites offer SMS OTP  but opt for TOTP if choice is given.4. Don't click on any links or open any attachments that you THINK is safe. Only open if you KNOW is safe.",btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn üëçüëç for explaining the Cyber Hygiene tips. The choice of  tools is essential. To achieve security benefits  the people who use the tools need to use them properly. Otherwise  it is as good as not using them or may be even worse than not having the tools :),btohqsg
To be Frank my hsbc was not use overseas and for  Uber wise I was using YouTrip back in 2019 when I was in USA.. considering various app I key in the Cc numbers it be hard to determine where the data leak happened also.,btohqsg
Was lucky that I blocked the card earlier than the transaction‚Ä¶ thanks for the sharing guys. The quality here is improving üòánot just which card for flights etc.,btohqsg
"Any one received SMS from AMEX SG (official AMEX sms line) this morning  as below:""AMEX: As your total unsecured interest-bearing balance from all banks in SG exceeded 12X your monthly income for 3 consecutive months  your Card(s) has been temporarily suspended. Please call68801500for more information or to update your income.""I tried to call AMEX SG numbers and all busy. It seems they have issues. Because I can still use my AMEX card and the mentioned sms is also not true.",btohqsg
I called Amex apparently was their system wrong sent out,btohqsg
Last night i applied DBS yuu and get approved. So i thought that sms is because I applied to.many credit cards.. Haha,btohqsg
Anyone can help if how come i try to use singpass to verify bigpay  got error one? Anyone got issue?,btohqsg
i got the same sms too,btohqsg
perhaps their system got hacked?The hotline is also engagedü•≤,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. I would keep mine brief mindful that this topic seems to be different from this channel. I have a similar experience that my Frank card was used abroad for buying Europe train tixs.Long story short  the more we use our card the higher likelihood of fraudulent transactions because of the increased exposure. We can only do what we can.Tips shared by Melvyn are super¬†useful. I practise them myself but we all make mistakes as human. All it takes is a threat actor to compromise from the weakest link.As self-care  our 'respond and recovery' when fraudulent transactions are detected by us or informed by us by FIs help us not to panic  stay cool and leveled as we deal with the aftermath.,btohqsg
