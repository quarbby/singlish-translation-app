But if you not selling house  don't pay also ok. Just that when you sold  the proceeds will first go to paying accrued interest,btohqsg
What if vc to refund housing sum  no interest on the balance accrued interest?,btohqsg
Yup. Don't sell then is ok,btohqsg
"Can't just use OA ""for free"" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",btohqsg
Iâ€™m hoping it can let us set a percentage of distribution to various etf in a profile and we just need to click buy and itâ€™ll split whatever amount we buy amongst the etf.,btohqsg
Good suggestion  something like what Robinhood can do. This would be a good feature that is unique in Singapore,btohqsg
Housing loan = Principal + Interest + Accrued Interest. If refund only principal + interest  accrued interest will still go on. Accrued interest will only stop after the full amount is re-paid,btohqsg
If full amount repaid  there is no more compound interest on the balance accrued interest?,btohqsg
Some people do leave $1 inside just to standby if they require CPF OA to be used again in the event of retrench and need more cash on hand or other purpose.If you cleared all finish and in if the above situation strikes. I think u will need to redo with the lawyer to activate OA for monthly deduction.,btohqsg

Anyone using cardup   worthing to use to pay rent or fees etc ?,btohqsg
I use it for my prudential insurance monthly premium,btohqsg
Insurance premium does not count towards your monthly spendings,btohqsg
It uses diff mcc when you use cardup,btohqsg
Have been getting my quarterly rebates,btohqsg
But ofc you pay cardup abt 2.6% fee,btohqsg
If self contribute to cpf sa can earn tax relief?,btohqsg
Should watch my video tonight. Talking about cpf,btohqsg
If sa reach certain amount  still can self contribute? Or still can ?,btohqsg
Then how is it worth after rebate,btohqsg
If your premium around 500 or 1000  then is about 0.8% cashback  if its 2000  then its about 2.47%,btohqsg
Sadly my premium is only 200  so I need to spend 300 more per month on the one card.,btohqsg
cool  can consider using CRO then wiht 3% cashback,btohqsg
Qn. FRS increases yearly. If I reach FRS in SA by end 2021  can I still contribute $8k and enjoy the tax relief in 2022  given that the CPF contributions will sure exceed the new FRS in 2022.Or your window will open every Jan when the new FRS is increased and that is the opportunity to top up?,btohqsg
No opportunity. The interest credited will hit next year FRS anyway,btohqsg
The interest rates shld still be count as normal right? I means every month interest credited to Yr cpf account? But sure not of opportunity if u find better investment opportunities elsewhere. Opportunity cost,btohqsg
If did not find opportunity. And have free cash laying around. Might as well get the addition interest rates. Just my 2 cent.,btohqsg
This year topup is still 7k to get tax relief?,btohqsg
Sa can use for buying stocks?,btohqsg
I will join this voice chat tomorrow with Boon Tee. Feel free to join in,btohqsg
Interest is calculated monthly but only credited once during year end,btohqsg
The FRS amount is the based on the current amount for the year or the calculated amount once you reach the retirement age?,btohqsg
Will keep increasing until you reach 55,btohqsg
So need to top-up yearly to match it,btohqsg
Once you reach frs  the interest earned (4%) will cover the annual FRS increase (3%),btohqsg
Frs is total from the 3 accounts?,btohqsg
Oh  when 55  all 3 account amount will transfer to ra?,btohqsg
Will transfer from SA first then fr OA.,btohqsg
So both sa n oa amount add up n transfer to ra?,btohqsg
Take from SA first  if SA not enough then take from OA,btohqsg
This is why CPF shielding is needed  to move the SA out first so RA can be formed by taking out from OA,btohqsg
So after ra is created  can still use cash to topup sa?,btohqsg
After age 55. You can only top up RA,btohqsg
Still can do VCA to the 3 accounts.,btohqsg
So is can or not? Lol,btohqsg
Yes  but only tax reliefs for SEP for VC3A,btohqsg
No dirrct top up to SA. Only indirect top up via VC3A by percentage allocation,btohqsg
Self employed person. You need to watch my cpf videos.,btohqsg
Oh i tot sep is September. Lol,btohqsg
So we can still cash topup sa after 55 to earn 4pc interest,btohqsg
