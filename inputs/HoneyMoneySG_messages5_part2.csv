Hi just curious how you all track ur portfolio.,btohqsg
I'm using Beancount  both for personal accounting and investment portfolio,btohqsg
But I guess it's only for people as nerdy as me as it's text-based ü§£,btohqsg
I see ppl use Excel all,btohqsg
Yahoo financeDelta app looks cool to track also.,btohqsg
Just the amount plus minus abit,btohqsg
I‚Äôm starting with my credit card benefits/cash back. Just to decide which credit card to get and use for what,btohqsg
Can UOB absolute card top-up nets flashpay card and get 1.7% csshback?,btohqsg

Yup  planning to go with Crypto and Revolut to see how. But most likely will leave Revolut card at home or to bring overseas,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt go overseas. Only if my friends jio me to go msia.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm quite a boring person  so they usually won‚Äôt call me unless they are lacking of people,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGbtw how important is having Live Stock Market Quotes in your choice brokerage?,btohqsg
as a Trader  i thought having live stock information is critical?so if no Live feeds available  how much time delay are we usually working with on Trading Platforms that don't offer Live Stock Market Quotes?,btohqsg
i understand that only TB offers Real-Time stock data  despite the higher fees and lack of fractional (correct me if im wrong)than IBKR,btohqsg
Happy new year all  just saw UOB T&C started to exclude ‚Äúamaze transit‚Äù mcc code already from March 2022‚Ä¶ so do make your own adjustment,btohqsg
I think most have live if u funded the account.,btohqsg
U ask the broker. Every broker different,btohqsg
And of course live is needed. Let's say u want to buy apple. 10. 00:00pm is $170.10. But your quotes is delayed. So u either going to buy it at higher bid price  fill at market price. If the spread is massive at that moment of time. Good luck.,btohqsg
Not sure why u want to save a few dollar per mth to make yrself risk more money. Unless u are the type of investor  buy and hold the rest of Yr life. Then live quotes is not necessary after buying.,btohqsg
only tonight i actually started looking more in depth into the Trading Platformsrealised that Live Data wasn't a given.,btohqsg
It is important but no need to be in your main brokerage,btohqsg
Thats why you can sign up tiger/moomoo to get live prices and 1 free AAPL stock,btohqsg
i guess its v accustomed to have some competitor's desktop trading app (which ig is TB?) to see live prices and then toggle back to IBKR and trade (for the fees),btohqsg
abit sianz i alr had those accounts since March 2021 but didnt sign via referral code  and left dormant until today.,btohqsg
unless can delete / deactivate those accounts and then signup again via ur referral link? üòÖ,btohqsg
