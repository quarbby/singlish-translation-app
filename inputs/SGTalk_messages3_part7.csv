I m jus a happy egg,btohqsg
You want our SGD 3 = MYR 1,btohqsg
It has nothing to do with what i said. You have no brains to argue lol. Fyi i lived in a scandi country so don't lump all devaluing countries into one,btohqsg
Did I say I am sad?,btohqsg
Without our Govt  you think our currency can be so strong.,btohqsg
Lol again shows how dumb you are. Everyone knows pap will retain majority and power. Civil service and the government per se will not change. Having a stronger opposition will prevent a blank cheque,btohqsg
My view is this. PAP represents complete control  extreme power  ownself check ownself  full authoritarianism  minimum welfare  no compassion. Alternative parties represent check and balance  voice of the people  transparency and accountability  singaporeans first. Its up to the people what they want and which is better for the country,btohqsg
Every year audit report same same without any consequences,btohqsg
PAP will retain their supermajority this election. They are trying to scare us so that they don't have to fight so hard for their supermajority next election,btohqsg
Not only retain their supermajority  there is high possibility of a total wipeout with zero opposition  due to the flight to safety factor,btohqsg
PAP confirm win big lorThat’s why WP didn’t want to send best candidates to East Coast GRCSend all the best to defend aljunied. Just hold on for nowSupport them for thinking in the Long term for sinfapore,btohqsg
Where is the best place to rent honda jazz?,btohqsg
This is what I think everyone ought to be worried about. They could win all seats and wipeout.,btohqsg
We need to have a sheep farm,btohqsg
Who gt rent from them before? Is it worth it? Or blue sg better?,btohqsg
I actually think Opposition has a good of winning Sengkang  West Coast and Bukit Batok.In addition to retaining Hougang and Aljunied.,btohqsg
Very tough.... covid a lot of unemployment and job uncertainty. People will flock to safety,btohqsg

Powerful image. Getting paid to sleep. Parliament is where they are expected to raise issues. And its once a week only!,btohqsg
"There have been a lot of compliments abt JJLim from Worker’s Party.  He’s for LBGT/Gay rights & same sex marriage. This is not what we want in S’pore  right ?FYI on this new kid in the block politician -WP candidate Jamus Jerome Lim is an ordained minister of   Universal Life Church. He can solemnize marriage. The church advocates social justice  such as  same sex marriage.Please googled the church for the worrying facts!https://www.themonastery.org/aboutUs""We have made it our mission to actualize these tenets in the world by empowering millions of ministers  whether they come to us from a *Christian  Buddhist  Muslim  Jewish  Catholic  Shinto  Agnostic  Atheist  Pagan  Wiccan  or Druid tradition  to speak their own truth to power.* We work tirelessly to ensure that anyone can get ordained online at the ULC Monastery and we seek to fulfill the spiritual needs of as many different groups as we can by offering plenty of information  a wide variety of services  and networking opportunities. The communication and fellowship of our scattered millions of ministers  we believe  is just as valid a form of worship as the weekly services held in some of the world’s more segregated and elitist religious institutions.""His team member Raeesah Khan is also questionable.She regard herself as intersectional feminist.both Raeesah and Jamus are using words that pander to the mainstreaming of gender-ideology.He was an Ordained Minister at Universal Life Church from 2011.Universal Life Church:https://www.themonastery.org/aboutUs. The website says that they are ""proud of the work we’ve done and the victories we’ve won in areas like religious freedom and the legalization of same-sex marriage.""Universal Life Church provides online ordination of Muslims  Christians  Atheists and even Wiccan",btohqsg
Just got this from church friends not sure if true 😒,btohqsg
I thought PAP has LGBT rights advocate,btohqsg

Opposition is this time around endorsed by LKY son or whatever genes of his left behind,btohqsg
I think everyone should appreciate the risks those who sign up for the opposition endure. Cos you will forever have a target on your back. So anyone running for opposition has balls and put themselves at risk,btohqsg
Seems like someone maybe coming out to cry soon.,btohqsg
Every election is like thatEveryone one KPKB online and at CoffeeshopThen results is pap winHaihTotally give up LiaoAll the older generation pple keep voting pap,btohqsg
Yes. The one best trick for Singaporeans,btohqsg
Yes..election say our vote is secret ..in fact is disclose to them who we vote for,btohqsg
No lah  it’s really secretPap only knows the district of percentage of votes  not the individual votes.,btohqsg
Ya it's true they expecting a wipeout. After that can disband eld and elections altogether. Better for all sinkies since they don't like elections  voting or democracy,btohqsg
Older generation is loyalty. Younger ones is see who can meet their expectations.,btohqsg
Let just imagine if in/after the 10 July  PAP didn't get 51% or more votes! Will she still able to hold multi millions positions in ..... 🤨,btohqsg
This lady is so unlikeable and childish Facebooking all day!,btohqsg
This is not gd period  defend is the best choice of WP.  Pap also understand n let go the aljunied.,btohqsg
"Singapore GE2020: DPM Heng releases video clarifying ""10 million population"" commentshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1KdYNbnx1E",btohqsg
Met with Liu Thai Kher. Hmm why did they meet and what did they discuss. Deny 10 million population now only!!,btohqsg
Wah 4.30 am also post. You scroll up see got one post at 4.36 am,btohqsg
Now 7.30 am. What country you from?,btohqsg
How can you compare opposition voters to Leave voters? Trump etc comparisons are also inappropriate. Want to compare negatively also compare with Taiwan or Hong Kong democracy voters,btohqsg
Taiwan and Hong Kong are the Worst,btohqsg
Does anyone have part time nanny to recommend?,btohqsg
Singapore doesn't have amazingly affordable public healthcare either. The Taiwanese system has a slightly higher spending as a percentage of GDP  but they have a lower GDP per capita too.https://international.thenewslens.com/article/108032,btohqsg
This one I never want to see. You love it so much. You can move there and stay there and watch them do that all the time.,btohqsg
