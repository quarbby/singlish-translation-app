Don't think so the wording to me seems to me like it's a full time kinda programme,btohqsg
Ok the history of thay building is actually pretty interesting I believe it started building in the Kim Jong il times in the 1990s but ran out of money when the soviet Union collapsed.. it then laid half built for like 15 years until 2011 when the outside was completed but till today in interior is not build fully,btohqsg

I mean the 737 is the most common one I think but the 757 in its class is outperformed by the 777 and 787,btohqsg
