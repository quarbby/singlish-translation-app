Has anyone tried to use ocbc 90n cc for simplygo as in tap in bus and mrt? Not sure how they charge. I am curious does it considered as qualifying monthly $500 spend for ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
Hi. How should my spouse and I manage household expenses if we don‚Äôt want to have a joint account yet want to split equally? Reason being joint accounts tend not to maximise interest. Or any recommendation for high interest joint account but low barrier (eg no crediting of salary req),btohqsg
For Visa  SimplyGo charges daily. For MC  SimplyGo charges after hitting $15 or 5 days whichever earlier. Then it'll take another 3-5 business days to post the charge.,btohqsg
Yes we did. Twice already. Still never change.Feel like complaining to mas about their trappy platform. How can u default to credit able account,btohqsg
Use another local bank no min account just for paynow to friends. Those close friends add as friends,btohqsg
That human not many banks left to open already.Rest need to use for musical chairs.,btohqsg
Understand how u feel. But unfortunately  MAS has no lever over bank app's user interface and experience,btohqsg
Who has the highest saving account (no lock)Maribank 2.88%?,btohqsg
I already said no and I had put in my savings account since sep23,btohqsg
SorryWho has the highest saving account (no lock)  no minimum sum  no conditionsJus leave yr $$ there  anytime can withdraw. Daily expense account  but still earn decent %Maribank 2.88%?,btohqsg
You register in Aug or Sep?,btohqsg
SEP n ending Feb. Now need search for another saving acc and considering esaver,btohqsg
He asking now  i don't think is available to him at this point of time.,btohqsg
Maribank or GXS up to 75k,btohqsg
SCB e-savers or hsbc EGA is much higher,btohqsg
Esavers need incremental funds but he‚Äôs using it for his daily expenses,btohqsg
It‚Äôs incremental vs Jan‚Äôs average. If jan‚Äôs average was zero  every $ is incremental. Anytime can withdraw,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure they would step in if they are aware the app defaults to a loan account (26% pa) for account transfers.And did I mention the account selection is hidden below (user has to scroll the screen to see it). And user is able to press Send Money without ever viewing the selected account.,btohqsg
Hsbc ega 3.5% is just 2 month I believe (I maybe wrong),btohqsg
Even kopitiam is not spared CNY surcharge,btohqsg
Ya conclude maribank 2.88% is the highest for now üòÑAlso good on shopee  high cashbacküòÜ,btohqsg
Put Mari invest la .. average 3.8 draw out anytime .. ya it‚Äôs an investment but can draw out anytime la,btohqsg
Ain't similar to moomoo cashplusSince now giving 6.8  after which also around 3+ü§î,btohqsg
This might be better but till Mar.A,btohqsg
Cash plus u need one day or so to withdraw .. he wants immediate withdrawal so Mari invest is the only one,btohqsg
Oh... tats the different.Great to know üëç,btohqsg
Is mari invest risk level similar to moomoo fullerton sgd cash fund?,btohqsg
May be üòä.. Let us know if u manage to convince MAS to nudge Maybank to really change the app experience,btohqsg
lol I just checked. They really did something!!! U can now see the debiting account before proceeding. Earlier u had to scroll down. I just complained last week before CNY. This definitely helps although defaulting to creditable still.,btohqsg
is recurring CC payment counted online transaction?,btohqsg
I think you gotta manually key in the details to count as online,btohqsg
Why it say total is $100 when there's fees?,btohqsg
is food panda apps consider as online transaction tooo ?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs another sneaky bit. It should have clearly said if u proceed 26% pa interest (min $5 per month) will apply.,btohqsg
Basically I feel it doesn‚Äôt make sense to allow a creditable account to ‚Äúcoexist‚Äù alongside a savings account at account selection stage  what more credit able being the default. lol.,btohqsg
If there is no criteria to be online/mobile transaction like UOB absolute so long it‚Äôs charged should be fine I guess? Hmm,btohqsg
Yeah I think soI think you can do some search hereYou should be able to find some data points.,btohqsg

Hi  i do not have experience with booking of flights before. I would like to seek suggestions for flight to Hong kong  how should i go about booking of the tickets for cheaper flights? Throughtrip.com  agoda or scoot website?I will be intending to use UOB lady's card.,btohqsg
Search for the cheapest options on skyscanner. Then  I recommend booking directly w the airline because if anything goes wrong  airline will direct you to the agent that you bought from to resolve (i.e. if you booked directly with them  you resolve with them  whereas if you booked through a website liketrip.comor agoda  you have to wait to talk to a customer service agent from there),btohqsg
Hard to say.. For example  Apple iCloud subscription charged to credit card on recurring basis is an online transaction and M1 recurring payment is not. The safest way is to pay manually,btohqsg
Hi guys  is UOB SimpleInvest worth parking my funds into?,btohqsg
I did rather buy the Fund myself  rather than buying ILP products... the admin fee  management fee etc will eat into your $,btohqsg
Yes  anyone bought it? Heard they give 5% on the sum u put in..for long term...,btohqsg
Heard it from dbs  posb & roadshow,btohqsg
5% after 10 ? 15 years ?that's a lie,btohqsg
That's why need to hear from more pplüòÇ,btohqsg
surrendered my ILP during my 2nd year term  lost 8k   i take it as a lesson.... coz after calculating the full 10years commitment  i wont be even get a capital guaranteed the base sum i put in aka 4k per year over 10 years = 40kshort pain rather long pain,btohqsg
at most i can get back is about 35kafter all the admin fees  manager fee  etc etc..,btohqsg
But they alws advise that these products r for long terms,btohqsg
Rule of thumb: investing thru banks and insurers is almost always a terrible idea due to the excessive fees. There is also extremely high moral hazard of them recommending funds that offer the bank/insurers the higest trailer fees. U can always find the exact same or a similar fund thru other diy platform that charges a lower fee.,btohqsg
but they never will say how much you will get capital back after the full term matured  ,btohqsg
Most ilp are using in house funds so the returns are pretty piss poor plus the exorbitant fees charged on top of it.,btohqsg
5% bonus but take 3% back in charges lor,btohqsg
not only that  there is a final maturing fee too  so more then 5%,btohqsg
Hahaha most of them are a joke,btohqsg
ILP maybe for those who don't know how to invest themselves,btohqsg
i learned my lesson  my 8k will never get back but i am smarter now  i rather put the 8k on example moomoo's Fullerton cash fund  which you will see daily(weekday) increment  and surrender anytime,btohqsg
Better off putting in roboadvisors. Have fees  but not as disgusting as most ILPs,btohqsg
yep  robo advisors are also good option...ILP just benefits your FA aka Finance advisorthey earn the most selling ILPs btw,btohqsg
anyone knows how long does singsaver send the rewards collection details after making the qualifying spend for HSBC cards?,btohqsg
UOB invest have direct fund option. But we will need to read up and review all the UOB funds and their performance til date to decide which ones we want to go for. There are a few funds that offer monthly dividends,btohqsg
Yes  melvyn. I'm already having the uob one n ocbc 360 accounts. Beside shopee purchase to clock the min spending for uob n ocbc. I'm thinking if worth to open mari bank to get their vouchers for shopee purchases. But don't see much comment here hence  maybe not worth to open mari. Asking for comment üòä,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to ask those who got the Shopee vouchers from Maribank to show you what those vouchers are n is it useful for you.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone open mari bank and using their vouchers for shopee purchases? Is mari giving out daily vouchers at shopee pls?,btohqsg
Hi Trazora  that time when you made payment via Healthhub  what did the transaction appear as on credit card? For NSC  I just made payment via healthhub using evol and dbs livefresh. Not sure if still qualifies for 6.66% and 5% respectively.,btohqsg
I think not daily vouchers but weekly vouchers. And you get free shipping with selected merchants,btohqsg
You can see what's being offered on the shopee. The only thing that comes close to an actual cashback is their weekly 5% cashback voucher (spend 60 off 8).The rest are coins cashback vouchers which imo are quite trash lol. But it maybe good for someone like yourself who buys stuff off shopee frequently.The vouchers also have a limit to usage...,btohqsg

It will not earn miles or ocbc travel$ cos less than $5 dollar block. I read thru the tnc. I am not sure on point 1.6 for ocbc 90n. Does it mean bus and mrt fares excluded?,btohqsg
Geez. I need to get 2nd phone then.,btohqsg

RE: Webull transfer promo. If I apply to transfer for eg 3 counters worth USD10k each at the same from IBKR to Webull  do they arrive at webull at the same time and all 3 count as the INITIAL transfer of USD30K?

I don't think the recent video covers this. Thanks.,btohqsg

My colleague who defaulted on his payment a few time is able to apply for one which confuses me,btohqsg
Assuming your salary have increased  have you updated your income with CIMB (if you're applying with them)? Then try applying for the card again. If you're planning to apply with other banks  you might want to fix your credit score.To fix your credit  you can try increasing your limit to 3x your required expenses and do not increase your spending past your required expenses.You should also review your budget if you're spending 100% of your salary.,btohqsg
I apply via singpass so they have my cpf statement,btohqsg
They will use your last assessed income  which is for 2022.,btohqsg
By assessed income as in NOA ?,btohqsg
Icic  so I have to wait until April for them to update it or is there anyway to update it on singpass ?,btohqsg
A couple of factors possible‚Ä¶you always late payment it will also affect your credit score  and don‚Äôt apply for credit cards with different banks within a short period of time,btohqsg
Because I send citibank my bank salary slip and they still reject me I am not sure if It relates,btohqsg
I haven't miss any payment yet for my cimb card,btohqsg
Usually if it's income they will email to ask for latest income  or cpf contributions  etc.If they just outright reject then likelihood is you applied for multiple cards from different banks within a short period of time or your credit score is too poor.,btohqsg
Icic  I think I will cool off with the application for one month and try again,btohqsg

Item 6 explained why your credit card applications were rejected. Not sure why you use your personal account for company expenses. The transaction amount likely exceeds your income a lot and does not match your income. Shall your company use its own account for business transactions?,btohqsg

Then the claim will only come together with salary.Sounds very stupid and sus. Like the company never cater for funds for operations like that.,btohqsg
How about opening an account n leave it there? That‚Äôs what i do. Occasionally when they have really good vouchers for shopee purchases  I‚Äôll use it (as high as 20% cashback in shopee coins  but with a cap). So u will have to do a lil bit of math to see if you earn more from CC or the voucher,btohqsg
The vouchers are shown on Shopee app  with a MariBank logo. So anyone is able to see what kind of vouchers they give out,btohqsg
Thanks. Read thru the tnc of rising dragon promo. It seems it is eligible for newly opened uob savings account this month. That means if I participate with my new uob one account by 29 Feb  I must deposit stipulated amount of funds by 29 Mar  hold it until 17 Jun to be eligible for the cashback? I am sorry. I worry I misinterpreted this promotion,btohqsg
Hi guys my xnap just stopped working.. anybody having the same experience too?,btohqsg

Side question  do you know how to check your progress after signing up for it? I believe I have satisfied all the requirement but have no way to verify it,btohqsg
Hi all  i am still experiencing issue with xnap. When making payment via apple pay  ‚Äúpayment failed‚Äù error pop out. Anyone encountering the same?,btohqsg
Participate and Deposit fund by 29th Feb and maintain it until it is being earmarked by 29th Mar.,btohqsg
Thank you. I think I will use my Uniplus account for this promo since I have maintained it minimum balance since. The tnc also mentioned this promo cannot concurrently run with other promo such as new opening promo and salary plus promo,btohqsg

The issue is not on the seed phase but on the confidence of using ledger as a wallet. If the seed is not compromised then there‚Äôs no risk. He just wants to switch wallet and keep his coins intact.,btohqsg
Because if you have UOB EVOL or One card  you can definitely get more than 5% cashback. And you can sometimes add on UOB bank vouchers.,btohqsg
Use Android phone with Google Pay...Since 3 days ago  only 1 person reported working whilst everyone else on Apple Pay said otherwise.You can check withJTto see what he did to get his XNAP to work.Seems like it failed for him too:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/171808,btohqsg
be careful about this  not sure where u see issues with ledger but it might be a scam to get your seed phrase,btohqsg
"Based on articles  the only news I've seen is about the Ledger hack by code exploit. Which happenedtwo monthsago.If your seed phrase or wallet is compromised  you would have noticed it way earlier. And Ledger will also be compensating victims as well.Ledger said to prevent further exploits  they will disable blind signing by Jun 24  which means you can only do clear signing (i.e. sign transactions on dApps only available on Ledger Live).If you're getting DMs or people prompting of such compromising of seed phrase  then you should be wary as it might be a scam. Possibly leaving the group/server altogether  usually happens in badly moderated dApps chat group/servers or those scammy ""signals providing"" chat group/servers.",btohqsg

Is this promo subject to the lifetime SCB bonus cashback limit? i.e. those who previously received cashback for SCB promo will not be eligible/have her or his cashback award deducted?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have a question regarding credit card spends. If I hit the cash back caps every month  can I use a different card from the same bank  or should I get a card from a different bank to continue getting cash back?,btohqsg
should maintain using the same credit card as long as you can easily hit the min spend.,btohqsg
does not matter same bank or not. Target to get max cashback for your spending where u can meet min spend easily,btohqsg
Let's say I spend 3K on the card  but I max out the cash back at 2K spend. Should I get another card to use the remaining 1K spend? Same bank or different bank?,btohqsg
yeah you should NOT spend over the maximum cashback limitget a few cashback / miles cards  so you can move your spillover spend to the next best card,btohqsg
Mine still not working. Just tried,btohqsg
Any account which does not require minimum credit card spending and deposit salary yet having decent monthly interest? I have a spare of 100kish cash.. I already have ocbc360 and cannot go for uob one,btohqsg

Hi for HSBC Revolution  do u earn 10mpd for card linked to ShopBack and favepay ?Or is it strictly only via apple pay/ pay wave in stores?,btohqsg
Scb esaver current 3.6% is only till end march? After that will be 0.05%? Sorry kinda confused haha,btohqsg
You get 4mpd if the Shopack/Favepay purchase falls under whitelisted merchants.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163614Esavers promo 3.6% ends end Mar 24.,btohqsg
Ongoing promotion that renews at promotional interest rates (at that point in time) every 2-3 months,btohqsg
Usually dining food courts etc will get right,btohqsg
Yeah end by end march... After that is just 0.05% I assume,btohqsg
Just realised I made some purchases last yr by keying card details rather than Apple Pay  are such transactions eligible for 4mpd too?,btohqsg
SCB Esaver has a perpetual promo  just that you need more than one human to take advantage of it,btohqsg
Like what David said  usually have renewal but you might need to move the cash to another esavers account to fully make use of it (basically what Mt said).,btohqsg
Oohh ok thanks all for advice... Let me check out,btohqsg
Oh ya thanks I read wrongly.. it‚Äôs ‚Äúonline or offline transaction‚Äù thanks!,btohqsg
I trying to see if I can use uob one too.. need to hit min cc spending,btohqsg
But why OCBC 360 over UOB One account? The rewards on OCBC cards isn't that great also.,btohqsg
It has additional cashback for uob one cc,btohqsg
Talking about DFI. I stuck to choose uob evol or one cc lol. DFI groceries such as CS and jasons far to reach at my place. Should whitelist fair price also ley,btohqsg
Depends on whether she‚Äôs a miles or cashback person. Anyway  small issue,btohqsg
Webull new join rewards is so kuku. 25 chances of drawing share but all is USD 3 of tesla,btohqsg
Dont under what u mean by whitelist fairprice as they are in whitelist just no bonus rebate,btohqsg
ACB got whitelist one meh. I thought all MCCs. Unless I misunderstand ACB wrongly as Absolute Cashback,btohqsg
Because I don't hit min spent of $500 on cc on certain months... Uob one without cc spent don't have any interest...,btohqsg
I just cleared my uob one insurance mthly deduction. So move money out soon,btohqsg
Hmm no wonder the 0.6% don't matter to u. But you can pay other bills and insurances to clock bonus interests.,btohqsg
U mean u paying insurance to hit $500?,btohqsg
U mean for uob one CC spent? How about salary credit since is going to my OCBC 360,btohqsg
ya me took up & move on after Mar,btohqsg
Just transfer 1.6k to UOB One? And then transfer back the next day.,btohqsg
Through paynow n indicate salary right? Does it still work now?,btohqsg

Bid slightly higher than your true next best alternative investment of similar profile.,btohqsg
hi  Syfe cash guaranteed rate for 3 mth is 3.8%. Any other platform has higher than this?,btohqsg
why not just stick to SCB Esaver 3.6% p.a. for general public..https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/esaver/,btohqsg
most certainly will be replaced by another apr to may (with march ADB comparison) promo.,btohqsg
It is very very important not to confuse/compare SYFE account with a full bank savings account.,btohqsg
Anyone registered UOB rising dragon in January? Are your deposits earmark and cash credited already?,btohqsg
OK. Thanks. I was thinking if earmark early end early.,btohqsg
Haha yours is the Christmas one.ZQsee here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442,btohqsg
oops sorry my bad for pasting the wrong one,btohqsg
Is the Styfe capital guaranteed as well? This is different from interest rate. That is the advantage of saving account.,btohqsg
This is basically similar to FD. In fact one of the highest rn.,btohqsg
Park it in a money market fund. Some are doing as high as 3.6/3.9%,btohqsg
Cash+ Guaranteed is a managed investment portfolio  and should not be taken as a deposit. Until the investment is locked in  the rate is subject to change. Investment capital and returns are guaranteed subject to underlying bank risk. This has more risk as compared with bank FD. As long you aware of it,btohqsg
i think they do something like topup the difference such that even if you lose on the fund price  overall you will get back 100% + 3.8% p.a. right?but u are still subject to the credit risk of SYFE and i think there is slippage with the transfer in and out of funds from SYFE (do they use FAST  and is the fund accruing 3.8% instantly?(,btohqsg
If you are using poems to trade  they will auto put your idle cash in MMF for you for 3.5%.,btohqsg
I just parked the access from my uob 100K into their mmf ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
You can also put into United SG fund. But they paid dividends  monthly whereas poems paid on daily basis.,btohqsg
I think is just similar to FD  but until they lock in your investments  the rates may change last min. And not SDIC insured.,btohqsg
I just got lazy since that's my salary account. I just park some in there every month when I pay my bills üòÅ,btohqsg
Currently at 3.77 I guess it's ok,btohqsg
i won't trust these published rates at all,btohqsg
I did review the UOB funds available and this fund seems to be one of the stable and consistently paying dividends but of course I don‚Äôt expect crazy dividend,btohqsg
Those rates come from in the app  and are updated every month (I think) ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Hi guys  may seek for some advise? I pay my HSBC Credit card last Saturday using DBS payment  the due date is 13 February(today)  but the transaction haven't posted yet  should I just wait tit to be posted then appeal for the late charge?,btohqsg
Were you charged a late fee already?,btohqsg
No charge then how to appeal? Just wait.,btohqsg
So  rush to pay bill now( on axs machine maybe) also pointless? Or just appeal late charge easier? üòÇ,btohqsg
Just wait for the the transaction to get posted,btohqsg
You shall pay at least 3businessdays in advance to avoid any worry. The only way now is for you to call HSBC CSO to check have they received the payment but not yet display on your account.,btohqsg
Yeah  forgot about public holiday...I checking with thier CSO too,btohqsg
do you have HSBC account? To play safe  transfer in money into HSBC Savings account.. and do internet banking payment now.,btohqsg
I don't have HSBC saving account,btohqsg

Amaze paired with citirewards still get 4 miles per dollar for hospital and clinics? Tks all the experts,btohqsg
I will just wait and appeal if inccur late charge as thier CSO suggested so  thanks all,btohqsg
The best way now is you place a FD  eg. $30k  in a bank to get a secured credit card with credit limit $20k or $30k. From there you rebuild your credit score slowly.Take care of your bank account n credit card. Don‚Äôt abuse it.,btohqsg
Technically he have one existing CC.. just need to increase limit and slowly fix the credit score,btohqsg
Quite curious  such cases won't affect income tax meh,btohqsg
depends on how HR / staff reports to IRAS loh..murky area,btohqsg
Exactly lol. Company not affected because end of the day it's still under operational expenses. ü§™,btohqsg
Anyone knows why my new uob lady credit card spending was not reflected in my uob one acct spending criteria? (My previous card was expired and they sent a new card with a new number.) Is there any linking procedure i shd do?,btohqsg
Can you confirm the transaction is posted? You should call uob if so,btohqsg
Hi all  can i confirm  atome with CRMC if do manual 3x payment (instalment) still can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Ya normally it is posted the next day. But its been 2 days and spending is still zero,btohqsg
public holidays leh  wait at least 2 business days after transactions posted on transactions history,btohqsg
Did you check the app to see if it's posted? Lol,btohqsg
Yup posted on the credit card statement. But the uob one account details spending is still 0/500,btohqsg
Called uob centre. The rep say need to wait for few days before the new card would be refreshed in the app's system. Probably thats why..,btohqsg

Is it advisable to pay off hdb loan faster monthly via cpf? Eg instalment is $100 but I can afford to pay $200 using cpf so I pay $200 monthly,btohqsg
? Low effective interest rate (unless you did not max out your uob one account on 31 Dec 2023),btohqsg
The longer you drag  the more accrued interest you will incur. So its better to.Maybe you will want to explore doing a lump sum reduction every year after your bonus if your job pays you bonuses?,btohqsg
If u can get higher returns than 2.6% then feel free to invest with cash.,btohqsg
Conservative way would be to pay up quickly.Balanced way would be to maintain the current instalments of $100 and use your OA to buy t-bills (instead of 'pre-paying' your HDB loan) which currently still outperforms the 2.6% that u are paying for HDB loan.,btohqsg
just need to empty out uob one on 30 Dec  then can get extra cashback on top of the full 5% on $100k,btohqsg
Yup  the only use case is assuming one did empty his uob one ac on 31 dec.,btohqsg

Hi all  which credit card is best for MCC 8699 (online FCY spend)? I don't mind cashback or miles,btohqsg

Sure. I am thinking to have one account for new account opening promo. Cos rising dragon savings promotion seems like cannot run in conjunction with other promotions as per tnc,btohqsg

I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúHsbc when points‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Usually hsbc revo points should come in following month if im not wrongCrmc usually within a few days after transaction is clear,btohqsg
What does that got to do with the rising dragon savings promo? Lol,btohqsg
If I already have UOB one account with 100K currently being earmarked for Christmas promo  I can still register to open a new UOB Stash account for the Rising Dragon promo right?,btohqsg
Rising dragon savings promo tnc said The Promotion is not valid with any other privileges or promotions unless otherwise stated.,btohqsg
Should still be possible to run UOB Rising Dragon savings on UOB Uniplus account and UOB Account Opening on UOB One account. You might want to double check with CSO.As you can see  people are running 2 savings promo on different accounts fine.,btohqsg

Not dumb la  what other cards are better?,btohqsg
Cuz Atome also can. I thought BNPL can‚Äôt get points,btohqsg
I would think citi smrt card is not bad,btohqsg
But if have fcy then still amaze +crmc,btohqsg
Either way I feel like dying waiting for the points. Wait since dec to accumulate enough üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Yes installment is better for opportunity cost but also depends how much tax we are looking at I would say 5 figure upwards will definitely makes sense.,btohqsg
Payment at FairPrice in store using app+Apple Pay (hsbc revo) eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg

üëåhappy problem to hear üëÇit be real good for hsbc ega,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt think of any reason not to take the free lunch. Even if tax is 4 digits.,btohqsg
It charges to your credit card earning you credit card rewards.  You can‚Äôt use your Apple Pay (credit card) for hawker centre.,btohqsg
Yes most hawker accept it it part of the SGQR directly and not a off label like favepay or shopbackLookout for xnap or liquid pay logo,btohqsg
can google pay use for hawker,btohqsg
Yes you just scan and it will prompt you to enter the amount and pay via Google pay or Apple Pay,btohqsg
can xnap link to any credit/debit card?,btohqsg
Whatever card is link to your phone you can use,btohqsg
use xnap app scan qr quote (with liquidpay/xnap logp) to pay from apple/googlepay,btohqsg
oh  ok. cannot use google pay to scan directly?,btohqsg
No you can‚Äôt hence why you need xnap,btohqsg
can I link my card to xnap app without google pay then?,btohqsg
no  need to pay using card in apple/google pay,btohqsg

Hi James  right now  you cannot use your credit card paywave to pay for hawker food.  XNAP provides a way for you to pay using XNAP that links to your googlepay(android)  applepay(iPhone).,btohqsg
noted. I seldom use scan to pay. Only try out iChange recently but failed. It could be that it cannot recognised the qr code like google pay. Will try out xnap to see if it helps.,btohqsg
installed xnap and it only support my Google pay. No setting for other payment method.,btohqsg
what giro arrangement u on now?,btohqsg
think need to check with iras cso how to resolve the issue,btohqsg
Yours can be see on iras website?,btohqsg
Could be because the tax year is about to end/start so you can't create new instalment plan,btohqsg

Ahh I see ok :-( thank u!!,btohqsg
Anyone has any recommendations on which cards to use instead for travel expenses?,btohqsg
Try UOB Lady (ideally solitaire with travel category selected) and WWMC. If paying in FCY  can consider UOB VS as well.,btohqsg
Can anyone gives me some good reasons why you take miles card over Cashback card ?? I'm a Cashback card user and by using multiple cards I can achieve up to 10% cash back in $2k spending every month.,btohqsg

For international online purchase e.g. disneyland in JPY  will my CC be charged addtional FCY charges?,btohqsg
You are doing great with cashback cards  keep it up!,btohqsg
Because u should use miles cards to cover the categories that doesn‚Äôt give u 10% Cashback.,btohqsg
Sounds to me like you're trying to brag more than looking for a proper discussion  but I'll take the bait üòÇCan you still get 10% cash back if you need to spend much more than $2k a month?,btohqsg
Nothing magical for 10% cashback!Uob one gives 10% cashback for $1500 of $2000 spending on specified merchants like dairy farm and grab.,btohqsg
Hey did u pay online with Citi Rewards in the end and get your 4mpd?,btohqsg
SCB Bonus saver needs salary credit  how about their e$aver? 3.6% also good without lock in (though short period)?,btohqsg

$600 gojek with dbs yuu (18%)$900 Maybank fnf (8%)$500 Citi smrt (5%)It's about 10% Cashback,btohqsg
A bit more maybe can . But it too much more definitely get lower Cashback and also depends on what category. This is why I'm considering miles card if it doesn't limit any category spend,btohqsg
for fresh funds. can trf out and later trf back?,btohqsg
Not everybody has $2k expenses per month. If have only $400 expenses per month  likely won‚Äôt get much cashback.,btohqsg
$400 expenses how much miles can get ?For Cashback can probably get 3.5%,btohqsg
Miles worth at least 6% to 10% depends on how much individual values the miles.You sure $400 can get 3.5%?,btohqsg
But the 6% to 10% is only when you use it to convert air ticket right ? I believe it's less than that as you also need to pay for the conversion fees and still need to pay for airport tax . It's not completely free for air ticket .,btohqsg
Hence the smart way is to use the correct card for the various categories.Earn the highest cashback or miles for the category.,btohqsg
Can use HSBC revolution cc to get 2.5% plus HSBC account to get additional 1%,btohqsg
Yes miles game is best played when u redeem for business class tickets.,btohqsg
So are you saying the maximum earn rate is about 10% even for miles card ?,btohqsg
Miles card has no fixed answer. It depends on your miles valuation.A good ‚Äúaverage‚Äù valuation used by many is 1.5 cents per mile.Which equates the Uob lady card 6 miles per dollar to be worth about 9% cashback.,btohqsg
This is why I use many different card for different categories to get the highest Cashback possible. But sometimes I find it very troublesome this is why I wonder if miles card can do better rate I want to switch to miles card,btohqsg
Yes I used to be entirely cashback like u about 1 year ago.I started on miles with Uob lady 6 miles per dollar and gradually into 4 miles per dollar cards.It‚Äôs very worth it. Basically u need to have the ability to mix and match (min / max) each cashback / miles card to extract the highest value out of all of them.My monthly household expenditure is minimum $6k-$8k per month and I‚Äôm using these cards.Uob one $2k x 2Citibank cashback $800 x 2Maybank family and friends $800Uob lady $3k x 2 (not always max)Amaze + Citi rewards masterUob ppv (general spend card max $1.1k),btohqsg
6 to 8k .. damn high üòÖ,btohqsg
It may seem high but when u have many people in the household it is quite normal.Another tip for u is get as many people in your umbrella.You are not alone in this world. Pay for your up and down (whether u claim back from them is up to u).Buy groceries for your parents. Give them sub card. Etc.,btohqsg
All those cards x2 means what?,btohqsg
2 of those cards. Household has more than one adult  each can apply one.,btohqsg
I find cashback is easier but they have a cap. Like $500 that kind for UOB one card.,btohqsg
I change to miles because the benefits like better üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all about getting used to the terms and conditions and the rules.Both cashback and miles cards have their pros and cons.,btohqsg
So basically you use Cashback and miles card mix . For those no category use miles card .. and for miles card is there minimum spending?,btohqsg
I guess I‚Äôm qualified to say this because I‚Äôm playing both sides now for about 1 year already.,btohqsg
Can share which benefit you find better?,btohqsg
No category = could be using cashback card or miles card. No hard and fast rule. Whichever highest.Miles cards some have minimum spending. Some don‚Äôt.Miles cards some have maximum spending. Some don‚Äôt.,btohqsg
U also need to have a very good understand of how Mccs work.,btohqsg
That means Revo is only 2.5%.Miles card also can earn the extra 1%.,btohqsg
Heh heh I just clicked on Chris shop and saw this. I find it interesting so help him re advert. Won‚Äôt get banned Hor.  Hahaha.,btohqsg
My mile card don‚Äôt have minimum but have maximum.The benefit is like how u would view it I guess. All about timing üòÇWhen I want I want book plane ticket pay cash to and from Japan.Like 2 person cost 1.5k cash. Then if have miles is like a piggy bank accumulate over the years then use to redeem. Then the cost like less painful.Plus SIA if want cancel / change flight easier just pay a fee if using miles. For those pay cash can‚Äôt cancel. More flexibility.Cash back is more of immediate returns every month see some money back.,btohqsg
Benefits wise I no need to explain if you find cash back give moreüòÇ u determine which more convenient bah.,btohqsg
Miles card u need to redeem business class then it will be very worth it.If u only intend to redeem economy class  you might not be better off than receiving cashback and buying a cash economy class ticket.,btohqsg
Hi guys! I‚Äôm new here and having a pickle on which credit cards should I apply for.Basically my expenditure fluctuates a lot  depending on my business trip activities for the month. I thought of getting lady UOB card (travel category) but seems like there‚Äôs a cap of $1000 per month.However my upcoming trip (hotel accommodation will probably around 3x that limit) makes me feel like I‚Äôm wasting miles opportunity.Any advice of credit cards that suits someone with fluctuating expenditures.Let me know any questions also if you might need more details to give a better suggestion.,btohqsg
Get Uob lady solitaire. U can choose 2 categories and up to $3k spend a month no minimum spend.,btohqsg
"Another thing I find it very limited on the miles card is that like what you mentioned the miles only be worth it when comes to redeem business class so which means we are ""forced"" to spend more for the ticket",btohqsg
It‚Äôs more worth for business class if accumulate for very long. For me I just accumulate for 1 year. I don‚Äôt mind using for economy it still works for me.,btohqsg
Like the Japan trip I looking at now  for cash payment don‚Äôt have the flight timing I want. If use miles than can give me the timing I wantüòÇ,btohqsg
Yes that is correct. I have this same thinking too.A redemption business class ticket will still always cost more in real value compared to economy class cash ticket.Using some figures:Singapore to Tokyo return ticketCash economy $900Cash business $3200Redemption economy 54k miles + $100Redemption business 104k miles + $100The redemption business even if your miles only cost 1 cent per mile will still cost you about $1100 real value. More than cash economy of $900.However you are only paying ‚Äú$200‚Äù more in my example for business class instead of 3 times.,btohqsg
Unfortunately I do not meet the requirements for solitaire ü§£.,btohqsg
Apply the dbs world woman card. Is 1.5k üòÖ,btohqsg
U can try Uob visa signature for 4 miles per dollar. But that has certain criteria Such as:1. Must contactless pay for sgd2. Must be foreign currencyBoth with minimum spend $1k max spend $2k.It‚Äôs more complicated than this so I suggest you read the tnc if proceeding.,btohqsg
Sorry is dbs. Just search milelion dbs world woman card. Can read more info.,btohqsg
Thanks! Let me look it up and see if it‚Äôs something that meets my situation,btohqsg
You know I just bought sin to Tokyo around $500 per ticket ..This is another reason I don't use miles card . It limits your selection to certain airlines,btohqsg
Personally dont use it because of the short 1 yr point expiry  that is smth u might need to consider too,btohqsg
Comparing apples to apples ya.Sq with sq.Anyway another strategy I use is:1. One way budget airline with cash2. Return trip with business class redemption.,btohqsg
I check scoot price and SIA price exactly the same. Some more I selected no bag check-in. My as well I go for SIAüòÇ,btohqsg
U booking last minute right?Air tickets must grab / book one year in advance for best deals,btohqsg
8 months later price up already.And scoot can be overpriced.,btohqsg
The KrisFlyer miles can use on scoot and SIAüòÖ,btohqsg
Should be zip or scoot I guessNow I think got ana new budget airline too,btohqsg
I hope air japan pricing is actually budget. For now because they sell thru ana but operated by air japan  the pricing not very de budget leh hahaha,btohqsg
Zipair was a good experience for me. $260 ish with 30kg luggage and food and seat selection one way sin Narita.I have yet to try air Japan. Waiting for DPs.,btohqsg
My only complaint they release too late. 4 months in advance only. Usually by then I firm up all my plans Liao with other airlines. lol,btohqsg
Just take this $500 Tokyo air ticket as an example.a). Assuming cash back 2.5% one needs to spend $16 000 with 2.5% cashback to get $400. Add $100 tax to get $500 worth of Tokyo economy  air ticket.b). One only needs to spend $9 000 to get 54 000 miles using 6mpd UOB Lady  plus $100 tax to get one Tokyo economy air ticket.,btohqsg
Each to their own ba I guess,btohqsg
Ya. Different people different choice. Just to show why some people choose to use miles card. That is the initial question raised.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a miles person  but I think the average Cashback rate they should aim for is ~5%  so the spend required will be $8k.Anyway  1 factor for miles is  there‚Äôs no ‚Äòpeak‚Äô miles required. But cash fares will fluctuate based on seasons. Also  lower the cost per miles from 1 cent to 0.X cent. It‚Äôs possible.Also with age  one will really appreciate having a good rest during the flight vs economy where you hardly get any sleep and start your trip feeling so tired. If I‚Äôm still early 20s  sure‚Ä¶. üòÇ,btohqsg
Since you‚Äôre already on UOB  try UOB PPV or UOB Visa Signature. The miles pool and your combined limit will be $1K + $1.1K + $2K.Also if you‚Äôre near the $120k income mark  just try applying for Solitaire  UOB may just approve it. No harm trying,btohqsg
For those monthly expenses less than $400  they don‚Äôt have much choice. It is hard to get 5% cashback on all spending.,btohqsg
How to monthly expense below $400? Living in their own world without a care?,btohqsg
UserSRhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no huatpal,btohqsg
mmmm if below $400 pm  i'll suggest they opt for cashback instead of miles,btohqsg
I use paynow from ocbc and selected salary but doesnt seem to included. Any idea??,btohqsg
XNAP is working for iPhone. As of this morning,btohqsg
As of yesterday have multiple reports say working already üëçüèª,btohqsg
Which card gives the best cashback under this scenario?,btohqsg
in this case  your suggestion of 2.5% is apt,btohqsg
how you manage to track each of the card? it will be very time consuming if use spreadsheet,btohqsg
even for economy with saver  still can get 9% which is very hard with cashback cards,btohqsg
I had HSBC revolution card and I opened EGA acocunt recentlyI left my contact details on EGA site then an HSBC staff called me if I'd like to open the account digitally or by going down to a branch.I opened the account digitally but in the end  I had to go to an HSBC branch to register my signature to complete setting up the account for e-giro.,btohqsg
If you really want the cashback/miles  you will work for it,btohqsg
Correct it's the same for all bank accounts if you're new to bank and they don't have signature records lol,btohqsg
Anyone uses the cimb visa infinite?,btohqsg
i am using Excel sheet to manually track each card  and updating the participating humans via Whatsapp Group Chat.It is manual indeed and time consuming  but it is something I enjoy (nobody else in the household cares and wants to do it).,btohqsg
i think i worked out Japan Y Saver and it was about 1.7 cents per mile so at 6mpd = 10.2% APPROX benefit. Japan J saver is about 3.2 cents per mile.but please don't be 'misled' by the 'high 3.2' cents per mile because that is assuming you are willing to pay for CASH BUSINESS CLASS  which most people won't (i won't).,btohqsg
And sometimes Scootbiz is cheaper than SQ Y,btohqsg
whether Scootbiz is better or equal or worse than SQ Y  arguable..haha.. don't want to start wars here(I am perfectly fine with Scoot Budget).,btohqsg
Think he meant SIA and Scoot as separate airlines,btohqsg
probably single and stay with parent,btohqsg
yeah parent(s) have no expenses?i'm not asking you to pay for them (well you could if you want)  but consider doing sub cards with/by them.,btohqsg
yes  i do the same  but only for my own cards; my supplement card just follows what card to use at that moment; the person can't remember that f&b to use lady card  grocery to use hsbc revo etc. I use around 5-6 active cards monthly  mixing cashback and miles,btohqsg
yes for those of your humans who don't bother  i have 2 recommendations:1. Amaze + CRMC2. UOB Visa Signature (make sure you tape up the chip),btohqsg
What is the reason to tape up the chip?,btohqsg
because for local SGD transactions  UOB Visa Signature must be either PAYWAVE or Applepay/Googlepay (contactless payment).,btohqsg
Actually there‚Äôs very little tracking required. Unless you want to go down to exact milesMost 4mpd cards have a cap. Just need to watch the cap via the banking app.Spending categories wise  after awhile  you will instinctively know which is which already,btohqsg
u need to track actively if sharing among humans  later easily burst the cap.,btohqsg
SC bonus saver bill payment interest- if I use local transfer to transfer credit to my credit card account. Does it consider as bill payment? If not  how should I do ?,btohqsg

Any idea how long the rate will last? I can‚Äôt find the info any where üòÖ,btohqsg
hi i am interested but which link,btohqsg
landing page of HSBC EGA.... its there...,btohqsg
i dont have an account with citibank,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just stated the % but no details of period etc,btohqsg
"you previously asked what's the interest rate of HSBC EGA and ""I can‚Äôt find the info any where""not sure what website have you been looking at  wanna share?",btohqsg
But i applied the citi cash back cc with singsaver . Please let me know if i cam go for this promo too ?,btohqsg
Usually most banks will give clear info  this one has no other info except this paragraph,btohqsg
Just wondering anyone has this account and can give more info like how long the 3.55 will last etc,btohqsg
"i think should do basic homework first. the earlier questions like ""what's the rate"" and ""no details of promo"" suggests insufficient attempt at finding out basic information at their webpage.....",btohqsg
the T&C is there on their website  answering all the questions you may have :),btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok never mind I will call the bank,btohqsg
no wonder bank phone always jammed because people like u,btohqsg

This is found under EXISTING customer I am a new one and the terms there don‚Äôt have this info,btohqsg
No wonder everyone say Singaporeans are quick to judge   if I never checked everything and is still clueless do u think I would come here and ask?,btohqsg

I thought this is suppose to be a friendly group  what judgemental with zero tolerance here,btohqsg
"because you need to be holding the EGA account to take part in this promotion. you can't SMS to HSBC without holding an EGA account  hence they call it ""existing HSBC customers""",btohqsg
‚ÄúMust hold an eligible account and register within 1st to 29th Feb.‚Äù Coz this bonus interest is only valid for people with EGA not new to bank promo  of coz it‚Äôs for EXISTING,btohqsg
i beg to differ. these string of queries  unfortunately showed little to no homework done.... and none of which revealed you're new to HSBC either.,btohqsg

Hi all  i read the uob rising dragon promo ends on 31 Mar. I havent done the zero out account thing yet. If i were to zero out before 29 feb  then i register for this promo  then i put in 100k into the one account  i can get $588 provided that i dont touch the funds for 4 months. Is this right?,btohqsg
cannot.. compare with 31 dec balance,btohqsg
What does it mean? So one year can only zero out one time for such promo?,btohqsg
means you need to hang around in here more often as we will say when to look out for the next promo haha..,btohqsg
Based on incremental fresh funds compared against day end balance on 31 Dec. Can do twice a year with one account I guess.,btohqsg
My not embark. Hope to see it by tomorrow.,btohqsg
Just curious  why one year can only do twice? How did you calculate?,btohqsg
If I only have one account and doing this alone;I signed up for Jan promo  money will be earmarked till May. I can only zero out the account in June and take part again for July-Sep promo.

CRMC for miles  UOB absolute  Citi cashback+ and cashbackBut im not sure whether splitting of payments will be allowed,btohqsg

Hi everyone  in this video chris mention a hack/trick to immediately get back the shopback cashback from the merchant that you wont be returning to(lets say 25cent shopback amount).

You can have $0 in the account  and the bank can‚Äôt charge you $5 for fall below.If you have $5 inside  they will take away from you next month on about 5th of month. üòÅ,btohqsg
It will be negative if u had 0 and was charged the fall below fee,btohqsg
It didn‚Äôt happened to me. They only charge me when I have money inside.If $0  their system will just not deduct that $5.,btohqsg
This is correct. But they may close the account anytime,btohqsg

Hi seeking the wisdom of everyone here. What's the best option to grow a $150k fund. I've used up moomoo  tigr and webull welcome promo. Monthly spend around $350.I'll be using the fund in 2 years for downpayment of a house. Is the best option still t-bill without forcing myself to spend $500 to qualify for the high savings interest?,btohqsg
maybe the GE SP Series 12 for 3.50% p.a. for 2 years,btohqsg
seedly made a recent post abt this. If i nvr rmbr wrongly hong leong had a 3 % 3 month 20k program,btohqsg
Ok will look into this  sounds attractive as it's capital guaranteed for 2 years Vs shorter period for t-bill. Thank you üòä,btohqsg
Just received snack $400 voucher for 4 Dec to 1 Jan challenge üôè,btohqsg
Same. But the current challenge so little vouchers only,btohqsg
The $0.25 goes to shopback balance  not tied to the stall. Essentially you get $0.25 - $0.10 = $0.15 without visiting the stall again. You may use the balance to offset future shopback purchases or withdraw to your bank at $10 min.,btohqsg
Of course lah. Their marketing budget not infinity,btohqsg
It works well for high cashback merchants at 7% and high bill amount. Maybe you paid for your friends bill of $100 total  $7 pending cashback and shopback the merchant another $0.10  you get $6.90 net.,btohqsg
now I laugh at my friends who were skeptical,btohqsg
Don't need to laugh. Just personal choice.,btohqsg
Yeaa I withdraw right after it was invested but loss about 20$. But in returns 400$ back. Pretty worth it,btohqsg
As in u initiated withdrawal immediately after investing?,btohqsg
Interesting  I thought they would just void the initial investment  rather than settle the investment then redeem it (which explains the small slippage of $20). Thanks for the DP.,btohqsg

Last week  I went jb. I changed ringgit rate 3.485  changed in sg. But while in jb  I used trust card  conversion rate is abt 3.52.Hence may I ask your opinions  is this better by using trust card?Or is there still better than this?,btohqsg
if your vendor accepts card then of coz card but not every where can use card,btohqsg
I went shopping mall  so mostly accept trust or other cards,btohqsg
then you should just use card as it is,btohqsg
I use trust card in China & Macau cos I can‚Äôt use cash or not convenient with big purchase,btohqsg
Trust card exchange rate seemed not bad  compared to money changer  right?,btohqsg
I went to Barcelona and i didn't even change more than 100 euros cash on hand,btohqsg
i just loaded about 200 sgd into my trust account and went around paying with my phone,btohqsg
Will trust card give a better Exchange rate? As compared to say... Uob or maybank cc?,btohqsg
I missed out on the $880 deal also. Wasted,btohqsg
if you use cc they will have a 10% surcharge on top,btohqsg
tell me about it.. i found out at 11.45pm.... by the time i figured out what's going on.. i only managed to do one human $10k....at 11.58pm.. didn't have time to do second human.,btohqsg
the CNY not as high already,btohqsg
not to mention those who held one month faithfully.. also made a small profit.. i think is $30-50 depending you sold 5th feb or few days later.,btohqsg
Yeah wasted. Else enough to get new iPad,btohqsg
yes... if you really need cash  use Trust to withdraw cash from their ATM. i think got small ATM fee (not Trust fees  bc its waived)  but probably a nominal sum and becomes more economical if the withdrawal amount is larger since ATM fee is fixed,btohqsg
Can I cancel my pending last application made several days ago and reapply? Feel like I lost 50 dollars üòá,btohqsg

Anyone who didn‚Äôt receive the $400 yet but participated?,btohqsg

Hi  if I link my OCBC infinity card to the Amaze card will I get the 1.6% cashback?,btohqsg

if paying locally then no point using Amaze either  just pay direct with the infinity card,btohqsg
use at jb also not worth?,btohqsg
Anybody know a safe credit card in singapore for which it is very hard to do fraudulent transaction. Frequency of feaudulent transaction mishap on me and my wife cards over last year is crazily increasing and tells me it is so easy in usa to crack out as it does not require otp. Any advice?,btohqsg
not worth bah  might as well top up Amaze wallet directly (no cashback) and get 1% Instarem points rebate,btohqsg
no way to avoid  because the way that the fraud happens is by BIN attack. Advice is to go for a card that has responsive customer svc so that you can easily report and dispute transactions when they happen. Alternatively go for a card that you can use a one-off card number (e.g. Revolut) for online payments  but then you don't have a card that you can physically use,btohqsg
Unlock the card before you use n lock it immediately after you use.,btohqsg
What you can lock and unlock so easily?,btohqsg
I can unlock and lock my trust credit card. Their customer service quite responsive. The trust app have a chat feature. I used it when they accidentally lock my card when I in shanghai cos they suspect fraudulent transactions,btohqsg
Take note if it‚Äôs locked  recurring transactions/bills will fail. BIN attack or brute force attack is hard to avoid since it‚Äôs a mathematical issue. No choice‚Ä¶OTP requirement is not controlled by banks but by merchants. American Express is known for very good customer service but trade off is acceptance,btohqsg
There is clearly an unmet need there and it needs a disrutptive new type of cryption,btohqsg
You can use app to lock n unlock easily within seconds. U can try it on Amaze n Citi.,btohqsg

hmm.. both my humans that did the $4k (for $400) got the email exactly at 12pm  so it is likely batch generated and not manual.,btohqsg
Weird on criteria they choose who to send first as both human do same day on flash deal and in fact human that got it was done later  guess just have to wait till 29 feb for the other human acct,btohqsg
SNACK eCapitaVouchers for recent promos:- $240 by 30th Apr 2024- $880 by 31st Mar 2024- $400 by 15th Feb 2024This is what I was told  so if your second human didn't get the $400 the same time as your first human  i think something might have gone wrong.,btohqsg
They are some other in other group that mention they din get it as well when they join the flash deal in dec,btohqsg
hmm.. i see.. ok i guess since this is the first fulfilment let's observe and see but if both humans did same time  i would have expected either both to get or both not to get today at 12pm.,btohqsg
Coz my friend that we join the flash deal together din receive in email as well.  the tnc of challenge have also change to by 29 feb get voucher for the 4k get 400.,btohqsg

My understanding is:1).Avoidusing UOB Krisflyer2).Don‚Äôtpay via Kris+ pay.If agency allowed  pay $1 to test out the mcc code first. If it is mcc 4722  pay S$3k per month across few months using Lady.,btohqsg
Chan Brother confirm can.You just need to pay the downpayment firstThen you can monthly contact the relevant country team to email you Red Dot payment links.I have been using that to max out my UOB Lady Travel category.,btohqsg
Does down payment consider as well?,btohqsg
chan brother (NON KRIS+) is all 4722... at shop and red dot online,btohqsg
May I ask what is red dot payment?,btohqsg
payment facilitator that chan brother uses to collect payment online,btohqsg
Why can‚Äôt pay via kris+ pay though? Isit cause payment via kris+ doesn‚Äôt qualify as a travel category?,btohqsg
