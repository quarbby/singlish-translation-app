hahahaha..the real one wouldn't care for $250 UOB payout,btohqsg
I think it may work although nobody try before. UOB may ignore 01 May(PH) n calculate from 02 May onwards. Let us know if it work once it is earmarked. At least got 1 dp as reference.Edited: I mean top up another $35 today or tomorrow.,btohqsg
Meaning yesterday  I must hv 150084.79 in the Bank?,btohqsg
I mean top up another $35 today or tomorrow.,btohqsg

Yup.. just have that and register this month. Earmark next month.,btohqsg

Feel bad for my mistake ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
You register again in May to overwrite for april. End May balance >$150084..79.,btohqsg

not sure if it helps. I was short of a few dollars for min salary requirements. after calling the customer service  it was managed to appeal after a week.,btohqsg
Thx.. Maybe I should call tomorrow to appeal,btohqsg

Uob one usually 2nd day  stash is first day of month,btohqsg
Hi all  for the Moomoo 6.8% promo  do yall choose to subscribe to the Fullerton SGD cash fund or liquidity fund? Why?,btohqsg
both the same tbh since they will match to 6.8% anyway,btohqsg
then technically liquidity fund is better since there's same day settlement right?,btohqsg
Has anyone received the IRAS income tax bill for 2024 yet?,btohqsg

Anyone has faced a similar issue where u can't link a MasterCard to amaze? Error message card issuer rejected,btohqsg
I also no receive. Maybe IRaS forgot about us ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I always thought the tax bill will run from May to April of following year. So kinda strange that we don't need to pay yet if not yet received the bill?,btohqsg
Hmm some years back mine is June to May,btohqsg
