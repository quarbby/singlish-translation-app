idt they have postgrad in what i wanna study tho,btohqsg
Yaaa most places masters in english,btohqsg
cos i studying comms in uni,btohqsg
so postgrad the popular options are like CMU  LSE  university of amsterdam  USC,btohqsg
The only worry is if i come back sg i scared my degree not recognised,btohqsg
Yea but the unis i aiming lower than ntu nus,btohqsg
Tbh if yours is sth like engineering or computing I think your exp matters more,btohqsg
I think if you go to schs like zurich,btohqsg
But if its humanities then yea abit worrying ig,btohqsg
Oh i thinking of econs/biz haha,btohqsg
Got one YouTube channel guy from there,btohqsg
Anyway if i can learn german  i can apply to belgium  switzerland and germany so why not haha,btohqsg
i would go straight to japan if they had any sort of competitive postgrad programs but they dont,btohqsg
Better to have the options open to u,btohqsg
Yea its q unconventional so nervous,btohqsg
Ask your sch ecg on what the German unis look out for,btohqsg
Bruh they dont even know unis there are free,btohqsg
I can go look at them once my uni cycle over,btohqsg
I want to get away from the heat,btohqsg
Fk columbia asking for 2000 words,btohqsg
I think if econs and biz then might as well stay in SG over Aus,btohqsg
so he recommends u move to a country where every living thing is trying to kill you,btohqsg
Isnt foreign work experience imp for biz haha,btohqsg
Cus he pr there so he biased,btohqsg
I think its more that aus unis aren't that prestigious in sg? Idk,btohqsg
i mean some of the better aus unis are not bad,btohqsg
but imo if can go local then just go local over aus,btohqsg
Yeaa there's that impression but I think if you market yourself I think it shld be okay (?) Another thing to consider is how much of biz is intertwined with tech rn,btohqsg
Tbh if people from malaysian unis can get hired in sg  i think a citizen with a foreign degree stands a good chance too,btohqsg
Which is why our local unis are shilling this intersection between biz and computing so much,btohqsg
But ofc if u wna stay aus long term then ofc getting a degree there is the best,btohqsg
im sick of that term being thrown around HAHA,btohqsg
It's not just a sg thing,btohqsg
Yea its best to study in the country u wanna live,btohqsg
Every uni throws that shit arnd,btohqsg
But i might wanna get pr in another countru,btohqsg
ok cyall gonna go japan bb,btohqsg
But I do think one huge benefit of our local unis is the cost and how they're p generous w unbonded scholarship,btohqsg
I alw hear horror stories from US about the debt crisis and stuff,btohqsg
I think debt to go uni is rly no joke,btohqsg
studying now ah but honestly no course in japan really interests me for uni,btohqsg
Some overseas uni are free so i still debating,btohqsg
i plan to do student exchange tho,btohqsg
Unless there's specific requirements to hit,btohqsg
Well u need to know tue langauge,btohqsg
"tbh sg is just ""score well for as""",btohqsg
And well i have 2 years of national privilege before then,btohqsg
if all else fails  sign on,btohqsg
Ns good to buff apps.... if you play the pes game,btohqsg
don't you want to have a career filled with adventure,btohqsg
