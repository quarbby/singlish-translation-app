ok its basically aptitude based admission,btohqsg
nah it’s just my course maybe saw i’m near the cutoff so i had to do the test to see if they want me. not aba,btohqsg
where u are not strong academically,btohqsg
Into that course of ur choice,btohqsg
Then u have to go thru several rounds,btohqsg
it’s basically having other achievements to buffer your acad results,btohqsg
Does having a research paper published help,btohqsg
i mean published is vague but sure,btohqsg
if you have a published paper in a journal that’s insane,btohqsg
if it’s like presented in a fair or conference then that’s good too,btohqsg
Working towards that but fimding the right mentors,btohqsg
Im thinking abt attending IMUN but i scared waste money,btohqsg

tbh just try your best to do well then cold email people to see if they can take you in during holidays so you at least have results to back up you have aptitude,btohqsg
Im crying i cold email all the jc in sg to promote comps (long story short the more signups i get the more mentoring hours i get),btohqsg
I didnt even receive 1 email saying they received my email,btohqsg
I mass emailed like 1k plus US unis and i got like 10 bot responses,btohqsg
Dun ask me how i got the list,btohqsg
I still dh an actual response,btohqsg
oh  my cold email idea was smth else. like if you want to get research experience and do well enough in sch you can try to approach scientists from astar for example,btohqsg
My portfolio and resume not stable,btohqsg
that’s why i say to have results to show at least,btohqsg
My EC all in the making,btohqsg
Is this during the hols usually or during sch,btohqsg
sch hols bc you’d be doing it like a full time thing. it’s more common to use prelim results to ask to do smth after a levels tho so you can do for longer,btohqsg
But i needa do it before i apply for college,btohqsg
And i shld alr be starting to write my college app like during feb alr cause eoy i got a level,btohqsg
So im thinking i shld be doing the research in yr 1,btohqsg

How u usually email the prof aaheadhead of time,btohqsg
U liek send your results and accomplishments,btohqsg
Omg if i got any college app qns can i dm u T.T i cld use some help,btohqsg
i mean you gotta show you understand what research they’re doing and show genuine interest for it  along with sufficient foundation knowledge. Ask if they’re taking in any interns (and for what timeframe) and if so would they consider you. then link your stuff,btohqsg
uh idk how much i can help but sure. i can ask my good friend in the states who’s studying to be a vet there,btohqsg
Ahhhhh atp im stressing more abt the application than the grades itself,btohqsg
