Uh u have to borrow/lend one,btohqsg
Oh sch pld is not buy from sch ah?,btohqsg

study and u shld be good(?) idk,btohqsg
im a borderline idiot so i can say this,btohqsg
quite hard to get urself  need ask cher,btohqsg
i had a whole stack of other sch math ppr lol,btohqsg
some of my subjs dont even have tys lmao,btohqsg
Erm it’s easy for u coz u not in nt?,btohqsg
well one of yall got it at least,btohqsg
Relatively it is hard coz people are in nt are slower,btohqsg
bro a few days ago i got roasted for counting 13-4 with my fingers,btohqsg
i think i qualify as slow ah,btohqsg
i rfi to 4 then he raise to 12,btohqsg
Didn't your parents force u to use the abacus to learn or smth,btohqsg
i was like eh how much to call 12 11 10 9,btohqsg
End up Their mental sum op,btohqsg
I find mental sum btr for me,btohqsg
Like idk why even tho I have a calculator beside me,btohqsg
i know someone that’s like super good at those card and strategy board games like can even card count and all,btohqsg
but if she needs to do like actual math,btohqsg
Either talent or the person grind a lot,btohqsg
I rmb got some equation one,btohqsg
For probability to get better hand,btohqsg
i more of a play the man kind,btohqsg
but most of the time ik he bluffing but cannot even fight,btohqsg
i mean as someone frm nt b4. our syallbus fking watered down. take math for example  some of our qns just requries us to throw the qns in the calculator and is worth 1 mark. so yes to ppl frm na/express is gna be easy for them. then fir us NT students it will be diffucult. obvs nt the calculate oni qns. our nt syallbus is basically express sec 1 sec 2 work.,btohqsg
huh but keying things into the calculator is hard meh,btohqsg
aiya is fine. i seen my math cher count wif fingers b4 LOL,btohqsg
There are people that don’t know how to google for ans,btohqsg
nope just example tht nt papers are easy,btohqsg
Alot of ppl my time used to use photomath,btohqsg
imagine you were a fking baby,btohqsg
my pri sch did. i didnt understand shit,btohqsg
i go find nt math qns,btohqsg
I didn't learn mental sum thru abacus,btohqsg
I see the uh times table,btohqsg
I memorize for most of it,btohqsg
But somehow somewhat when it comes to more complicated ones,btohqsg
One day I just can visualise the numbers,btohqsg
Like uk how kids have to draw out to calculate,btohqsg
Overtime it's just there in my brain,btohqsg
tbh idek how i learned my mental sum,btohqsg
like i did learn abacus but the technique all return alr,btohqsg
nowadays i actually prefer not to use mental sum for my work,btohqsg
i’d rather just document each and every step,btohqsg
this the new syallbus but i did for prac b4. this the last qns aka the hardest qns.,btohqsg
Is that how u fucked up hours of calculation,btohqsg
cause u relied on mental sum,btohqsg
but since im horrible at math  i was struggling,btohqsg
Maths is like gym for your mind,btohqsg
Eh are u asking or saying,btohqsg
Like how bedok go gym to build muscle,btohqsg
People do maths to build their mind,btohqsg
like for matrix a x b =/= b x a so if i’m not careful it’s all fucked,btohqsg
Ok you aren't exactly wrong  it's stereotypical but there's some truth to that,btohqsg
thing is my stuff is legit damn easy to get careless bc i’m doing like 16 part equation that can look similar,btohqsg
so by the end my eyes blur alr,btohqsg
i showed atarax a bit of it before,btohqsg
Like love ones sick need take care,btohqsg
but then also my cher say passing is 45% and above lol for n's itself. so if u r failing during n level theres smtg wrong,btohqsg
If it's that bad...and the higher ups didn't hear or they did but cover up..,btohqsg
I’m from sec 5 and I’m lazy,btohqsg
lol you going to sch is like me going overseas,btohqsg
it's kinda ironic when sch is meant to be our 2nd home,btohqsg
Or that's what they always say,btohqsg
my sch was more guai so can’t comment,btohqsg
the gangsters nt will help their own classmates,btohqsg
Is legit ssb know them one Ah,btohqsg
I feel like how u say yp,btohqsg
If they have a xmm it's full fledged yp alrd,btohqsg
I wonder if theres yp who sign on,btohqsg
lol i ever inew this idiot,btohqsg
No fucking way bud just said it out of the blue,btohqsg
Sekali also end up in the chain,btohqsg
hahaha i of no threat la,btohqsg
she’s not a threat either fr,btohqsg
i’m agreeing with your own assessment of yourself,btohqsg
he’d rather take a nap at home,btohqsg
i apply alr  but they sure throw my application 1 side hahaha,btohqsg
Just reminding u in case u ever feel the need to speak up again,btohqsg
sometimes some things are better left unsaid,btohqsg
I'll be sure to make u a handicap next time,btohqsg
i’m so scared i’m getting chills down my spine,btohqsg
That's the way it shld be,btohqsg
i tot was some nsf all along sia,btohqsg
Im told I talk like a guy,btohqsg
yea u talk like a guy,btohqsg
i think it’s typically just safer to assume guy,btohqsg
idk why people think girl means xmm way of typing LOL,btohqsg
Mostly sg girls are like that,btohqsg
That's why social media is bad,btohqsg
Wah maybe when I sign on,btohqsg
Is bye a guy or girl,btohqsg
it’s like if not xmm way of typing we just assume guy,btohqsg
but nothing about it is actly a guy thing,btohqsg
Is bye a guy or girl,btohqsg
but Ive nvr heard of it before,btohqsg
In between kuro and si Yan age,btohqsg
tbh I still dk what's a nsf,btohqsg
what is this e lit analysis,btohqsg
I just know you must be someone who's gotta be in NS or was in NS before,btohqsg
If you ever mentioned that term,btohqsg
if done with reservist then is MR,btohqsg
Ya sia I wish I was like kuro,btohqsg
no wonder you so good at telling grandfather story,btohqsg
I can't believe someone like you took lit,btohqsg
That's actly alot to take in  process and absorb,btohqsg
How can your GP suck if u took lit,btohqsg
wah shit I should filter my words,btohqsg
it should somewhat help u to apply GP skills btr,btohqsg
If only you took pure lit,btohqsg
We would have seen a diff kuro,btohqsg
i think i'll go deaf b4 i actly learn anyt,btohqsg
if it’s like lecture hall big then it makes sense,btohqsg
but if it’s classroom then 💀,btohqsg
even my ite lecturer doesn’t use mic in class,btohqsg
some of my cher does not all,btohqsg
my (former) biz math teacher uses it,btohqsg
Now it's up to your own interpretation whether I wish I was actually affected or just affected,btohqsg
Omg but I ship jean and diluc,btohqsg
I wonder if they are gg get tgth,btohqsg
may i ask   is this correct ?,btohqsg
Oh I'm at a diff fairprice,btohqsg
time of the year to get new clothes pein,btohqsg
Hello again ur just gonna be the snr I ask qns to now haha. Do I need buy graphical calculator? And what’s the difference between that and normal calculator,btohqsg
if ur taking h2 math )/h1math need graphing calculator,btohqsg
difference is graphing calculator can draw graphs while normal calculator cannot,btohqsg
if you cannot afford write in to your school admin they will either let you buy at a discounted price or loan from sch then return after a lvl,btohqsg
huh where got such thing one,btohqsg
Hi anybody wants to buy prime drinks?,btohqsg
my sch sells at 177 but some ppl cannot afford then they say write to sch email if cannot afford,btohqsg
because some ppl really struggling with finances,btohqsg
imo no cause ltr ur calculator keesiao then you buy from carousell theres no warranty,btohqsg
then have to buy new one again,btohqsg
It's 175 for 3 years and potentially longer,btohqsg
So look at it as an investment,btohqsg
I remember i go my orientation thy said is 177,btohqsg
If you're doing stem you still need your gc anyway.... I'm still using my gc from mi lmao it's been over half a decade,btohqsg
someone posted the uni courses requirements right,btohqsg
"You may google ""Indicative Grade Profile"" to find out.For some of the local unis:https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp)https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/indicative-grade-profilehttps://admissions.smu.edu.sg/admissions-requirements/indicative-grade-profilehttps://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Application/Admission-RequirementsIndicative grade profile gives you the minimum score you need (look at the 10th percentile) to enter the course.If you go deeper into each course  you will find additional information in their undergraduate programs and the requirements.",btohqsg
now cny i craving bak kwa ex af,btohqsg
Ive nvr touched a bak kwa ever again,btohqsg
Those choosing a level subject combis can take note also…,btohqsg
dont later want to go med or other courses then realise cannot enter,btohqsg
I mean I went into hybrid knowing full well med is gone case,btohqsg
any1 gone overmugged tuition center before?,btohqsg
But like fr idt I can go med ever,btohqsg
Bro me readin the requirements 💀,btohqsg
1 H2 sci + H2 maths,btohqsg
Alrd open q alot of doors,btohqsg
I take art stream but iw take hybrid,btohqsg
I alrd know that the moment I took pure bio lol,btohqsg
Nah bruh I just hate lit,btohqsg
Depends on how strict the sch is and stuff,btohqsg
Cause thy say need raw 11 or less,btohqsg
But like all the subj iw take,btohqsg
All a1 to b3 range results fr o lvl,btohqsg
So iw see whether can ykyk,btohqsg
R U actually from tm btw,btohqsg
But if can see whether cn go h2 in j2,btohqsg
But i gna try appeal to cj,btohqsg
nus no phy req  but still  u probably have a lot to catch up,btohqsg
I mean iw take phy but i,btohqsg
Thts why i opt fr art stream,btohqsg
ur sch all phy combis with chem ah,btohqsg
Ya is chem + any other sci,btohqsg
can do like h2 phy + h1 chem then can safely throw away chem under 70 rp system,btohqsg
He was the principal in my old sec sch,btohqsg
I did not want to see him again,btohqsg
I mean the most flamed principal rn is nyjc's,btohqsg
Bye la what R the odds,btohqsg
Idk ah but i got see the jp student complain,btohqsg
HOW MUCH HE LIKES TO YAP,btohqsg
He was talking fr 30min straight eh,btohqsg
Idk how he does it without his mouth goin dry,btohqsg
Isok every morning my VP also yap,btohqsg
Hes like a NPC trying to be main chara,btohqsg
I was counting the time he talked from like 7 44 to 8 25 or so,btohqsg
I saw so mny people on their phone,btohqsg
I was talkin to the ogls in my grp,btohqsg
Eh do every JC have that,btohqsg
Bro n idl how the lecturers talk as if the art stream like,btohqsg
At least TM principal yaps is like,btohqsg
Wthell do ppl still do that,btohqsg
Cuz his personality is pretty nice so it's hard to be angry,btohqsg
Cause math h2 isnt compulsary fr art,btohqsg
But vp yaps is more like,btohqsg
Some not close auntie yapping abt Ur weight or no rs,btohqsg
Then gt the math hod imply tht they shldnt take h2 if they arent qualified,btohqsg
n btr off take h1 ig,btohqsg
I mean H2 maths is legit cracked compared to h1,btohqsg
Or maybe im reading too much into it,btohqsg
Lit has killed all my braincells,btohqsg
Ukw if U like the subjs,btohqsg
Afaik if U can take physics n chem as h2,btohqsg
Then it'll legit open q a few doors in stem side la if U R int in that,btohqsg
MY PRINCIPAL ALSO CALLED MR ANF,btohqsg
Isok idm U yapping abt econs,btohqsg
Pls yap to me abt econs 🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
I need absorb all tht info,btohqsg
That's what I can speak for,btohqsg
Disclaimer I obv DK JP topic order,btohqsg
If they weird fuck then gg,btohqsg
J1 shld be micro  j2 macro,btohqsg
The main diff betw H1 n H2 is the,btohqsg
Content diff not that much tbh,btohqsg
U tell me whther weird ah but jp math start with vectors,btohqsg
Bro does not want to be there,btohqsg
Cj pls accept my appeal 🤗,btohqsg
Everyone and their mother say fuck vectors,btohqsg
Ok anyw basically both H1 and H2 got CSQ (case study qn),btohqsg
Is abit like Ur sbq for SS la,btohqsg
lol quite a few jcs do that cos apparently they say they start with the hardest topic to allow students 2 yrs to digest vectors (*then there’s me who proceeds to get both vector qns for my year wrong*),btohqsg
bruh apparently TM does that long time ago,btohqsg
But my batch is graphing tech,btohqsg
1 is for csq  the other is essay,btohqsg
SO I WS GOING THROUGH THT ABIT,btohqsg
@chemcerhow they inform u if u can take fmath,btohqsg
They turn up at ur doorstep,btohqsg
nani that one easiest chap liao,btohqsg
Ik but I legit hate it,btohqsg
then how u do rest of h2 math rip,btohqsg
Idk if it helps la but,btohqsg
Last time I went for TSD diagnostic,btohqsg
i nvr got any call from tm,btohqsg
ah then u should take uni econs we love spamming calculus,btohqsg
To say I made it la,btohqsg
if u take uni econs wht jobs cn u pursue?,btohqsg
They may give U structured qns,btohqsg
But they may give for Ur wa or wtv to help boost grades xd,btohqsg
do u think tuition is vry helpful,btohqsg
Cause economics is about trying to maximise utility/profits/public welfare given limited resources mah. So you got a shit ton of optimisation problems. So how to solve optimisation problems? Calculus lor,btohqsg
For me I see it as extra practice and revision,btohqsg
Then like can U cope w the material yourself,btohqsg
What I can defo say is,btohqsg
Don't bother try getting tuition for everything,btohqsg
U literally won't have the time,btohqsg
yeah a level econs only learn the concepts then uni econs spam math to apply the concepts,btohqsg
For micro econs (basically econs for each market)H2 got- central economic problem- demand supply  elasticity- market failure- market structure (H2 only),btohqsg
The first 3 H1 also have,btohqsg
Funny thing is prereq to uni econs is not econs but math lol,btohqsg
So tbh the content discount for H1,btohqsg
Do yall think being a lawyer is good 😭😭😭 like i think its like an asian stereotype fr parents to want their children to be lawyers,btohqsg
