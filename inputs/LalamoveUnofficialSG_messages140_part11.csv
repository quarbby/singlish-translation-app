Hi bosses  anyone used getgo for LLM jobs? Need some queries. Am new to this .. 🙏🙏,btohqsg
I really don’t advise using GetGo but may want to use Shariot instead.- GetGo don’t need to fork out money for petrol but will charge you for distance travelled.-Shariot use your own money to top up petrol however only pay for the usage of the car depending on how many hours you booked.,btohqsg
Stay home with ur family better. Dun waste ur time with LLM.,btohqsg
That’s why lor. Rather than you use car sharing  you might as well rent a car outside and do. A whole lot cheaper. Just that jobs nowadays really sucky.,btohqsg
Any lobang for can rental? 🙏,btohqsg
Bro! Remember  it’s a commitment for as long as you rent the car. 😅 You might want to ask the other old timers here how are the rates nowadays. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
True that. Haha totally understandable..Btw  getgo i thought got hourly rate too?,btohqsg
GetGo & Shariot are hourly based. But petrol is bourne differently. 😅,btohqsg
Rent car to do LLM is a waste of ur life.  Monetary wun make any diff but ur precious time do n a lot.,btohqsg
How to compete with worker with zero overhead. Work die u still lose out.  Try others,btohqsg
Agreed. Unless you own a car  then it’s your choice whether you wanna do or not.,btohqsg
Rather than LLM  I’d suggest you try FP or GF. 😅,btohqsg
That’s how bad LLM is right now. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Pls dun rent car or van to do llm.,btohqsg
Hais.. thats sad to hear that.. as im new to all these.. haha getting some research from all the experiences from you all,btohqsg
One of the few old birds has spoken.,btohqsg
Ive been here since pre-covid. And the rates were much much better then. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
U better believe else gd luk to u with the contracts,btohqsg
Will take note. Really appreciate for sharing 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Haha any lobang not for part time? 😅,btohqsg
Try other platforms. I heard Roo  FP & GF not bad.,btohqsg
Hmm okay.. will take a look.. 🙃Thanks alot,btohqsg
We don’t want you to suffer Bro. That’s why we advise as such.,btohqsg
Haha ya  i do understand. Luckily got 3 cents of advices from you all.. else drop inside blackhole lol,btohqsg
HAHAHA! At least you bother to ask and do research. Some blind kuku straight away sign up and jump into the massive black hole. Then stuck with contracts.,btohqsg
Haha did see and hear from some.. confirm need do proper research.. 🙃 else die hard 😂,btohqsg
bad. motorcycle non peak hour 4 dollars,btohqsg
Some bugger order car delivery for this one just now. Somemore can said try fold,btohqsg
N separately for car orders  please try to avoid taking orders to or from Arab street area at least for this 1 month. I took one earlier and traffic is horrible where alot of the minor roads are close due to the bazaar. To find 1 space to park and quickly send order is tough.If its the North Bridge Road side  still not so bad.,btohqsg
LLM cheating drivers again. I thought this weekend got scheduled surcharge? How come I see all never include the surcharge? And yet drivers are still accepting the jobs? Haiz! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Check again. Not all orders have. Those that have don’t have base fares. 🤔,btohqsg
So it’s either have base fare + no scheduled fee or no base fare + scheduled fee. KNN!,btohqsg
ohh   those are lalamove special orders   not included,btohqsg
only normal orders and oddles have,btohqsg
If want rent car or van do llm  might as well be subcon send parcels. My opinion lah.,btohqsg
Feddup until now i nvr get,btohqsg
Hw much that earns haahah curious,btohqsg
Champion 🥴 really not shy to request..,btohqsg
Yes customer probably tried n tested..so sad to see such orders..,btohqsg
I m curious how to fit everything into one car..I hope the ceiling fans are small ones..,btohqsg
I see so many pooling jobs pickup in my area but I can't bear to accept those jobs🥴cos cannot decide what time to pick up n deliver..the pick up in 2hrs n drop off in 4hrs too deep in my head😅,btohqsg
Everyone be safe on the roads 🙏,btohqsg
More parcels more money lor. So must find good friend or boss that can offer better price or salary.,btohqsg
Which is hw much haahah on avg/hr,btohqsg
What nonsense is this   whole month earn 16XX- return back 60 cents ..do i go to their office or email them ? Anyone have any idea ?,btohqsg
Or write in to ntuc union,btohqsg
If u tally your contribution and llm app cpf contribution got a lot less,btohqsg
80% less than what stated in app,btohqsg
Don't know where the cpf goes to. Llm press wrongly the figure maybe,btohqsg
Go down office tally with them better,btohqsg
