Theft maybe one year and the above reckless driving also get one year,btohqsg
There was that one guy convicted of drug driving after killing a family of 4 otw to send off at the airport. He got 5 yrs  the worst I've seen in terms of driver vs road fatality,btohqsg
He took drugs? Or drunk driving,btohqsg
Also it was mentioned here the ppl who got flung out of the car were not wearing seatbelts. I wonder if in the case of the Tampines incident  the person(s) (forgot if there’s 1 or 2) weren’t wearing,btohqsg
Nope cte fatal accident all 4 died,btohqsg
Just read the other msgs you’ll understand the confusion,btohqsg
He was saying tmjc instead of tjc,btohqsg
is there any geog student here that is not valerie,btohqsg
If you talking about current students only,btohqsg
I need clarify one part of the syllabus,btohqsg
Idk why cpdd always makes the syllabus doc confusing,btohqsg
Wait Valerie do u have the waste as a potential resource thingy,btohqsg
hi does any1 take h1 geog i need help,btohqsg
Oh she asked me for help last time,btohqsg
Ohya I also got somewhat help,btohqsg
You need to find h2 geog students ah,btohqsg
THE DEMAND PLACED ON NATURAL ENVIROENT,btohqsg
demand placed on natural environment when waste is not viewed as a potential resource,btohqsg
idk xuz my cher say 3 body paragraphs den need like 2 case studies,btohqsg
like one positive and one negative,btohqsg
so long as I dont see waste as something useful = i will harm the environment,btohqsg
a h1 essay is only 13m,btohqsg
they said u should do that,btohqsg
one gp essay has about 12 examples,btohqsg
a gp essay has 30m of content,btohqsg

the demand placed on the environment,btohqsg
EJ h1 MYE is GI + Urban,btohqsg
Ya its better than having nth,btohqsg
Are they saying something like they dump the waste in the environment,btohqsg
EJ for some reason refuses to send me their 3.1 notes,btohqsg
do uw me to talk abt the societal perception,btohqsg
"because the way its phrased is like a societal perception (inherent in the phrase ""potential resource"")",btohqsg
I thought with your connections your chers should have no qualms,btohqsg
but in the grand scheme of things it seems like the tangible phenomenon,btohqsg
I wanted to ask my Econs Cher for notes but she said she can’t send to ex students,btohqsg
Nvm I too dumb to comprehend this,btohqsg
we could use it IF we wanted to,btohqsg
but if u unpack WHY its potential,btohqsg
its mainly cause of societal perception (for waste at least),btohqsg
I mean you can go the angle of,btohqsg
countries are not financially capable of turning waste into an actual resource,btohqsg
Oh ok then the phrasing there is so weird,btohqsg
I mean the case study theyre thinking of,btohqsg
Do you want me to try my luck with mine,btohqsg
Feel like this is mentioned in my notes b4,btohqsg
Im gonna drop the ej one another text,btohqsg
How should I phrase my request ah,btohqsg
yeah cuz thats what its probably talking abtThe idea that our wastewater is seen as unusable until some genius saw it as a potential resource so turned it into like drinkable water,btohqsg
Cos I don’t even know what portion of the syllabus is that,btohqsg
