I mean i gets and 1.25rp may heavily affect more for some  less on others (depends on how one looks at it and ofc some ppl really just aim for 90rp n nth less)‚Ä¶but others may view this as insensitive because that is still a rather decent score (even if i actually went to read the prev posts),btohqsg
lmao got sum1 banned from cabin club n his still here,btohqsg
I wonder if this story is even real,btohqsg
Even MI has no D for PW,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs true probably from YI,btohqsg
Like I seriously haven‚Äôt heard a single person getting D for PW before,btohqsg
I dun think D is even existent,btohqsg
C is the lowest and even then most schs don‚Äôt have a single C in any given year,btohqsg
Unless that dude really did 0,btohqsg
I‚Äôm guessing that story is fake or that person is just exaggerating stuff,btohqsg
Fr what i heard  the lowest a slacker actually will get is C,btohqsg
The story sounds confusing ngl‚Ä¶he wun be talking about 88.75 vs 90 rp if it is yi/mi‚Ä¶and also an elite school wun hv slackers as described,btohqsg
‚Äúoffended‚Äù u just know its a woman+retarded,btohqsg
He is crying  you need to find a way to fix him,btohqsg
it's not child porn la dei,btohqsg
I'm shipping the 2 of u,btohqsg
are you using english grammar to type chinese,btohqsg
but the white part oso not white enuff,btohqsg
my brain is not braining as always,btohqsg
i read peelable as peeable due to the many colourful lines on my screen,btohqsg
Ah yes you got the Samsung poison?,btohqsg
This is peak humor for 04 and younger,btohqsg
reminds me when sum guy in my class was surprised android cld export videos in 4k,btohqsg
You personally know at least one?,btohqsg
When you learn of the HDB=Hide Dig and Bury joke,btohqsg
goddam singpass sent me 3 different physical mail,btohqsg
1 for activation  1 for face scan  1 for changing of password,btohqsg
Collapse during OP + join sch late so penalise,btohqsg
But for the collapse part why didn‚Äôt they let that person retake? I thought it‚Äôs out of their control,btohqsg
She got hospitalised also I think,btohqsg
I‚Äôm surprised the sch didn‚Äôt cover,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why  ppl who get like close to raw 20 but insist on taking a levels instead of poly should just go to MI instead,btohqsg
what if they live east tho,btohqsg
Is it worth the travel time,btohqsg
Idk then  but if they rly want to take a levels having a sch is still better than doing everything private,btohqsg
But they could also consider retaking some o level subs so they can gain entry into a better tier jc,btohqsg
Jae system allows you to combine 2 years worth of o level results,btohqsg
Lowkey cringing rn at Minecraft rp videos,btohqsg
where the guy has a face cam,btohqsg
and he is js reading the lines,btohqsg
Like i can like retake o lvld,btohqsg
Combine? If you mean take two üïë levels and they take the higher marks of both  yes,btohqsg
It's no different than taking a o level subject as a Na and taking the same subject in sec 5,btohqsg
Your report book will reflect the best grade of both instance,btohqsg
But what if i took vhinese in sec 3,btohqsg
Wait until you realise  how much it cost your parents for you to go through another full year just to retake o levels,btohqsg
Ofc ill be paying nyself ah,btohqsg
O levels retaking is also reserved for people who fail particular subjects,btohqsg
So you want to improve your Mt grade  from your last score?,btohqsg
I took chinese in sec 3 and i yook the rest in sec 4,btohqsg
