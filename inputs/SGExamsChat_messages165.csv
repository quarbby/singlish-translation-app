Your nitro has no power here,btohqsg
AJ we had 70% on a year with a lot of moderation  otherwise we avg about 75%. it's okay I guess,btohqsg
my class faired the worst for PW  we got about 60% As,btohqsg
I cook   I play   I sleep,btohqsg
Does any of em include me,btohqsg
YesDepends on the modules that you're takingBut  usually  we're just using the default format (for business report  it's slightly different). Moreover  at the end of report  we're supposed to put credits and/or references  which is the hardest to do in the report but it's a must to do so (I spent like quite a few months to understand the crediting/referencing format)And for crediting/referencing  the formats are fixed that you should follow either one of them  cannot anyhow crediting/referencingSo  if anyone here is wondering how to do so  feel free to pm me and I'll send you the notes,btohqsg
Hi guys I‚Äôm graduating today and im kinda sad,btohqsg
There's a lot of tools to make referencing easier,btohqsg
Shouldn't waste time having to keep staring at citations,btohqsg

But academically it‚Äôs fine since I‚Äôm doing such I like,btohqsg
its honestly fine as long as ure consistent,btohqsg
I‚Äôm literally that one weird person in class sometimes,btohqsg
Honestly  better than what poly sounds like (to me),btohqsg
Nth wrong in being werid wad,btohqsg
U can emergency pull up ur grades cos it‚Äôs not cumulative,btohqsg
And  poly sounds like 3 years of PW,btohqsg
its okay  I didn't do v well tho,btohqsg

*laughs and cries in Yishun Innova,btohqsg
Can lah still got long way,btohqsg

some jcs weird  graduating today after practs,btohqsg
ur school got good vibes tbh,btohqsg
it's not as depressing as AJ/VJ,btohqsg
Whats ej psps idk all the jc names,btohqsg
yeah  but that was the one time I visited so idk,btohqsg
the one with the high budget and brand new campus,btohqsg
The demand was so high that literally they jumped by 2 points,btohqsg
the novelty will wear out eventually,btohqsg
when other jcs start getting their new campuses,btohqsg
EJ got a lot of budget  so they managed to poach some teachers from RJ/AJ/NJ,btohqsg
got a lot of alumni funding  and an IP intake to cap their COP high,btohqsg
How does a new sch have alumni,btohqsg
Like my Sec sch has affiliation to acjc but I can‚Äôt go in,btohqsg
in the same series of schools affiliated to CJ,btohqsg
ACJC is nice but far af from where I stay,btohqsg
U can only -2 pts from what i heard,btohqsg
You just dun score well in O‚Äôs üôÉ,btohqsg
Who knew maybe if i had gone to acjc@cauchycriterionwouldve been my senior,btohqsg
u get the assurance that ur jc won't be merged either,btohqsg
2 cca 2 affiliation 2 hmt,btohqsg
idk i wld think its v helpful HAHA,btohqsg
Well it can help you go to a sch u want,btohqsg
Can plot efficincy distribution bellcurve x axis is ur l1r5 score y axis is how much -2 helps,btohqsg
They poached a PW teacher whose class had no As,btohqsg
I would like to to explai,btohqsg
they got our PE teacher lmao,btohqsg
and a math teacher from VJ according to my friend,btohqsg
Never heard of these schs before,btohqsg
If only my sch can do that,btohqsg
Some skools can't be reached without -2,btohqsg
they cant merge religious schools anyways,btohqsg
although im lookin  forward to the day when sg population dies out:,btohqsg
Breaking: RI and HCI to merge,btohqsg
they can  but the alumni with kpkb and play the religion card,btohqsg
But sian tmr need work halfday,btohqsg
Rwachfles High School of Science and Maths,btohqsg
Big brains time guys we need to be smart to get -2 points in O level,btohqsg
The Us exist in my report book,btohqsg
So NUS without me is NS,btohqsg
Hahahaha i got letter from scdf,btohqsg
NS is a must for all,btohqsg
I dont take gp but im sure its an absolute statement,btohqsg
When u ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî don‚Äôt wanna go,btohqsg
n welcome to the HappyPill show,btohqsg
I was thinking of going there is the new campus good,btohqsg
The environment n Teachers is more impt than the campus,btohqsg
Mi would be 5 raw score sch then,btohqsg
go open house  see which sch u feel the most at home in,btohqsg
i feel most at home when im with uüòò,btohqsg
the only facility that matters to me is the library,btohqsg
ask around here  for a start,btohqsg
merged schs have a diff culture from their past schs too btw,btohqsg
but if campus got air con i happy,btohqsg
petition to give us back our air cons,btohqsg
Is it true that students from the original schools that merged schools hate each other,btohqsg
does anyone know abt dhs environment?,btohqsg
No like those that went to the merged school before they graduate,btohqsg
i wanna go bcs it sounds like a good sch and has a good culture ?? so yaa if anyone has info on gg to sch thr!!,btohqsg
aahh rly? i heard that w ejc which is why idrw to go thr now:(,btohqsg
ik for ejc jae kids cant get leadership,btohqsg
IP schools always have the problem where the school admin prioritises IP kids,btohqsg
is it rly bad discrimination or more just prejudice,btohqsg
so is it btr to aim for a non ip sch..,btohqsg
Bedok  when are going to ri?,btohqsg
idk how bad the ip jae thing is thats why,btohqsg
It's up to u if u think the opportunities in IP schools are worth it,btohqsg
More importantly  whether or not you are able to compete with the IP kids to get those opportunities,btohqsg
Yes  cause everything in school will require you to have good academics,btohqsg
Not that they're all that great  but still,btohqsg
i mean i just want to be treated fairly,btohqsg
It's not a flex  bedok deserves to go to ri  not me. üòî,btohqsg
hmm okay  i was considering thr as well maybe,btohqsg
Maybe someone who's actually been to IP school should weigh in here,btohqsg
its just its alot further for meHAHA,btohqsg
how much is nyjc cutoff tho?,btohqsg
i asking abt nyjc not ri,btohqsg
not like i want to go jc but like,btohqsg
all along i thgt nyjc cutoff is above 10,btohqsg
so harder to get in than tj?,btohqsg
if i get net 5 is it btr to try for acjc or nyjc,btohqsg
im in the east everywhr is far,btohqsg
5 may as well try RI/HC,btohqsg
i thought they hv 4 cop?,btohqsg
Did it go back to 4 already,btohqsg
5 can go VJ and NJ too though,btohqsg
But they didnt want my DSA,btohqsg
Guess they lost a value added result,btohqsg
but is the ip jae segregation so bad we shld forefeit trying for ip schs bcs of it??,btohqsg
everybody's tryna be famous  I'm just tryna find a place to hide,btohqsg
I think you're becoming a boomer!,btohqsg
usually seems that way because of the larger sample size of ip cohort,btohqsg
ohh i see  i thought i read somewhr they choose leadership before jae kids join,btohqsg
No that‚Äôs not true I‚Äôm from an ip school and we don‚Äôt have problems with that,btohqsg
I got a leadership role though,btohqsg
I'm just trying to prove a point - they try to be equal,btohqsg
even sc elections are rigged to accommodate jae kids,btohqsg
Other CCAs usually not much impact,btohqsg
there was a rumour that they selected one JAE kid to be vice pres,btohqsg
Tbh i will believe that for sc,btohqsg
they are really trying to level the playing field,btohqsg
Are u implyin that u will definitely get into dhs?,btohqsg
is tj good? it seems cool,btohqsg
it can only be described as a mixed bag,btohqsg
if you're looking for a school on the cutting edge of modernity with top notch facilities and a progressive culture,btohqsg
Do not lie  you secretly harbour intense hatred for Serangoon JC,btohqsg
then tj is not the place for you  although culture is pushing forward,btohqsg
mate I went out with somebody from SR HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
you don't have the nutjobs raging for lgbt rights in tj  so theres that,btohqsg
At least for my jc there was,btohqsg
SR collect in audi  AJ collect in hall,btohqsg
met my bmt mates and some sec sch friends too,btohqsg
Gg i tot i saw john on the train,btohqsg
the culture's not too abrasive between the merged JCs imo,btohqsg
AJ got some ppl not happy cuz SR cutoff lower la,btohqsg
Cos the other jc used to be better than the latter jcUntil the latter jc did btr than the other jc academically overtime then got feud,btohqsg
in YJ there were similar sentiments at the time,btohqsg
esp when it became known that IJs campus would be obsolete,btohqsg
reminded me of the SP aerobridge,btohqsg
there's a lot of hidden corners there too,btohqsg
What u planning to do there üòí,btohqsg
after my SHN ends u won't see me posting as much here anymore,btohqsg
dun leave me bb boy :(,btohqsg
I ain't a boys brigade boy smh,btohqsg

My service to the nation is helping to chop bad controllers,btohqsg
changi ATCs must be having a good time,btohqsg
Closing down alrd leh no meh,btohqsg
Shud be gg AELD after this current posting,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionh3 math did you have any external lessons,btohqsg
Like need go other place for lessons,btohqsg
We went to NUS in term 1 and acjc in term 2 (as in  people from other schools came to acjc),btohqsg
The latter was for an NTU lecturer  because of course NTU is too out of the way,btohqsg
You can walk in there and see urself,btohqsg
Wait so entirety of term 1 cirriculum is in nus?,btohqsg
So i can just walk in and use things like their library at any time,btohqsg
I dunno about the library  but you can walk around the campus freely,btohqsg
Oh what are the proportions of the students,btohqsg
Like around how many from rjc,btohqsg
RI and HC don‚Äôt go to the NUS lectures,btohqsg
So what were the schools from your year,btohqsg
East JCs go to NYJC instead for the NUS lecture,btohqsg
Although my teacher did say a few students dropped other h3s cause they were the only jp students there,btohqsg
Mainly the uni h3s like phy or bio,btohqsg
Very strange reason to drop H3,btohqsg
Why define your abilities by your school,btohqsg
I think she said that they felt inferior or felt a sense of elitism from the other students,btohqsg
She say sometimes its true sometimes its in your head,btohqsg
Oh well ill see for myself,btohqsg
Ill just take the test next week,btohqsg
I think my teacher said smtg like one year got 5 students then drop to 2,btohqsg
This year its 2 then to 1,btohqsg
Most people try out H3 in the start of the year,btohqsg
But to be fair small sample size to begin with,btohqsg
Then as the year goes on they see if they like it or not,btohqsg
If they don't like then they drop,btohqsg
In the end you got double A for math+ merit right,btohqsg
Is there a mark range for the grades in h3 i cant  seem to find them and i forgoy to ask my teacher,btohqsg
I doubt so  considering H3s are bell curved,btohqsg
Does anyone have the n level soft copy answer key btw for 2020,btohqsg
Wait is there mye and prelim for h3,btohqsg
I thought like small sample size no bell cirve,btohqsg
He doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about 70% of the time,btohqsg
So for prelims and mye they just give you your mark without saying merit or dist or pass right,btohqsg
Well  my school didn‚Äôt put a letter grade on it,btohqsg
So did your h3 math help you with anything,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt really done those up yet,btohqsg
I must have been fed lies,btohqsg
Cos most H3s are bell curved,btohqsg
if ur still wondering  imo it feels a bit like NP,btohqsg
What should I do if I see someone being dishonest like to the cashier?,btohqsg
U must make a decision to pretend not to see it or tell the dishonest person not to do it  or tell the cashier/authority,btohqsg
Short story :Person scanning QR code to make payment but he exit the app and showed like have a screen capture of a paid payment but it wasn't paid.,btohqsg
U must make a decision what u want to contribute to the situation,btohqsg
I tried to tell the aunty tho,btohqsg
Cuz normally if use cashless then the receipt would normally come out but it didn't,btohqsg
the only esports series I follow is GT academy,btohqsg
Ohhh cuz you need to be top tier level then can haha,btohqsg
v v tough to get in though,btohqsg
I wanted to do gaming as a career but it's like impossible cause there are better players then me :'),btohqsg
Oh i think u must join the games event and win,btohqsg
u can be gamer tuition cher,btohqsg
Or if u do more than gaming,btohqsg
stream teach help ppl move rank etc,btohqsg
It can happen but u must spend many hours training and win many games,btohqsg
get to the top of the ranks first,btohqsg
U can gain sponsers for advertistments too after u win,btohqsg
And I dress like e-girl when I twitch hehe but I don't have card so I don't own any donations hahah,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt need a card to receive actually,btohqsg
Does it help if I played league for 6years?,btohqsg
Haha depends on ur results . Duration means nothing,btohqsg

U should rlly apply for one,btohqsg
Or at the min just make a PayLah acc,btohqsg
Yea I know but hard ah,btohqsg
then u want be pro gamer,btohqsg
i can never play a game without wanting to utterly destroy their existence,btohqsg
Honestly gaming not very viable in Singapore tbh,btohqsg
If u really want u do influencing + gaming,btohqsg
I used to be like top 5 for osu HAHA,btohqsg
if u can be a pro assasin,btohqsg
Social media not really my tea,btohqsg
im killing the kids in my basement,btohqsg
Anything that needs consistent practice isnt,btohqsg
Yes of cos its not enough to stop at 50,btohqsg
Can u interact well with ppl,btohqsg
Even so it is ‚Äújust fine‚Äù.. be top 3 to secure this career line for gaming,btohqsg
funny yall wanna make a career out of gmaing tho,btohqsg
maybe its js me but i cant see a stable rice bowl HAHA,btohqsg
sounds like smth ppl would get sick of pretty quick,btohqsg
Oops I sell clothes though and survival tools on carousell üòÇ,btohqsg
and I speak with 1000 hours in TF2,btohqsg
Anything that needs consistent practice - such roles have short career lifespan,btohqsg
I think I have more than that on league HAHA,btohqsg
I'm changing my career to be a game coder alr,btohqsg
Actually ppl can publicize ur name for u right? Maybe ur social media will be simply to repost or update followers ur latest involvement or achievements lorNothing too ‚Äúsociable‚Äù about it u need to be,btohqsg
Haha so is that one of ur career pipeline?,btohqsg
All the best! It‚Äôs worth the venture haha,btohqsg
Is it that viable in sg,btohqsg
But I'm aiming for computer science in uni,btohqsg
Yeah but there arent much gaming companies in sg and most devs have horrible working conditions,btohqsg
Must ownself go and venture.. and be innovative,btohqsg
make sure u read up first,btohqsg
can be very fulfilling if u enjoy it,btohqsg
And dun follow status quo or rely on the jobs provided nor the corporate ladder,btohqsg
We can carve out our own career path in any line,btohqsg
I have been coding since 14 HAHA,btohqsg
Still many people playing basketball at cc,btohqsg
Should I stop gaming like during my exam period?,btohqsg
Tho it actually helps me with my stress level,btohqsg
Just shorten your hours when playingg,btohqsg
But one game takes like 1hr ...,btohqsg
Is up to u! If u find it purposeful or it helps u destress why not. But if it is not then pause first haha u must be honest to urself üòÇ,btohqsg
You could drop rank  then wreck the noobs and finish the game faster,btohqsg
Nah I'm joking  probably maybe play less games,btohqsg
I play like 1 game per day..,btohqsg
Who doing e math tys yearly,btohqsg

THE life story of Alex Orlyuk does not seem destined to lead to political apathy. Born in the Soviet Union to a family scarred by the Holocaust  he moved at the age of six to Tel Aviv  where he finished school and military service. He follows politics and prizes democracy. He thinks his government should do more to make peace with Palestinians  separate religion and state  and cut inequality. And yet  now 28 and eligible to vote in the past four general elections  he has never cast a ballot.His abstention  he says  is ‚Äúa political statement‚Äù on the sorry state of Israel‚Äôs politics. He does not think any of its myriad parties is likely to bring about the change he wants. Many other young Israelis share his disaffection. Just 58% of under-35s  and just 41% of under-25s  voted in the general election of 2013  compared with 88% of over-55s. No other rich country has a bigger gap in turnout between under-25s and over-55s (see chart).,btohqsg
Yet by saying this u have flexed,btohqsg
