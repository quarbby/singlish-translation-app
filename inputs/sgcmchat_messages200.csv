You know the bot was made in SGCM because it broke in 20 minutes,btohqsg
broken by the SGCM broke ass niggas spamming the bot with pics of their CRVs and Noahs,btohqsg
It's back up  do help to test,btohqsg
does the bot have a character limit LMAO,btohqsg
it's abit borked when displaying certain vehicles,btohqsg
it's having a bit of fun with the spaces ah,btohqsg
would this clash with the source website's maintenance timings by any chance,btohqsg
It should return an error if not u can check again,btohqsg
Ya from 11pm to 7am cannot use I think,btohqsg
The bot basically automates the lta checking on the browser,btohqsg
If y'all spam it too often  it will fail the captcha test,btohqsg
for SGRV users to screenshot easier,btohqsg
this is perfect for checking for fake Type Rs and M3s and Mustang 5.0s,btohqsg
I basically did it to spot lancerlutions,btohqsg
But also to identify car models that I don't recognize,btohqsg
their obese fingers won't be able to type in captchas easily so this bot helps,btohqsg
lancerlutions are q easy to spot imo,btohqsg
what's harder is trying to weed out FD2Rs from all the FD not Rs,btohqsg
yeah this one is also a huge pet peeve of mine,btohqsg
basically FD2Rs have no rear keyhole  wider at the back,btohqsg
someone here posted a f430 with fake scuderia badges,btohqsg
so no keyhole in the boot,btohqsg
maybe a month or two ago,btohqsg
ok im losted on that cos not an exotic guy,btohqsg
what's the major diff between an f430 and a f430 scuderia,btohqsg
so even an FD2 not R  the 2.0 would have a keyhole,btohqsg
tuned engine  carbon bits  sport exhaust  a few other bits. but the main thing is its limited production and much more exclusive/expensive,btohqsg
but from what i do recall from past conversations  seems to be the case,btohqsg
that would be hard to spot from far,btohqsg
but no matter what  FD2.0 and FD2R have diff rear widths,btohqsg
also  FD2R stock bonnet has ridges,btohqsg
some bro took an upclose pic with the badges and one smart guy spotted it was fake because of the diffuser or exhaust tips or something,btohqsg
cos its nowhere near as obvious as EX vs evo,btohqsg
u really need to look fucking hard at times,btohqsg
cos there's way too many telltales,btohqsg
most people take 1.5/1.6 as the base,btohqsg
basically fuel cap and roof ridges,btohqsg
but alot don't go all the way,btohqsg
so when you see its got drums behind,btohqsg
you know for sure its cap,btohqsg
but even then its a clear sign cos evo's at minimum have floating caliper brakes from factory both front and rear,btohqsg
an EX GT would still have sliding single pots,btohqsg
i cannot recall if evo x has rear wiper,btohqsg
but the telltales from far alr so many that even rear wiper doesn't become a consideration,btohqsg
would probably work really well on 911s also. I suspect a lot of mofos are buying base 911s and badging them as S models,btohqsg
i remember renting a lancer CS5 at one point in time,btohqsg
and everyone was very confused because they thought it was a lancerlution,btohqsg
but for real it was NOT,btohqsg
the ones i notice most are E200s to E300s etc,btohqsg
being a bit raped is probably as likely as being a bit pregnant,btohqsg
but got wiper  discs all around  engine goes choo choo,btohqsg
there was a fucker that badged a E180 as a E43,btohqsg
ahhh yes the fucking mercs. I bet a ton of them are upbadged,btohqsg
i mean hey no one's actually gonna knock you for buying an E180 if you're just being honest about it,btohqsg
i consider taking the badges off acceptable too,btohqsg
1.5 tarbu for a 1.7 ton car,btohqsg
but if you upbadge then that deserves to be shamed,btohqsg
people who know will laugh their ass off,btohqsg
it makes a lot of sense to those with 3 inch or less penis,btohqsg
ironically i've had one person ask if my family car was a legit E250 or we changed the badges,btohqsg
wasting money to get either laughed at or ignored,btohqsg
E63 bodykitted are the worst offenders,btohqsg
"i've seen at least 4 ""E63s""",btohqsg
and holy shit the upbadging is unreal,btohqsg
i've seen a ton of these lately with the quad tip exhausts and all. but its quite easy to tell most of them from the rear tire width,btohqsg
"imo the quad tips are ""fine"" bah",btohqsg
but the bodykit is really overkill liao,btohqsg
problem is they have the badges too,btohqsg
most have 255 all round tyres from factory,btohqsg
and the rear tires look like 235s to me. dead fucking giveaway,btohqsg
iinw alot chose 245s because cheep,btohqsg
275s on a low spec merc would be pretty damn overkill tho,btohqsg
did you say it was an e250?,btohqsg
even then i think its a bit much but acceptable i guess,btohqsg
wide tires on the rear do look good though,btohqsg
"22R18"" LT ALLOY WHEEL 5 DOUBLE-SPOKE DES. MIXED TIRES",btohqsg
would be cool if the bot can check road tax paid or not. a lot of clowns running around with road tax unpaid. i think the onemotoring site can tell you this without being the owner,btohqsg
worst offender i've seen didn't pay road tax for about a year,btohqsg
imagine a lancerlution or fake f2dr with expired road tax. send straight to the firing squad,btohqsg
Yeah can  I omitted it since the main goal is to check the model. The data is on the same page,btohqsg
bro  add that feature in. lol,btohqsg
Go easy guys before lta ban my IP üíÄ,btohqsg
they floated away in a flood last saturday morning,btohqsg
there was a massive flood on SLE twd BKE aft upp thomson entrance,btohqsg
i blew through it and saw my covers floating away,btohqsg
shoulda printed the one with cursed angles,btohqsg
now u can show ur friends the missing covers in REAL LIFE,btohqsg
look at all his IG content,btohqsg
bro i thought u were gonna say dj vendetta,btohqsg
Spotted the new M5 in Simei,btohqsg
Tbh looks much better in person,btohqsg
mattheusdo u know how legends are made,btohqsg
wow didn't know so fast sia!,btohqsg
holy shit someone was actually dumb enough to buy one,btohqsg
overweight  horrible efficiency  looks terrible  and a lotus basically built by geely,btohqsg
geely knows their brand is shit so they basically bought lotus and stuck the lotus badge on what is basically a shit tier chinese EV. i'm grateful at least they let lotus build the emira but make no mistake this is basically a fancier BYD with a lotus badge on it for a lot more money,btohqsg
is that a requirement to post an opinion on a car?,btohqsg
because if so then 95% do not have the right to comment on any car,btohqsg
u should‚Ä¶.  its actually a decent car‚Ä¶,btohqsg
well all i can say is you're entitled to your opinion,btohqsg
overweight  ugly  owned by geely and the absolutely terrible efficiency are all objective by the way  and not opinions,btohqsg
i just asked if u drive it before,btohqsg
and you countered facts with your own little opinion? ok,btohqsg
it is when the majority of people feel that way,btohqsg
omg the two overlords are fighting,btohqsg
hello haha no boss just worker,btohqsg
sounds like someone recently bought an eletre and is feeling a little butthurt,btohqsg
but hey as long as you like it  why get triggered over what i say right,btohqsg
i wish i had an eletre‚Ä¶ i only take bmw,btohqsg
which part am i triggered do lmk,btohqsg
the part where you say its a decent car when i gave you factual reasons why its crap,btohqsg
the ugly part is consensus not just by me buy by many reviewers too by the way,btohqsg
bro‚Ä¶ I have driven it‚Ä¶ i just said i felt its a decent car‚Ä¶,btohqsg
and like i said before  good for you  keep having that opinion,btohqsg
i was suggesting you drive it‚Ä¶ and can see if you still feel its decent,btohqsg
bring yours over and i will,btohqsg
i'll buy you a drink while you explain to me how awesome it is,btohqsg
oh Mr Kevin the Superhero‚Ä¶ i didnt say its awesome  i said its decent‚Ä¶,btohqsg
ahhh when two common friends fight,btohqsg
it is like seeing superman vs batman,btohqsg
remember when you asked me to tell you how i knew you were triggered? well here's another example,btohqsg
2 aneh at worksite while both supervisor stand one corner,btohqsg
(@NH0Waycalling you fat from a distance),btohqsg
sorry had to make that joke,btohqsg
drive off with his fd2r then he know,btohqsg
if this is triggered‚Ä¶ your eq must be really low‚Ä¶,btohqsg
proof that you're triggered no 3,btohqsg
bye bye i want play game,btohqsg
u see all the sgfollowsall videos,btohqsg
what the hell does this even mean can someone explain it to me? i dont speak ahneh,btohqsg
dont worry kevin  keep stereotyping cars because of their specs on paper‚Ä¶ i am sure you will go far with that,btohqsg
@twelvethirtyfivecan help me translate since you supervisor,btohqsg
yep excuse me while i 'stereotype' ugly overweight chinese evs with fancy badges and horrible efficiency lmao,btohqsg
get out my shop u bloody benchod,btohqsg
anyways please look at my rose gold evo 9 on ce28s,btohqsg
ahneh not happy i dissed his favourite chinese ev,btohqsg
hahaha dont be a racist leh‚Ä¶ reflects on your character,btohqsg
superman now wanna fight you bro,btohqsg
ayo don‚Äôt bring me into this,btohqsg
my opinion is diff from both of yalls,btohqsg
haha bro can only pull this kind of stunt when he realise he fucked up,btohqsg
u can tell a cars charactheristics before driving one,btohqsg
yes  that car is a piece of crap,btohqsg
geely made lotus‚Äôs don‚Äôt inspire confidence at all,btohqsg
it‚Äôs built like a conti car in terms of aesthetics  but performs more like kdm,btohqsg
i basically agree with 90% of what you say,btohqsg
"and he will come at you with the ""did you even drive it"" BS",btohqsg
so before i even say anytg abt that  do note that this is more on if you‚Äôre more used on driving contis,btohqsg
when u drive a jdm car,btohqsg
like the 5 star guy that he is,btohqsg
His name has the N word inside if u look closely,btohqsg
‚Äú does it work? ‚Äúyes‚Äú is it good? ‚Äúyes,btohqsg
yall should try drive the Lotus‚Ä¶ Geely had no influence on the suspension geometry of the Lotus eletre.,btohqsg
i ahneh can say what hahaha,btohqsg
idek what car it even is so tbh it doesn‚Äôt matter to me,btohqsg
facts on a sheet are more important when pushing the car to a certain extent,btohqsg
oh wow what a great argument  so i pay 3x the price of a crap chinese ev so it has better dampers. thats definitely gonna win over the buyers,btohqsg
js cos it‚Äôs bad on paper doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad for normal everyday driving,btohqsg
Like i said‚Ä¶ drive it then review it haha,btohqsg
dont judge a book by its cover,btohqsg
How long have you been driving it?,btohqsg
Similarly  the new Tesla Model 3 Highland is very lovely too  wonderful product minus the lack of indicators,btohqsg
i drove it 3 times‚Ä¶ for quite the distance..,btohqsg
most EVs are shit. the eletre is an example of what makes EVs shit. upbadged  overweight  overpriced  and ugly with terrible efficiency. There are also good EVs but they are in the minority. Also a decent ICE shits over any EV,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt say EV is shit,btohqsg
EV is more or less the same as a petrol car,btohqsg
taycan  which i drove. model 3 because of how it changed the world. and most entry level BYDs because they are such great value for money,btohqsg
this is where i‚Äôm completely out,btohqsg
cos i hate ev‚Äôs w a passion,btohqsg
BYD‚Ä¶ have you seen the issue where the BYD 12v battery will go flat without warning?,btohqsg
frankly i hate them too  even the good ones. cos they are all soulless appliances to me. but some drive really well and i cannot deny that EVs are very suitable for a large % of the driving population  just not enthusiasts,btohqsg
i wont argue the taycan and Model 3  both great cars too haha,btohqsg
do you really think any manufacturer is immune to defects? Do you know literally anything about Lotus and their history?,btohqsg
i will forever put it in a term  cars are mostly humanthey function just like usan electric car just takes out your heart  as if you had no soul,btohqsg
ev‚Äôs aren‚Äôt so good w majority of the population tbh,btohqsg
This is not a defect  this is a serious lack of thought when building the car‚Äôs software.,btohqsg
this is how an enthusiast thinks. most people driving cars dont give a shit what they drive as long as its powerful enough  reliable enough and economical enough. EVs can fill this void nicely as long as the v8s and v12s still exists  i dont care,btohqsg
the convinience and the maintenance is more important for a day to day driver,btohqsg
Long term  hybrid is not the answer haha. But for a daily commute in peak hour jam  i wld defo pick an EV.,btohqsg
in today's world i agree. but in 20 maybe 30 years pure EV will probably take it's place. sooner maybe in singapore where we can build the infrastructure quickly,btohqsg
the fact that an EV has as much emissions as a petrol engine,btohqsg
just because it‚Äôs a placebo doesn‚Äôt make it better,btohqsg
the best cars are still hybrids   driven economically,btohqsg
a lot of manufacturers are really fucking up hybrids too. did you see the latest M5? hybrid v8 and it weighs fucking 2.5 tons while having less performance than the old ICE M5,btohqsg
lol they only made the shift recently,btohqsg
before that they said the same thing,btohqsg
fuck the weather but love the weather,btohqsg
it matters haha  because the pollution is not visible to us‚Ä¶ not our problem.,btohqsg
does it rlly matter. you dun touch grass anyway,btohqsg
lmao the guy who posted the eletre pics deleted them,btohqsg
sorry bro i was a little harsh i admit,btohqsg
but all cars deserve to be posted here leh hahahaha,btohqsg
can confirm i was just shopping in that mall a few hours ago,btohqsg
we need srt jeeps in sg bruh,btohqsg
some good hemi 6.4 to save the earth,btohqsg
that was pin worthy i‚Äôm surprised,btohqsg
https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/lotus/eletrehave a read haha  it is good for what it is made to be,btohqsg
really low standards  reminds me of my ex,btohqsg
bro singapore got so many abang bro,btohqsg
u go haji lane cfm got a lot one,btohqsg
ok serious question now  what do you think is a fair price for a 2680kg made-in-wuhan EV in singapore  basically for what it is?,btohqsg
rabak‚Ä¶ i ahneh u sure the racist want anot‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Price is a seperate issue haha  i am just saying i like the driving characteristcs as a car,btohqsg
not just any racist but the greatest,btohqsg
that is not how you assess a car,btohqsg
price to a car is assessed dependent on ur SES,btohqsg
here let me ask you  what do you think is a fair price for the eletre  valued fairly?,btohqsg
some wld spend 500k on a toyota  some wldn‚Äôt,btohqsg
i think anyone regardless of ses can assign what he feels is a fair value to a car,btohqsg
i know people who spend a SHIT ton of money on a 2008 Mazda,btohqsg
no leh‚Ä¶ if i drive in UK‚Ä¶ i care about how much the car cost in SG meh‚Ä¶,btohqsg
yeah but dependent on their ways of spending,btohqsg
bro  you still havent answered. what do you think a car like the eletre  being a made in china 2680kg EV with poor efficiency  what is a fair price for it in SG?,btohqsg
is there gonna be a car meet anytime soon?,btohqsg
I assess a car holistically base on its driving characteristic  reliability etc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
i'm going somewhere with this though..what do you personally think a car like that is worth?,btohqsg
you see you are dodging the question and i absolutely know why,btohqsg
there is no fair price  willing buyer willing seller.,btohqsg
anyone else want to give their opinion? what a car like that should be worth?,btohqsg
i would put the lotus in the price point similar of a SUV Lexus,btohqsg
there are basically no willing buyers in singapore aside from maybe that one nutcase,btohqsg
IMO a little overvalued but ok. what does an SUV lexus RX cost?,btohqsg
then no buyers lor  but its still a nice car to drive haha,btohqsg
u mean a new rolls royce is a shit car because its expensive?,btohqsg
not at all. but you pay RR money cos you know why it costs so much,btohqsg
bro. how much is a lexus RX?,btohqsg
if u gave me materials  craftmanship and engineering that is well worth the price AND status on top,btohqsg
300K maybe at the most right?,btohqsg
that is why 1mil RR is still a good car,btohqsg
would you choose a 964 or a rx,btohqsg
‚Äúmost car enthusiast will choose a 964‚Äù,btohqsg
which RX did you use sia? the bloody top spec one?,btohqsg
RX is a mid tier SUV,btohqsg
doesn‚Äôt neccesarily mean a car enthu will take a 964 over a RX,btohqsg
some will choose the RX because of warranty  easier parts and it‚Äôs a SUV,btohqsg
so this is about equal to an eletre in your book?,btohqsg
guess how much the eletre costs,btohqsg
i thought it wld be 400-500k,btohqsg
for that chinese made piece of shit,btohqsg
so now tell me again how its a decent car,btohqsg
so u pay 200k more without coe?,btohqsg
explain to me like i'm 5,btohqsg
nah tbh he has a point la,btohqsg
now i can add overpriced to overweight  made in china  ugly and poor efficiency,btohqsg
ur point is it‚Äôs a good car to drive,btohqsg
but keep going telling me how its a decent car,btohqsg
i never said the Eletre is an overpriced car haha,btohqsg
his point is that it‚Äôs not and not worth it,btohqsg
but it is a very nice car to drive haha,btohqsg
‚Äúwtf is a eletre and why is it kind of shitty?‚Äù,btohqsg
meaningless statement esp without context from a guy who doesnt even own cars,btohqsg
i nvr said either of u werent talking abt that,btohqsg
i bet i would find it shit,btohqsg
it‚Äôs js that he made a good point,btohqsg
does it make my opinion more valuable than yours or less?,btohqsg
hahahaha aiyo‚Ä¶ asked you if you drive before and now you start to gaslight hahahha,btohqsg
to be clear. the ENTRY LEVEL eletre (there is a more premium one) WITHOUT COE is 598k,btohqsg
actually maybe because ive driven it before?,btohqsg
he‚Äôs not rly gas lighting tho,btohqsg
hahaha why you keep focusing on the price?,btohqsg
anyway i've made my point  the car is dogshit on any metric and you are the only champion who feels differently  aside from the one dude who bought it,btohqsg
cos he‚Äôs proving it‚Äôs not worth it‚Äôs price,btohqsg
you're entitled to your opinion idc,btohqsg
then why you fight my opinion its a decent car?,btohqsg
"""but its a decent car"" lmao",btohqsg
what is both of yalls car u would own if u had all the money in the world?,btohqsg
because you are probably not qualified to form an opinion calling a 700+k made in wuhan 2.6 ton EV a decent car,btohqsg
wierdest fucking answer i ever seen,btohqsg
yes because its the best bang for buck mid size suv,btohqsg
so to you  the RX350 is your ultimate car. and you rated an eletre as equal to it?,btohqsg
maybe his GLB is the best,btohqsg
your ability to reason is severely lacking man,btohqsg
15  no license ahneh taking bus 11 everyday,btohqsg
i just wasted my fucking evening arguing with a 15 year old,btohqsg
i'm not arguing with you anymore and i am serious. You are lacking way too much experience and simply too young to have any sort of serious opinion about cars,btohqsg
explains a lot of your behaviour too  including statements like this. very apt for a 15 year old,btohqsg
yes‚Ä¶ my mother was scolding me cos i almost failed my A Math MYE‚Ä¶,btohqsg
