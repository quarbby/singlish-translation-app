Actually i can make my own custom notes,btohqsg
My friend from there is a geek. But he is at San Frans google now.,btohqsg
That's why you should submit it onexams.sg,btohqsg
Ppl prefer to have NAMED institution attached to the notes rather than have hand written ones,btohqsg
Even the quality of the latter is > former,btohqsg
Why the fuck did you tag me cb,btohqsg
Eutrophication  why u got so many enemies,btohqsg
Id rather upload on my own website,btohqsg
It's dangerous to keep u around here,btohqsg
Excellent that means your notes will do well with a named institution like sgexams,btohqsg

Imagine selling answering techniques when you can just develop them within the 2 years in jc,btohqsg
Some people just cant do it hahaha,btohqsg
Also for certain subjects its easier yo be brain dead than to actually memorise,btohqsg
If you're memorising answering format  you're pretty much brain dead,btohqsg
yes can relate where's my rote learn math gang,btohqsg
U try to write an own answer for an evolution ques or u try answering using a format. You see which one1. Saves time2. Is succinct3. Easier,btohqsg
If u can be brain dead. Just be brain dead.,btohqsg
C'mon there's more fish in the sea,btohqsg
Funny because I was frantically doing this one day before gp As,btohqsg

Somebody advise me on some good ways to rage at someone across the internet please.,btohqsg
Ye. He talking bout it in another chat as well.,btohqsg
And he got 3 warns before  I removed one so he wouldn’t get ban. Plus one verbal warning.,btohqsg
imagine thinking dark chocolate is artisanal!,btohqsg
No valid reason. But behind... we got some evidence and reason to ban him. But it was kinda obtained illegally. So...,btohqsg
And welcome to the place where newbs get FBed,btohqsg
It’s not a court of law,btohqsg
We rather not. We’re still a growing group.,btohqsg
"Are y'all inside the ""a group where we pretend to be YP Bengs"" in facebook",btohqsg
I c . But still. U want ur ppl to be the kind that u like and not any kind right?,btohqsg
ya every 14th feb eat alone right because you got no one to give to,btohqsg
It really depends on nature n politics of the group thou,btohqsg
My bf gonna mute him for 1 week,btohqsg
"I'll try to summarise:One guy post his own photos of him and his eurasian wife/girlfriend and censor the face  then people started making fun of him (legally allowed  since its ""pretend we are YP bengs"")  he not happy. Admin tell him this is how the group works. He not happy with admin  he go block the admin on FB. Admin go kick and ban him from the group  and then block him back. Then the same guy go create his own FB group.",btohqsg
Cuz I don’t have the heart to do it.,btohqsg
It’s really not that big a deal,btohqsg
A group where we pretend to be YP Bengs,btohqsg
Am eating some good 70% dark chocolate,btohqsg
Maybe we pm about it  if u want to grow the group we can explore some solutions,btohqsg
court of public opinion is good enough evidence for me,btohqsg

False positives are still better than false negatives right,btohqsg
Relatively but still is bad. Cause then have to retest everyone in quarantine,btohqsg
They do it daily anyways so i dont think it matters,btohqsg
imagine how wasteful it will be,btohqsg
To test the same person daily,btohqsg
Its done like weekly or once every 1/2 month,btohqsg
Just to perform one PCR test  by cost of material is ard 50-100,btohqsg
Cause they take into account latency period,btohqsg
No need to test during latency cause u know it will be there,btohqsg
Pcr tbh is only expensive in singapore,btohqsg
