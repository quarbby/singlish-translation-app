Oooh hmm I just connected my citi to amaze card and then use my amaze card for grab car. I still can't see the point,btohqsg
Is it delayed because of amaze?,btohqsg
Need to wait for it to be finish posted currently it on pending ~ once posted point are updated either that day itself or the next day,btohqsg
If it still say pending  just have to wait ~ amaze transaction are slightly faster then retails according to some DP,btohqsg
I see thank you very much,btohqsg
Any guide for using UOB lady card for oversea spent. Any combo with amaze card?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I’m currently pairing amaze with citi rewards  amaze actually convert all spendings into online spending so I’m eligible for 4 mpd,btohqsg
But with uob lady solitaire  it seems that there is no “online spending” category that I can choose. Say the category I choose is dining and travel and I made purchase at ntuc using amaze linked to solitaire card  does that earn me 6 mpd ?,btohqsg
Go read their funds details. See their top 5 NAV Holdings.Fullert SGD 10% is in mid term bonds / receivables.,btohqsg
Ntuc is under family which include grocery mcc,btohqsg
Alright  thanks for the reply guys  appreciate it !,btohqsg
Hi Members  im heading to si chuan do hua restuarant. so if i use krispay i will get 9miles via applepay. if i use uob solitaire to tag with applepay  do i get a total of 15 miles from eating there ? thanks in advance,btohqsg
If dining is your bonus cat under uob lady,btohqsg
yes it is. so it wouldnt count as contactless ?,btohqsg
Hey all  I just did a search for klook’s MCC and its 5734 (unlike travel  airtickets  lodging etc) does that mean that I could use my citirewards world mastercard for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi For UOB salary credit promo  if I credited before 30 Jun   am I not eligible?,btohqsg
Uob lady bonus point is based on catergory choose  doesnt matter how u pay,btohqsg
Hi  how it work and is reward good? Can use amex card top up and earn rebate?,btohqsg
Assume it’s normal useless vouchers or cents of rebate from gpay,btohqsg
Hi  not sure whether is this asked in the community. So the MooMoo promotion for 5.8% guaranteed is also applied for existing users?In addition  we just have to topup $10k to MooMoo and buy 5 times money market fund will do is it?,btohqsg
What about top up using uob amex got 1.7% rebate?,btohqsg
think gpay in this case is funded by bank account,btohqsg
Google search said it can use to top up.,btohqsg
google dun have account to be topped up ah,btohqsg
So it mean tag to your credit card for payment?,btohqsg
either credit card or dbs/ocbc/scb bank account. Think in this case it is the latter.,btohqsg
Then u can use Google pay to top up cpf to get reward and earn cash rebate 1.7% from uob amex?,btohqsg
dun think so  will be funded by bank account not CC,btohqsg
Morning all!!the lady card - Bonus point only come in next month right? I only received the base point.I spend 100 on HDL. i got 20 uni$,btohqsg
Yes I tink end of mth then calculate. Total spent then round down to nearest 5,btohqsg
They count at end of Calendar mth right bro? Then round down to nearest 5,btohqsg
arrr icic.. okay.. no wonder.. i spend 100. i get only 20.. which mean next month i will get 280,btohqsg
To be more precise  on the 7th working day after the end of the previous montj,btohqsg
Guys  did you keep your munny in EGA account after 3months? What's the good strategy.. UOB?,btohqsg
Hello guys ~ can I check.. for UOB ladies card  fashion category covers online shopping platform like Lazada/ shoppe right?,btohqsg
This question honestly is quite dangerous to assume/answer because Lazada and Shopee has multiple MCCs and the final MCC you get is based on the merchant.To be safe this is what I do:1. Shopee = UOB One card = 10% cash rebate2. Lazada = Citi CRMC = 4mpd,btohqsg
If you can hit Citi CRMC max $1k every month  can consider Citi Lazada card too.,btohqsg
citi is such a pain... max of 5 cards per person,btohqsg
Seems like still Citi rewards card with amaze is the better option for me,btohqsg
correct... although for both shopee and lazada they are already online so technically don't need amaze layer but if you want to keep that for good practice  also ok,btohqsg
Is it stated that max allow is 5 cards? Anyone have dp that they have more than 5?,btohqsg
i got exceptional approval for a 6th card 1-2 years ago  but recently when I tried to apply for a 7th card  Citibank insisted I cancel 2 existing cards before they approved my new application.,btohqsg
Which card did u apply for tho,btohqsg
Hi  can i check if lady card want to earn rewards via amaze card should choose which category?,btohqsg
I have:Citi M1 VisaCiti Cashback VisaCiti Cashback MasterCiti Premier MilesCiti SMRTCiti Cashback+ Master (exceptionally approved 6th card)I tried to add Citi PrestigeWas not able to be approved until I cancelled Citi M1 Visa and Citi SMRT.After I cancelled these 2  they approved my Prestige and I'm back at the max of 5 cards with Citi.,btohqsg
Depend on which cat u spend more on. No one can answer gpr u. U need to know your own spending habit,btohqsg
Citi smrt is a very good card to spend online  it get back 5 percent cashback,btohqsg
Mostly on foods and electrical stuffs,btohqsg
He probably alr maxed the 5% for 600 cashback so cancelled it after hit the cap haha,btohqsg
yeah but it excludes travel spending which is one of the only reasons I would spend large amounts online for 5% (now UOB Lady has 6mpd  even lower reason).5% for online spending now loses to quite a number of 4mpd cards (depends on your miles valuation) so I didn't really see the shine of Citi SMRT anymore for sometime.,btohqsg
