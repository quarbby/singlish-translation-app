Can I sell my bto before mop period?,btohqsg
Is this at Tampines Green emerald?,btohqsg
You have to use the search function,btohqsg
I use then I cannot find,btohqsg
This means nobody is selling a unit there. Look for other places,btohqsg
Any BTO near Tampines west mrt station?,btohqsg
You can check the current BTO here:https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landingIf don't have the ones you want  wait until there is one. There is a HDB launch every quarter,btohqsg
If you cannot wait  you have to buy from the market using the 2 links given earlier,btohqsg
Property Guru &99.co. There are many more out there  just search on Google,btohqsg
Only if there is financial difficulties  divorce  or death,btohqsg
there are ongoing BTO projects nearby there. but if you want to buy  consider apply for SBF in Nov/Dec 2023.,btohqsg
oh ya you can also try OBF. it depends if you get anot ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Can I have the link to apply for it?,btohqsg
err babe next application havent out yet so i dunno the link. you can use the HDB eAlert.,btohqsg
Okay. Can I buy the Tampines Green Emerald 2 room?,btohqsg
not sure babe. i not hdb officer nor agent. i just give you the link liao for Tampines GreenEmerald... you browse thru laaa,btohqsg
I went to check they tell me to join the telegram group,btohqsg
This is not the place to buy BTO. Hence  the links I gave you earlier,btohqsg
"Who are the ""they""?Wait for next SBF and see if HDB is still offering what you are looking for",btohqsg
"If you need a straightforward answer  it's ""no"". Wait until Dec SBF and check back the HDB link I gave you. If nobody let go of their unit  then wait another 6 months to see if anyone let go their unit.",btohqsg
i help you abit k.2R flexi (w/o grants) from $130k onwards.like what me & the rest mentioned wait for SBF in Nov/Dec 2023.,btohqsg
Hi anyone has progress on kent heights?,btohqsg
For queries on progress  might be better off for you to search whether there is a telegram chat for the project and join that group,btohqsg
Hi. Can I check if I have to apply for HFE in to order to get the BTO?,btohqsg
https://www.btohq.com/bto-top-trackeryou can refer to this for a rough estimate of each project's progress,btohqsg
Everyone has to apply for HFE when applying for BTOBut it doesn't guarantee that you will definitely get the BTOMaybe you can read up the HDB website too,btohqsg
Hi. Can I also enquire your 2 Room BTO is it taken up currently?,btohqsg
Please read the website. We can't be spoon-feeding you,btohqsg
Whatever you see in BTOHQ website are all taken up  so look elsewhere (the links I gave you yesterday),btohqsg
U can always google . Every info is on hdb website or google . And we here can't always spoon feed u also .,btohqsg
This is also a simple questions.,btohqsg
Is a must. When HFE was introduced ya,btohqsg
Actually i want to ask... What exactly is your issue?Examples  you do not have internet access  you don't know how to use Google or don't know how to visit HDB website etcYou would reply okay  okay but keep on asking the same types of questionsNot sure if providing you help in other ways will be more useful and practical than answering your questions per se,btohqsg
I'm curious also... Thanks for asking.,btohqsg
Oh. Because I went to your website at BTO HQ and I actually wanted to get a 2 room flat. But I think it is not up yet.,btohqsg
Can you please Google the process to get BTO?,btohqsg
I think you have misunderstood.This is just Telegram group.Not hdbNot website selling houses,btohqsg
It's not the case of up or not. People buy BTO before it is built.If you want a ready house  go to resale market (property guru &99.co). Not BTO.,btohqsg
Then go to HDB  not here,btohqsg
Itâ€™s okay. I research on it. Thanks,btohqsg
Are you more comfortable in Chinese?You can try typing your questions in Chinese and we will try to reply you in ChineseMaybe we will understand one another better in the language that you are more comfortable with,btohqsg
Won't be surprised if you ask here again whether you can buy some 2R BTO somewhere in TampinesDon't mean to be harshPeople here are generally helpful but not very nice if you keep asking the same questions which you were already given answers previously,btohqsg
At the expense of hurting people's feelings though... Sigh,btohqsg
