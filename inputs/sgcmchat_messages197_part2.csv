Thank you for this info I needed it,btohqsg
technically if you look at the straw in the two dimension  it does not have a theoretical holehowever  if you were to look at it in the three dimension  it has two holes. one on top and one belowit is physically impossible for a straw to have one hole  as it would not function as a straw anymoreone may argue that the hole starts and ends from top to bottom  but for this to be true you would need to reevaluate the meaning of hole. in this case  it can be taken as absence of spacetherefore  a straw can either have two holes or zero holes dependent on the dimensional view of a straw,btohqsg
if u cut the straw thin enuff,btohqsg
unlike a straw  a donut is not tunnel-length nor shaped.we can take into consideration the 2 dimension for the case of objects such as a donut  thus it has one holea torus in theory only has one hole as it begins and ends at the same point  where as a straw hole begin and ends at two separate pointstherefore  a donut and a straw do not have the same amount of holes. leading to the conclusion that a donut has one singular hole and a straw has two holesthe floor is now open to questions,btohqsg
i've got the pole if you've got the hole,btohqsg
Need to make merch out of this,btohqsg
