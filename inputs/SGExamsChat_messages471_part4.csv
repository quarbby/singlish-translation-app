Bro...the supervisor said  today got 14 000 packages of just lazada,btohqsg
but I kindly donated someone $5 I wonder who,btohqsg
i can see that  dw...today we worked like we were machines,btohqsg
just so yall can get your lazada packages on time,btohqsg
it‚Äôs whether the drivers wan get on time anot,btohqsg
actually is not  the reason why some packages take longer than others is because...some of yall packages fly off the conveyors,btohqsg
oh cmon udk how to fix the machine is it!,btohqsg
and at night  the nightcrew that is tasked to find these packages sometimes miss certain spots,btohqsg
what if it was a fragile üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
its not a broken machine  its because of how fast the packages have to be processed,btohqsg
actually  no this is why i dont buy glass/fragile things,btohqsg
ik la is js I beige irritating,btohqsg
but better start praying your package did not fly off the conveyor,btohqsg

I just joined yesterday and I‚Äôm looking at some of these questions and I have no idea how I figured them out when I was doing A/O levels lol  they‚Äôre actually kind of hard for me now.Props to all those who are sitting for exams  you‚Äôre smarter than this uncle here.,btohqsg
Tbh I‚Äôm trying to size myself up and see if I could become a tuition teacher if somehow I lost my job lol,btohqsg
And so far the answer is clearly not for mathematics physics chemistry or biology üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeah  but I haven‚Äôt seen too many English or GP questions haha  and they‚Äôre sort of difficult to give tuition answers for over telegram. That‚Äôs the only subject that I have a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù feel for actually.,btohqsg
my cher got say me before,btohqsg
My survey asked me if I‚Äôm proud to serve NS,btohqsg
But Learnet is very slow and the UX sucks,btohqsg
o legit no wonder I find them not nice HAHAHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
Meanwhile there is me who buys from pasar malam,btohqsg
Well I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true that GP is Rng  I would say it‚Äôs like poker.English/GPcan be variable in how you score  but people can show a consistent A or top the school for being skilled in it.I used to never practice at all and never got anything less than the highest grades  even in university philosophy/language based essay writing. (They force STEM students to be holistic now lol),btohqsg
But I think maybe at birth I shifted all my skill points from mandarin to English so that‚Äôs the tradeoff lol,btohqsg
I traded math competency for language skills,btohqsg
not my coy cuz nvr told us comeback  not sure but cld be 7th coy  cuz they got in camp video and also kind of mocking the saf drills and all,btohqsg
if its actually ladang side im also as clueless üíÄ,btohqsg
I traded language skills for maths.Then Physics came looking for me after it chose me.,btohqsg
Science is less grey more black and white,btohqsg
I got equal skills in math science language,btohqsg
until you get to a higher level,btohqsg
Yes but for the purpose of secondary and JC  it is black and white,btohqsg
can fly from 90th+ percentile to 10th+ within 1 month,btohqsg
i rmb borders  am i older than im suppose to be,btohqsg
No way chatgtp is a bot,btohqsg
Bruh if they put chatgtp into a robot,btohqsg
