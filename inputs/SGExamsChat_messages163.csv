If u have to kill one  kill bedok or kill me?,btohqsg
I always have this impression that you are female,btohqsg
Oh  den he shld just go for pure bio haha  why consider physics ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
It and med both sound like bandwagon,btohqsg
Don't know.... But because you talk about the need to do NS so I know you are male,btohqsg
Nah  I need to next year üòÇ,btohqsg
Hahaha yea. He just got peer pressured ig coz everyone was telling him phy is easier to study and bio is more content heavy.,btohqsg
Unless I go med and can det r,btohqsg
peer pressure - the bane of modern students,btohqsg
But really  it's not about how easy it is for distinction or how less content there is,btohqsg
It's about what he truly enjoy bah,btohqsg
Don't regret and waste two year studying things he dl,btohqsg
now i have a slight recollection,btohqsg
but i forgot ur old username,btohqsg
Bedok  look at my chem pract,btohqsg
In sec sch that titration table is 4 marks,btohqsg
Cos there's two titration table in total haha,btohqsg
And I make the mistake twice ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Cuz erm i spilled some indicator,btohqsg
Yall isit e math damn unpredictable,btohqsg
I have a teacher who spill EtBr on his hand,btohqsg
Tys got like a fixed format,btohqsg
Like i can predict which qn will cfm come out,btohqsg
As you do you will start to observe,btohqsg
U mean other question almost same?,btohqsg
But like paper 2Qn 1 algebraQn 2 either pattern(use calculator) or money exchange rate or simple interestQn 3 quadratic eqnQn 4 graphQn 5 trigo thingysQn 6 circle properties cfm got proving similarity and congruencyQn 7 vectors haha SIKE DN TO DOQn 8 maybe sectors and stuffQn 9 statistics range all thoseQn 10 the gayest shit ever,btohqsg
Paper 1 a lot will come out,btohqsg
I rmb for Emath and Amath,btohqsg
U can tell what topic coming for paper 2,btohqsg
Like quadratic eqn trigo and graph cfm come out,btohqsg
My teacher say the reason why amaath got two paper,btohqsg
Is cos they teach too much,btohqsg
And not enough paper to test at one shot,btohqsg
@chemcerme too! Teach me how did you get 59/65 for chemistry!,btohqsg
I can imagine bedok doing that,btohqsg
Why is it always Einstein? Why not mathematicians such as Galois?,btohqsg
My chem paper 2 like 50/80,btohqsg
Idk  when I search genius on gif it was top result,btohqsg
Bedok can open bedok tuition agency after a level,btohqsg
I died liao bro one paper,btohqsg
Imagine doing a math for 4.5hour,btohqsg
So he's gonna get banned from this grp 2 yrs ltr?,btohqsg
Later eat then food coma wasted effort,btohqsg
He helped me in chem HAHA,btohqsg
Then if starve cant do well also,btohqsg
My combi is phy maths maths for uni,btohqsg
Im like phy chem bio maths,btohqsg
Eh bdont forget the meet up during dec,btohqsg
Yall take how many many  subject,btohqsg
Me u Neil and tener üëç,btohqsg
Okie swee one more can reach max 5 alr,btohqsg
Siao eh uni ppl study everyday meh,btohqsg
Later u bring ur gf and start kissing infront of us how,btohqsg
i alr died bc of that,btohqsg
Bedok  u treating us buffet right?,btohqsg
I'll complain to the principal of BedokJC,btohqsg
but i hate food and resources,btohqsg
Lmao  I go there to eat my friend food,btohqsg
My friend cook like 4 meal,btohqsg
Even the teacher dk how he did it,btohqsg
He cook rice  spagethhi  chicken  oligooligo or smt,btohqsg
Den other people just cook sushi cos it's easiest to make,btohqsg
He cook so much that he had to tapao home,btohqsg
It was like a 4 person serving,btohqsg
i wld have made this chaoda tbh,btohqsg
it teaches u how to consume food !!,btohqsg
But yea  he was a beast,btohqsg
Den I was his partner for sec 2 FCE,btohqsg
My sec sch had 0 students taking fce for my year,btohqsg
And he cook everything sia  I just watch,btohqsg
But I get all the credit üòÇ,btohqsg
Because one of the two fce teachers had a 0 A record,btohqsg
how to put healthy food into ur mouth,btohqsg
His practical score damn high  but he never study for theory,btohqsg
Cos we partner so I got the highest practical,btohqsg
i heard d&t the most slack one,btohqsg
Den I got one of the highest for theory,btohqsg
literally in the aircon d&t room slacking for d&t,btohqsg
fnn the report alot bc 1 report 6 pages üëÅüëÑüëÅ,btohqsg
U know he wanted to make pandan cake  den he make the whole thing himself,btohqsg
And be ask me to melt the chocolate for dipping,btohqsg
Actually is true during Semester time tbh Uni timeline sucks rush at inhumanely speeds for 26weeks then totally nothing for the rest of the year,btohqsg
I went to open the naked flame to heat it sia haha,btohqsg
I did study but not so much,btohqsg
I rmb my cohort only 1 person got A,btohqsg
But I got A cos group work carry also hahahaüôà,btohqsg
Den the group work was to play some song I think,btohqsg
art is deadass talent based subject,btohqsg
but also v hard to get decent score for art,btohqsg
Why 6 marks for both Add maths and Principal of accounts?,btohqsg
did ya like not fllw the instructions or smth,btohqsg
deadass slept through 2 emath pprs,btohqsg
I slept thru my chem promo papers,btohqsg
No and I have two rebuttals from diverging standpoint,btohqsg
I also dont know wtf im drawin every single time,btohqsg
he did 1 qn and the whole 1qn from,btohqsg
End up either A1 or A2,btohqsg
from my experience i just anyhow draw,btohqsg
I rmb I have a friend who drew damn well  like some artist level,btohqsg
But he only got like C grade,btohqsg
Maybe the teacher doesn't like it,btohqsg
tbh i thought u were an express kid tbh LOL,btohqsg
Did the art teacher even see the art sold at auction,btohqsg
He drew pic of meat and the examiner was a vegan,btohqsg
That red pic can sell for thousands and millions leh,btohqsg
ur sci good math good chi good,btohqsg
It's fine  people have their ups and downs in life. Anyways  we all know you are very intelligent,btohqsg
like psle if u get in,btohqsg
1. Contrary to popular belief  Art is not just about the doing of Art but also understanding of Art (paper 3)2. Even if we‚Äôre talking about the making of Art  there are actually talented artists who will struggle to get A in the O level subject Art is because the kind of Art Cambridge is expecting in their rubrics is narrow. So  talent =/= score  you need to be their rubric and not all talented ppl can fit their rubric and some ppl can fit rubric with no talent haha.,btohqsg
A for math A for chi A for sci,btohqsg
Don't worry  we won't judge you,btohqsg
maybe im jus anyhow saying ah,btohqsg
so if i dont take amath i just kms in coursework,btohqsg
im happy im the last batch of bio chem geog combi ngll,btohqsg
lmao u actually went to find,btohqsg
my report book is desdass in ny shelves,btohqsg
I rmb i got give mc,btohqsg
Oh shit i forgot can see sch name,btohqsg
Then i got marked as skipped sch,btohqsg
Its a hyphen all the way,btohqsg
No matter you mean it literally or sarcastically I agree  haha PW is like just that conflicting.,btohqsg
Literally. Really. I enjoyed PW. Because I was the leader and had control over almost everytjing. Did everything I wanted,btohqsg
Yeah so likelt 1/4 ppl in ur grp enjoyed it,btohqsg
I had 5 people in my group,btohqsg
Which is rougjly thr statistic for most grps,btohqsg
Ok then this subj has failed to achieve its purpose on you,btohqsg
That's your opinion  but I think it was my second favourite subject in JC  after economics,btohqsg
No  I look back at my PW work from time to time. I often stayed up until 4 am ish . Very proud of what I did,btohqsg
How is it possible to get everything done your way in a project unless you do everything yourself,btohqsg
A lot of my group members cannot write very well  so I just did it,btohqsg
Only OP then it was more equally split,btohqsg
Here I was in an officially 5 person group but feels like only 3.5 ppl working  complaining about the burden and you found tanking amazing. Wow  amazing.,btohqsg
The true tanking role begins in uni,btohqsg
By any chance did you write their script for them,btohqsg
Idea was from a another person's PI. I protested as I wanted to do BRT (bus rapid transit) using my PI.Scripts for OP was written by them  edited by meIdeas  apart from the initial idea and a few other things  it was mine.,btohqsg
I guess I like to work alone  so others not interfering let me do what I wanted. Worked out for everyone I guess,btohqsg
Oooo you‚Äôre from a batch with PI?,btohqsg
From what I recalled  we just summarised what was said in the WR and I edited a lot.,btohqsg
You mean... there's no PI now?,btohqsg
I was the last batch with PI  they scrapped it,btohqsg
My time was PI  then form group  then group project proposal  then WR  then OP  then I and R,btohqsg
isn't PI and EOM super impt?,btohqsg
I thought they'd scrap I&R if any,btohqsg
By my calculations  you are born in 2000,btohqsg
From what I gather they still make them do but it‚Äôs no longer graded and we all know how students treat non-graded work,btohqsg
Yeah  you get to choose your ideas from one of the members for the WR,btohqsg
I see no value in I&R honestly,btohqsg
but I&R is basically for u to put things that u forgot to put in,btohqsg
It‚Äôs basically like a piece on limitations,btohqsg
I did up a mock Fairprice sign that read for your information or something. Found all the correct fonts. Took the photograph at NTUC Rochor Centre,btohqsg
Because it was how to improve the WR. We were trying to find a solution to the littering conundrum in Singapore,btohqsg
HAHAHA tbh I really dk how students these days survive PW. EOM literally forces your group mates to contribute ideas for the WR  scrapping it made it optional lol.,btohqsg
Ok la pw was fine for me,btohqsg
My grp met only thrice in the entire yr  and that was enough,btohqsg
My group never even meet once,btohqsg
In this chat: old men reminiscing PW HAHA,btohqsg
Our group met so much I couldn‚Äôt count,btohqsg
My WR was one of the first in the school to be completed. No further comments. I was unhappy  so I went to edit the WR further to make it nearly perfect,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs always me convening the meeting,btohqsg
the best is yet to be,btohqsg
and forever yet to be tbh,btohqsg
I still remember that ridiculous groupmate of mine that was fretting and asking me if I think she‚Äôll get A in results release day when she‚Äôs the same person that started on her EOM on the national deadline lol,btohqsg
Reminds me of Modus PonensIf P  then Q.PTherefore Q,btohqsg
I said yes  but of course deep down was hell no  I bet if I said no she‚Äôll blame me for cursing her haha,btohqsg
Pw was my best time in JC,btohqsg
We met everyday for 1-2month straight except Sunday from morning to 9-10pm,btohqsg
its close to 1am but shld i redo my 2019 tys or do2011/2010one tmr,btohqsg
Lol my students chiong like crazy,btohqsg
Especially when this near to the actual one,btohqsg
Need to rush to clear after promos,btohqsg
ye but i was asking if i shld redo last year's paper or do the paper like 9 years ago lol,btohqsg
cos im almost done w emath tys yay,btohqsg
i did the topical one tho :/,btohqsg
Wow and I thought my group was aggressive,btohqsg
But we meet up to do 30percent work 70percrnt play,btohqsg
Saturday we usually meet up to work,btohqsg
But it always so happen that there's some event,btohqsg
So we ended up go to event and play,btohqsg
Does not compute. Where does one find so much time to play in JC.,btohqsg
We meet up on Saturday . Monday to Friday is in sch,btohqsg
yep i do frm most to least recent,btohqsg
Prioritise the ones from the same syllabus,btohqsg
ive done all of those alr,btohqsg
Take note of the subj code in TYS,btohqsg
cos ive seen advice encouraging redoing,btohqsg
Yea if you want to redo do this,btohqsg
Idk  I wouldn't redo if im u,btohqsg
Actually... when did you finish it,btohqsg
Cos if u do it once and understood it  redoing is like pointless cos u alrealdy learn how to do it and solved it already,btohqsg
Should expose to more new qn,btohqsg
yeah same i will just take note of error i make :/,btohqsg
If you completed it like 5 months ago  probs should redo,btohqsg
Redo the qn you had issue with  not the qn u ale know,btohqsg
I have a friend who told me he redo the TYS for chem like 3-4 times,btohqsg
Like he went from 2017 to 2008  den go back to 2017,btohqsg
And he only got like B3 in the end,btohqsg
Does one have so much time,btohqsg
Okay  application questions are like comprehension passages. Read the info carefully to answer,btohqsg
Idk he trying to memroise the qn and answer or what,btohqsg
They are mostly out of syllabus,btohqsg
but more of bio i heard,btohqsg
u mean the last question of paper 2?,btohqsg
well i still dont know shit abt leila and hamid so,btohqsg
My bio paper I was like I saw this qn before  they just changed one word and MCQ order,btohqsg
okay i did the first 2 parts but they were wrong?,btohqsg
2017 paper 2 for chem the marking was very stringent,btohqsg
And my teacher follow markers report,btohqsg
Is it o lvl or a lvl,btohqsg
I saw the h2 tys before and it is twice of my tys thickness,btohqsg
There‚Äôs the smaller one for H2,btohqsg
EPH thicker than SAP for o level cos SAP squeeze more qns on one page then EPH just print exactly from SEAB,btohqsg
Yeah my friend say got a lot of one liner for 2m or 3m qn,btohqsg
My teacher reluctantly sent 2017 o lvl pure chem markers report,btohqsg
@njeilsonfml i recieve the NS enlistment letter alr,btohqsg
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ khatib camp literally 10min walk from my house,btohqsg
Its not mono can alr lah,btohqsg
all enlistees go thru tekong bro,btohqsg
so khatib camp is only a possibility if ure posted to Arty after POP,btohqsg
Unless u mono that one diff story,btohqsg
Got ppl direct enlist into SPF/SCDF,btohqsg
Ur ‚Äòall enlistees‚Äô has so many exceptions,btohqsg
dude was saying he wanted to enlist to Khatib Camp instead of Tekong ma,btohqsg
so it was in an SAF Setting,btohqsg
If BMTC Sch V is so good  how come they haven‚Äôt released BMTC Sch 6?,btohqsg
with exceptions of Mono and Sch 5,btohqsg
My bad  I dk anything about NS haha,btohqsg
every single time i enter this chat all i see is army talk,btohqsg
who ask u enter wrg time,btohqsg
thats when uk all the ppl who started sgexams are rlly old now,btohqsg
my intern just started singing abc,btohqsg
listen to classical music when ur studying,btohqsg
I listen to lofi xue hua piaopiao,btohqsg
i listen to lo fi east coast plan,btohqsg
I listened to this while studying during As,btohqsg
The Carpenters is good. Karen Carpenter has a very smooth voice,btohqsg
Hi guysI'm curious somethingAre public libraries now allowing patrons to stay at library to study? If not  does anyone have any suggestion where I can study for free and can stay for long hours?,btohqsg
At the moment due to covid19 Library are not allowed for studying.You can study at Community Club(CC) they recently open up their study rooms again.,btohqsg
In case you want to know where are the cc at@Shanshan1234,btohqsg
but u shld call in to check for availability,btohqsg
my area only allows ten ppl inside first come first served basis,btohqsg
If your PES is A or B1 you enjoy a 2-month discount,btohqsg
They will make you pass one,btohqsg
I can't even do a single push up,btohqsg
As in even if you cannot actually pass by the strictest standard  they will put your score as pass,btohqsg
What if you refuse? I was so exhausted trying to improve my score for no good reason,btohqsg
Then no choice but go for extra 2 months BMT,btohqsg
But if you are going to get PES C-F  there is no difference,btohqsg
No he going Tekong which is A and B,btohqsg
if u F u won't even go NS lmao,btohqsg
I know  I'm just saying it in general,btohqsg
I know  so if you pass ot fail as PES F there isn't a difference as well,btohqsg
Some people have conditions that aren't dangerous to others  but get PES F. Military and civilian life is vastly different,btohqsg
Oh i never know this chain existsOnly heard of popeye chicken,btohqsg
I don't buy it. I know many people that have PES F.,btohqsg
How about taking time to build up on ur confidence n preparation?,btohqsg
I'm not threatened by them. They don't harm themselves,btohqsg
When u cannot move forward  take a step back first and recharge ?,btohqsg
Yes  but people may not be able to hold a rifle but can work and be successful in other ways,btohqsg
How do they decide the grade for pw?,btohqsg
Okay... But there are other conditions that people are just born different but they aren't harming themselves or others,btohqsg
Okay  danger to themselves. People can be blind  deaf  born with a mental or neurological conditions. I don't consider that a danger to anyone  including themselves,btohqsg
they see what sch u from,btohqsg
then set a percentage based on how good ur sch is perceived to be,btohqsg
those lower end sch be like,btohqsg
Huh? How on earth did that happen? It is in a different year from the 4As getting 250 right?,btohqsg
like do u think yjc pw is rly that bad,btohqsg
So if I fire a gun  I might faint. As long as I avoid firearms  that isn't a danger to myself.You are just adding conditions to make it work.,btohqsg
never heard of this happen but,btohqsg
I got ABBD and got 194,btohqsg
It really happen to one of my good friend,btohqsg
Cos A* is 91 and abovr,btohqsg
U seem to be in a more competitive year haha,btohqsg
If I get 70 for all 4 subject,btohqsg
My T score will be 210,btohqsg
I only same class as them in P3,btohqsg
It usually does not happen. They will always say such things to make themselves feel better only,btohqsg
And they tuition all the way to P6,btohqsg
That is the worst answer you could give. Conclude that I'm trolling when you can't even properly respond to me. What a joke,btohqsg
Ya i have finished my pw üòÇ just asking,btohqsg
I'm not sure but it certainly seems that way,btohqsg
it's no coincidence that the distinction rate for pw correlates almost perfectly with the cut off point of JCs,btohqsg
I think their parent tiger mom,btohqsg
Whatever. If you really want to  you could analyse them one by one.,btohqsg
Haha means 1 jc is an anomaly,btohqsg
Yeah the PW system is the most unfair system ever,btohqsg
I've seen some really stellar stuff from serangoon jc,btohqsg
not to say serangoon is good and dunman is bad,btohqsg
but there seems to be quite a bias,btohqsg
It's designed to keep the elite elite,btohqsg
I would agree with this honestly,btohqsg
Tbh the reason that jc does well,btohqsg
Is that more JJC style or PJC style? With the merger which school does the new JPJC follow more closely?,btohqsg
Just curious how the whole merger thing played out,btohqsg
1.25 rank points wouldn‚Äôt be that huge a difference imo,btohqsg
Yes that‚Äôs right  now give me your undeserved 1.25 RP,btohqsg
JJ PW is worlds apart from PJ,btohqsg
Advice for PSLE ^^ tbh I scored the worst in my class since p6 cause I came from overseas and I no idea what was going on  but I still got 2nd in the level,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs possible to score much higher in a few months,btohqsg
üõç Scientists at Nanyang Technological University have found that single-use plastic bags are more eco-friendly than cotton and paper single-use bags when used for only one time.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3lHXz3p,btohqsg
Do u need research for this ...,btohqsg
when u try very hard to keep ur ricebowl intact,btohqsg
H3 Math is what pure math looks like,btohqsg
Fm is still almost all computational,btohqsg
(Sorry for sending a long message)Actually  it depends on how one is usingLike I'm studying Materials Science course. I learnt about different kinds of materials  including different types of plastic materials.It can be true that single-use plastic bags are more eco-friendly than cotton and paper bags because they are actually reusable and recyclable (while cotton bags cannot be recycled and paper bags are not so eco-friendly because they are actually from trees - we don't have enough trees already). However  many people prefer using plastic bags for throwing the rubbish.In Singapore  once one is using plastic bags for throwing the rubbish  that plastic bag cannot be recycled anymore because of contamination. Moreover  they will just burnt the whole bag of rubbish (including that plastic bag)  which can produce dioxin gas (a type of toxic gas).More and more dioxin gas will be produced from burnt plastic bags which may cause climate change or anything that can be harmful to the environment  unless either people want to reuse the plastic bags as many times as possible before those plastic bags get recycled or just bring reusable bags.Think about one thing. How were the people in the past able to throw their rubbish without plastic bags?,btohqsg
No need to sorry haha  thanks for your insight. I shared the article cos I thought it was a known fact   just like how we know that metal straw produce way more greenhouse gases as compared to plastic straw  and it can only be offset if the metal straw is reused at least like 100+ times or smt. So I'm like do u really need 3 researcher to do research to get this result,btohqsg
H3 is much more abstract  and helps you much less,btohqsg
"HmmThat's true. Don't understand why need researchers to do research to get this result.Feel like they just want to produce more plastic bags just ""for fun"".",btohqsg
how does pure meth look like?,btohqsg
Anyone here willing to ease my worries for o‚Äôsü•¥ü•¥,btohqsg
This period of time ngl i feel like giving up on studying cause i feel like i got no time to push up my grades,btohqsg
