crmc excludes all travel mcc related transactions. also  due to the amazelocalcap (1k per calendar month before they start to charge you 1% per transaction)  you might want to use crmc direct (don’t use crmc for in app purchases!) for eligible transactions,btohqsg
Good with or without Amaze card.,btohqsg
