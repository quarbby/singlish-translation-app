everythg i studied nvr come out,btohqsg
Bruh i forget what alloy sia,btohqsg
I pounded blast furnace until 1AM yesterday,btohqsg
I screwed up my qualitative analysis,btohqsg
Was almost late for the paper,btohqsg
I never study air and blast furnace,btohqsg
I check tys all the air is mcq wth,btohqsg
Fucked up my qa lol i put calcium sulfate,btohqsg
Should have go with my gut feel,btohqsg
Dilute acid less distilled water and,btohqsg
for u to find out for me to know,btohqsg
Wtf i didnt do 3 question,btohqsg
Section b i never do at all,btohqsg
You just said the paper was easy...,btohqsg
Idk if easy or not behind,btohqsg
Cause change from gas to solid,btohqsg
Down the group turn solid what,btohqsg
Bruh everytime exam i forget everything,btohqsg
wait shldnt it be bc of the strong forces between atoms,btohqsg
I said the physical state of matter changes from gas to solid as it goes down the group. Thus more energy is needed to overcome the FOA between particles. Therefore m.p increases,btohqsg
Idk if my ans can tho,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t the size of the atom increase,btohqsg
melting point increase down the group 7,btohqsg
Ye so the amount of energy requires to overcome the forces of attraction increases,btohqsg
So the melting and boiling point rise,btohqsg
lol i put steel for the alloy,btohqsg
but i forgot is iron n what,btohqsg
Actually just mention increase in relative molecular mass,btohqsg
they like never test alot leh,btohqsg
Just say relative molecular mass increases  hence the molecules move slower  resulting in stronger intermolecular forces of attraction and higher boiling point,btohqsg
Bruh i swear all like common sense question,btohqsg
if organic chem is not taken out honestly i think this paper is damn hard,btohqsg
i see the org chem questions i ðŸ¤®,btohqsg
is this paper counted as easy or hard,btohqsg
It has something to do with atom size what,btohqsg
Kinetic particle theory more on the mass,btohqsg
But atom size is part of kinetic particle theory,btohqsg
Anyone taking geog paper ltr ?,btohqsg
nope.... but others find it easy so idk,btohqsg
any idea what is gna come out for geog ?,btohqsg
i think we same class LOK,btohqsg
did u stare at the white t shirt dude when they say stop wriitng,btohqsg
I waitin for my student to reply,btohqsg
Wait for pchem were u supposed to do the entire B9 or choose btw either/or :O,btohqsg
Must choose between either and or,btohqsg
It went from 80 to 65 marks ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
But if u taking chem at a levels its kinda disadvantage,btohqsg
So neither choices were org chem?,btohqsg
So how was the pure chem paper?,btohqsg
They took out 15m if not i wouldnt have finished,btohqsg
cos a lvl chem rly is a joke,btohqsg
Bodok has gone even further beyond,btohqsg
a lvl physics has more use,btohqsg
I mean org chem at a level is literally 40% of the H2 syb,btohqsg
U r being like Neil right now,btohqsg
mm yep  but the same org chem content is only 2% of uni's syllabus,btohqsg
And having no foundation at Os can be bad,btohqsg
does anyone have the pure chem qn paper,btohqsg
This was the easiest chem ppr i have ever done,btohqsg
Lol notice that chem is a joke as you advance to higher levels,btohqsg
Iâ€™m dang scared for my combined science paper,btohqsg
Still dk how to do light and electricity for physics,btohqsg
"God said ""Let there be light""",btohqsg
ay guys ryan was wrong rite,btohqsg
What are the all the electricity formulas though,btohqsg
But EMI is not in this year,btohqsg
So don't have to know those for transformers,btohqsg
My main worry is the charge formulas,btohqsg
when will answers come out fr pure chem?,btohqsg
The angle of incidence which results in the angle of refraction to be 90Â°,btohqsg
Go check ur notes for more detail,btohqsg
Is it true Bell curve grading is not used in any of the national examinations?,btohqsg
Any has the 2020 o level pure chem paper,btohqsg
Anyone got combined sci chem paper ?,btohqsg
There was a diagram in there that required drawing??,btohqsg
i thought yall talking abt the structure of co2 and calcium chloride thingy,btohqsg
Definitely easier than 2019 2018 and 2017,btohqsg
didnt even read through tys ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Can only tell when I see the paper,btohqsg
Apparently one of the common  mistakes was to draw the energy profile diagram instead of energy level as asked by the q,btohqsg
Hehe who study blast furnace ah,btohqsg
they shld change blast furnace to thr cauldron from minecraft,btohqsg
thats the last thing i attempted lol,btohqsg
oh yeah now that i realise ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Bell curve confirm gonna be 80+ lmao,btohqsg
i thought i was going to die lol,btohqsg
My bro took combined sci that why I only got combined haha,btohqsg
umm lets wait for mcq 1st...then we talk,btohqsg
Probably gonna study mcq everyday for 2 week,btohqsg
u see me doing 10 mcq papers per day,btohqsg
Shd get close to full marks,btohqsg
That's more than I studied for Os in general lmao,btohqsg
Like i just do 20mcq for,btohqsg
I digging my grave while memorising,btohqsg
I only need 5 subject so,btohqsg
Wah i also want to drop,btohqsg
I think I minus less than 5m ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
People are gg to look for u man,btohqsg
But it was so much easier than y prelim paper,btohqsg
Ok my class found it easy though idk,btohqsg
It kinda was. But that's why bell curve I scared,btohqsg
I dropped humans for a math,btohqsg
I dont think I can get,btohqsg
when they ask for electronic structure,btohqsg
Itâ€™s ok I minus like 5m for practical,btohqsg
I minus more than 10 wtf lol,btohqsg
they say the structure so idk,btohqsg
Dot or comma shld be can,btohqsg
But no speed of reaction all,btohqsg
Better than A math at least,btohqsg
Speed of reaction easy marks brooo,btohqsg
Anyone here stress eat after exam,btohqsg
I just eaten 3 macdonald setmeal,btohqsg
Was A math really that bad....,btohqsg
Nah cant afford to still have tests,btohqsg
I'm sorry I dumb cant relate to ur intellect ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Juniors gonna cry when they saw the 2020 paper,btohqsg
I didn't sit for the paper just saying,btohqsg
I just eat msg straight from the package no difference,btohqsg
Its always harder under exam conditions,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why every batch says that their batch paper is the hardest,btohqsg
Dude i am doing my As haha,btohqsg
I mean I think it was more due to time management,btohqsg
I still hear his voice after all this years,btohqsg
Err abt the same i guess,btohqsg
well  every years batch will find previous years easier  thats cuz youre under exam conditins,btohqsg
2016 i rmb is quite easy,btohqsg
every yr is ez except ur yr?,btohqsg
No I think another year was harder,btohqsg
I must be a dumb kid,btohqsg
I cant believe i buy 3 meal they still ask me go away,btohqsg
U must really love that sticker,btohqsg
I can hear the sticker sia,btohqsg
Idk how i got this sticker,btohqsg
think it was pretty manageable ?,btohqsg
pure coast qns came out for core geog :// but i didnâ€™t really revise coast so meh but the coast questions should be manageable for those who studied,btohqsg
Lol 4m only weather and climate,btohqsg
The marks still same for combi tho,btohqsg
how can cancel qns and same marks,btohqsg
cos  we cancel the choose qn,btohqsg
then they chnge some 3m to 2m,btohqsg
my other factor i out government eh,btohqsg
those that make packages and organise tours,btohqsg
i- fked up my w&c qns 2,btohqsg
i nvr state any intrument at all,btohqsg
Didnt u say u gna ditch weather,btohqsg
one i go do qns 1 and 4 and 5&6,btohqsg
the other i do qns 2 and 4 and 5&6,btohqsg
then i was deciding which to hand up,btohqsg
i dont even have time to finish,btohqsg
but still i shld hv jus handed up the tourism one that i did:(( and sleep for 1hr,btohqsg
my cher say alw choose wnc for fieldword idek why,btohqsg
ikr i use o lvls to test doing w&c LOL,btohqsg
I TOT ACCURACY IS JUS UK,btohqsg
i mean all of us alr dead from chem,btohqsg
HOW IK ACCURACY IS FUCKING NEED NAME INTRUMENTS ONE,btohqsg
the 4 hour break did more harm than good,btohqsg
i read blue soln as blue ppt,btohqsg
so all my answers r iron(ii),btohqsg
no one is a s dead as me,btohqsg
HAHAHA I STUDIED GEOG IN KOPITIAM,btohqsg
I hope i C6 if anything,btohqsg
Yes if i get more than 26,btohqsg
Same but after all this shit,btohqsg
they say the bullcurve for humanities alw quite gd but since dis yr dh bellcurve,btohqsg
how does the moderation work tho,btohqsg
Cos i think i fail 40+,btohqsg
That is a rly good and easy gi,btohqsg
OKAY MOST OF US R DONE WITH GEOG,btohqsg
Whrs my 1 and 4 gang,btohqsg
aiya fk geog la i jus anyhow oni,btohqsg
no one an elect geoger :(,btohqsg
I nvr study weather so bs also cannot bs,btohqsg
I bs the whole paper liao tbh,btohqsg
i nvr do wnc before i also do,btohqsg
but the accuracy one i fk up la,btohqsg
cambridge marker vv nice de dw,btohqsg
The last time i touched weather was FEB,btohqsg
they marking during winter shd be in gd mood,btohqsg
i like only remember 5% of what i studied haha lol i fail alr ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
What was the essay questions o,btohqsg
bruh my class was literally breaking down 1hr before exams lmao,btohqsg
I remembered 0% dw im moving the bellcurve down,btohqsg
actually u can use most of d ones from eq for tsunami,btohqsg
Lol tsunami was tested in my timed practice,btohqsg
Anyway I take full geo so I donâ€™t know about the paper,btohqsg
Bro anyone didnâ€™t see photograph C also LOL,btohqsg
Btw the hardest landform they can actually test is caldera,btohqsg
use sucha  gud piece if oaper,btohqsg
isn't caldera just the side fall in,btohqsg
U need describe the water also,btohqsg
ltr one dude write job instead of off,btohqsg
yes richer than me at least ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Cause I take pure so idk the question,btohqsg
So I ant comment on it,btohqsg
nope like what my prelims did ðŸ¤£ haha jokes,btohqsg
did u guys write both positive and negative for effects?,btohqsg
u need to use it tho,btohqsg
yeah they give us colour one for prelims ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
cos they ask u to refer to it,btohqsg
so not so much damage done,btohqsg
I used d words in diagram but then accidentally said photograph C so it looks like I did refer,btohqsg
they talk about on environment and people,btohqsg
im sure no need talk about caldera lol,btohqsg
there's a range of points u can give la,btohqsg
i think u get 5 can alr,btohqsg
dis time d questions quite ambiguously set,btohqsg
i think i wanted too much alr,btohqsg
GCE O Lvl Sci Chem 2020 Paper 3 (Suggested Ans).pdf,btohqsg
den the drawing one all correct,btohqsg
den the ionic equation WRONG LOL NOT SURPRISING,btohqsg
They asked to account for the structure tho?,btohqsg
"Isn't that what ""Acocunt for"" means?",btohqsg
i think must explain ash layer  lava layer  secondary vent  crater and main vent,btohqsg
thats 5 points = 5 marks,btohqsg
i disnt expect them to ask that,btohqsg
den my fren say wont one,btohqsg
Aiya now i jus hope 3a 3b la hor,btohqsg
Guess i wont get to see the pure chem paper,btohqsg
If i do i will do the paper from scratch,btohqsg
anyone got combined scienc (chem) paper?,btohqsg
sorry  I need the softcopy itself  . _.,btohqsg
not the answers  sorry for not making it clear,btohqsg
Is Bernoulliâ€™s principle in the combined physics syllabus,btohqsg
wth pure chem looks way easier than combined chem,btohqsg
Pure chem prob will face a more extreme grade moderation this year,btohqsg
Maybe 85 instead of 80 for A1,btohqsg
Welp I lost between 20 - 25 marks for combined chem,btohqsg
U will end up in b3 to b4 range,btohqsg
The same amount of marks lost for pure chem in this scenario,btohqsg
Lol I want my physics and paper 1 to pull be up to an A2,btohqsg
combined humanities 45% can pass? i heard moderation very high,btohqsg
Most subjects 45% is alr C6,btohqsg
What's the percentage of paper 1 for combined?,btohqsg
Seab is maximising number of passes,btohqsg
And only controlling number of As,btohqsg
dkwkdickekwksk nice statement im happier now. thanks,btohqsg
it makes sense  thats why so many people's l1r4 prelim from 30+ become <20,btohqsg
And given that 15m was removed and same time shd be ok right?,btohqsg
Wont be surprised if ppl rly get 65/65,btohqsg
i got 13 wrong for combined science,btohqsg
And got tricked by jean/beth qn,btohqsg
Ya lah but other than that its fine right,btohqsg
Usually for combined humanities what is the range of marks to get A1?,btohqsg
But will it fluctuate every year?,btohqsg
I lost 5m to callus mistakes,btohqsg
Humanities/English A1 is traditionally lower than Math/Sciences A1,btohqsg
U can expect b3/b4 to be around the normal score range,btohqsg
If not a bit lower/higher depending on subject,btohqsg
A2 >70A1 78-82 depending on yr,btohqsg
Lookin at this yr paper  a1 may be as high as 85,btohqsg
New syllabus subjects right btw1st yr of examination there is no moderation supposedly. Even if have not so much,btohqsg
I rmb my A lvl h2 math overall score was quite tragic,btohqsg
Bec A level H2 math is very diff,btohqsg
Mm yep but past predictions of A is abt 75-80 overall,btohqsg
My batch can bring back the paper,btohqsg
So i just write my final answer and check answer,btohqsg
