Hi guys so with my maybank FNF card if lets say I buy from NTUC  Redmart and the MCC is eligible for 8% cashback  if I pair with Amaze the same MCC will be used right? and I will still be eligible for 8% cashback,btohqsg
Yes. But u can just use the card direct also get 8% no extra benefits for using amaze for local spend on fnf,btohqsg
oh so there is no additional benefit to pair amaze with fnf ?,btohqsg
Local spend no extra benefits if use overseas u get a better exchange rates than the bank lo and the instapoints,btohqsg
oh wow I had no idea on that ! easier to just use fnf directly then haha,btohqsg
Actually if lock up 10k  you lose about $300 in interest per year on opportunity cost.If you do enough 4NF to recoup the $300 and annual fee then maybe make sense,btohqsg
ohhh UNLESS!! I go and spend in malaysia and pair it with fnf  then I will get 8% cashback + good exchange rate. right!? lol,btohqsg
Amaze + Credit card has 3 main features :1). Convert transactions from offline to online2). Prefix the transaction description with ‚ÄúAMAZE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù.With this  some credit cards exclude the rewards. eg  UOB KF exclude Amaze from OTA travel related.3). Reduce the foreign currency spread.,btohqsg
It's not good rates . Better rates than banks but still higher than trust youtrip etc,btohqsg
"Haha not sure if #2 is a ""feature""...",btohqsg
Mainly to raise awareness ‚ò∫Ô∏è. So everybody know if a credit card give rewards based on description  shall avoid using the card combo with Amaze..,btohqsg
Is VCMA and RSTU considered part of additional wage calculation for CPF? The 30k cap.,btohqsg
Is it worth to get a new credit card that requires you to pay annual fee to earn miles? I'm looking at HSBC TravelOne or AMEX.,btohqsg

Depends on the amount of miles  cash you need to pay  and your own personal valuation of a mile,btohqsg
U shld go for higher mpd like citi rewards uob lady's.. hsbc t1 only get for the 20k miles welcome bonus,btohqsg

Just wanted to ask if I link my Citi Cash Back + (not Citirewards as I don't have it)  to Instarem Amaze  is it better than using Youtrip? Am going to make overseas spend on Hotel and am thinking which way is best for this with the current cards I have. Unfortunately I don't have UOB Ladies or Citirewards card atm,btohqsg
It depends on how you see things. For non-promotional pricing for US stocks and ETFs  I am using IBKR because I DCA  for eg  USD 100 and the fee is only 0.38 USD  for fractional trading. Other brokers charged more after their promotional price are over. IBKR can access Iondon stock ex so that is also an advantage over other brokers.Syfe offers 2 free us trade per month which is pretty good too.,btohqsg
