My friend regular at this workshop GAG.Brought his own spark plug and gear oil.Also kena expensive labor.He said might as well change at the shop. Same price. No savings at allüòÖ,btohqsg
Ask him move on from there,btohqsg
Got major difference after soundproofing ma? Idk eh  i read online some ppl say not much difference for the price they paid.,btohqsg
I was quoted S$1800 for ‚Äú3 layers‚Äù STP before from rep. workshop (Confirm kenna chop head quote),btohqsg

3 layers .. tell me it‚Äôs STP highest range alr. Bs with me  show me a STP gold instead of STP Aero diamond,btohqsg
Many labour is one  but i don‚Äôt think the labour cost should be that much either LOL.,btohqsg
Oh expensive.My friend 4 wheel arch 600$ 2 layer.1 layer will do.Sound proof must doEngine bayDoor and floor first.Wheel arch don't do yet.,btohqsg
Thing is  i‚Äôm running lower profile and wider tyres  road noise is significantly more. Thought of soundproofing it to target the wheel rolling noise,btohqsg
people funny hor... change exhaust  change intake  the car sounds so nice liao  then do sound proof,btohqsg
why you ask me? weiii just because I do manual labour work ... ü•¥ü•¥,btohqsg

EV quietness is useless if you immediately change to big rims + low profile tyres,btohqsg
