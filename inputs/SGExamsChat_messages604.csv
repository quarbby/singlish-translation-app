chem consistently >90% at O lvl,btohqsg
Abt to submit my apps LOL,btohqsg
I actually struggled with Physics at O lvl,btohqsg
then Physics decided to snatch me away from Chem,btohqsg
skid about to go back into his HELPPPPP phase when he gets rejected from overseas uni,btohqsg
i think if i go sec 5 after n levels im a masochist confirmed,btohqsg
unless you got raw 5 then,btohqsg
if i go sec 5 my only objective is JC,btohqsg
if not i might as well take safe route to poly,btohqsg
i think if im already planning to go sec 5 i might as well do o level questions instead of n levels,btohqsg
U might as well do a lvl qn,btohqsg
i got do a level questions b4 brother,btohqsg
bluds trying to go to rjc,btohqsg
i have no chance for rjc lmao,btohqsg
my only chance to rjc is dsa,btohqsg
sec school bio is all memorise,btohqsg
you memorise a whole answer you immediately get the question right alr,btohqsg
a lvl bio is not all memorize meh,btohqsg
O and A lvl Physics also possible to all memorise,btohqsg
You legit switch for the most ... reason,btohqsg
2yrs ltr I STILL don't unds why yt chose geog,btohqsg
skid why out of all characters from alice in borderland you like that one dude who was from the game where you tell what‚Äôs ur symbol,btohqsg
"when I was doing my A lvl Phy and encountered a tough question and solved itI was going like""yes! I'm going to get my A""",btohqsg
when i was doing a level prelim papers it took me half the day to complete one school,btohqsg
how did u get into semicon,btohqsg
I personally didn't even do the prelim papers at that time. I was that confident,btohqsg
but i mean even if I spent that long,btohqsg
electrical engineering  specialise by taking specific modules,btohqsg
how hard was it to get into ee,btohqsg
super easy. one of the lowest entry requirements,btohqsg
what are the chances of getting into rjc or hcjc with 6-2,btohqsg
y did u leave semicon btw,btohqsg
me too. chem was better for me until i hit jc,btohqsg
because I lazy to work 8am to 5pm,btohqsg
at that time China was on the rise and there was a trend of manufacturing moving towards China.That's before Donald Trump became president,btohqsg
how was the money tho  int in it cus money lmao,btohqsg
that's usually about where the cut off is,btohqsg
Normal. Govt job would have paid more.I was serving a scholarship bond mainly. Resigned after bond completed.,btohqsg
ok should do a SgExams scholarship interview workshop?,btohqsg
i mean you have the drive to actually learn and attempt it now. if you go jc that's like 4 years to hone the concepts,btohqsg
how and what to speak during interviewsBy scholarship holder who failed multiple interviews before securing one-- learn from my mistakes and avoid them during your interviews-- shortcut your effective preparation with the common HR challenge questions-- the main difference between govt and private scholarships and how you should approach them,btohqsg
ok anyhow write. Its not a real event btw,btohqsg
heard its very hard to get a scholarship tho,btohqsg
also my the time i take a levels should be the new 70 rp system?,btohqsg
next year J1s will be 70 rp system,btohqsg

just need focus on o lvl first rip,btohqsg
hoping they bring back capacitors and kirchoff laws to physics,btohqsg
just unsure cus my schools standard is bottom of the barrel lol,btohqsg
easy doesn't mean no hard work needed,btohqsg
so hard to estimate my marks,btohqsg
just do tys and get the general feel,btohqsg
still dont like the uncertainty bobian,btohqsg
regardless how bottom  there's a minimum standard in questions due to the way it's set.So still ok,btohqsg
true storyA Physics student I had  whom scored A1 for A Maths her entire 2 years without tuition  got B3 at O lvl.Not because can't do  but because had a super bad sinus attack that morning accompanied with massive headache.,btohqsg
moral of the storyyou can be very certain  but curve balls could still be thrown at you,btohqsg
does not mean go and buy Toto btw,btohqsg
i just need to win once frfr,btohqsg
gg i wouldve flown up to heaven to fight god,btohqsg
though I told her  I would have scored >95%  and a headache would reduce me to 80%,btohqsg
another 15 years on  you won't think about it,btohqsg
another 20 years on  you will be monitoring your finances and plan early for retirement.,btohqsg

whether schools choose to teach their students this,btohqsg
i have a 35 page and counting document right now analysing the paper üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
this is why i think gp tutorials are useless,btohqsg
"and why when i do tuition  I focus more on ""How to think critically"" and ""How to write essays""",btohqsg
cuz no pt i force feed u more content when ur sch alr doing that,btohqsg
RI just tell their students use chatgpt üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
"Wym   if the world isn't fraught with such vices  why would ""betterment for society"" /"" voluntary work"" exist or be necessary",btohqsg
actually wtv I said can be a double edged sword,btohqsg
Not me walking into a lion's den,btohqsg
"funniest shit ever was when my friend a RI scholar told me""Oh my sch cher just told us to use chatgpt to write""",btohqsg
A potential argument for this is that,btohqsg
Idk like I know content but when arranging my thoughts and shit,btohqsg
Then I went back into a slump,btohqsg
There are people out there who volunteer because they wanna help society. By helping society  they are ultimately fulfilling their own goals  so it is more about benefit yourself vs benefit society,btohqsg
