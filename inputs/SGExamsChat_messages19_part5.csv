Anyone have any idea if my reserved place in ntu will be withdrawn/ forfeited if I applied again this year?,btohqsg
as long as you dont accept another course offer from another uni  u will still retain it.,btohqsg
that being said  even if u were to accept another course from another uni  but decide to go back to choosing your original ntu offer which you currently have a place in  you can always finalise your decision by end May this year (I forgot the exact deadline),btohqsg
Will it be the same if I were to apply for same uni but diff. course?,btohqsg
as long as you dont accept another course offer from another uni  u will still retain it.,btohqsg
