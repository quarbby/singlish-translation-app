Nope  if you're a FT-er  either there will be a mode of study (FT/PT) on your matriculation papers  or else you'll have to email and request for one from your registar for a student status letter. Should emphasise that you need the ft status from them,btohqsg

Hi just to check which BTo has a balcony for a 3 room flat?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if we need to have enough HLE loan amount to cover the remaining of the house during the booking of the flat . Then will be reviewed during the key collection to check whether you are able to service the loan.Or no need to have sufficient amount of HLE to cover the remaining payment of the house during the booking of the flat and then take the risk to review the HLE during the key collection which will be 4 to 7 years later as the loan amount might increase due to higher salary?Eg. House 600kCurrent CPF 60kEhg grant 35kHle currently given in 1st draft 250kWhich not enough to cover everything unless use cash and future cpf? And if there's an higher HLE amount in the future,btohqsg
If HLE not enough u will need to have enough CPF/cash for the balance.,btohqsg
HLE will increase when salary increase. But HLE will also decrease if ur age increase.,btohqsg
If you still young then age is not issue.,btohqsg
HLE is the amount they loan you.So u take (House - CPF - Gant - HLE) = remaining amount out of pocket,btohqsg
Oo thank you  does the HLE amount differ alot after 2nd review when the house is completed?,btohqsg
