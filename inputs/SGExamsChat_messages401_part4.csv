My family member â€˜s flight got cancelled last minute and the next flight is like 3-4 days later.,btohqsg

Since the aircraft did not even fly to SG,btohqsg
but i usually won't blame the airline itself for cancelling,btohqsg
if they had notice earlier then they should have said so,btohqsg
They only have 4 planes at their disposal with 6 destinations.,btohqsg

flexing over PSLE is the most stupid thing ever LOL,btohqsg
eh but that means ur sch good,btohqsg
Bedok can be q inspirational in the worst ways possible,btohqsg
only reason I tell people i never study for PSLE is just to illustrate my point,btohqsg
that it's not a good assessment,btohqsg
for example  discriminating against his own kind,btohqsg
