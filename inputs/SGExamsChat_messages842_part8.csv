actually a lot of buses do that now,btohqsg
that's why there are people complaining more about buses not stopping to alight or pick-up passengers,btohqsg
there are many buses that stops at more than 30 bus stops,btohqsg
some public bus drivers might see something in the peripheral vision but they won't give a fuck  because they're already making a turn into the main road even if you flagged,btohqsg
if you take the off-peak buses or arrive at the bus stop late trying to rush for a bus that's about to drive away.. gg,btohqsg
there's always different scenarios  so nothing's definitely set in stone,btohqsg
"some of these same drivers blame in a lecturing tone to the passengers of not flagging ""noticeable"" enough",btohqsg
LOOOL i bought it off tiktok shop some time after my birthday because 10k & 20k mah power banks are not enough for me (one person) to get through an entire day,btohqsg
too lazy to find sockets now,btohqsg
i have never heard of any powerbanks over 30k LOL omg,btohqsg
i used to bring like 2-3 laptops  2 phones  two power banks  at least 3 pairs of earpieces both wired and wireless as well as some stationary  out during my sec 4 days for some reason,btohqsg

Imagine if your bag got searched for being suspicious last time,btohqsg
my parents always called me some rich woman for being so unnecessary,btohqsg
nah  didn't happen once at all,btohqsg
not even when i brought like scissors and sharp objects that would count as weapons,btohqsg
im more concerned how you carried all that weight,btohqsg
i suffer from back pain now,btohqsg
i used a tote bag for my stuff and after half a year it felt like my shoulders were not aligned,btohqsg
my parents used to complain about why my primary + secondary school backpacks (mostly pri) weighed like a bomb aka heavier than 5kg,btohqsg
LOL i think is quite normal thoo,btohqsg
that one chem tb already 2kg,btohqsg
i estimate it 5kg and asked my parents if my estimation was accurate and they said no,btohqsg
my face was like speechlessly crestfallen,btohqsg
I TOLD THEM I REMOVED SHIT ALREADY,btohqsg
tolerable  but my back screams either aching or outright pain like i stretched too much muscle,btohqsg
this happens even if i end up standing for far too long in one day  and multiple times a week,btohqsg
my parents said just to rub some ointment or paste salompas,btohqsg
i dont think salonpas does anything for that..,btohqsg
back in 2017:my posture was already this bad..,btohqsg

LOOL honestly yeah  i shouldmy physical fitness and lifestyle habits make my life more miserable despite me wanting to be a normal living human,btohqsg
why i say normal living human is because im nearly a shut-in recluse hikikomori,btohqsg
there was one point (late october this year to middle november) where i barely talked to people and just drowned in romance novels/dramas,btohqsg
i tell myself it's okay but no  it's not okayim just deluding myself into getting my trululu,btohqsg
