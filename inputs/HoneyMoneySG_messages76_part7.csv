Mobile wallet transaction is not eligible. Use your amaze card to paywave,btohqsg
What is cpf shielding  mmfs etc??,btohqsg
Has some rule changed?From my understanding CDA cannot be withdrawn anymore. It goes into cpf mandatorily if not used for approved purposes.Long time ago yes it could be withdrawn as cash.,btohqsg
Just use amaze on apple pay is ok  amaze will convert transaction to online,btohqsg

Axs is excluded. Refer to tnc.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  was wondering if the UOB Visa Signature is a good substitute for HSBC Revo/Citi Rewards paired with Amaze? Reason being trying to consolidate everything under UNI$ and the min S$1 000 spend is not an issue. Thank you!,btohqsg
Yup if u can hit 1k on paywave monthly,btohqsg
I think by far uob have quite alot of good card like uob vs  uob ppv  uob lady that give 4-6mpd  and uob one and uob evol that give reasonable cashback plus the uob one account which is why i tend to have alot of uni$ as all their uni$ pool together,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs what I am trying to do too. Somemore I read that the VS card still awards the Bonus UNI$ for UOB$ merchants and it consolidates the spending vs the PPV which awards based on every $5 for each transaction.,btohqsg
Apologies for stupid question. Visa can now be paired with Amaze?,btohqsg
