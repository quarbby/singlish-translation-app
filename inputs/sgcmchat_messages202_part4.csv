WHERES THE ONE WHEEL PEELS AND REVVING,btohqsg
Gonna be hard to top the macan‚Äôs hole in one,btohqsg
need the kia koupe to come back,btohqsg
anyone can tell if this is repairable or total loss?,btohqsg
not sure it happen midnight few hours ago workshop opens tomorrow,btohqsg
this might not be repairable by the looks of it,btohqsg
key thing to look at is if your a-pillar and roof structure is compromised,btohqsg
yeah.. looks like A pillar has some damageüò¨,btohqsg
that might be the fender actually,btohqsg
the car still drives no engine light or anything,btohqsg
the fender for these eat into the a pillar,btohqsg
it's not about whether it drives or not  key thing is that the frame isn't compromised,btohqsg
problem is structural bro not if can drive or not,btohqsg
even a dent or two can total it,btohqsg
and if it's on your mind  no  legally speaking you can't pull the chassis to straighten it,btohqsg
yea i think there‚Äôs really bad structural damage hope for the best,btohqsg
Mostly superficial damage. Don't see why cannot,btohqsg
Chassis is unlikely to be damaged. Even if yes  it's very very slight,btohqsg
WOW WHERE IN MW IS THIS???????,btohqsg
WOW SO COOL!!! CAN YOU SHOOT MY 1:64 BEXT TIME,btohqsg
Repairable but depends on how much years is still left. Insurance might total lost the case if left 1 year or 2 cos its cheaper to do so.,btohqsg
giving you the benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
yes  repairable. but like DT said  clarify with your insurance if they prefer to buy out or repair,btohqsg
this is the correct answer. Its not about whether it can be repaired (it definitely can). its more about how the insurance company assesses the residual value of the car vs the cost to repair it. So if your car old or not worth a lot  highly likely they will total loss it,btohqsg
