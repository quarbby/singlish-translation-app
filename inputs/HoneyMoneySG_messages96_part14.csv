Can I check with ocbc Frank user  payment to ctrip/pinduoduo/etc via WeChat/Alipay wallet linked card  is eligible for 8% cashback? (Not sure how they detect the MCC as it‚Äôs not stated here),btohqsg
Yes  as long as not something under the exclusion list.,btohqsg
Hi! Have anyone tried buying physical card for Fairprice & topping up at Unity pharmacy to get 8% cashback on Maybank fnf recently - does this still work? Thanks :),btohqsg
Dbs credit card $388 sign up gift has anyone received the cashback already? April already.,btohqsg
You can probably check the MCC on WeChat?,btohqsg
I think there‚Äôs no mcc on WeChat transaction..,btohqsg
ü§î it's likely they follow the MCC of the merchant,btohqsg
8 is additional charge which will be reversed unless got extra charges like ERP,btohqsg
Do u have any excel that I can refer to? I did saw many ppl use excel but no idea how to calculate the ADB,btohqsg
Found out that mcc of WeChat pay is 4816 ü§î looked thru Ocbc‚Äôs TnC and it‚Äôs not excluded  probably considered as FX category. Will proceed to make another same txn to fulfill $800 n hopefully the callback from cs on Monday confirmation is a yes,btohqsg

Hi dear all.Urgent inquiry:Did anyone use Amaze card  but have duplicated transaction?I am using amaze card for overseas physical payment in  Japan. But the 1st time payment by insert card  the machine says did not go through. Then the says did the 2nd time - which at the 2nd time I sign.However later I found out there are 2 pending payment at my UOB card.I called UOB  CSV ppl say both are approved by the UOB. But informing me to ask the merchant  to only conclude one transaction and then the other will disappear in up to 2 weeks time.I returned to the merchant  informing so  and the merchant sales person says they will inform the finance accordingly as well.Now i would like ask and consult dear ppl here  will the Amaze Card as the medium add complications for such situation.  pls let me know your experience as i am leaving Japan for SG the day after tmr. i dont have much time left here,btohqsg
As the name says  Average  Daily Balance. Average of all the end of day balances in the month. To make it even more accurate  follow the transaction date of your transactions and manually calculate for each day.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/77752Hope the merchant refunds the error charge.,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply. Seems from your pinned message - so long as I contact the merchant to only claim once  not twice  it could be sorted out in this manner. Hope it all goes well.,btohqsg
I had the same issue with family mart.Eventually after 7 days. The first charge disappeared.Best for u to live chat with amaze now to log your concern.Yes amaze is the right party. Not Uob.,btohqsg
Thanks so much! Now suspecting this may end in Apr.. Nvr renew.. Haa..,btohqsg
Zig should use what card for 4mpd? UOB? Kris+?,btohqsg
hi anybody know how to transfer money to and fo australia other than wise revolut,btohqsg
Happens to me before also for my hotel booking. After few days the dup txn was cancelled also,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGsaw your video. Lady's card UOB say 1st Apr will have more exciting stuff coming. Should wait till then to apply? Haha,btohqsg
Anybody has insider info of what the UOB Lady exciting stuff? Do we have to change category before that?,btohqsg
No inside info leh haha. I duno want to apply now or not. Not a new card holder,btohqsg
odd day to announce exciting new stuff. maybe 8mpd  then next day tell us its april fool,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is ok if directly use in Zig,btohqsg
Just my thought. If the exciting stuff attracts a lot of new applications  you will need to compete with them to get it approve in Apr. Better apply now during ‚Äúoff peak‚Äù if you really need a Lady.,btohqsg
Sign up for ‚ôæÔ∏è Heymaxhttps://hmsg.link/heymaxand get 1000 Max Miles,btohqsg
My guess is Uob lady savings account will be buffed. But unlikely to be super buff la,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if UOB krisflyer card awards bonus miles for ShopBack and Fave transactions? Considered online shopping?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword‚ÄúUob krisflyer fave‚Äùto search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
is online transaction but the underlying mcc code is nt fixed and depends on the item that u're buying,btohqsg
Btw any one know where will take in old SG notes & coin's,btohqsg
It‚Äôs currently a useless account and for ladies only.But maybe 1st April onwards may change.,btohqsg
Still no refund of the $8 surcharge lolIs there a way to contact kris + bout this?,btohqsg
Isit posted transaction? If no  don't panic.,btohqsg
You said 1st Apr will have more exciting stuff coming  you sure no inside info? üëÄ,btohqsg
You‚Äôll not see separate refund transaction. Once transaction is posted  you‚Äôll see its amount is $20 (not $28).,btohqsg

Hi gurus. Given the S&P500's recent run  is this a bad time to start? Or does it not matter as long as you start and focus on time in the market? Have been trying to figure the most cost effective way e.g. Endowus vs IBKR,btohqsg
Depends wat ru investing with first  Cash? SRS? CPF?,btohqsg
