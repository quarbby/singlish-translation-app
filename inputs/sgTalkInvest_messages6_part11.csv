Anyone sign up ocbc SORA mortgage loan? Is it better than fixed rate?,btohqsg
At current situation  it’s better to sign for fixed rate as interest rates might be going up soon...,btohqsg
I was looking at SORA maybe rising,btohqsg
Even TBL term loan raise from 2.5 to 4.25 already.. So SOFA sooner or later only..,btohqsg

anyone manage to appeal success for 3rd hdb loan before?,btohqsg
Why HDB loan whereas loan from Bank is cheaper a lot...,btohqsg
my bank record no good. credit bureau report not nice,btohqsg
HDB also see Credit Bureau Report leh...,btohqsg
the 2 times we took hdb loans. my record already no good,btohqsg
Hdb will never reject loan for first two times iirc3rd time really need to appeal to Mp.Appeal hdb first ba. Don’t jump toMP until you have a rejection letter,btohqsg
beforehand already email to hdb resale to appeal 3rd loan  rejected twice,btohqsg
Then you see what criteria u can improve on  improve that then visit mp.The concept is you must improve on something then the MP got room to write to HDB that you are doing your best  please help,btohqsg
now is wait hdb reply. see how it goes. agent says hdb loan approval would b useful though is currently more exp than bank loan,btohqsg
Alot speculation say going to $1.,btohqsg

Now is drop drop and drop already... The dog fall down already,btohqsg
For resale  OTP  the seller agent is asking me to sign on it only after the bank loan approved. But bank is asking for the signed OTP.,btohqsg
