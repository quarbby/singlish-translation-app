Wah if I retake how bro,btohqsg
"encik moment ""if you cannot convince  confuse""",btohqsg
ngl being bad in handwriting even in maths,btohqsg
dont make your problem my problem,btohqsg
the dont make your problem my problem?,btohqsg
wait are u VJ 04 kid,btohqsg
were u thr when i was complaining abt the indian guy in my office,btohqsg
the one who said talking in chinese is racist,btohqsg
my opinion with this is i agree,btohqsg
tbh i only know 1 guy who would make such comment,btohqsg
not gon say his name here,btohqsg
1. I am not responsible for ur feelings2. I am not responsible for ur inability to do things3. I am only responsible for myself and that is my duty in life,btohqsg
these are just my principles so,btohqsg
I will help u to the best of my ability but this is contingent on u wanting to be helped and not just wasting my time,btohqsg
Ie i am not gonna sit down and give u 10 million solutions to ur life problems if u clearly dont wanna put in any effort in sorting ur own shit out,btohqsg
cuz idh time to deal with that,btohqsg
my friend went for a meeting with 6 wospecs,btohqsg
and they took 30min to do math which could be done with a calculator,btohqsg
dont make your problem my problem,btohqsg
"Wait how can ""handwriting in math"" be bad",btohqsg
can. maybe u write 3 as 5  z as 2  then confuse yourself,btohqsg
I tot Z is normally written with a stroke somewhere near the top,btohqsg
So it looks like a weird E ukuk,btohqsg
jk thatâ€™s what i do also,btohqsg
Omg wow  I think the govt is really allocating roughly the same budget as ej got for the new campus,btohqsg
But I doubt yijc can expect as much since theyâ€™re just gonna refurbish the old ijc campus,btohqsg
but my yr cant enjoy it sadge,btohqsg
i lowkey dont understand internet slang but I pretend i do,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA you should know it clearly by now,btohqsg
Imagine having your parent as a classmate in secondary school. ðŸ˜±CNAâ€™s On the Red Dot let 4 parents and their teenage children experience this for six weeks. Hereâ€™s how it went:https://cna.asia/3SRh2B1,btohqsg
i cannot this one is so funny,btohqsg
didn't they have one with primary schools or am i misremembering something,btohqsg
I wonder if they exaggerated the size of the running track,btohqsg
Why does it look bigger than the main building,btohqsg
tho still feel like main building might be small for more facilities,btohqsg
If it rly is that means the main building is small,btohqsg
Wdym by small for more facilities,btohqsg
i mean for like labs and stuff,btohqsg
Maybe the govt got more money to spend on the campus from selling away the additional land that asr wonâ€™t be using,btohqsg
Ohh ok I thought you mean smaller to build more facilities,btohqsg
At least your new campus doesnâ€™t seem to be cheap,btohqsg
Smaller land size so just build taller,btohqsg
did you do warm-ups before having gym/physical education class?,btohqsg
Yijc Iâ€™m not gonna be surprised if they just spend like 10-20 million refurbishing the old ijc campus and call it a day,btohqsg
I canâ€™t rly tell how many storeys the new campus has from the pic,btohqsg
Ejc new campus cost 100 million so asr should be roughly the same,btohqsg
I think so because this is season 2,btohqsg
oh ya on closer look does have more floors lol,btohqsg
if you don't have a choice,btohqsg
then try your best to manage,btohqsg
rounding error for 2024 moe budget  interesting lol,btohqsg
cuz otherwise things will spiral downwards from there,btohqsg
Never ranting on this chat again ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
i was so sick of chasing people for money that i ended up just paying for some notes myself,btohqsg
i did that for every subject,btohqsg
reminds me of my class currently making our class tee and only 1 guy dw lol,btohqsg
your first wrong move was to rant OR vent online,btohqsg
no the wrong move is venting with and expecting us to say specifically what you want us to,btohqsg
i mean not everyone online will comfort you and be nice mah  especially on any sg platforms,btohqsg
i was confused by that too,btohqsg
is it gonna be about your 0 rp,btohqsg
cause like to be fair if you vent on a public chat with 2k ppl you cant really expect any particular response,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t expect anything tho I just didnâ€™t expect like a lack of empathy but okay my bad yall ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
if you are expecting a particular kind of response then maybe ask your friends,btohqsg
you can go on r/rant or r/vent,btohqsg
ðŸ˜­ WDYM by a lack of empathy from my response,btohqsg
like honestly the difference between sg subreddit and other countries are nights and days bruh,btohqsg
is burette a girl or guy,btohqsg
they said everything but the correct answer,btohqsg
wait so how did you do,btohqsg
idk whatâ€™s your definition but nvm,btohqsg
h2s were all okish but h1s,btohqsg
Donâ€™t even get me started on MATH.,btohqsg
wait blaze dev how old are you/genuineqn,btohqsg
So complicated and I donâ€™t understand anything ever.,btohqsg
isn't the suffix -ette more of a girl nickname?,btohqsg
Is there an age limit here?,btohqsg
were you here when i changed my name to burette in 2022?,btohqsg
more context of what youâ€™re talking about,btohqsg
but why do u want to name urself BURETTE,btohqsg
its just that ppl here a bit blunt and also like,btohqsg
@chemcerseems like no one was around when it happened,btohqsg
i guess you werent around that moment when i changed my name,btohqsg
guess im still younger 1 sadge,btohqsg
i remember very clearly  it was the night before my a level bio prac,btohqsg
I wish I had a name that rhymes with burette.,btohqsg
Wbu how old are you? ^.^,btohqsg
the sec4s this year were p6s when i was sec4,btohqsg
Jesus thatâ€™sâ€¦ yeah I get why you feel old.,btohqsg
youâ€™re on the younger end here but not alone,btohqsg
cb you 1 batch above me,btohqsg
and you  dont keep saying my name in this chat,btohqsg
i need someone that isnâ€™t jun wei to be older than me,btohqsg
she is prob older than u,btohqsg
Anyone listen to Radiohead here. ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Omg same. I wanna get more into Radiohead.,btohqsg
I heard COP was 20 also,btohqsg
my bladder ( bradell ) spoilt already,btohqsg
Too much to the point I canâ€™t lie down in peace.,btohqsg
I mean hey in the very least brace yourself for what's to come considering this is a public chat LOL,btohqsg
Nowadays if score 14-20 legit no choice,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t YI moving this year to Jurong or smth??,btohqsg
Umm okok the google one only shows the outside,btohqsg
I wonder how the inside looks like,btohqsg
also they're not moving this year,btohqsg
What do people mean by they got offers from uni? Like will the unis send them an email saying pls accept out course even without them applying at all??,btohqsg
Bruh why they taking so long sia,btohqsg
I rmb when tjc move to Tampines it took like 1 year to refurbish the old tpjc campus,btohqsg
Right now got some scaffolding works there also,btohqsg
Bro later the principal come POFMA you,btohqsg
thereâ€™s early admissions using a level prelims and some even before that,btohqsg
Wow I feel so left behind now,btohqsg
Shdve started studying in J1 and not played a fool,btohqsg
itâ€™s fine youâ€™ll get where you wanna be,btohqsg
Does all school get same funding or what,btohqsg
idk but for uk uni is like you apply and they accept,btohqsg
what u guys talking abt ah,btohqsg
schools also allocate funding to different areas very differently,btohqsg
ri campus damn big n nice bro,btohqsg
it stretches across 2 mrt stations some more,btohqsg
The money comes from MOE not from the staffs pockets so everything is tracked,btohqsg
i heard need to pay like a few hundred $ a month,btohqsg
and also  not like they treat you any better,btohqsg
they got the old rafflesian assoc,btohqsg
They just painted it last year,btohqsg
That would be very sad leh. Not even 1% of the cost to rebuild a new campus,btohqsg
Theyâ€™re refurbishing the the old ijc campus,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not sure but moe said they would,btohqsg
Then once itâ€™s done move from yjc to ijc,btohqsg
i thought they moving to woodlands,btohqsg
the government JCs on paper get the same funding but donations from successful alumni make a big difference,btohqsg
if only 10 mil  not even rounding error on moe budget lmaooo,btohqsg
then itâ€™s how they use that funding,btohqsg
this entire jc in shambles bro,btohqsg
if a jc throws it into useless shit then ofc fucked lor,btohqsg
Tbh idk wth need to delay so long  itâ€™s literally just a refurbishment not rebuilding,btohqsg
Can be done in one year if they want to,btohqsg
Yes thatâ€™s where ijc campus is,btohqsg
you forgot my prof used to work for MOE,btohqsg
Announce in 2019 but havenâ€™t start,btohqsg
our sch alot of stuff is alumni donations no,btohqsg
Yeah so they moving to woodlands right?,btohqsg
ns effect bro  cant help it,btohqsg
yall sch got that plaque of donations?,btohqsg
Oh I thought both near each other but theyâ€™re actually opposite sides lmao,btohqsg
but our sch cut budget for ccas,btohqsg
if the age is on the clock,btohqsg
and i think the funds are shared between jh and sh,btohqsg
actually the only thing i might donate to dhs is a piano,btohqsg
the one at the audi there is so bad,btohqsg
i heard dhs campus vv big,btohqsg
imagine getting to study thr frim sec 1/y1,btohqsg
they got the statue thingy also,btohqsg
targeted at students int in sci,btohqsg
problem idw it linked back tome,btohqsg
i usually see julian the one posting these things on behalf of organisations etc but idk if it applies here?,btohqsg
time crunch cos they got not enough signups,btohqsg
atp i think they jsut gonna,btohqsg
Oh right they're kinda abit independent hor,btohqsg
Their alumni and dk who sponsor alot,btohqsg
Like got MP fund them also uh idrmb but iirc lah,btohqsg
my sec sch previous principal used to say ''we are the best govt boys school because we are the only govt boys school'',btohqsg
why would i donate to the school that barely helped me,btohqsg
Idgi Sia normally don't their alumni and anonymous donors donate q a hefty amt,btohqsg
And then there's still moe fund,btohqsg
no shit their sch budget alot lor...,btohqsg
and we are also assuming that they know what to do with the money,btohqsg
talk about equity and equality amirite,btohqsg
"but it's what ""elite"" schs are",btohqsg
I feel like to an extent it is what it is,btohqsg
but ngl if I think abt it it's rlly biased to those schs lor,btohqsg
bro bv always produces legends wym,btohqsg
I wonder what helped kickstart to the funding tho,btohqsg
In terms of them being independent part,btohqsg
I mean HM maybe there's some BTS going on uk,btohqsg
it's kinda shady if u think of it,btohqsg
Like damn what must be going on behind the scenes,btohqsg
I see normal schs like the donations a handful,btohqsg
See those kinda schs fking need two wall of fame or wtv,btohqsg
I gotta admit those sch vibes v diff lah,btohqsg
As opposed to the schs you and I normally went/go to,btohqsg
Ig they've been keeping the trad alive or smth idk,btohqsg
Passing down the prev batches vibe,btohqsg
Lol as in pass away ah?,btohqsg
Didn't this involve mostly sap schs,btohqsg
Ngl I find certain sch cultures/vibes too overly bombastic,btohqsg
school culture is a dumb thing to care about,btohqsg
it only seems big to an outsider,btohqsg
During orientation it's like a tornado,btohqsg
i mean it's big compared to other jcs but that's because jh and sh are both in 1 compound,btohqsg
'' i bleed red blue yellow'',btohqsg
plus dhs jh and sh share auditorium  hall  canteen etc unlike hwach where high sch and jc have separate facilities,btohqsg
cause i have friends in y4 rn then its easier to meetup,btohqsg
also last year i meetup with my friend whos y6 this yr,btohqsg
Y'all have string ensemble as CCA rite,btohqsg
damn why never tell us about him,btohqsg
sh string and choir got cancelled,btohqsg
alot of sh ccas got scrapped,btohqsg
Speaking of which isn't there a tmjc one recently,btohqsg
itâ€™s ok i didnâ€™t really do cca stuff in sh anyway,btohqsg
Ngl i wish i was in jh again,btohqsg
last time bv have ä¸­ç§‹èŠ‚ also,btohqsg
coz i rmb when i sec 1 they have it,btohqsg
den sec 2 onwards no more,btohqsg
i tot u mean higher chinese,btohqsg
"ye always confused me  you come stay for a few years and go  who manage this ""culture"" lol",btohqsg
"and its like the first dude who started the ""culture"" and the juniors continues it",btohqsg
when the juniors turned senior they expect the now juniors to follow it,btohqsg
i got one person in my sec sch retained and carried the sch bball team,btohqsg
but u need to pay for ur ipad!!! Actually ya the notes are ex omo...(but actually the only device i own in jc was my phone),btohqsg
my lecture book is still in my room coz i cant bear to throw them away,btohqsg
Meanwhile my jc classmates store them in the classroom under the table in the past*,btohqsg
i did that too omo  im too tired to chase,btohqsg
huh dont u need it to study for As?????,btohqsg
weâ€™d rather sacrifice our wallet than chase,btohqsg
dont the lecture have LOTS of blanks,btohqsg
that i cant even copy in time and have to borrow my friend's notes to copy,btohqsg
feel like classes dont intermingle/interact enough anyways lol,btohqsg
anyways not smth to argue abt eh,btohqsg
wah  but my school classroom is shared  so cant do that,btohqsg
j1 seriously running everywhere  and i believe in j2 we have homeroom but during recess / pe or whatever  j1 will use it (???),btohqsg
u immediately remember stuff aft the lecture ah,btohqsg
Retention or some study method idk,btohqsg
meanwhile  i heard speculations that mjc make the soccer boys retain to carry the team (???),btohqsg
Teachers hate him for this one trick to score well,btohqsg
I have a classmate who slept during A levels 1st paper* ane never showed up for the 2nd paper.,btohqsg
and they throw away their trophy,btohqsg
why the fuck are you here LOL,btohqsg
but how is that a trick to do well tho,btohqsg
WUT DU U MEAN  I HAVE BEEN HERE but I muted it like in 2020+ arnd there,btohqsg
i got called out by a prof in a lecture for sleeping,btohqsg
actually i think there was one math lecturer,btohqsg
and he became my fyp prof,btohqsg
if u caught talking / sleeping  she make u stand at a corner,btohqsg
majority of my class dun turn up for lecture lmao,btohqsg
i went bc my friends went,btohqsg
you mute alr then why suddenly talk,btohqsg
as the sem goes by lesser and lesser ppl come for lecture,btohqsg
Professors hate this one trick to get a PhD candidature,btohqsg
i wonder who is this YT that can solve math real fast,btohqsg
This Wyatt dude is younger than both of us,btohqsg
iâ€™ll be sure to fail yall if i ever TA,btohqsg
I do be an old soul,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s very nice of you to assume Iâ€™ll ever take anything youâ€™d TA,btohqsg
why are we suddenly talking about age,btohqsg
Or that Iâ€™m ever smart enough to take anything youâ€™d TA,btohqsg
for lab you canâ€™t stop me,btohqsg
bc each experiment under one TA,btohqsg
omg i want faster end this shit,btohqsg
and these two are my juniors in uni,btohqsg
my brain wanna give way already,btohqsg
can y'all do my cos1000 for me,btohqsg
Canâ€™t see my question paper during finals because itâ€™s wet from my tears,btohqsg
Is the 1000 in degrees or in radian,btohqsg
do u know ezhou or idk hoe to spell his name,btohqsg
one of the prof is pHd in physics iirc,btohqsg
Paiseh man doing his lab report hahahahaha,btohqsg
If lab report is due 2 weeks later itâ€™ll be done 2 weeks later,btohqsg
i threw you all my lab reports,btohqsg
No  it will be filled with drawings :D,btohqsg
uk what stupid thing i did,btohqsg
TA approve my drawings on lab report:D,btohqsg
the freaking job application  i put expected salary 'NA' coz i read the form wrongly,btohqsg
maybe it is a blessing in disguise,btohqsg
im still curious how this YT study math and chem without his lecture notes,btohqsg
i cant leave my notes in jc hahahaa,btohqsg
and still can sleep in lecture also,btohqsg
there's no lecture in jc i didn't sleep in,btohqsg
The worst part is 2 yrs of drawing physics notes were lost in the process,btohqsg
even in uni i was bad at staying awake in class,btohqsg
there was one nasty math cher  make those sleeping / talking to stand at the corner,btohqsg
I used to be always awake in Jc,btohqsg
like p sure there's only one mod in uni that i attended every single class,btohqsg
i think it wasnt even the lecturer  it was some other teacher walking ard the LT,btohqsg
mine kinda gave up on me LOL,btohqsg
then i remembered there was this guy dozing off by the wall,btohqsg
what can they do at that point,btohqsg
is ur lecture that small for lecturers to take notice hahaha,btohqsg
H2 chem has like 600+ ppl  H2 math idk  H2 econs 350+  how to take notice,btohqsg
I keep telling myself next sem ill be a better version of myself,btohqsg
idk my lecturers never really cared leh,btohqsg
I havent watched qm1 lecture since week 2...,btohqsg
Prof nelly made me realise I am not smart hahahaha,btohqsg
Wyatt if you need someone to tank bell curve im here,btohqsg
i got called to answer during math lecture before,btohqsg
Sorry boss ill get to it...,btohqsg
Eh but legit eh. Qm 1 legit no one can understand sia,btohqsg
is it the content or rainer lol,btohqsg
The fact that i dont even know we split profs for this mod,btohqsg
Christopos better be good at lecturing else I am outta here with my 6 graded assignments from 6 different mods for week 8.,btohqsg
At most ask dr si yan to help us with assignment,btohqsg
during math lecture  my class shared 1 row with another class  then the cher called for my class math rep (aka it was me la hhahaa)  then i shy to raise my hand coz my class was in the middle row sort of at lectuer's eye level. Then i took a very long while to raise my hand  then she suddenly said 2 ppl to ur right  and it was some guy from another class,btohqsg
and poor guy still looking all over and dunno who was being called,btohqsg
and the lecturer was like 'u dun look around  it is u',btohqsg
my lecturers like never call anyone to answer one leh,btohqsg
i was holding my laughter sia,btohqsg
TM the lecturer got every class list,btohqsg
My phy lecturer made the whole auditorium stand up just to do uniform check.,btohqsg
sometimes they even pick a random file to call names,btohqsg
do yall think the lecturer is sad if no one go for his class,btohqsg
He wasted 10 mins of precious time,btohqsg
in jc i stayed up damn late every day so i just slept through every lesson i could,btohqsg
my econs cher know i m not sleeping enough without me telling her,btohqsg
Yes. Because later the whole lecture kena disciplinary action by principal,btohqsg
sometimes i feel bad coz almost no one go,btohqsg
but to be fair they plan the lecture/tutorial right after exams,btohqsg
thing is for physics my class was in the front row so i really blatantly shutting off and dozing,btohqsg
Oh they are used to it haha,btohqsg
but they just walk past and ignore,btohqsg
my prof mass scolded us through an email,btohqsg
feel like some would be sad bc some legit prep,btohqsg
actually other than econs and that 1 sem for math  my class got allocated the back rows,btohqsg
my prof does a lot for his course,btohqsg
mine always either front or near it,btohqsg
displacement  initial velocity  final velocity  acceleration  time,btohqsg
actually im lucky my testimonial is written by my gp tutor,btohqsg
if it is written by my chem teacher  it may be ugly,btohqsg
coz my chem cher has got sth against me for some reason,btohqsg
wah i think my tutors tried to be very nice to me alr,btohqsg
All my teachers I know of left my jc : (,btohqsg
but there's a limit to how nice they can be to someone that's sleeping 24/7,btohqsg
she is our form teacher that doesnt even join our class for lecturers (she join another class),btohqsg
idk why she has sth against me,btohqsg
j2s during the first 4 weeks of sch before ori:,btohqsg
S202 be sending zesty sticker in the chat,btohqsg
Maybe the class does well for chem everytime,btohqsg
So in exchange she doesn't mind,btohqsg
i mean 202 is the 2nd best pcme,btohqsg
my class only me and another guy got A,btohqsg
then she gave us a lecture after returning our MBT scripts,btohqsg
wait that is a weird combi,btohqsg
Feel like h1 chem might be easier,btohqsg
H2 chem with organic  holy hell,btohqsg
Wym organic was the fun part about h2 chem,btohqsg
i was inspired by the 101 and 201 people (actually the top is not even in these 2 classes) to be on the board,btohqsg
the top in H2 chem for my batch was in 18S309,btohqsg
there are 14 people on avg that above 80m,btohqsg
im pretty sure majority of the 90rp is in 101,btohqsg
Yeah ik your social circle q small,btohqsg
Got 2 ppl from Arts stream,btohqsg
Then only one guy from s101,btohqsg
I wish to know my stats,btohqsg
mrs pang is a good vp,btohqsg
she deserve to take pam spot,btohqsg
i tot she is still in the school,btohqsg
Yep. I was *this* close to 80,btohqsg
isnt the batch specific year heads,btohqsg
i tot the 3 vps are overall taking charge of different thinks,btohqsg
i tot mrs pang is vp academics,btohqsg
I think she left  she taught chem,btohqsg
i gave an impression of being a shy kid omo,btohqsg
that is my nick name (like what mr gohell calls me),btohqsg
Mr oh sounds familiar  is he the always angry angry one,btohqsg
Hahaha good luck to sajc lmao,btohqsg
this gc is like TM + YI,btohqsg
I think coz the elite are elite and,btohqsg
i no better things to do,btohqsg
I just lazy to do lab report,btohqsg
im risking failing my final sem,btohqsg
that one is so fucking easy,btohqsg
my own report is in the file i sent you,btohqsg
oh ntu's recess week is after mid-terms i forgot,btohqsg
Do you want to know how f**king long the experiment is,btohqsg
I actually forgot cus it is damn lonf,btohqsg
i mean a lab session is 4 hours so,btohqsg
Luckily we just come in on monday and fridays just to do finish the scanning hahahaha,btohqsg
isn't that experiment literally just put the shit inside,btohqsg
But my friend scared the experiment give 2 seperate data,btohqsg
it's a good thing i'm not TAing for this bc otherwise idt i should know this LOL,btohqsg
you wanna be done with it so pls don't,btohqsg
lab report can't screw up that much,btohqsg
To any juniors looking here pls come to ntu open house :D,btohqsg
ok i go open house find you,btohqsg
Wtf is a load bearing human hahahaha,btohqsg
random qns do i put professor as the job or their other job,btohqsg
