Hello  can i check which miles cc is the best for booking SQ flights?I've checked Krisflyer UOB gives 3mpd on SIA.DBS altitude gives 6mpd for expedia booking but booking SQ flight through expedia is $100 more expensive.Thanks in advance‚ò∫Ô∏èUpdate: I realise SQ is not under DBS altitude's participating airlines for expedia. So even if i book SQ flights on expedia  i'm not entitled to 6mpd  right?,btohqsg
