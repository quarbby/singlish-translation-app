You waiting to claim 4x RTW business? 😂,btohqsg
I thought RTW already no more?,btohqsg
I send my msg on 30 Apr,btohqsg
Hi all.. just want to check/ ask whats a good card to accumulate miles? will be using the card for all spending…,btohqsg
Still have I think  except SQ No longer participates for award redemption,btohqsg
If in apr and nothing was wrong  should have been earmarked in May.,btohqsg
Too much miles in KF already. Already expired a lot. 🥲 And buy a lot concert tickets. Booked all holidays until 2025 liao….Thinking to play other FFP  learning from Suitesmile. 🥰,btohqsg
Oic. Means need to transfer our miles to other FFP to redeem  right?,btohqsg
I also looking at exploring other FFP haha,btohqsg
Sorry. What does that mean?I play miles so long  never used the RTW once leh…,btohqsg
This one i not sure leh. There's a possibility still can claim through SQ but.. no SQ flights.I.e. CSO help with booking on Star Alliance,btohqsg
good if you have long leave period or retirees. Booked for my parents before. Very worth it as Business to US already 240k miles i think.,btohqsg
Ya.Fai said AirFrance good. I check  it’s not bad  but the YQ is shockingly high… but kids miles is discounted. So you use less miles but more cash output. Still a little cheaper than KF.But then that’s how you get actual ORPHAN MILES! 😂😅,btohqsg
I used airfrance for my domestic europe flight. I checked the booking and i thought X amount of miles is for 1 pax.. then i transferred for 2pax... And THEN realised.. the X amount is actually already for 2 pax..Another way to get orphan miles.. lo,btohqsg
2023 was also the year I do stupid things like Advantage Suites from PVG-SIN due to expiring miles at 98k 😂But consolation is the 2nd leg SIN-CGK  which allows me to YOLO travel to a city that I never would think of going. 😂And Marriott was nice to have the promo of stay 2N get 35k Bonvoy which I stayed at Pacific RC for free. Amazing property.Forced miles spending is good  go out of my comfort zone.,btohqsg
Wah your parents Adventurous! 🥰RTW very worth it!,btohqsg
Ya sia! I choose 2A1C ma…Then I always think… walao… this is ridiculously.Until recently Fai said the child discounted then I noticed it’s the TOTAL miles required during searching liao! WALAO! 😂,btohqsg
Good leh. Cos all the senpai will jump out to correct him  and not the 'what does the TnC say' reply 😂. Though too much message post in a day to scroll n read.,btohqsg
I like this chat because can divide my IQ by 2  and post without thinking too much. Maybe other chat I kenna banned liao.,btohqsg
I am not sure I want to be compared to their legendary status. 😂,btohqsg
Can pay income tax using cardup by splitting into 2 payment 500 each that link to OCBC 365 and Uob one card to qualify for 500 cc spent ?,btohqsg
Hi Expert   how to check OCBC Credit Card application status ?Thanks,btohqsg
If you not earmarked in May  you have did something wrong. How much was your Mar MAB?,btohqsg
Call ocbc customer service to check,btohqsg
if reject   they sent us message,btohqsg
I guess so? Didnt get rejected so someone else can input.,btohqsg
Ok if approve ? sent me something ? thanks,btohqsg
Reject will get letter.I applied two times  both failed with letter saying I did not hit the required $30k per annum salary.I had to show my $2.8k payslip and CPF to the OCBC staff 2nd time I applying at branch.But I still got rejected due to $30k salary income requirement… 🥲If you approved  they will sms or mail you your card.,btohqsg
Uob absolute Cashback amex charged annual fee. Does anyone know how to waive it? I use the uob app to apply for waiver but got rejected. Any advice?,btohqsg
Call the hotline and speak to CSO.,btohqsg
2.8 x 12 is more then 30k liao right?,btohqsg
So proud 😄 i only apply for back up due to all ocbc card are not teir 1 or 2 or 3 card . Why so proud ? 😀,btohqsg
Exactly. That’s why I go their branch to complain and show my payslip & CPF the 2nd time lo. 😅It didn’t work. Same email from their department head stating the same reason again.,btohqsg
That happens to my uob visa card ... I give up... until I start to have uob stash account. I put in 6500. 6 months later become 10k. Then uob preferred visa starts to approved in 2021,btohqsg
Anyway eventually I find OCBC promos or miles program not very sincere  always got cuts there and there which is quite critical in one’s miles journey.Imagine you accumulate so long  then suddenly your points/miles worth suddenly changes rapidly.Especially the Voyage points that once said can redeem revenue tickets at affordable rates. I wonder how many managed to do it. 🤣,btohqsg
Stash account put $6500 good? How you turn it into $10k after only 6 months?,btohqsg
Just did right now  i received an acknowledgment SMS :«  Thank you for your interest in our promotion  we have received your submission of interest. Kindly ensure that you have submitted with the correct last 4 alphanumeric digits of your NRIC or Passport Number registered with UOB. Visit UOB PRVI Miles Card website for T&Cs. »You did not receive this SMS ?,btohqsg
Yes I ytd managed to sign up for it! 👍,btohqsg
Anyone knows whats the best credit card for big ticket item overseas spending?,btohqsg
Oh great  good to hear. Did they send you an email or anything afterwards ?,btohqsg
for me i will use trustcard,btohqsg
But I received the sms text. Same as what you copied paste immediately after,btohqsg
ohh what are the perks? cashback or miles?,btohqsg
Okay  we’re in the same situation then haha  hope it won’t take 3 weeks … apparently that’s often the case with Uob,btohqsg
cashback in link points 0.5% and low fx spread   0 fees,btohqsg
thank you  that is helpful. Any miles card to recommend? am i right to say 2.4 miles is probably decent?,btohqsg
How big? Can use contactless? Can consider UOB Visa signature if between 1k-2k.,btohqsg
Think now maybank got promo in jun for fcy spending 3.2 miles for horizon and vi uncapped,btohqsg
Win 4d. And salary 2k saving,btohqsg
oh great thanks! do u have the link?,btohqsg
