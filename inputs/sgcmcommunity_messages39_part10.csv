if its abit above the required  there will be a warning,btohqsg
I don’t like it at all,btohqsg
High risk but cannot do anything about it if all cars follow this 'trend'.,btohqsg
but i honestly dont see the need to unless u know ur car is burning excess oil or there isnt a sensor,btohqsg
i can check exactly how much oil there is in car,btohqsg
only downside is that when i wna work on the car at home  makes it tough lor,btohqsg

Oil sensor is really unnecessary. We already have oil pressure. It’s good enough. Besides dipstick way is easier for drivers to check oil level. The best method.,btohqsg
Oil change every 10kArd 5k will check but seldom now😂Because Honda Engine don't drink engine oil.,btohqsg
Internally there’s already oil temperature and pressure,btohqsg
Yes. Same with my boss car. I never check. It’s so good it doesn’t require checking or tip up,btohqsg
