Hi all  I stopped at this spot (marked in red) after the bus priority box in yellow during a red light. But a Cisco warden standing beside took a photo of me. Went back after parking but he was gone. Am I in the wrong?,btohqsg
As far as I know  if the bus alr hit yellow signal but u never stop,btohqsg
No bus was in bus lane,btohqsg
Was the bus preparing to come out?,btohqsg
Eh nvm U show us ur dashcam,btohqsg
Just that it was a red light. Then I stopped at that spot. No bus was in the bus bay before or after,btohqsg
Crossed over the yellow box as indicated,btohqsg
as long as bus coming out you must give way,btohqsg
Ya correct but there was no bus inside or coming out,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why funny the warden took my pic,btohqsg
then the cisco warden dunno doing what lo,btohqsg
Haha nvr mind wait for letter to come then fight,btohqsg
Does that mean the entire front section is mean for bus priority lane?,btohqsg
if got no buses there the box doesn't mean anything,btohqsg
Not only the yellow coloured portion,btohqsg
yellow boxes often will have space in front  always will have one car squeeze inside,btohqsg
Even no bus also cannot stop inside the yellow priority box,btohqsg
I am that one car today loh,btohqsg
but the gap should be safe ah,btohqsg
if is not supposed to have any vehicle there then they should just paint the whole way,btohqsg
That is why I confused also,btohqsg
