Hi bros  just to check if I were in Malaysia shopping  is it better to use Trust card to pay or to use Uob absolute to enjoy the 1.7% rebates?,btohqsg
Amaze + CRMC  if not trust will be better. UOB absolute will net loss with bad FX rate and 3% fee. Your 1.7% is gone from just doing that transaction,btohqsg
Have not tried before. Whatâ€™s Amaze?,btohqsg
Tks a lot. Will check it out,btohqsg
How to earn miles from those hotel bookings that says â€˜pay at hotelâ€™ at Bangkok grand Hyatt? I started from Agoda UOB prvi miles landing page and booked a suite cheapest options pay at hotel,btohqsg
Pay first is more expensive? Usually its the opposite,btohqsg
which vpn is the best now to use?,btohqsg
My understanding of Amex for overseas transactions not worth it unless necessity,btohqsg
There should be one video on paylah with posb daily. Seems my cash rebate is good on paylah. But not certain how is calculated,btohqsg
I have just applied for Cimb MC. And then link to Amaze later when I received it.,btohqsg
My Top 5 Rewards & Miles Credit Cards for 2023https://youtu.be/f8NqHMAb2Fw,btohqsg
Per the t&c  you must deposit minimum fresh funds of S$50 000 in your Bonus$aver Account at the time of account opening and maintain the sum until the end of the calendar month immediately after the calendar month in which your Bonus$aver Account is opened.I think it is saying if you acc is opened on 8 august  your 50k must be in the acc until 30 sept. And I think the bonus int likely to credit after 30sept so should be free to move to another account.,btohqsg
Then should be challenging since I didnâ€™t deposit at the time of account opening and was only planning to deposit today. Guess I wonâ€™t get any bonus then.,btohqsg
That mean you would get the maximum bonus miles from UOB PRVI  right?Perhaps Amaze + UOB Lady ?,btohqsg
I think still can Bec your acc is open within 1 aug-31aug promo period. Just that u need to keep the fresh fund of that 50k till end of 30 sept. Of course u need to be a new customer And also apply their designated credit card on top of opening the acc.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s quite tricky though  n really tough for those working a full time job to keep track of all these promos and shift monies around.. not passive at all. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yup. Meet all the requirements except I didnâ€™t deposit when account was opened coz itâ€™s online..,btohqsg
Will just try my luck I guess no harm trying just that if I donâ€™t get the $258 Iâ€™ll be wasting 2 months putting my monies there.. lol,btohqsg
Untill u want to go do tbills or ssb lor,btohqsg
