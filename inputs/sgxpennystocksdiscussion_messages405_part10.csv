"UMS Q1 net profit up 44% on sustained demand for semiconductors1. The mainboard-listed company also announced an interim dividend of one Singapore cent per share for the quarter ended March 31.2. UMS chairman and chief executive Andy Luong said in a statement on Monday: ""While the Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to challenging market conditions  it has fuelled increasing consumption of chips across a wide range of markets and applications  opening up significant growth opportunities for us  as global fabs continue to boost their production capacities and expansion plans.""3. Companies such as UMS which support the chip equipment sector are thus poised to benefit from this sustained semiconductor upswing  especially as the global semiconductor industry is forecast to hit record highs in fab equipment spending till 2022  he said.4. With the exception of the United States and others  sales from other key geographical markets grew significantly in the first quarter. Malaysia was the best-performing  with sales climbing 93 per cent to S$1.5 million due to higher material distribution sales. Taiwan was up 70 per cent to S$9.2 million due to increased component spares sales; Singapore climbed 51 per cent to S$33 million because of higher shipments of semiconductor integrated-system sales and component sales for new equipment.5. ""We remain optimistic about the future of the aviation sector as mass vaccinations and border re-opening efforts will increase in the coming months "" he said.",btohqsg
