If you received a number for SBF MAY 2022. Then you may get a chance to pick a unit before the AUG BTO happen. So in that case  no.,btohqsg

Hi  anyone has the link to the flat availability for SBf May 2022?,btohqsg
hi! when you successfully get the flat  HDB will provide you with the floor plan with accurate dimensions correct?currently for most flats found online  it’s the layouts without any dimensions,btohqsg
Hi! Yes they will provide a printed copy when you pay your first down payment for BTO. Also can be found in the myhdb portal afterwards.,btohqsg
看你那麼回覆， 您年幼時在念書一定是班長。多管閒事， 就是老師喜歡的那種。Let me translate for you. Ok sure  goody two shoes class monitor.,btohqsg
Hi  any upcoming bto in Ghim moh area ? I missed the May Ghim moh ascent,btohqsg
With about 40 per cent of invited applicants deciding not to book a flat  first-timer families applying to projects with application rates below 1.7 times stand a good chance of booking a flat. Last year  more than 35 per cent of BTO projects in non-mature estates with three-room or bigger flat types had application rates of 1.7 times or lower among first-timer families.,btohqsg
Anyone write in to MP before? Got use? No use?,btohqsg
No use. Last time maybe got chance. Now they want us to be “equal” / lottery.,btohqsg
Jurong application for 3 room closing time what was the rate ?,btohqsg
No use. But no harm going to the Meet the people session to present your case.Never try  never know. 😆,btohqsg
No harm trying. Good luck. Hope your MP fight for you.,btohqsg
Actually it depends on the volunteer who drafts your letter. If he writes with a negative mindset  than all is loss. 😅,btohqsg
wahhh for MP to write for you  if you first time trying  he/she will probably just advice you to wait  unless you have tried 5 times and failed kind,btohqsg
Go to see them...I did mine.,btohqsg
5 times failed liao but all mature estates cos wanna stay near parents. So dunno if they will pick on that,btohqsg
Oh then managed to get after that?,btohqsg
applied for the priority scheme but failed is it?,btohqsg
if thats the case  just go to MP liao,btohqsg
Mine was to apply for a flat.,btohqsg
5 times only. some here tried more than 10 times... mps sought. Myself included. Useless  cos everyone is in the same situation as you. Just look at the subscription rates. Demand vs supply. Nothing that they can do. Unless you tried 3rd child priority  5 times still fail  then can consider asking them.,btohqsg
Maybe cos MP nvr write for us lo,btohqsg
It's not that I don't know that the rates are bad  just wondering if MP letter helps,btohqsg
Write also ineffective... if u read this hdb article  you'll know what sort of ans to expect,btohqsg
This one they replying to forum letter ma  not replying MP 😈,btohqsg
Unless you are saying that with MP letter  this was the reply you got from HDB and still didnt get a flat  then I would agree that yes  write no use,btohqsg
u try and let me know if it work please. Then I go knock on mp door again,btohqsg
That's why  depends on ur case. If u are first timer couple. No kids... forget it,btohqsg
Effectively  MP can only write a letter to recommend  but not change the results,btohqsg
maybe got chance if that MP is in charge of Housing,btohqsg
