The cause is likely the bus driver underestimating how fast the truck was going to turn,btohqsg
He probably thought the truck would have completed the turn when he drive pass,btohqsg
well atleast the weather is nice and chilly.,btohqsg
The truck turned from the same lane the was on  you can see the bus try to do a evasive swerve to clear the rods,btohqsg
Wait why didnâ€™t the truck used the left turn lane tho,btohqsg
Is it leading to two diff roads?,btohqsg
Long vehicle tend to have to use the 2nd inner lane to the direction they are turning,btohqsg
That truck was never going to turn using that small ass turning lane,btohqsg
So in this case itâ€™s more of the bus fault,btohqsg
This is simillar to a famous fatal incidents that happened in bedok over a decade ago  a crane truck pivot arm swung into the upper decks of a passing double decker bus from the front to the back killing one person,btohqsg
Sometimes those reckless drivers really need to be sacked,btohqsg
