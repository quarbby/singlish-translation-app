"Hi all  i got a weird question that i will like to ask.. not sure if its asked before.I understand that UOB lady and PPV annual fee is automatically deducted by UNI$. UOB do approved waiver of annual fee  which i believe has to do with your spending done on the credit card monthly.What happens if i spend a ton on UOB lady  but a mini amount on PPV. Does UOB consider them as a whole and allow fee waiver for both cards ""easily""? or UOB lady will be waived  but PPV will be charged with an annual fee?In short  I'm trying to understand if fee waiver can be get without splitting my spending equally to 2 cards.. or i can just focus on 1 card will do",btohqsg
It‚Äôs likely they will consider overall spend on both cards but  to be frank  only uob can answer that question with accuracy,btohqsg
No need to think too much lol. Ask for waiver  and if they don't agree  cancel the card ‚úÖ,btohqsg
but by then means they deducted 6500 UNI$ leh.. and u dun get it back. Quite painful to accumulate 6500 UNI$. Thats about 2k+ spendings?,btohqsg
They'll return.Anyway never had issue getting waiver from UOB.No need to think too much,btohqsg
Oh? if they dun waive the annual fee  u cancel the card  they will return 6500 UNI$ back to u?,btohqsg
Yes. Make sure u have another uni$ capable card to hold the uni$,btohqsg

Hi guys.I want to enter the miles game and learn more. As business saver need to book separately between me and gf  how to ensure they have enough seats for both of us to claim using miles?,btohqsg
Besides the foreign exchange risk  non-SGD FDs are not FDIC insured. Also not kept in custodian accounts right?,btohqsg
If you can only book one seat at a time means they dont have two savers available.,btohqsg
Ohh okay. Then I try increase the number of adult to check  then book separately.Thanks,btohqsg
Oh you booking one ticket at a time cause not enough miles in one account to book for both?,btohqsg
What you can do is you book for you and ur gf for SIN - ICNshe book for both of you for the return flight,btohqsg
Yup not enough miles.Wow nice thanks,btohqsg
