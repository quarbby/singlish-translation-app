Hi all! I have a question for the HFE. I am unable to get any answers from HDB on this. For context  my husband does part time security every other week for fun and they do not give out payslips for adhoc payments. He tried to ask the companies for the payslips but he doesn‚Äôt keep track of the companies and he is not able to retrieve most of the payslips. Will that affect our HFE?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
don‚Äôt think ad hoc salary is included in income assessment,btohqsg
Oh okay thank you so much! We were just scared because we could not submit the payslips for our HFE.,btohqsg
you can just tell them you dont have access to those payslips  thats what i told the officer as well,btohqsg

Not sure if there have been any changes  but see here for the list of admins for Canberra Vista's confirmed resident chathttps://t.me/canberrafeb2020bto/30441,btohqsg
Can I ask some question?Background: One Singapore and one PR (Both working adults). Currently waiting for BTO flat selection  should be around end August 2023. Msia properties fully paid by parent. As dad passed away recently  there will be a succession of properties/inheritance of properties ongoing  probably by end of 2023. At this moment  mum is residing in the property.Question:1. Can we still go for BTO flat selection while still under succession process? in fact right now we do not own private properties yet.2. During serving MOP period can buy private estate in Malaysia? HDB would check one with Malaysia counterparty?3. If goes for resale flat  do I need to transfer ownership for the inheritance Malaysia properties before buy hdb flat?,btohqsg
You probably need to ask the HDB officer.I remember the bto application form did state that if you own private properties  either local/overseas  you'll need to dispose of them 30 months prior to the application. Same for resale but 6 months. Not sure if they changed anything.And you can't buy any local or overseas property during your MOP,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to apply for HFE as Singaporean with foreigner spouse and child below 16? I tried to apply as applicant and cited spouse and child as occupier but child doesn‚Äôt have SingPass. Would appreciate is someone is able to cite some insightsüôèüèª have emailed HDB but 2 months no answer lolüòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah held the line for over an hour  and gave upüòÖ,btohqsg
Hmm can try write in again asking for any updates and quote the previous case number,btohqsg
Child is Singaporean or foreigner ?Wife is foreigner or with any long term visit pass ?,btohqsg
Child is Singaporean  spouse is with LTVP,btohqsg
You and child both Singaporeans can applyDid you ( the Singaporean) work continuously for 12 months with CPF contributions ?,btohqsg
Spouse is husband and under LTVp ?,btohqsg

But seems like for Singaporeans  need SingPass to verify. Under 16 don‚Äôt have lolüòÖ but from what I understand  with Sp child shld be able to apply. Not sure why the website require SingPass verification,btohqsg
Can if your child is a Singaporean. My wife is LTVP my child is SC . Already waiting for key collection,btohqsg
