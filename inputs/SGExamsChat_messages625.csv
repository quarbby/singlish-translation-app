hello guys i’m just curious is portfolio very important for local unis?,btohqsg
back story : I joined basketball since last year and i’m thinking of quitting because i’ve lost interest for it and i really wanna study and do well for As. I have a leadership position too.,btohqsg
does it require a lot of portfolio ?,btohqsg
anyone got recommendations for priv dip,btohqsg
should i do via to boost my portfolio or should i just continue mugging,btohqsg
you are going to get very diverse answers here but personally  no. My take is  a portfolio is meant to be used to supplement yourself during interviews (be it uni or scholarships) so you can  theoretically  have just 1 activity but milk it enough to cover enough grounds so  no,btohqsg
priv dip nt recommended if u aiming for local U.,btohqsg
via? if you can link it to how it helps you and business stuff then sure  it's all about how your portfolio is linked and targeted to the course/scholarship,btohqsg
also i bobian have to go priv,btohqsg
wait so basically i should focus more on my As instead of portfolio right,btohqsg
eh how shd i improve portfolio literally a month before I apply uni,btohqsg
you sign on so that you have more time to improve portfolio 😎@chemcer,btohqsg
depends on what kind but the one like beach clean up bro....,btohqsg

do you understand what you're copying tho,btohqsg
when we could have continued on the research from last year,btohqsg
ofc got put the links in the credit,btohqsg
keep track of which sections come from where,btohqsg
uh do you know how to do proper citations for research papers,btohqsg
just not sure where citing ends and plagarism begins,btohqsg
i've seen A levels people doing PW that also dk,btohqsg
if the research paper is published like they have a journal they're from  volume number  issue  etc,btohqsg
oh ye wat is pw abt,btohqsg
it's just a year long project ba that culminates in a final report + presentation,btohqsg
Aye uk for my sch if u fail PW in y2   Ur supposed to retake till u pass in y3,btohqsg
Basically if ur taking GP H2s and PW,btohqsg
BRUH I'm the only 2 that got B for pw in my class,btohqsg
even if you cite you can't copy wholesale. if it's more well known knowledge then there's zero reason to have to esp,btohqsg
It'll be btr if u can actly find and solve,btohqsg
It can brush up Ur sgc,btohqsg
a group project i can hopefully be proud of,btohqsg
Not when udh a say in choosing teammates,btohqsg
i cant wait to cite myself in my own paper,btohqsg
And you'll be tasked to deal with shitty or good teammates,btohqsg
Bruh me and my teammate we fought for half a year,btohqsg
fun or not really depends on your group,btohqsg
good group = can be fun,btohqsg
shit group = hell on earth,btohqsg
cuz my group leader always wan do his shit and he doesn't listen to us,btohqsg
then I dw listen to him,btohqsg
why did i laugh at that,btohqsg
end up we everyday shout at each other,btohqsg
when not fun is it cannot agree,btohqsg
jc i tot most at least willing to work hard,btohqsg
dk what's in his brain xD,btohqsg
group work is fun to do smth bigger with more ppl  but will definitely have some that unhappy with the direction,btohqsg

It's not fair not having peer evaluation,btohqsg
Like what if I Kenna cmi one,btohqsg
There are only so few who are cooperative,btohqsg

My Cher was like oh y'all try settle own self first if rlly cannot tell let us know,btohqsg
my pw Cher everytime just reply one thing,btohqsg
i think hard to fail pw la. if they peg the pass standard to the old E grade probably no one in sg will fail lol,btohqsg

If anything I mean for me at least  it actly discourages and pull me down,btohqsg
mechanical the math and physics is mad sia,btohqsg
My chem Cher said the exact same thing,btohqsg
I read through the math 1 and 2 already,btohqsg
Help out at old folks home,btohqsg

thought iem also got math 1 & 2,btohqsg
i mean ofc it'll look crazy rn,btohqsg
but idt there's any course that won't initially,btohqsg
math 1 I can handle quite okay,btohqsg
math 2 is ok la. probably just cause u haven’t learn yet lol,btohqsg
anyway iem also got engineering math 1 & 2,btohqsg

oh u officially become ta for math 2?,btohqsg
i can send u the latest curriculum outline if u want,btohqsg
it got a bit complicated bc someone else took the spot then they're like oh maybe we can take one hour from a prof that's helping,btohqsg
since i need to clear hours,btohqsg
but then my faculty side is like no,btohqsg
ok context is the prof in charge of it at my faculty is kinda annoying,btohqsg
and a lot of times we feel he's just lazy to do things,btohqsg
so since the ta spots settled he seems unwilling to change,btohqsg
i guess maybe if every week different ta also a bit confusing for the class,btohqsg
he doesnt like you and rand,btohqsg
do i join back to see again,btohqsg
left liao manimaran in hq 9 div,btohqsg
ngl i'd almost wanna argue with him just to see how triggered he gets,btohqsg
basically tatabusa suddenly ask me about whether i will want to be a teacher for low pay and start yapping about money and then josh starts accusing tatabusa of trying to make me regret my career choices and starts personal attacking tata,btohqsg
Oh this is normal josh argument,btohqsg
"""Stop complaining about O Levels""""At least I dont need retake A Levels""",btohqsg
"""Lol he only here cause he has no friends""",btohqsg
Oh i went to read it,btohqsg
wait its cause he thinks 5K is alot of money also,btohqsg
wait what does josh wanna do,btohqsg
so he's gonna work in HR,btohqsg
like some people are perfectly happy going into a major for interest and accept that their job won't pay that well,btohqsg
wah I wish Josh is in NS rn,btohqsg
i would stalk him up and down,btohqsg
esp considering some majors you pursue for passion wont' net a job in that passion,btohqsg
if they do you reach a limited ceiling,btohqsg
unless you go back study more,btohqsg
i want do life sci also,btohqsg

"""Eating at hawker center once in a while = I understand the commoners plight""",btohqsg

i wonder wat happen to zl,btohqsg
when josh was complaining about rand,btohqsg
zl is ignorant but josh gets so triggered,btohqsg
he got pissed at me cuz i told him to stop complaining about how difficult the paper was and focus on the next exam,btohqsg
I tot Josh and Rand were quite aligned in terms of views leh,btohqsg
tbh idk what you two even did LOL,btohqsg
if anything i thought he'd be flaming the other rand,btohqsg
a bit overboard alr  dont be so mean lah,btohqsg
i'm still trying to wrap around the whole,btohqsg
eat at hawker centre = common man struggles,btohqsg
I mean sure he's entitled to his opinion but he's feeling a little bit too ambitious and projecting quite a number of his thoughts and feelings onto random innocent ppl,btohqsg
someone said smth about rich people not understanding the common man struggle then josh commented how he see a lot of well off people eating at hawker centre,btohqsg
bro is so full of shit the toilet's jealous,btohqsg
More like even the largest adult diaper couldn't fit it,btohqsg
CB which fucking hospital doesnt have a 24/7 hotline number,btohqsg
i try calling they say their hotline is closde,btohqsg

Wait josh is tryna be like me wtf,btohqsg
what is this o level thing he speaks of,btohqsg
Dont study so much thing is my ideal,btohqsg
but he forgot to caveat it,btohqsg
idk i tell people that if you wanna study like alot go for it but just make sure you dont abandon everything else in ur life,btohqsg
i could care less about what a group of children says about me,btohqsg
i hope they aba reject him,btohqsg
i regret not shitting on people enough before i left,btohqsg
it's shitting on someone's that not here talk,btohqsg
Does josh has a what complex,btohqsg
If there's actually a term for it,btohqsg
while i acknowledge that sgreans can be v kiasu and competitive  one also has to consider the underlying reasons leading to such attitudes,btohqsg
"ppl dont js wake up one day and decide that "" i have to get a high paying career "" one day",btohqsg
he doesnt think hes the best,btohqsg
its because cost of living keep going up,btohqsg
All we have is time ahead of us,btohqsg
cant wait to read more doomsday clock statements,btohqsg
my best advice for gp students,btohqsg
doomsday clock statements is a thing?,btohqsg
by the bulletin board of the atomic scientist,btohqsg
sounds more like inferiority complex tbh,btohqsg
"Rationale:1. Cambridge is a part of it  so it kinda sets the stage as to what Cambridge would normally test for A Levels2. You also suck cambridge dick cuz you basically tell cambridge that ""ah yes we are one in the same""3. It is one of the most active reflections of whatever is the most pressing issue that is happening in the world today",btohqsg
So from a cognitive function unpacking of GP it covers most of the bases for a decent essay,btohqsg
Oof idh CCA on that day HAHA   luckily now only every wed  if there's no other changes,btohqsg
Roughly ran thru one article  aye it's bussin,btohqsg
i make students who have optimistic views of the world read it,btohqsg

Like the past 2 years AQ topic ngl,btohqsg
Came out in the freaking bulletin board of atomic scientists,btohqsg
What abt.. what abt pessimistic LOL,btohqsg
why is bill nye speaking for the doomsday clock announcement this year,btohqsg
Cuz the report actually talks about progress in each sector and why it's still an issue (which from a skills perspective should also be how you balance your essay),btohqsg
Should I fear for what's to come ? Or?,btohqsg
Do I just have to wait in anticipation,btohqsg
Wah fuck I really typed the way I typed,btohqsg
If I can have half of the guts I have online  I could have rizz sm ppl up,btohqsg
I've never talked to anyone that way,btohqsg
we... dont need to know the dm,btohqsg
I'll prob have to be tipsy or drunk abit,btohqsg
I'll b in a goofy talkative mood once I'm intoxicated enough,btohqsg
If I were to down two soju bottles I'd still be sober ish,btohqsg
and truth be told I was,btohqsg
I drank at home n then went out walk walk cause I was high,btohqsg
I can walk straight just that I was swaying just slightly to both left&rifht,btohqsg
I can pinch myself to stay alert,btohqsg
At least he look like it while saying,btohqsg
connections mean you have backdoor access to opportunities,btohqsg
They couldn't handle the exclusive stuff in the DM anw,btohqsg

Bro u rant on IG ah,btohqsg
Must be 2000+ year kind of format,btohqsg
sometimes he forward to me somemore,btohqsg
Does the kid have extra time,btohqsg
What should I start researching on,btohqsg
I heard can brush up sgc if I were to tackle some real world issue or smth,btohqsg
Before they release the tasks or wtv we can choose from,btohqsg
Why follow kuro on ig when you can see him irl,btohqsg
I saw him at ej open house,btohqsg
Cuz you were typing on ur phone while sending me stuff at the same time,btohqsg
I don't wear specs all the time,btohqsg
Wait why u assume I wear specs did I tell you,btohqsg
I normally wear white colored contacts so I can scare people,btohqsg
your tongue slipped when u shared your story,btohqsg
By pretending I have no iris,btohqsg
Took off specs friend thought gonna kill him,btohqsg
Ik alot of people but alot of people don't know me,btohqsg
It's such a pri sch argument,btohqsg
The only other students ik who can come up with this are RGS students,btohqsg
Okay it's time to show him what real bullying is,btohqsg
"No if ur argument is""Your opinion is wrong because you are XXX""",btohqsg
Then that's not a legit argument,btohqsg
I would argue him getting people to gang up on others is more akin to bullying,btohqsg
Hes saying your argument is factually incorrect because you have 0EQ,btohqsg
Therefore you should not talk about EQ,btohqsg
Either it's his counter argument  or it's his really shitty way of reading someone,btohqsg
He will have fun in TP,btohqsg
Y'all nvr meet irl before right,btohqsg
And he got give a brief description of himself last time,btohqsg
maybe cause u looked too old to be there,btohqsg
There was more alumni than prospective students,btohqsg
Like idk if u could have told,btohqsg
"""Oh I'm coming at the end it shouldn't be that loud""",btohqsg
The funny thing is it's even louder,btohqsg
Like that day wasn't even that bad yet,btohqsg
when I was sec 4 I actly wanted to go ejc,btohqsg
They placed more beanbags in the sch,btohqsg
Could be either a good or bad thing,btohqsg
Okay so u have to understand,btohqsg
Doesn't matter peak hour or not ?,btohqsg
1/5 of ej population is from chs,btohqsg
Like people thr have no self control and keep breaking things it's q funny,btohqsg
this guy keeps on talking about being a pawn of the economy and etc and don’t wanna work for somebody,btohqsg
Which hosp U work at kuro 😈,btohqsg
it sorta gives me those vibes where people wanna start their own business and treating 9 to 5 jobs like it’s their worst nightmare,btohqsg
study ahead as in what? between sems?,btohqsg
haven’t been doing much lately tbh,btohqsg
not to say i didn't try btw,btohqsg
i spent the day just building legos the moment I came back home,btohqsg
just wanna take some time off studying,btohqsg
Ah icic  meanwhile enjoy your time,btohqsg
I’ve just finished the whole chem syllabus recently,btohqsg

💀 have u lost you shit officially,btohqsg
I wanna start an argument with Josh again,btohqsg
bc you end up insecure and projecting,btohqsg
HAHAH a lot of probability thingy stuff that i clearly forgot from 1107 but should be fine once i read up again,btohqsg
I thought inferiority complex usu do nth one,btohqsg
Become dilf and reveal like bedok dp,btohqsg
i cant type ucz my phone number cant be fucking verified,btohqsg
prof chong's notes when he taught are all publicly available alr,btohqsg
I unironically need to maintain my bodytype rn cuz of dancing its q stupid,btohqsg
It's time for that schstick to shine,btohqsg
cross check with your syllabus tho,btohqsg
idk what might have been removed,btohqsg
Oh I also look like a child,btohqsg
most people say i look like a kid,btohqsg
wait idk but everyone says I look like a kid,btohqsg
i also behvae like a kid so wtb,btohqsg
I unironically behave like a child,btohqsg
I just act drunk and high,btohqsg

I mean aren't Ur grades kinda dying,btohqsg
Do it once get it over with,btohqsg

I mean rlly internet has mentally impacted the Young ones badly,btohqsg
If got white hair strands can always dye your entire hair white to match,btohqsg
just search for the texts you screenshotted,btohqsg
what is the context of cannot score just say,btohqsg
bro got L1R5 11 Raw and decided that was good enough,btohqsg
but that means they have money to even budget,btohqsg
aka not paycheck to paycheck LOL,btohqsg
Sad thing is ik many people like him,btohqsg
But they're mostly 07 kids so wtv,btohqsg
Who is the HCI person why they suddenly interject ah,btohqsg
Wait the discord is a cesspool wtf there's people there even worse than Josh holyshiy,btohqsg
not good for your mental wellbeing,btohqsg
Sounds like the kinda guy who likes to flex that he is smarter than others,btohqsg
When he/she doesn't even know what they're saying,btohqsg
How come his maclaurin series got sigma notation one,btohqsg
Unless I'm just rly rly unqualified but I'm q confused,btohqsg
"Wtf is ""except a few more holidays"" an example of ""I got raised to live very cheaply"" and ""almost no lifestyle changes""",btohqsg
general formula of taylor/maclaurin series uses sigma but that's about it?,btohqsg
But he's using it in kinematics,btohqsg
Which is why I'm also confused,btohqsg
He said he learnt maclaurin for the purpose of understanding kinematics,btohqsg
Sounds damn unrelated and kinda whacky,btohqsg
sometimes you might do taylor expansion for approximations,btohqsg
He just vibes like someone who likes people to call him smart (cause I see this alot in chs),btohqsg
