My teacher wrote about my drifting and involvement in car stuff ah,btohqsg
My old sec sch force one.. if IT and Science  Sports club dun want take in  kena pushed to UG. At least 1 of the options for CCA selection has to be UG,btohqsg
But for me at the time worth it  mine prioritise attendance rather than focused on performance,btohqsg
So every npcc activity I go  I participate  I get free points,btohqsg
bodoh im alr studying art yet my cca art so lame sia,btohqsg
Helped to drop my L1R2B2 from 15 to 13 üòÅ,btohqsg
idw UG end up become drills head in NPCC üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Drills head is you discuss with your squad je,btohqsg
UG its like thw worst cca to take up,btohqsg
i get cca points i take ah,btohqsg
You don't open your mouth  they won't know you uncomfortable with that position.,btohqsg
who said anyth abt being uncomfortable üò≠,btohqsg
Last time I NCO  whole squad brief who do what  then disperse.,btohqsg
EH I SAW THE FIRST ONE BEFORE,btohqsg
later I go find the pic,btohqsg
why u take picture of my car,btohqsg
Rwb is wider by a mile sia,btohqsg
iw buy myvi also cnnt afford,btohqsg
Can't afford no shitbox in sg üòî,btohqsg
word on the street that there will be people coming in a certain type of vehicle without any driving license. pls don‚Äôt be dumb and do this  especially going to places with a lot of people and a lot of cars parked. it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.,btohqsg
and pls don‚Äôt jeapordize the car community if you get caught at the carmeet by tp/lta,btohqsg
singaporeans in general are very stupid,btohqsg
you tell them not to  all the more it spurs them on.,btohqsg
Smone gna crash n smthing gna explode,btohqsg
might as well let me drive with my eu license while they're at it,btohqsg
Yep. The ones so called Red Flag drivers.,btohqsg
Cus I feel the front grille and roof seems a littleoff.,btohqsg
I'd love to see some dumbasses going to jail,btohqsg
ik alot of them no license oso,btohqsg
idw later i see crash sia,btohqsg
How long you been in Singapore?,btohqsg
Or are you not a foreigner? I.e. pr/citizen alr,btohqsg
alot of ppl going for this?,btohqsg
no opps man ahahha just tryna look out for each other bro this thing if really happen especially during car meets will look really bad to the community if you get what i mean,btohqsg
4 months + foreigner yeah  pass holder,btohqsg
Just convert your eu license then,btohqsg
About 100 bucks for the btt course and test at CDC,btohqsg
Then you can't drive on the eu license,btohqsg
Until then you can use the eu license to drive too,btohqsg
Good to know but not really worth it la bc I leave sg in 2 months,btohqsg
Can drive without conversion for 1 year then haha,btohqsg
Should definitely be cheaper than actually renting a car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs point A to A Tho,btohqsg
I think bluesg a bit better,btohqsg
ü•∂ He said this is NOT a parking spot ‚ö†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Bluesg won't allow his license my guy,btohqsg
Well it really depends how long you use it cause you gotta drop it off where you pick it up,btohqsg
So if you're out for a while and the car's just parked,btohqsg
You've gotta pay for the car hourly anyway,btohqsg
So at times daily rental is cheaper,btohqsg
I've paid about 100 for a getgo for 5-6 hours,btohqsg
Cause mileage is added in as a charge,btohqsg
But at the same time 2 to 3 hours of regular use  I've gotten 20 to 30 as well,btohqsg
Rentals make you pay for fuel,btohqsg
guys tdy pasir ris park got car meet right,btohqsg
Maybe me but got only 3 hours of sleep üôÉ,btohqsg
Hi guys regarding thisWe will try to stop it from happening but if people do decide to come we shall have no contact with them as to prevent from us being a accompliceSo stay safe and see you all thereFrom the team of Hotshots_Sgüî•,btohqsg
As in towing it in or driving in?,btohqsg
Driving in those with no lics,btohqsg
I know someone might tow his car in cause his license is suspendedFor that we can allow as his not technically driving,btohqsg
Oh damm that's really calling for disaster,btohqsg
From a good time to a raid is smtg we do not want,btohqsg
So whoever who in this group who got no license and wanna still comeI dont recommend but if you really wanna come please bring someone who have a driving license so anything you can seek help from your friend,btohqsg

zx is not as nice except for 300zx,btohqsg
my favourite is z32 300zx. Nice v6 tt engineüëçüëç,btohqsg
If no money  stock is best,btohqsg
Bro  those don't look like stock taillights..,btohqsg
Very stock bro  typical f10 taillight,btohqsg
Is it? I hardly see non red tint taillights on Beemer,btohqsg
I *USUALLY* see like this one,btohqsg
Bmw never did clear tails stock,btohqsg
That's why I also stunned when they say it was stock,btohqsg
This one engine stock is best,btohqsg
Well I think it may be,btohqsg
And never do anything to engine,btohqsg
To compensate for loss of back pressure,btohqsg
If exhaust changed.. should have ECU tuning done along with it right?,btohqsg
It is recommended usually just to make sure you're running at the most optimal level,btohqsg
But if muffler only can see if you want or not,btohqsg
Cus need experienced tuner to do.,btohqsg
Just need to know who to go to,btohqsg
Got enough people out there anyhow one,btohqsg
Copy paste map that's not meant for SG conditions,btohqsg
Luckily motorcycle mostly pipe change also still okay,btohqsg
Dunnid touch ecu. Touch turbo üëç,btohqsg
No turbo bro  i drive NA only,btohqsg
I forget apply brake on traffic light,btohqsg
We can agree Arnav is gay üòÇ,btohqsg
Touch engine to NA not much gains,btohqsg
Okay sorry i change my words,btohqsg
Go for the throttle response  not just power,btohqsg
Good to hear someone got good n52,btohqsg
Errr if you gonna say throttle controller,btohqsg
Most people buy nvr maintain then just sell,btohqsg
Throttle controller the worst thing to do to your car,btohqsg
You want more power just manual shift and stay in powerband or step harder,btohqsg
I never said it ah. You said it.,btohqsg
For SG mix driving condition decent,btohqsg
You go up smooth drive 150 also,btohqsg
I last time 6.5-7 best case,btohqsg
My day to day I get 6.5-7 always,btohqsg
Slowly build up the cars i drive,btohqsg
Some more need put 98 min.,btohqsg
Idk man. Merc v weird. Go by L/100km,btohqsg
And you don't anyhow pop and bang the 523,btohqsg
Dont want drive 535 suddenly go crash,btohqsg
My exos only abit pop and bangs here n thr,btohqsg
Then change to cla or 523/535,btohqsg
That one normal with changing muffler you can get,btohqsg
Got bttr one. Drive 316 claim is 328,btohqsg
But you never tune to dump all,btohqsg
If its girl he will say m3,btohqsg
But rear no widebody cause need cut,btohqsg
If guy he will say 328,btohqsg
Car good  units on the market no good,btohqsg
All abused and not maintained well,btohqsg
So many cars dying like that,btohqsg
Or else got some cars can be very good platforms,btohqsg
No need go so high also,btohqsg
You can do a modest build,btohqsg
Power to weight ratio more important,btohqsg
Especially claimed hp numbers by rabak places,btohqsg
But you want can overtake very well,btohqsg
Cannot feel that i going 150,btohqsg
"What I saying is ... ""the more you fuck around  the more you find out.""In this case  maybe even... ""The more you fuck around  the more you can fuck it up.""",btohqsg
Germans really seal their cars nice,btohqsg
Again depends how you do la,btohqsg
Catless downpipes with exos and tune nice nice,btohqsg
Bro then y my car i hit wtv speed i oso realize,btohqsg
There is a reason got price difference in different models they sell one,btohqsg
Same engine stock from bmw make 150hp,btohqsg
Same one stock from bmw make 300,btohqsg
I'll just stick with my VTEC on 2 wheels for now.. tmr work zzzz,btohqsg
But you see the changes they make between the 2 will be a lot,btohqsg
Super 4. Cannot use the term S4 here later somebody will ask if it is Audi S4.. ü§åüèΩ,btohqsg
gentlemen  a short view back to the past. 30 years ago  Nikki Lauda told us‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Audi s4 got 2 wheels and vtec?,btohqsg
Merc build quality recently just go to china cheap knockoff kind,btohqsg
Need jom msia tonight for fuel run,btohqsg
Audi S4 where got vtec and 2 wheels,btohqsg
Isit actually cheaper to go into to pump then come back,btohqsg
Nowadays where got people use common sense one. Now already so many accidents bloody road sense already bloody lost.,btohqsg
I calculated assuming you live central area and go tuas to pump,btohqsg
It depends on where you stay  how much fuel you use on the roundtrip and what you pump,btohqsg
If got traffic it can be the game changer,btohqsg
Go 2am‚Ä¶ no traffic and fuel check,btohqsg
Plus depends on if the time taken worth or not,btohqsg
Cause I too far from crossing,btohqsg
80L last time for full tank,btohqsg
But obviously I will take some petrol also,btohqsg
I calc always save arnd $50 per trip,btohqsg
Add in all tolls and etc,btohqsg
Partially I go msia to enjoy the drive also,btohqsg
I jus pump diesel to save cost,btohqsg
Their petrol station got hot nasi lemak also,btohqsg
Same bro I go woodlands buy illegal petrol,btohqsg
Next moment cannot even run from them,btohqsg
Aiya you got smoke screen ability also,btohqsg
Idk. My cla like can handle leh,btohqsg
You got try vegetable oil or not,btohqsg
Sometimes u let go throttle got pop sound,btohqsg
He make last time on top gear,btohqsg
I legit everything stock. Hit the diesel,btohqsg
Can make me pop and bang,btohqsg
Actually not much cheaper these days also sia,btohqsg
We take wat we can get,btohqsg
Cause demand low so the import also not high,btohqsg
Wah wtf my petrol in msia rise,btohqsg
A whopping 2 cents sgd increase,btohqsg
Lazy go hide pump 95 ü´¢,btohqsg
Ok then wherever you buy food,btohqsg
Wasted at the end of the day for them anyway,btohqsg
Its 60 cents per litre üíÄ,btohqsg
Go msia alr might as well whack 97 or up alr,btohqsg
Got no space for fuel to expand bro,btohqsg
Vpower shiok to drive very smooth,btohqsg
I pump vpower for my lancer before,btohqsg
But saving so much compared to SG alr,btohqsg
Can feel a bit more power,btohqsg
But petron 100 the fc better,btohqsg
And this is same driving conditions,btohqsg
If I pump vpower price might as well pump sg liao,btohqsg
So must pump racing or 100,btohqsg
Test how long it takes for my engine to explode,btohqsg
I send you the b road I go,btohqsg
Then you call tomorrow when you stuck in jungle,btohqsg
Shag sia think need borrow rm from my father,btohqsg
Ask me go b road at this timing,btohqsg
I round in my dreams. Tmr got work,btohqsg
