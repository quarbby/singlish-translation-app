If u jam brake  car ABS kick in  means ur tyres either not grippy or brakes alr too powerful. Need BBK for what.If you jam brake  car doesn't want to stop  that one then need BBK.,btohqsg
But i like cos it's between w30 and w40,btohqsg
Shud save engine without compromise for performance,btohqsg
My understanding is turbo cars shouldnt run too thin right,btohqsg
We NA cars can run w30 also,btohqsg
I tried from 40 to 30  more power... 40 dam draggy,btohqsg
i added XADO metal conditioner in my recent service.,btohqsg
should help w lubrication & friction reduction,btohqsg
Well  what you dont want is when you need the brakes that time end up the brakes overkill and lock up,btohqsg
From got brakes become no brakes,btohqsg
how much to put SSBH? i tink that 1 is vfm move haha.,btohqsg
all the best man. stupid rule,btohqsg
light car move ez  stop also ez haha no use for bbk unless show,btohqsg
I paint red for show 😂,btohqsg
220 for the lines100 for installation60 for brake fluid.Bleeding and everything else alr included,btohqsg
But it varies from car to car,btohqsg
Cos diff car got different length,btohqsg
I rmb my old swift sport had like 6 lines. 2 in front  4 in the rear. So garage R also shocked.,btohqsg
4 lines for the rear? lol so weird,btohqsg
they told me 2 is the foot brake. Then the handbrake 2 more. Or something like that,btohqsg
sounds similar to my 33. it's because the rear brake line had a solid piping in the middle. so flexible > solid > flexible.,btohqsg
when i changed to ssbh  i just changed to a single unbroken line,btohqsg
maybe this is the reason why,btohqsg
in the end 4 lines total only,btohqsg
Garage R told me they needed to make 6 lines.,btohqsg
But eitherway they go by the overall length also,btohqsg
the other owners changed at gr got charged 6 lines. while i paid for 4 lol,btohqsg
I guess it's a suzuki thing,btohqsg
length not much of a factor. it's the more connections they have to make.,btohqsg
4 lines have 8 ends. 6 lines have 12 ends. extra 50%,btohqsg
hahaha next time if kena liddat just request do full length,btohqsg
Walao mine also about this price 🙄 u dw rent from me,btohqsg

Mid size sedans not better meh,btohqsg
My grandma cannot climb up SUVs,btohqsg

Nope  it’s easier to go into the seat… and the size is good for bigger sized people,btohqsg
I find i go up SUVs also need to climb. Then need to jump down when i get off,btohqsg
And hor people sat can return car,btohqsg
And there’s the side str thing that’s why easier for them to climb in. Cus old people bend down to go into sedan problem 😅,btohqsg

I only can tahan one year,btohqsg
Singapore not very conductive place to keep nice classic jdms,btohqsg
LTA..and the lack of quality products and ppl who know exactly how to maintain and repair,btohqsg
The annual inspection is not something to be taken lightly for old cars😂,btohqsg
Also now with borders open  certain things better to repair by our neighbor,btohqsg
Carburetors is quite easy but hard to find workshop that can fix lol,btohqsg
I would probably still have J's exhaust if the borders opened 6 months ago,btohqsg
