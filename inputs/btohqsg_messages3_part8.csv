Seems older hdb yes  newer gen no more. I tried search around online but no firm answer too. Some people asked HDB staff they said same height but after moved in found really 20-30cm higher than other level,btohqsg
So what's considered as old hdb and the recent people who moved in found 20-30cm higher?,btohqsg
No idea. The last i saw on this topic was written in 2017. Anyone who moved in recent may b can help clarify this.,btohqsg
only for those staying on top,btohqsg
So the top floor for all the BTOs have been newly built recently has their top floor 20-30cm higher?,btohqsg
As in for those BTOs built in recent years from 2016 till today?,btohqsg
don't think too much of what I said  I was merely referring to only those who stay on top know how high is the ceiling,btohqsg
I actually wan to know too this the main reason i opt for top floor. But after i chose my unit only realize new build bto now seems no more has this ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù. Hope someone can help clarify.,btohqsg
New bto all standard height already no more higher ceiling for top floor only old flats den have,btohqsg
Tat is oldrule.nowall have to finished mop of 5 yrs b4 u can apply bto.u can try submit bto application it will be denied n ur 10 dollars will be eaten up,btohqsg
just $10 nia  poh poh your luck,btohqsg
Top level and level below seems different,btohqsg
this page giving really value of your house?,btohqsg
can try with your yet to TOP address,btohqsg
the way I see it  looks like the top floor has higher ceiling,btohqsg
üëçüèªüëçüèª but it seems like some residents have said it which makes sense too  whereby it contains additional beams to support the water tanks,btohqsg
The should be actual height. The TOP require water proof and heavy loan space,btohqsg
May i know where you found this info?,btohqsg
Under the new rule now if your flat haven't reach the mop n u apply bto even if u send in ur application ur application will be block.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/selling-a-flat/eligibility,btohqsg
Oh sorry i was refer to wrong topic,btohqsg
I actually wan refer to this,btohqsg
Does all current BTO given completion delay notice by HDB? I had received my bto delay by 9 mths.,btohqsg
How come my bto (Tampines greendew) in status can drop from 80 plus % to 71% in BTOHQ after they indicated may delay by 9mths.By i look at the actual progress there is not too much of delay.üòÄ,btohqsg
take it that  as long as dont get key is 0% lor  once take key is 100% complete lor,btohqsg
Hi Thomas! You recieved an email regards to the 9mths delay by HDB?,btohqsg
I mean you got receive any email? Haha,btohqsg
https://www.btohq.com/development-progress/bto/tampines-greendewThere's updated development images here üëç,btohqsg
Yes i received the 9 mths delay notice by HDB. Does all bto received the notice? Or standard practice to give to all bto applicants?,btohqsg
Some received 6 mths  some received 3 mths  but different projects,btohqsg
oops just realised I'm no longer admin lol,btohqsg
The upcoming august hougang bto really attractive üòÇ kept thinking about it all day,btohqsg
hi. i'm a newbie here. wonder at what percentage can we start collecting keys?,btohqsg
Did you receive any email from hdb regarding any delay?,btohqsg
Mine‚Äôs at 100% now also still haven‚Äôt receive letter leh ü•∫,btohqsg
wow 8 BTO projects are 100% completed,btohqsg
the weird thing is  my colleague moved in to AMK Court in the starting of the year,btohqsg
when the project is shown at 100% recently,btohqsg
if it takes 2 weeks to complete 1%  means he already shifted in upon like 96% of progression of his BTO,btohqsg
which means maybe some of the residents of your project have already shifted in,btohqsg
but we went down to see  it doesn't look like 100% complete though~ hahaha,btohqsg
yeah so weird.. but thanks for sharing.. hope we'll receive our letters very soon! ü•∫,btohqsg
same for Matilda Sundeck. it is still construction in progress  but its saying 100% on the website,btohqsg
but the cranes are all removed and water tank all installed. so i guess it's left with finishing touches,btohqsg
hope to receive letter in March :/,btohqsg
which year BTO launch was it from?,btohqsg
mine may 2017 and at 93% according to BTOHQ,btohqsg
but the location is really ulu  fine if you drive otherwise have to walk so far for transit,btohqsg
Can see if TOP has been issued,btohqsg
Ya some blocks are already done,btohqsg
Then key collection is batch by batch,btohqsg
