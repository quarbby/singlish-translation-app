Hi guys abit off topic anyone have any idea about the HDB Hfe loan as I'm self-employed for three years but haven't contributed to CPF. I'm planning to get my house this year.Will this lack of CPF contributions affect my loan eligibility? I file income tax and contribute to Medisave regularly. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!EDIT: My bto will likely TOP this coming q4,btohqsg
From my experience it should not affect. You just need to take a lot of care in prepping bank statements / rental statements / income statements of all sorts  to show continuity  most importantly it is to show that you‚Äôre working constantly without gaps and generating income monthly.Rental or housing statements help too to show that you‚Äôre paying things regularly,btohqsg
Hi  during key collection the loan amount eill be revised and be told on the spot is it,btohqsg
Depends if you are on HLE or HFE.,btohqsg
I am on HLE for the greencrest project at tampines,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ then yes 1-2 months before key collection HDB will contact you. Though I have friends who did not get any loan reassessment for their HLE. So just note that in mind‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Oh . Would that be an issue? ü•π,btohqsg
If your current loan amount is sufficient then it‚Äôs not an issue.Unit price - EHG - downpayment - CPFOA - Loan.If loan amount is insufficient then you might need to top up the shortfall with cash.,btohqsg
U need to contribute to cpf 1yr at least,btohqsg
Will it affect my HDB loan? My project will top this coming q4 I guess,btohqsg
Not contributing to the cpf OA won‚Äôt affect ur HFE loan at allAs long as u got ur monthly income statements from company / commissions  month by month clearly send to them(It‚Äôs ur annual income divide by 12  ur average monthly income that matters)& ur bank statements & ur credit card rating rankingThen it should be fine. Will be approve for u ‚úÖI am a self employed too & mine is approved successfully tgt w my spouse üëç,btohqsg
NOA solid 2 yearscredit rating solid approved,btohqsg
I don't think CPF contribution is mentioned in the eligibility for loans and EHG per seEvidence of income is required but can be other suitable documentsFor employees  we tend to perceive CPF statement as seemingly straightforward enough,btohqsg
Guys married couple first timer bto applicants no children. Reserved 25% of supply right?,btohqsg

If you are talking about renting 2 individual rooms in a 3 room or bigger flats this part not sureOnly know the flat was be over MOP,btohqsg
Whens the opening for june bto?,btohqsg
So far  normally it‚Äôs the very last minute of the said month. Most likely 23-end of June I guess,btohqsg
Concurrently they also release the next bto launches. Very smart. Make people have more choices to delay their house -decision-making,btohqsg
Hi. My queue number is out of supply and if I already have a flat appointment date and I do not wish to select a unit  do I need to inform HDB that I'm not coming or can I just ignore the appointment?,btohqsg
Will that affect subsequent applications though?Like  lose priority or must wait a year before they can apply for BTO again etc,btohqsg
