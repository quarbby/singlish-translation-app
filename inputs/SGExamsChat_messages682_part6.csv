Still pretty nice of her though,btohqsg
Coz i think she wanted A so badly,btohqsg
Hmm idk whatâ€™s a sheltered workshop,btohqsg
Can he go to local uni with that education,btohqsg
Basically getting them to do some work but in a safe environment (like not mingle w the public),btohqsg
I used chat gpt to help w script writing tbh,btohqsg
My bro is ard moderate i think,btohqsg
There are those who only communicate by screaming  like totally non-verbal,btohqsg
Wah wah tbh chatgpt now helped a lot,btohqsg
Like mild is stage 1  moderate is 2 and severe is 3 iinw,btohqsg
I used chatgpt help me wrote cover letter lol,btohqsg
just make sure not directly used for wr can alrd,btohqsg
Oh yea apparently i read about this guy in suss got flagged out for high AI usage,btohqsg
If only gpt came out earlier,btohqsg
I got B for pw too even though my group was not slacking. I suspect itâ€™s because of the topic chosen,btohqsg
My pw teacher was also not bad too,btohqsg
Idk if my PW cher is bad tbh,btohqsg
He's not that bad imo but my group mates all say he bad,btohqsg
I think using gpt is fine  just dun copy paste  that one is like sending u to trouble lmao  imagine putting gpt on the reference listðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Actually my parents claim that my topic chosen was off-theme and slapped the tutor for not telling us so,btohqsg
So all the hoo ha rightSo the complain actually included1) not telling us our topic is off-theme2) not coming for tutorials3) that MIA girl,btohqsg
Idk is drink driving not a crisis,btohqsg
So my parents complain to hod that my tutor didnt tell us the topic we chose wasnt on-themeðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
In the end was anything done,btohqsg
My parents met w the hod (it was ms aslindah before ms tang) during ptc lol (it was so awkward coz i was there too watching things) and the person behind me alr here so she could aso see what is happening,btohqsg
Then I suppose the new rp system is overall easier than during the OA times  Iâ€™d rather be forced to take one extra subject at minimally a H1 level than be forced to include MTL in my rp,btohqsg
Was that person the mia girl,btohqsg
As long as your pw tutor wasnâ€™t there I thought itâ€™s ok,btohqsg
No ah but she was someone i wasnt close to  in fact i think for the 2y i did not talk to her,btohqsg
He is actually but i think not during when the hod was there,btohqsg
Actually after j1 ptc episode  i actually didnt inform my parents about the ptc in j2,btohqsg
Coz in tm  the ptc is only compulsory if u do v badly,btohqsg
But ofc he knows shit happened already  then still gotta tahan for another yr coz he my CT and GP tutor,btohqsg
Oh wait i suddenly remembered  he was there not because he was my CT  it was coz of thisðŸ’€ðŸ’€ but i cant rmb if hod part he was listening in,btohqsg
Was he like biased against you,btohqsg
Because you reported him before being shit,btohqsg
Basically firstly my dad kinda told me off by asking my tutor to get me to take gp seriously  like basically tell me off that im not caring about gp  ask him gimme more assignment.Then there is also the pw hoo ha  my parents complain to hod (and got transmitted to the principal too)  then i had to seat in when they talk to the hod  and it was super super awkward,btohqsg
I think for pw a bit weird ass relationship  but he was my ct in j2 (my prev ct went on maternity leave) and actually i dun really listen in his class. Tbh he is damn bochap so the biasness is not significant.,btohqsg
Tbh my CTs dun really like my class:-(,btohqsg
If you had gotten a better pw/gp Cher you might have gotten like one grade higher for both subs,btohqsg
Some things canâ€™t rly control I guess,btohqsg
Ngl wats the pt of ptc,btohqsg
i bring i bring all the drama ma ma ma ma i bring drama ma ma ma,btohqsg
i lazy explain so i shall pass this honour to@polarbearnextdoorinstead,btohqsg
uk the yijc person here who didn't know how to do the qns. the long division one.,btohqsg
itâ€™s smth that can be trained at the end of the day bc the questions they can ask typically fall into similar categories,btohqsg
damn  you sure you wanted to say it in front of 2k people,btohqsg
For chem do we need to memorise qa for a levels like we did in o levels? Iâ€™m a J1 so please donâ€™t toxic lol. Because if itâ€™s true Iâ€™ll just start slowly memorising 1 everyday,btohqsg
