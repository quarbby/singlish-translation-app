tbh only elementree would really have a go at him,btohqsg
everyone else is so fed up with shit already,btohqsg
may be reading this chat as of right now,btohqsg
eh hv u studied econs yet,btohqsg
ngl econs is the most sien one,btohqsg
Is q worth ngl if u cannot go uni/poly holder,btohqsg
Cuz u can go part time uni (largely paid for by SAF also) + build relevant work experience,btohqsg
Most of the younger dxos in my camp doing that LOL,btohqsg
Then after they get part time uni they fk off,btohqsg
Maybe that guy has nth else,btohqsg
Maybe I should sign on dxo,btohqsg
I vote for him to stfu,btohqsg
discord vote bio easier because we have DHS siaolang etamatcha who mugs campbell bio 14 hours a day as a y4,btohqsg
and also flexer hitman who brags about his alevel knowledge of bio and causing a wreckage of misinformation in olevel bio chat,btohqsg
Who even studies more than 6h a day as a JC student wtf,btohqsg
BRO BEEFING W U / J,btohqsg
what do you study for 14h a day,btohqsg
idt i even had enough content to study 14 hours a day,btohqsg
lol that DHS person 14 hours a day,btohqsg
this dhs person 1.4 hours a day happy alr,btohqsg
i swear i got see some IP notes have linear algebra???,btohqsg
4m qn state the characteristics of transition metals,btohqsg
I mean they were trained since y1 so,btohqsg
They wld th in k itâ€™s nromal,btohqsg
like if we have a level content mixed in it means we alr learned it,btohqsg
Maybe like hci but like most ip schs set q easy papers,btohqsg
not like they suddenly throw at us,btohqsg
form coloured compoundssoft and malleable??low melting/boiling point,btohqsg
In any other sch that's a like,btohqsg
Then they had 4m of shadings graphs to represent equalizing,btohqsg
idr my papers ask what alr,btohqsg
They only do inequalities in year 4,btohqsg
"i saw transformations in dhs and i was like ""??""",btohqsg
And even if they intro a level topics its normally simplified or the simpler topics,btohqsg
they have some weird letter bonding thing in chemistry that looks like shoelace method,btohqsg
More content does not mean harder paper,btohqsg
i mean itâ€™s all relative to what content we learned,btohqsg
They can give more content but test the fundamentals of each thing then it becomes easier...,btohqsg
like the point of IP is to be a direct train to a levels so it makes sense to spread out the a level content more,btohqsg
like i do rmb transformations in my content but it was quite basic,btohqsg
I appealed for trip sci  but i didn't make it so I decided to give parent letter lol  but I wrote it myself ah and it worked,btohqsg
