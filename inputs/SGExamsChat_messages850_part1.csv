pretty sure is a prep course towards gce n/o levels,btohqsg
general education is not nitec/higher nitecüíÄ,btohqsg
general education can be referred to many things without extra context ma,btohqsg
u add in the word GEP then it makes sense,btohqsg
Sorry for my ambiguous message  just want to find out options if ppl want to take o levels as retake,btohqsg
And I saw ITE GE program somewhere,btohqsg
"if they've ""graduated"" out of their sec sch studies already  ite GEP doesn't apply for such students who wish to retake Os even if it's just a few certain subjects they didn't do well in",btohqsg
but u can check the link calista sent earlier,btohqsg
Is designed for students who failed to graduate school for any reason ?,btohqsg
Like drop out of school that kind ?,btohqsg
but usually its catered to those who are working already & have their own stable source of income,btohqsg
ITE has a thing where if u pass only 1 or 0 subjects in N(A) & N(T) exams after sec 4-- u can try to enrol in a foundation study program,btohqsg
oh ya  ite will also be phasing out DPP (direct poly program) by 2028,btohqsg
Can I ask when is the time period to register as an O level private candidate?,btohqsg
a lot of structural changes as well to the current system thr,btohqsg
Think can find on seab ?,btohqsg
They update the dates alr? I cannot find?,btohqsg
Guys I was playing FC Mobile and found these goofy AHH names,btohqsg
Reason why I asked about private o levels and ite gep,btohqsg
He is close to being adult [18] so ...,btohqsg
Whether he is working idk uh so I think my evaluation is ite gep may not be okay for him.,btohqsg
guys I am looking for friends to play badminton with regularly,btohqsg

54.6% of polytechnic grads were in full-time jobs in 2024  with a median gross monthly salary of $2 900.Here are the courses with the best pay:https://str.sg/sXgV#stheadstart,btohqsg
Trying to DIY my own BBT  what sort of milk do the shops use?,btohqsg
i know LiHo uses Australian Farmhouse LHT milk,btohqsg
idk if it was koi or some other brand that uses meiji,btohqsg
oat milk is also an alternative if u don't want to start from scratch,btohqsg
there are worse ones for sure,btohqsg
Do they add extra creamer/butter milk/ÂÜ∞‰ºØÂÖã or is that a thing they only do in China?,btohqsg
uh  usually depends on individual preference,btohqsg
in sg  there's only low fat  normal milk or flavoured milk,btohqsg
some milks have different taste as well because there's the cow vs goat milk version,btohqsg
So we can't get the fancy cream milks they add to the milk in China?,btohqsg
u need to find those specific types,btohqsg
I'm thinking the best we can do in SG would be something like Coffeemate creamer,btohqsg
usually ppl end up mixing their own fancy milk,btohqsg
coz the ones sold in stores dont rly taste right,btohqsg
right as in what they might prefer,btohqsg

ya so i don't even know,btohqsg
Last time when Michael Jackson passed away  same happened to Google servers  too many query on his death and they thought it was DDoS attack.,btohqsg
That one on google at that point in time still small matter but government one is a bigger issue  if server not fixed for too long  ppl can miss application deadline for courses which is an even bigger problem here.,btohqsg
