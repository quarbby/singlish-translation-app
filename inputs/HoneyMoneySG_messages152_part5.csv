My first impression is that the portfolios are like other robo-advisers. My glance into the portfolios tell me that the fund level fees are relatively high  and the fund manager Aberdeen appeared in those portfolios. I will give trustinvest a pass.,btohqsg
A closer look into trustinvest tells me that it is just investing into Aberdeen unit trust 😐,btohqsg
Citi website got issue? I can’t submit my application for prestige card,btohqsg
Hi experts  I used shopback pay to pay at restaurants using maybank fnf. Does this mean it is online category or dining category?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I want to use DBS yuu in foodpanda. Do you know if selecting the yuu card through Apple Pay in foodpanda will earn me the bonus points or must add the yuu card in foodpanda to get the points?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can i use citi rewards card to pay for atome 3 month installments and get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Then there are 2 lvl of charges? Trust and Aberdeen,btohqsg
Yes 2 levels of charge from what I see.E.g. Wealth+ Growth portfolio = abrdn Wealth Plus Growth FundFund level fee - 1.7%Platform fee - FreeSales charge - FreeBUT looking at the key fact sheet  it states 1.45% Management fee. You can do the math.I am giving this new product offering TrustInvest a big pass despite their promo of min $5000 investment and receiving $10 cash credit by end Feb.,btohqsg
I'd suggest using with amaze still. There was random dp direct citi rewards not getting 10x pts from atome.,btohqsg
Seems so. People have been saying it's not working,btohqsg
Does anyone with DBS wwmc can advise whether this deduction will give me DBS points? Thanks,btohqsg
There was dp fitness first recurring deduction is online.Is it posted? You can verify once it does,btohqsg
Yes it's been posted  if the fee is $150  then I shd be getting $150/5 * 1 = 30 points on transaction date and 270 points by end of following month right?,btohqsg
Hi can i ask if this promo is only for new to OCBC credit card member or new to that particular credit card member?,btohqsg
I'd like to highlight capital not guaranteed,btohqsg
Please have some basic courtesy to state that the capital of and the profits from such investments are not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Is uob on fraud rampage again  just got 2 fraudulent cc transactions to my ladys card,btohqsg

Yup. If guaranteed wont be 6%,btohqsg
I already have the courtesy to send the link. I dun have to one by one go thru the tnc right? We are all adults. Not elementary sch kids. Can at least read right?,btohqsg
Factoring in the 6% interest pa. Paid mnthly. Depends on individual see if is suitable.,btohqsg
Thanks guys.Another option to explore  we do our own due diligent,btohqsg
Unfortunately that's what we all hope for  but that's not what happens.,btohqsg
If there really are kids. Their parents ought to be responsible lor. We cant hold their hands hahah,btohqsg
"And unfortunately a lot of such cases are adults. You'll eventually see people who say  ""if I can read the t&c  I won't be asking"" or ""why my account with x amount is going negative when abc company says only guaranteed up to y amount"".At least remove yourself from the source of blame.",btohqsg
U sounds like u have ur fair share of experience.Yup very true 👍,btohqsg
We cannot help people who not willing to be helped  but we should at least avoid from being caught in a nasty blame game. 🤪,btohqsg
