Fresh polytechnic graduates commanded higher salaries and had better job prospects in 2023  according to a poll conducted by Singapore‚Äôs 5 polytechnics.Here are the courses that have commanded the best pay:https://str.sg/Koq6,btohqsg
fated to OT and low pay in sg,btohqsg

Health sci is basically like physiotherapist and stuff like that,btohqsg
yk those lab professionals in hospital,btohqsg
If nursing included the pay on be higher LOL,btohqsg
If they include ot pay ah,btohqsg
coding for finance >>> coding for tech,btohqsg
Dieticians  physiotherapist  technically psychologist but its mostly social sci,btohqsg
Nursing depends on who u ask maybe,btohqsg
Apparently asrjc promos quite hard my tutor mention,btohqsg
Hm i think sg considers nursing as health science,btohqsg
Cause i js googled and nursing in poly is under sch of health science or smt similar ._.,btohqsg
What is this atrocious behaviour?@chemcerüòîAt this rate  I'm gonna end up with a broken heart syndrome,btohqsg
Met one guy from ite during my poly days. He said that ite students during intern are in charge of cleaning the toilet for aircraft,btohqsg
Tbh the dude went to a small company that is in charge to maintaining the aircraft of SIA or smth,btohqsg

atarax and bedok are tgt woohoo,btohqsg
Think last year not too bad,btohqsg

so far for math  majority of asrjc students I have scored A or B.,btohqsg
Eh where u buy ur mc,btohqsg
oh thats gud  looking to do fmath,btohqsg

IB and alvls are very different,btohqsg
IB has an emphasis on coursework there is an extended essay IB students will have to complete (basically like a research paper)  and subjects have IA which are also like research projs,btohqsg
For Alvls  it is more of the 1 big exam at the end of 2 years that determines everyth,btohqsg
We can be a total of 190 tgth if that's what you'd like üò≥üòè,btohqsg
Wait then how u get intern in pri sch,btohqsg

As in wont affect ur sch meh,btohqsg
Is more of js following kids around,btohqsg
i was js wondering to pick between ib n like alvls,btohqsg
if you like projs then maybe ib is better but if you are the type to mug for 1 big exam then alvls,btohqsg
read story book to kid and help them with their story book activities,btohqsg
j1 doesn't really start start until the jae side gets settled in,btohqsg
huh my current primary sch i chose from a list my sch gave us,btohqsg
ib mostly international studentsvery project baseda lvl  the other way round,btohqsg
ur mugging for 2years stright anyways watt right,btohqsg
But kidsread is outside of sch,btohqsg
You can  look up on it if u int,btohqsg

A lvl  u can ask in the grp chat for free,btohqsg
Isnt it sch for jc now already,btohqsg
but the pple thr ego damn inflated,btohqsg
idw to deal w it yk,btohqsg
Physics: The department in general ranges from pretty good to absolute dogshit. The notes are not bad tho but the papers are very killer :( Be prepared to fail every single paper until promos. For Mid years the pass was 40% and the distinction rate was 3%. For Promos the pass was 60% and the distinction rate was 8%. Some of the topics tested were also not in syllabus so yeah.Chemistry: Literally the most stacked science like actually damn good. The papers are very similar to a level standards but it is much more difficult for organic chem as compared to physical chem. Teachers are very willing to contribute and overqualified imo. (Literally go look at EJ website :D)Biology: Generally pretty good. Notes are very comprehensive but exam papers are damn anal and kinda weird. (10m qn on how microscopes contribute to studying of biology).Econs: Dont take it. If u want to take econs dont come EJ. But in general the econs department ranges from good (a select few) to like disappearing because they dont turn up for lessons. Notes are horrible. Lectures are disappointing and do not fully cover the notes + does not fully cover the syllabus. Pray for a good teacher and you should do well for econs. Practice!History: You will never be bored in history. They are super fking entertaining. It is one of the few subjects that have alot of live lectures. Their comments are damn good for practices (Legit gives feedback for both bad and good). Alot of discipline is needed to do readings by yourself tho as there isnt really content lectures/tutorials. Generally everything is done by the students. Sample essays are also posted onto google classroom  done by your batchmates.Geography: Geog notes are damn entertaining. Also live lectures damn fun. For our batch however we literally only have 2 teachers but the 2 teachers are damn stacked. Plus the like amount of practices they give is damn alot and the teachers for extra practises they do stuff like marking extra work a few hours before the exam and still going through for us. Like honestly they are damn good and they have a collected book of every model essay from 2017 to now.Lit: i dont take lit. but i heard that the lit chers for your batch is damn good!GP: lectures make me want to kill myself. Ranges from good teachers to dogshit. Hard to get an A. They dont give enough practises so u legit need go do urself. Content not provided UNTIL ur in J2. A shit ton of packages tho (Although the naming damn confusing). Packages include model essays  abit of content (Student compiled). Singapore context stuff. Alot of extra practice qns but not used in class or gone through.PW: We dont know because yall get new teachers since almost every pw cher in ej is leaving the school :(  although some of the good teachers are staying behind.Culture: Cancel. Tiktok. Basketball. Ulti. House.Council: basically useless they do nothing they suck their own dicks. Alot of their initiatives proposed by council is for themselves only  if they even get anything done. They havent came up with anything unique YET (Please come up with something.) Getting in is legit a popularity contest  regardless of JAE or JIP  as long as u can make friends in a quick span of time can get in.Segregation: Most overexaggerated bs imo. Highly dependent on what class u are in which is literally out of ur control. They do not band by JIP JAE for classes  CCAs everyone has the same shot of getting in. It only is like this at the first few days of orientation  beacuse no one knows one another  even the JIP students. Generally JIP students do interact with JAE if they are willing to. Alot of JAE students go around saying they cannot make friends/cannot relate because they are JAE. Imo is not really the case especially for my class. Unless u refuse to even initiate a conversation there should not be any segregation at all.For the last 2 points  it is generally very dependent on ur batch. Because each batch differs.Campus: Damn nice.,btohqsg
j2 yes but j1 how to start lessons without jae people,btohqsg
Eae is u want to go that course  applied and interviews to get in,btohqsg
im glad this is 1 of your consideration,btohqsg
If u get in den do bare minimum for o lvls can le,btohqsg
26 and below can get in,btohqsg
like me lorI have super inflated ego now,btohqsg
the earlier you learn to deal with big ego people the better,btohqsg
Last yr was later seh  I started on 28 feb,btohqsg
So they jus learn the stuff again when jae peeps come?,btohqsg
isit i tot eunonia pple was q nice i js dint like the courses,btohqsg
no we dont learn anything now,btohqsg
my ego as huge as my DAD BOD,btohqsg
no la that's why j1 only start in feb,btohqsg
I already humble liao and still considered as big ego,btohqsg
were you like that back then,btohqsg
there's a diff between big ego and being confident,btohqsg
my ns days  got 1 guy from jp  85RP  kudos to him ah but he always flexed on others people LMAO,btohqsg
If stranded on a island how,btohqsg
1) if his rp higher  he flexes rp2) if his rp lower  he flexes his portfolio which is just him ''starting'' a company but when i asked the jp people  turned out it was just a concept so no such company exist,btohqsg
If both 1&2 fails  he flexes his existence,btohqsg
when people flex rpthen I flex olympiadwhen people flex olympiadI flex sg representative and sch trainer,btohqsg
then u fuck up in y2s2 and then die in shame,btohqsg
When I flex bachelor degree  Si Yan flex PhD,btohqsg
i wanna have a good publication so i can tell people,btohqsg
mf i'm discovering the shit you're studying,btohqsg
when people flex about their grades  then i flex about having a gf ü§°,btohqsg

When is it my turn to see,btohqsg
during NS max out at 12,btohqsg
After NS I trained till 14 or 15then lazy after that,btohqsg
now I can do 13 times of ‚Öì chin ups  = 1,btohqsg
one of my friends trained pullups since sec sch just bc he wanna do muscle up,btohqsg
I should start retraining some basic push ups again,btohqsg
useless portfolioGood for flexing onlynothing beats $$ in bank account,btohqsg
truely  not alot off ppl can say represent nation anything lol,btohqsg
After ord I was super into exercising for a while,btohqsg
nus days  my exercise regime was 6 days a week,btohqsg
After graduation it was 4 or 5 days a week,btohqsg
how u even get to represent sg olympiad siah,btohqsg
I didn't study for local olympiad but I think those above me chose bio or chemthen filter down to me liao,btohqsg
say filter like u bottom of barrel liddat,btohqsg
let's just say by March of J2  I completed university first year physics  both theory and some questions,btohqsg
if anyone wants to ace  read Resnick and HallidayBest textbook ever,btohqsg
Mr Tannn  do u have any tips for me to buck up on my physics,btohqsg
How do I familiarize myself with the content and definitions,btohqsg
means your understanding of forces  energy and your mathematical calculations not there yet,btohqsg
Idw end up memorizing and not appreciating it,btohqsg
So it's quality over quantity is it,btohqsg
just do questions. For now you can take H1 papers cuz u haven't really learn H2 chapters yet,btohqsg
do those that are already taught. No need to repeat,btohqsg
honestly my sec 3 still abit shaky,btohqsg
Black pink doo doo doo doo doo do do do do do,btohqsg
just whack prelim papers and tys,btohqsg
i wld rather do tys later on tho,btohqsg
cus its the closest to the actual thing,btohqsg
the thing is the later the years  the less likely to repeat,btohqsg
Iw see wasted old fucks irl,btohqsg
do the topical versionjust whack all,btohqsg
topical wld have repeat qns in yearly?,btohqsg
yes  but you won't remember anyway,btohqsg
if u remember 100% of everything u won't be asking how to study also,btohqsg
best do as early as possibly or finish syllabus first,btohqsg
my sch speed like shit liao  cher planning finish a math in term 3,btohqsg
i tot most sch aim before june holiday?,btohqsg
only H2 physics finish before June,btohqsg
think ill try finish syllabus first,btohqsg
I always tell studentsconceptual understanding is easymastery is toughtime is needed for the mastery,btohqsg
Someone say ns cannot compare with period,btohqsg
Its the same as tap water uk right,btohqsg
so finish syllabus first more time to master?,btohqsg
Ok he can go imh claim pes f,btohqsg
if cannot master  then extra efforts to understand the next related part,btohqsg
I legit see before some dude said fk it and went shower using bidet,btohqsg

This is v random but does anyone know a Mr ang from nyjc   I think he's one of the Chers in charge of gz cca,btohqsg
If there is   he was from mi   he taught me for one H2 phy lesson,btohqsg

Ah I've only had the oppt last year during special timetable for y1,btohqsg
Before we were allocated to our official classes,btohqsg
Man such a pity I didn't get him for my phy Cher üò≠,btohqsg
MI really had a lot of nice teachers back in my year but for some reason a few of them were poached to ejc HAHHA,btohqsg
last year Mr Chee was reallocated to thr,btohqsg
would it be worth to do ndp rehersal performance if im sec 4 to get -2 cca pts,btohqsg
Is it marching or the flag walking,btohqsg
its like year long thing maybe?,btohqsg
my fucking god trying to msg all these ppl trying to sort smth out w my cca points,btohqsg
later sekali your o level you rage because you miss by 1 point,btohqsg

There's other factors that contribute to that also leh. Me overthinking and my own thoughts are hindering meh LOL also,btohqsg
not judging people that struggle with it but,btohqsg
in the wide view of physics,btohqsg
o levels really shows very little,btohqsg
Tempt me like the snake tempted eve,btohqsg
Oh so 1% of ocean is discovered kinda but physics version,btohqsg
like all the problems are very straightforward and idealistic,btohqsg
a levels start to intro a bit of complexity,btohqsg
but also without math physics is always gonna be very barebones,btohqsg
When was fully developed 9 month yt born,btohqsg
And the eat with your family day,btohqsg
