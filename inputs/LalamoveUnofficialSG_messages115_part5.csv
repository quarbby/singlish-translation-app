M'sian police investigating case of licence plate-plucking by woman at Tuas Second Link -Mothership.SG- News from Singapore  Asia and around the worldhttps://mothership.sg/2022/07/malaysia-police-investigating-tuas-link/?fbclid=IwAR31L766gi15PMFwLaOEvCYAjp9dUZT6L_R8DtXqANX1QqPfM91Wg9DQsJI&fs=e&s=cl,btohqsg

I think maybe llm got internal account to ‚Äútake away‚Äù these orders,btohqsg
For me  doing part time lala is cover some cost and a little bit of pocket money,btohqsg
Doing full time  need to really calculate your overheads to see if worth it or not,btohqsg
If want do ft  need to clock quite high mileage to earn a decent amt now. Cos less n less jobs with high prices. With the rising petrol costs  have to weigh the mileage n hours clocked against the income. Unless u have hybrid car,btohqsg
So part time lalamove car is still viable to do?,btohqsg
just do it and u will know  ask also no use de\,btohqsg
I will be blunt. Too many drivers  too many part timers joining now. Either to get the petrol discount or to just do abit to supplement income. On wkends where we used to expect higher volume of jobs nowdays harder to get jobs cos:1. Lesser orders cos open up liao. Pple either go out eat or go malaysia2. Recession. Economy bad. Tighten belt.3. Alot of drivers just take whatever jobs that come out. Regardless of the pricing. Of cos its their own personal choice  but when prices so low  deduct comm n petrol liao  earn so little  its not enough for full timers. But for part timers who just want cover abit of their weekly petrol etc  they do. Also they want clear mission  so just take whatever is out there.,btohqsg
In a way  the mkt is now skewed towards restos n users having advantage over us. N will continue to be like that. That's y nowdays more n more unreasonable job requests  n will be like that,btohqsg
Above is my own opinion  so if I offend any1  apologies,btohqsg
when i do  i dun even ask whether is it viable to do it. i just do it. everybody has a different view of what is viable n also every day has different delivery. mayb suit u or not. every day is a different day too. Dun need to ask just do it when u want it. Asking is useless. If u are scared dun do,btohqsg
u where got scare de  u old bird,btohqsg
scare of at the wrong place n timing  where another place have many jobs. WHy my area no job????!!!!,btohqsg
