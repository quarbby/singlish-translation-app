Why I ride: The impossibility of being a first time car owner 😔Well ladies and gentleman  we have done it. Cat A COE has crossed the $100 000 mark  and it looks entirely likely that it will continue to trend upwards. 📈There's plenty to complain and moan about  but there is one particular group that I do want to address and send my hearty commiserations - first time car buyers.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg

Just wanna ask you guys for comments on BMW 218i active tourer. This  car reliable?,btohqsg
Reliable-yes.More expensive to maintain when you compare to Jap or korean- also yes,btohqsg
Doesn't sound very convincing in terms of reliability  was comparing to Qashqai 2.0. Probably jap option is better. But bmw style still looks great!,btohqsg
If a car is expensive to repair,btohqsg
It doesn't mean that it's unreliable,btohqsg
It just means it's more expensive,btohqsg
Relative to what you get in the car,btohqsg
The cheaper your car is  the simpler it is,btohqsg
The less things there are to fix,btohqsg
I heard.. Parking sensors are a few hundred to replace,btohqsg
Bmw has much better driving performance. I feel comfortable driving it. But yes its expensive to maintain,btohqsg
If you do them at the ad  yes,btohqsg
But why would you need to replace them? Unless you reverse into pillars and walls often,btohqsg
No comments about 218i. I only drove their 1 series. But bmw good thing is zf solid gearbox Lol,btohqsg
LIMPEH DRIVE TO THAILAND 200KMH NO SEATBELT,btohqsg
Overall it is a nice car to drive less maintenance. 218 has more power anyway,btohqsg
Bmw common problem is smth leak,btohqsg
As long as u do proper maintenance it runs and drives fine bro,btohqsg
