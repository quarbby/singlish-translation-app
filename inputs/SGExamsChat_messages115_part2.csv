I'm doing a double degree SMU/Duke NUS.,btohqsg
I still have to sit for GAMSAT though,btohqsg
Are you in yr final year?,btohqsg
I'm thinking of doing LLM but I am not sure if i can disrupt. Duke says the 4 years has to be back-on-back and suggested if I wanna do Masters I study it before starting the medicine phase.,btohqsg
Anyway I heard gamsat is quite easy like mostly JC level stuff... hope I can do it ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg

Latest uni rankings out amid calls for halt due to Covid-19https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/latest-uni-rankings-out-amid-calls-for-halt-due-to-covid-19?utm_source=STSmartphone&utm_medium=share&utm_term=2020-06-10+17%3A16%3A45,btohqsg
NUS remains in 11th position while NTU has slipped to 13th position.,btohqsg
NUS and NTU game the rankings heavily,btohqsg
That's why they managed to get themselves ranked above many Ivy League universities,btohqsg
Heard NTU is ranked higher in engineering and chem than nus,btohqsg
Why do u think profs are graded heavily based on research,btohqsg
Prof ability to get tenure is 99% dependent on research,btohqsg
Not as much. Their teaching feedback get 4.0 enough,btohqsg
Yea but just for reference only,btohqsg
Is anyone ready for block exams?,btohqsg
Guys this is a random question,btohqsg
To be fair  I don't think Einstein was an excellent teacher,btohqsg
Anyone plays volleyball in local u here? Is the level of play high?,btohqsg
Like high to the extent that a complete novice cannot even warm the bench by the end of 4 years,btohqsg
He was one of the worst teacher in fact,btohqsg
yall obviously nvr met my encik,btohqsg
Which is why I think it's just an unfortunate industry standard where professors are expected to be both excellent teachers and researchers,btohqsg
Professors can actually be excellent teachers  it is more like uni penalise them for prioritising teaching over research,btohqsg
Hence most dont bother teaching well,btohqsg
Mhm  that's an institutionalised problem as well I suppose,btohqsg
Is it the $50 note flush down the toilet one?,btohqsg
i cant believe the dude did that,btohqsg
Can I use this as evidence to say that RI students all rich,btohqsg
Teaching quality  not necessarily Ivies are amazing too,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t it illegal to deface currency,btohqsg
It is  but guess which DPP wants to charge a retarded child,btohqsg
Court probably has no time for this shit,btohqsg
If you mean the public  sure.,btohqsg
But if you talk about field-specific stuff big no,btohqsg
? specific organisations always publish their own rankings,btohqsg
It almost seems like conflicting skillsets to me;Being able to simplify and break down concepts for beginners as a teacher and being able to grasp and answer complex questions being asked in those thesises as a researcher.,btohqsg
The Shanghai one is published by the Shanghai one,btohqsg
QS is published by the same org  etc.,btohqsg
Actually communication is a core skill in research. Now I just need someone to communicate to me how arrows upon arrows can prove ABC Conjecture is true or how its supposed proof does not hold,btohqsg
oh god what did i step into,btohqsg
