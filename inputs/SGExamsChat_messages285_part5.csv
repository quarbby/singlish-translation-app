If I want to change subjects at the end of j1  must I retain?,btohqsg
likely yes  unless you‚Äôre just changing h2 to h1 but if you‚Äôre changing from a subject to another  likely have to retain (altho i have heard of cases in the past whereby some ppl managed to change subjects without retaining bc they managed to study the year‚Äôs worth of content and perform reasonably well for a test that the school made them sit to see if they need to retain or they can move on to j2 with the new combi),btohqsg
for my JC to the best of my knowledge yes.,btohqsg
but i believe that it is likely that you may have to retain if you switch subjects in most cases,btohqsg
I cannot relate to this level of big brain,btohqsg
I dont need to fail promos to retain rite,btohqsg
Is failure in the subject a good reason,btohqsg

It  is normal to do absolutely horrendous for prelim . And acing it at olevel,btohqsg
I wanna know if any senior here got crap for prelim but doing well at olevel because I feel soüíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è right now,btohqsg
"same for every school  every level. prelim is set by school  national exam is same for everyonedepending on schools  some might want to set their paper damn hard to test their students' understanding or give them a ""wakeup call"". so yes  there are definitely people who do badly for prelims to ace their national exams  but it really depends on ur schools' standards for prelims",btohqsg
Ik someone 40+ prelims made it to jc,btohqsg
Its normal to do similarly well if u dont change up ur ways. If u come from a more competitive school  chances are youll improve greater but not guranteed.However  ur own effort and use of time will be most important in achieving ur desired results at the end of the day,btohqsg
Ohh I think my  school certain subjects they set very diffrui,btohqsg
Can I be the next him or her,btohqsg
