Though tbf all stocks and investments carry risk,btohqsg
I invested 30k... made 5k . Now all paper loss but waiting for the upside. I only bought big companies with little risk but I wanna urgently vet now. Today stocks crashed,btohqsg
Withdrew and made $7... mmm   it was too scary 😒,btohqsg
imagine having that much capital to begin with,btohqsg
I'm never ever gonna do day trading again.  Like I put $1k into Medtecs. It is a catalist gloves and masks manufacturer on SGX. damn scared .... Weekly still ok.,btohqsg
U dont need much to invest.  Like sg has no minimum lot size...  Companies like singtel and sia have 50% or more upside. I dont see any reason why these companies will fail or stay low.  Almost 100% gteed profits upon recovery if u can hold few month. So like 1000 becomes 1500 or 2000... lailai invest into sg and push prices up ❤️,btohqsg
sorry my bank oni got $1.64,btohqsg
Mine worse le. $0. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 all in stocks liao,btohqsg
I'm damn broke now I literally got less than 1 dollar on me 😀,btohqsg
Exams in this chat not investing 😔,btohqsg
If so money stuck longer 😂,btohqsg
But now my bank account shall grow with the power of saf,btohqsg
Even though saf's power is hella puny,btohqsg
At least it’s just the core subjects,btohqsg
I said this with no knowledge of what Brexit's impacts are on school education,btohqsg
But you’ve been on both sides of the grass,btohqsg
Bruh I researched that the other day,btohqsg
All undergraduate courses are taught in German there,btohqsg
Besides  it has no accomodation and international students will need to rent their own,btohqsg
Not everyone would be willing to spend a foundation year learning German,btohqsg
i talk to this person on dating app then we talking pretty ok then we say meet tmr,btohqsg
then i ask what time where,btohqsg
im losing so much faith in humanity sia,btohqsg
Provided we can get in. The test is ridiculously difficult,btohqsg
Anyone knows the difficulty of entrance for UCL/ICL?,btohqsg
I checked ucl and the minimum req to apply is 3h2 abb for sg a lvls,btohqsg
But I would presume need straight As,btohqsg
QS is only one limited way to assess quality,btohqsg
A in three H2 subjects and a decent PS,btohqsg
Cant find much details about icl though,btohqsg
Does UK in general care much about ccas and leadership,btohqsg
That answers my qn i guess,btohqsg
So get good grades to get in basically,btohqsg
They don't even ask for it,btohqsg
Overall spend half an hour can complete the app,btohqsg
Do they have their own internal tests like oxbridge,btohqsg
Plus whatever time you need for personal statement,btohqsg
Icl CS has a separate test and interview,btohqsg
EIE doesn't have a test but has interview,btohqsg
They might interview you over video call,btohqsg
Oh i get what you mean,btohqsg
Imo even if you get Oxbridge  without scholarship  you should think again on roi,btohqsg
With scholarship though  think again whether 6 years is worth it,btohqsg
Is icl and ucl fees any better though,btohqsg
Or is that advice generally for all uk unis,btohqsg
Oxbridge have college fees which most other universities don't,btohqsg
Factor in whatever London cost you have,btohqsg
At more than 60k a year  an extra 10 is marginal,btohqsg
Imo doesn't matter much. You already spent 60k. You spend 10k more for Oxbridge premium,btohqsg
9K pounds for a typical college fee,btohqsg
