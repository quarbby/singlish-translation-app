‚úàÔ∏èPika World Update 14 Dec 2021‚úàÔ∏èThe equity market tumbled on Monday as leading central banks are scheduled to hold meetings to discuss the prospect of monetary tightening soon. Without the Fed's support  the fear of future trading unnerve investors accustomed to a great stimulus feeding the market.‚åõÔ∏èMarkets ExpectationüïπThere is a general sentiment among investors that the Fed will lay out plans to remove its bond-buying program faster  which could lead to the path of an early interest rate hike. A combo that isn't helping equity valuation.Some economists are expecting 2 rate hikes in 2022. With the Fed pumping less money into the financial markets  there tend to be less liquidity bidding for riskier assets. Likewise  as we expect slower growth in 2022  the duo combo tends to put the market on edge.üß®Tech Stocks bear the blunt‚õΩÔ∏èAs discussed  technology stocks tend to see their future profit in present terms diminishes in value are likely to be hit the hardest. Smaller cap growth stocks face the same fate since many aren't profitable in the first place.üéâTreasury: Safe Haven  for nowüíµInvestors who are seeking safety will shift to purchasing Treasury bonds. So we can see the 10-year Treasury yield fell. The environment also favours the more defensive sector  which is less economically sensitive  such as the utility sector (XLU  ETF) and Consumer Staples (VDC  ETF).With about 20 central banks meeting this week  it is clear the volatility is on the rise and that the impact of Omicron on the background unsettle most investors.We hope you enjoy this read.
