must see position who bet first and preflop action,btohqsg
so u fold out all the retard hands that can fk u over so their “range” is narrowed,btohqsg
although usually we call squeeze related to 3bets,btohqsg
so like that if the flop comes some retarded wet board shit,btohqsg
u know its a lot less likely that they have,btohqsg
see what his other card is,btohqsg
mistake here is that nvr raise pre,btohqsg
AQ even off is premium hand,btohqsg
see the charts i sent u,btohqsg
earlier position u r tighten up,btohqsg
another example wld be lets say u got AKo and u DONT raise pre so 8 ppl in the hand  all limp and all got downie hands that u have no clue (or maybe not u never know),btohqsg
assuming single raise pot the chances of someone having a 4 wld be limited to just 45s 34a A4s,btohqsg
and so theres a lot lesser combos of hands that beat u in their range if u had raised pre,btohqsg
there was this other hand i had AKoi RFI out of positionopponent 3 bets prei callflop comes 565i bet 25 even tho i had nth (exploitative move dont ask me but in theory its a donkey move)he raise to 75i know his personality+his range for a fact he doesnt have shit most of the time  so i shovehe folds i was right,btohqsg
what hands are good enough to call with a 4,btohqsg
everything else is retarded and should fold,btohqsg
he would have folded pre OR not 3bet me pre lor,btohqsg
but having said that sometimes ppl 3bet bluff and i get fucked,btohqsg
this is vvvv simplified and i may have butchered some concepts for simplicitys sake and assumed other things,btohqsg
u first start is like that,btohqsg
i j said that cuz ltr some gto monster come roast me,btohqsg
oh thats actl not that small,btohqsg
lol 2 days ago every hand all in,btohqsg
i just sitting there with my $800 profit folding every hand,btohqsg
is that in the pdf i sent u,btohqsg
the poker eqv of telling someone whos starting investing,btohqsg

I am annoyed af rn bruh,btohqsg
They probably asking the wrong question in the first place,btohqsg
My Chinese did not reach this peak to understand,btohqsg
