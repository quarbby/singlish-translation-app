Can use a card to push it beneath the interior upholstery,btohqsg
You’re such a wise man sir AM!,btohqsg

What the heck is a moon roof,btohqsg
A sun roof opens. A moonroof doesn’t.,btohqsg
Moonroof can open abit to let air in,btohqsg
Like a crack. Barely considered open,btohqsg
At least I never say one to see moon one to see sun.,btohqsg
Like a buttcrack. Nice to have  but nobody want to see,btohqsg
Speak for yourself sir. Some like to see leh,btohqsg
You park under the rain and let your seat recline back,btohqsg
This is why I have no roof,btohqsg
Then realise.. Oh shit never put the roof up.,btohqsg

For the Esso users.. The time of the month is here,btohqsg
Either way I always refer to it as sunroof 🤣,btohqsg
So when are we installing on the civic?,btohqsg
No roof then die every other day in Singapore,btohqsg
Woohoooo!!! I love it when the time of the month is not painful but gives so much joy ☺️☺️,btohqsg
Unless roof is such a difficult sloping shape  I think many makers just make sunroof straight to give owners both options?,btohqsg
Like the 6 series then Bo pian lor,btohqsg
