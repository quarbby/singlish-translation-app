like how xdrive and all4 is for bmw and mini and 4matic for merc,btohqsg
just that quattro more renown cos itâ€™s launch and grip is really exceptional,btohqsg
5.2 seconds. To bs it by 1 second without substantial power increase is too much.,btohqsg
must use dragy they good haha,btohqsg
I was referring to price before COE. COE is standard for all cars  but since the hyundai evs will be made in singapore  there might be a lower ARF or lower price due to no import duties on the car,btohqsg
this quite nice though  but NA mileage and 6owners i abit scared,btohqsg
with a tune itâ€™s possible laa give the ad benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
the car is not at 333hp anym,btohqsg
This is m3. 4.3 seconds approximately.,btohqsg
we talking abt a car w more horsepower and awd,btohqsg
the import duties is negligible with respect to the coe price. Anyway Hyundai aso not cheap these day .the price is same like japs,btohqsg
So if boosted power than itâ€™s no longer 330bhp,btohqsg
where got stage 2 and no change to figures,btohqsg
when u beat everybody on kzkw,btohqsg
Sir  I'm not saying cheap in general. There is a term called relativity. Cheaper relatively  compared to other EVs that would come in as imports,btohqsg
A 2010 car is for all the coe is still quite new when taken good car,btohqsg
the definition of stage is endless,btohqsg
no we are not trying to define what stage. We are explaining the car isnt stock,btohqsg
If heâ€™s done it why didnâ€™t he mention new power output,btohqsg
sgcm ads use the car stats when new,btohqsg
I donâ€™t  are what sgcm what not.,btohqsg
It isn't very wise to put it out in the ad,btohqsg
he never put 333 in his description laaa haha,btohqsg
And everyone doesn't Dyno their cars,btohqsg
dyno only useful if u do before and after,btohqsg
please  dont start  another fee for dyno for inspection. tonglong ah,btohqsg
can see the gains espc if the car has lost power due to age,btohqsg
Not just that. If his tune is not custom,btohqsg
He might have a benchmark given already from the tuner,btohqsg
tbh even if i racechip iâ€™d dyno for fun,btohqsg
Everyone doesn't mention everything in their listing,btohqsg
got a lot of ads say mod list upon viewing,btohqsg
later some cocker go parliament  come out new policy every inspection cycle must dyno. i cry,btohqsg
The seller doesn't need to mention,btohqsg
Taken from LTA data that sgcm produces,btohqsg
u read his description he never mention haha,btohqsg
wait lemme read again in case i wrong,btohqsg
And as a seller  you cannot change this info,btohqsg
description never write on flywheel or on wheel,btohqsg
It is taken automatically basis the carplate,btohqsg
He could have described the new power after stage 2. Does the stock mentione 4.2 seconds?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s like saying his 330 bhp machine can do 4.2 ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
sub 5s possible even with normal a4s4 should be nth tbh haha,btohqsg
He doesn't get to choose the power output displayed,btohqsg
How are you not able to understand a simple thing like this,btohqsg
thatâ€™s ur perception of it lo haha,btohqsg
4.2 second but never use proper equipment  maybe not accurate one,btohqsg
Sucks. Really you donâ€™t see the finer points.,btohqsg
u see all the modded golf R adssgcm say 300 but u rly think those w meth and tunes pushing 300 still meh haha,btohqsg
Whyâ€™s he able to describe 4.2 seconds?,btohqsg
