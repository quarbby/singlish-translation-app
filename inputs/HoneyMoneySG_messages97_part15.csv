So if earmark $100k must pump in another $50k?,btohqsg
It is on the chat group that you exited earlier.,btohqsg
No link. Some one just posted : Note that uob one account interest will be revised to max effective 4% for $150k wef 1 May,btohqsg
It is posted by individuals. Unverified. Not from bank announcements.,btohqsg
Only $150 insurance counted and $150 must spend on retails.,btohqsg
Regarding UOB Dragon deposit promotion  for whatever reasons  despite me doing everything right  somehow UOB didn't earmark my deposit and gave me extra interest. What I did is to withdraw my deposit on last BUSINESS day of December. Then on 1st day of promo release  I registered for the promotion. Then transferred MORE than 100k back into UOB ONE.Come early Feb  fund still not earmarked although some folks here said theirs already earmarked. So I waited 1 more week and registered again  hoping it'll earmark in March. Didn't happen.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can confirm if Prudential insurance counted in UOB $500 spending for one account?,btohqsg
I'm assuming you transferred out to another bank before 30 Dec 1030pm?,btohqsg
Thanks  then I should spit it into monthly üòÇ,btohqsg
Go n read your Dec 2023 UOB One account statement inPDF copy.Check what was your account closing balance in December 2023?,btohqsg
After u registered and moved in $100k. Did your balance ever drop below $100k on any day,btohqsg
Like that then maybe not worth to put in UOB already. Might as well put in Tbills if not going to spend $500 per month,btohqsg
And I thought register in January. Earmark happens end Feb?,btohqsg
When using grab pay later installment do cards still respective cardsEarn points/miles for that MCC,btohqsg
Have you used Grab pay later already?,btohqsg
Depends on earmark promo to boost up the effective rate,btohqsg
no need recurring  direct pay via pru ipay also can,btohqsg
Well everyone nerf. Uob 4% + earmark could still be competitive,btohqsg
Anyway just like Cashback vs miles game.Just go for which ever is most value for money. No need loyalty.,btohqsg
I called the bank and said must be recurring insurance payment,btohqsg
then the bank giving false info not supported by their TnC,btohqsg
Some bank doesn‚Äôt even fully understand their product la,btohqsg
Yes  if I know early will have this promo  I sure will fund in more to do this  because I have the excel sheet for the MAB. üòÅ,btohqsg
So currently it deducted from your bank account directly or your Grab pay credit card?,btohqsg
T&C does say ‚Äúinsurance payments made on a recurring basis‚Äùhttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/chequeing/one-account/uob-one-account-card-spend.pdf,btohqsg
Oh  I don‚Äôt top up via cash or bank. Intending to use on Compasia for gadget purchase using either hsbc revo/crmc-amaze or dbsww,btohqsg
Why u never share your golden Info on Uob one here. Sad.,btohqsg
not much ba? play safe better..lol,btohqsg
see the TnC. Anyway tried and tested direct payment of insurance counted to the $500 card spend for bonus interest.,btohqsg
Bank can anytime void what u did if they want to use the term and conditions.If any dispute in future  they will use this term and condition to void the interests. Just saying and play safe.,btohqsg
void using which clause in the TnC? read the TnC not FAQ,btohqsg
You will only know after the promo start.,btohqsg
Something is wrong. Your 10th is different from 9th. But then again double check against your bank account transaction will be more accurate than me,btohqsg
The system is setup that CC payments for Grab PayLater is via Grab Wallet auto top-up first. So there's only 1 card gets rewards  at 0.3% cashback.,btohqsg
Iirc recurring payments via ipay is considered recurring.,btohqsg
Coz got giro ma no meh?,btohqsg
Yes which I did it.One off payment using credit card don't consider recurring payment.,btohqsg
hey guys  does giro transaction count towards the uob min $500 monthly spend?,btohqsg
To be clear  what u mean by giro? recurrent payment via cc?,btohqsg
GIRO is specifically processed only weekdays  before 6pm. Impossible for it to be processed on Saturdays  less to say Sunday.Payment is usually +1 business day after processing date.,btohqsg
