everythg i studied nvr come out,btohqsg
Bruh i forget what alloy sia,btohqsg
I pounded blast furnace until 1AM yesterday,btohqsg
I screwed up my qualitative analysis,btohqsg
Was almost late for the paper,btohqsg
I never study air and blast furnace,btohqsg
I check tys all the air is mcq wth,btohqsg
Fucked up my qa lol i put calcium sulfate,btohqsg
Should have go with my gut feel,btohqsg
Dilute acid less distilled water and,btohqsg
for u to find out for me to know,btohqsg
Wtf i didnt do 3 question,btohqsg
Section b i never do at all,btohqsg
You just said the paper was easy...,btohqsg
Idk if easy or not behind,btohqsg
Cause change from gas to solid,btohqsg
Down the group turn solid what,btohqsg
Bruh everytime exam i forget everything,btohqsg
wait shldnt it be bc of the strong forces between atoms,btohqsg
I said the physical state of matter changes from gas to solid as it goes down the group. Thus more energy is needed to overcome the FOA between particles. Therefore m.p increases,btohqsg
Idk if my ans can tho,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t the size of the atom increase,btohqsg
melting point increase down the group 7,btohqsg
Ye so the amount of energy requires to overcome the forces of attraction increases,btohqsg
So the melting and boiling point rise,btohqsg
lol i put steel for the alloy,btohqsg
but i forgot is iron n what,btohqsg
Actually just mention increase in relative molecular mass,btohqsg
they like never test alot leh,btohqsg
Just say relative molecular mass increases  hence the molecules move slower  resulting in stronger intermolecular forces of attraction and higher boiling point,btohqsg
Bruh i swear all like common sense question,btohqsg
if organic chem is not taken out honestly i think this paper is damn hard,btohqsg
i see the org chem questions i ðŸ¤®,btohqsg
is this paper counted as easy or hard,btohqsg
It has something to do with atom size what,btohqsg
Kinetic particle theory more on the mass,btohqsg
But atom size is part of kinetic particle theory,btohqsg
Anyone taking geog paper ltr ?,btohqsg
nope.... but others find it easy so idk,btohqsg
any idea what is gna come out for geog ?,btohqsg
i think we same class LOK,btohqsg
did u stare at the white t shirt dude when they say stop wriitng,btohqsg
I waitin for my student to reply,btohqsg
Wait for pchem were u supposed to do the entire B9 or choose btw either/or :O,btohqsg
Must choose between either and or,btohqsg
It went from 80 to 65 marks ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
But if u taking chem at a levels its kinda disadvantage,btohqsg
So neither choices were org chem?,btohqsg
So how was the pure chem paper?,btohqsg
They took out 15m if not i wouldnt have finished,btohqsg
