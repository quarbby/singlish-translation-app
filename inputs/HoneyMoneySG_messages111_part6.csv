I set up payee to my uob ac for moving my fund.,btohqsg
I have UOB one card  still considered new-to-UOB?,btohqsg
Hahaâ€¦ okâ€¦ just pushing it.. thanks,btohqsg
This one not pushing it ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

if you have the UOB One *Debit* Card then sure...,btohqsg
What's the best combination for income tax payment?,btohqsg
Maybank family and friends card got get 0.3% for AXS payment?Thatâ€™s sounds good,btohqsg
yah but cap at 15 cents per transaction,btohqsg
Donâ€™t do it. If u go and pay $50 x 100 times. Maybank will be your best friend in sending u love letter.,btohqsg
I have done 30 time before lol  need to spread out the transaction. One day max also 30 time only,btohqsg
Starsaver deposit 5k can get  3.5% interest?,btohqsg
I tot u said Maybank punished u Liao?,btohqsg
Closed my bank acct not cc,btohqsg
HmmmmI tot if close u. Is closed everything with lifetime ban.,btohqsg
Mine is secured cc  so not closed. Plus i spend on their card regular. But they dont approve anymore new card,btohqsg
So u withdraw and when do u put back in?,btohqsg
Oh haha. Ok la. At least never close u. Just no new products.,btohqsg
They fool only lah lol  coz i can spend quite alot. Just give it to other bank loh,btohqsg
I did it last time. Got limit 30 transactions a day. After 6 months in a row they stopped me.,btohqsg
Think till now uob havent close my cc is also because i spend alot,btohqsg
And i pay on time every month and no cash advance (in case some people anyhow guess),btohqsg
Banks come up with all this is to entice u to spend more. So most importantly is u must have the ability to spend. But when its the other way round u keep earning their interests and promotional cash they dont earn anything for u  after a while  they will stop u.,btohqsg
They wouldn't allow .. haha. Too troublesome for them also retailers...,btohqsg
They reject your lady solitaire card application?,btohqsg
What card you have for uob,btohqsg

Ocbc 365  I have a transaction $946 on 28th May already charged to my card but this transaction will cancel and credit back to my cc on june  then I must  spend $946 +$500  in order to hit my $500 spent on my card for June?,btohqsg

For 1st timer for dbs credit card Is it better sign altitude 1st or Vantage 1st ?,btohqsg
Sign dbs attitude card unless you feel is worth it. To spend 3k in 2 months. If is me I won't. I have the choice I go for dbs premier miles. Spend 800 in 2 months to get 30k miles,btohqsg
I am confusedVantage is 4k in 30daysAltitude is 3k in 60daysRight?,btohqsg
Uob one card and absolute cashback,btohqsg
I feel is expensive lÃ . Unless really can spend 3 to 4k... no point you pressure to spend this amount to get the miles,btohqsg
Seriously you say 1st time Dbs.. then go for Dbs world woman card,btohqsg
i can hit both cards criteria But just thinking which card has the best welcome offer currently for dbs,btohqsg
This one you can check with other bros and sisters in the group. To me even I got the money. . I go for dbs woman card is better...,btohqsg
You can just apply for dbs world woman. No need to spend $$ ...to hit criteria,btohqsg
