I‚Äôm very new to YouTrip card.  May I know can I change KWR today using today exchange rate n keep it for use in December?   KWR$ is not shown on the top 10 currencies,btohqsg
youtrip doesnt allow exchange of sgd to krw  so you need to top up your youtrip wallet and use as normal paywave in korea  youtrip automatically deducts according to the sgd to krw conversion rate,btohqsg

if you want fuss-free  open Standard Chartered's esaver acc via SingPass  the limit is up to $2M. If March is a guide  it gives 3.6% interest yield on incremental balance. since you're new  the full apr balance will be incremental. Apr rates will be published on 1 Apr itself,btohqsg
Use ichange rate is so much better,btohqsg

Any cashback card recommended for 17 year ite student.1)hsbc revolution debit+ega can give 1% cashback on all transaction2)maybank evibes has 1% cashback on all transactionBut sadly all need 18 years to qualify.,btohqsg
Frank by OCBC (debit)  min age is 16,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt have any competition at all ? All other debit card seem to have minimum age 18 as requirement,btohqsg
I need to hit 500$ min spend by 23Mar  and I just spend the remaining to hit the min on 20th  will I still be eligible for the singsaver rewards as idk whether the transaction will be approved by then.,btohqsg
Hi gurus of ocbc360  anyone knows how would OCBC compute this month's MAB  since 30th and 31st March is Saturday and Sunday?Will they use the 29th March MAB as the final MAB?Or will they update the MAB calculation one last time to account for all 31 days of March even though it is a sunday?,btohqsg
All 31 days. 29 is PH so the EOD balance is likely to be same as 28 EOD balance. Similar to 31 as Sunday with 30.,btohqsg
I see! I missed out 29th PH.Hmm and I just realised ocbc updates balances on Saturdays. I referred back to my Dec 2023 consolidated report  they do updates balances on Saturdays  as a result the last update was 30th Dec (31st being Sunday)And u are right  they do include the last day of the month even when it is a sunday.This means ledger balances doesn't change in their point of view on Sundays and ph  but MAB has a possibility of changing. Important to understand this for those gaming ocbc 360,btohqsg
"BTW.. I suppose this month the last ""ledger balance"" update would be on 30th March. i.e  last day for anyone wanting to adjust their MAB",btohqsg
Only other debit card available at 16 is Singapura Finance Vivid card  1.28% p.a. on savings account and dynamic CVC card. No cashback however,btohqsg

Shopback: Does that mean paying 100 dollars  am getting 90 dollars back ?,btohqsg
Looks like it ü§£ but who uses Norton omg üëÄ,btohqsg
Ahhh also have vpn that provides 120% cashback ! Is suspishSounds too good to be true,btohqsg
But don't you need to continue subscribe to utilise the cashback?,btohqsg
I thought cashback meaning cash into ur shopback account and trsf back to ur own bank acct. that‚Äôs what   I did totrip.compurchase,btohqsg
"I may be wrong ü§£ I thought need to ""unlock"" the cashback. Maybe it's only for retail store?",btohqsg
Lazada have various mcc  might not fall under fashion cat  depend on luck when charging to the card  but ya installement no point,btohqsg
Dunno. Am applying my past concept where i purchase accommodation viatrip.com  cash rebate is credited to my acct and after x days  i can put the cash into my bank account,btohqsg
Try to explore if you can benefit from this.,btohqsg
Not too good to be true. Sometime even free. Happen at times. They just treat it as customer accquire cost. If you forget to cancel next year. Charge you full price.,btohqsg
True true. Is on a renewal basis  also a way to expand customer base.,btohqsg
so they charge $102.96 but cashback 90%+? makes me wanna sign up,btohqsg
May I ask for rising dragon promotion after earmarked the fund says 100k  afterwards the balance in the account does it still get the 5% interest? Thanks,btohqsg
Oh means I get 5% on total 200k on the account now? As 100k already earmarked frozen away,btohqsg
No. You can check the table for the bonus interest tiers.,btohqsg
Yea then it's not a yes then. Thanks,btohqsg
You get bonus interest. But check the table to see how much will get the bonus interest.,btohqsg
OK I think means after the 100k earmark the balance in the bank shd be zero to max interest return. Let that locked amount saving to earn interest,btohqsg
