Hi i have a question  for subscriptions like spotify or netflix etc   do u get 10x rewards if u use the hsbc revolution or citi rewards card ?,btohqsg
I use Revolut for atm cash withdrawal and everything else itâ€™s citi rewards via amaze or if limit is hit then fall back to citi premiermiles + amaze,btohqsg
Hmm citi rewards doesnt include travel expenses,btohqsg
Is there like a shared mcc database that is publicly available?,btohqsg
Oh you mean buying stuff like air tickets and tours?,btohqsg
I think overseas transactions work but not travel expenses like air tickets and tours but need confirmation,btohqsg
Im confuse with the mcc database myself  i like to buy things online like games but not sure if its considered an online spending to hsbc revolution,btohqsg
1% cashback in points. Rewards portal will appear in October,btohqsg
Travel is excluded on citi rewards  you can use citi cashback+  premiermiles mc  or uob lady Mc. Or hsbc revolution,btohqsg
