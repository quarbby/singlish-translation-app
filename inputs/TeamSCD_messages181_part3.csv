hi guys  want to ask  now my windshield crack  due to rock chip  if i claim the $100 insurance thing to replace the windshield  will affect next year the insurance pricing or ncd?,btohqsg
Just that you cannot get back any rebate if you want to cancel your insurance prematurely (eg. Change car),btohqsg
To add on: Isit true that if during the 1year period  you have any insurance claim. You cannot get back the remaining amount if you cancel your plan early.,btohqsg
so i just pay the excess $100  will change the windshield  no increase in pricing and ncd wont affect ?,btohqsg
For your own peace of mind why not talk to your agent or the person who did the policy for you,btohqsg
Generally windscreen replacement doesnt affect NCD,btohqsg
They usually have website with chatbot or FAQ  or u can call,btohqsg
Most of the time it doesn't la,btohqsg
Ltr you policy dont even offer $100 excess for windshield,btohqsg
Makes no sense for something so small they reduce your NCD,btohqsg
if not you can go check your policy if it states windscreen change without affecting NCD,btohqsg
I swoped my windscreen out last yr without anything,btohqsg
Anyway. Being on non speaking terms with your insurance contact does not seem wise. Better find an alternative channel so if u ever need anything from your insurer you have a way,btohqsg
Makes no sense to let someone you not on good terms with to earn your money,btohqsg
You go leech his money can.,btohqsg
I can do that for you for under $50,btohqsg
Im upset now i saved this asuka 50 cm sticker on aliexpress but now I canâ€™t find it,btohqsg
Yes  no rebate if have any claims (even if is windscreen claim),btohqsg
