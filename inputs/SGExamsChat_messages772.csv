I suddenly realise my viva in wk 14,btohqsg
at most all the % throw to finals only,btohqsg
samies i have 1 viva next monday,btohqsg
I get to put the weirdest photos in my lab report,btohqsg
and i think applied need to do lab in y3s1 sia,btohqsg
get it out of the way asap,btohqsg
I rather do in sem 2,btohqsg
not with 4 core mods next sem...,btohqsg
tbh the shit part about lab is just if you last min,btohqsg
bc actually doing the report is ok,btohqsg
im 4 out of 4 reports where i did it the day before till the next morning,btohqsg
6 hours non stop through the night HAHHA,btohqsg
for me i just do the instructions thingy gfirst,btohqsg
tbh that was me a lot too,btohqsg
i split into few nights tho towards the end,btohqsg
i think its a nice groove to just sit down and finish one shot la,btohqsg
but honestly idt its very healthy so,btohqsg
i skip intro and just jump to the procedures,btohqsg
first night map out all the points i wanna make like just sections and short points,btohqsg
second night the easy stuff like procedure intro etc,btohqsg
write the report while waiting for the exp to finish,btohqsg
last night results and discussion those,btohqsg
Refering to C1 and E5 cus they take so damn long,btohqsg
i even had to come back during cny lmao,btohqsg
i just went to eat lunch lmao,btohqsg
for me i rmb i was doing something,btohqsg
its time to cruise and await graduation alr,btohqsg
you still need to do physics electives,btohqsg
y3s1 is the last hardest sem we gotta ever do,btohqsg
idt they'll be as tough as our core mods,btohqsg
otherwise the seniors will look like dying,btohqsg
spms club ppl looked ok for the moment uh,btohqsg
but yea someone told me got someone stress uh so i pity them sometimes,btohqsg
lol i swear wk 13 is like hell week with like a lot of projects,btohqsg
this is my chillest week 13 ive ever had since matriculating lol,btohqsg
and lab report which was ok,btohqsg
i think cus i switch modes alr,btohqsg
i havent stay in hall for quite a while uh,btohqsg
but tbh i also dunno the point of staying in hall for y2s2,btohqsg
you have the more chill mods like computational physics,btohqsg
then you have the gu mile quantum info,btohqsg
i think the odds of me jumping down from spms rooftop is higher than me choosing gu mile's mod ever again,btohqsg
computational physics is no longer offered apparently,btohqsg
according to the ntu website now,btohqsg
a lot of phy mods being removed,btohqsg
computational physics is bc prof marco is leaving,btohqsg
but you know what they added?,btohqsg
"they added ""Geometric Methods in Mathematical Physics""",btohqsg
"omg i was so damn pissed when they removed ""Acoustics"" as a mod",btohqsg
oh yea also Fluid dynamics is removed also,btohqsg
i‚Äôm seeing a few that i nvr see before,btohqsg
"But they cant remove the ""acoustic"" in me",btohqsg
yea but it‚Äôs actually the same as the graduate mod,btohqsg
yea same thing tho just that instead of taking a diff exam etc you just do the same stuff,btohqsg
i kinda wanna be a TA for one of the mods next sem,btohqsg
btw if you wanna do research  i recommend taking mods that apply your foundation concepts more,btohqsg
bc truthfully like example QM II is very conceptual but you don‚Äôt get to apply it to real systems really,btohqsg
christophos brought ppl on a sch trip to his lab.,btohqsg
i never went uh but yea,btohqsg
no i mean like conceptual wise it‚Äôs cool to know QM and the math but even theory work wise you‚Äôre not really using it to understand systems physically,btohqsg

I alw been using linear notes la,btohqsg
And it works for me so,btohqsg
like ppl ask me how I study I also dont know how to describe,btohqsg
Carebear but they were actually cats,btohqsg
I ask my pw cher about DHS pw distinction,btohqsg
then he say how yk is 88% (my friend say reddit said 88%) then my other cher was like sgexams lor,btohqsg
i'm actl dead for my WA next monday,btohqsg
btw do you have separate WA for fmath and h2,btohqsg
next week I have chem math hist,btohqsg
but I study which subject the most?,btohqsg
even tho technically our fm wa is still h2 math,btohqsg
you guys haven't touched the fmath topics yet?,btohqsg
technically relationship between 3 planes is fm,btohqsg
but it's just like that only,btohqsg
the actual fm topic is recurrence relations then we starting that next week,btohqsg
Bruh chat gpt can't help me with a double nested if loop,btohqsg
chatgpt is pretty rudimentary in the code it can properly help with,btohqsg
the more complex you want it to be  the more you gotta break it down to basic parts and stitch them together with your own knowledge,btohqsg
chatgpt only provides you with the knowledge from the internet,btohqsg
so you‚Äôre better off searching on google,btohqsg
chatgpt‚Äôs niche is in essays and etc,btohqsg
Ye usually i will just ask to solve bugs  if u copy paste the whole qns onto chatgpt  sometimes u get weird things that is not even taught so like it is p obvious to the chers u chatgpt-ed it,btohqsg
U need to feed it w more specific prompts if u want ur code to turn out a certain way,btohqsg
I legit wanna say smth so mean but must resist because im cultured,btohqsg
yeah stack overflow also very useful,btohqsg
helped me a lot whenever i struggled with lots of doubts,btohqsg
Well there is still the weekend + the rest of tdy  so u are not dead yet,btohqsg
Oh I realised why cause the data I want it to loop is null üíÄ,btohqsg
mr lim better not set some bs,btohqsg
I dun even think he will set the math paper unless he got promoted to sth now (?),btohqsg
My time he didnt even give lecture,btohqsg
i rmb for my amath prelim none of the sec 4 teachers set iy,btohqsg
he gave like 1 lecture as we starting lesson,btohqsg
For math or f math? F math should be just tutorial?,btohqsg
but he made us go for one h2 math lecture,btohqsg
Wah but how did u find out who set it,btohqsg
I was scrolling my ig archives and found sth funny  last time after each bad paper  i will post and pray for the next paper to be nice,btohqsg
Iz ok u still hv 1.5d!! Every day and minute counts,btohqsg
they put the name on the bottom,btohqsg
i like how they call the detention area  the student reflection space,btohqsg
There is a detention area in ur sch?,btohqsg
I tot usually detention just take a free classrm,btohqsg
I tot i wanna beat the rain but it restarted when i reached the bus stop,btohqsg
used to be a room called src,btohqsg
the useless network i have here,btohqsg
Sabotaging the other way is not a way to solve a problem,btohqsg
What exactly did that person do,btohqsg
nvm was student reflection center lol,btohqsg
This is actually q funny  a designated venue for it,btohqsg
why is the WhatsApp neon green?,btohqsg
dam gt on ps4 is fun,btohqsg
and the meta ai thingy is ugly,btohqsg
wat if i fail my napfa at sec 4,btohqsg
for girls probably no impact even if you fail everythingFor boys idk about sec4 but if you fail in Jc2 have to serve extra ns,btohqsg
anyone looking for tutors for sec/jc ?,btohqsg
i mean im from ip so alot of stuff doesnt really count in y4  but i assume for boys if you fail the napfa in sec 4   shouldnt be too much of a problemjust try to pass in jc2,btohqsg
everything i can except pull up and running,btohqsg
running i might be like 1 or 2 mins off,btohqsg
did anyone also listen to the radio while studying?,btohqsg
There will be a final ippt months before you enlist. You fail that  you go into army two months early,btohqsg
Yes so failing it now is nothing  but that final ippt is likely as matcha say is during or nearing the end of jc2,btohqsg
imma get jacked in 2 yrs fr,btohqsg
step 1 get ur heart broken,btohqsg
u will never get jacked if u dont follow step 1,btohqsg
i 2.5 years but i still potato,btohqsg
i used to listen to death metal while mugging back in jc,btohqsg
dropped the bag at sec 1,btohqsg
u know how i look like meh,btohqsg
that one cannot see physique at all wym HAHAHHAH,btohqsg
if i cld turn back time i wld straight knockout that dum fuck sec 1 me,btohqsg
throughout the heavens and earth  i alone am the fumbled one,btohqsg
For jcJan-April enlistmentFor PolyMay-Aug enlistmentFor IteFeb-Aug enlistmentAfter Aug it's likely because your medical is still Pes D,btohqsg
bud cant even breathe istg lol,btohqsg
All the best in training  make sure you don't forget to train your heart by doing runs,btohqsg
train heart to failure by taking 600mg of caffiene,btohqsg
Am i correct that the red portion is producer surplus and the dark blue portion is dwl when there is a binding price floor (above the equilibrium price) being set,btohqsg
"""want to stay awake longer? Don't sleep""",btohqsg
Or is the producer surplus the big triangle to the qs supplied (600),btohqsg
The dwl is which triangle ah  the one pointing downwards to the price or the one pointing rightwards to the price,btohqsg
even tho i got A for econs,btohqsg
i can do anything except the fking diagrams,btohqsg
which is quite annoying bc econs pays very well,btohqsg
Yes I think. Idk if there‚Äôs anything you may have learnt in Uni that‚Äôs different from a levels,btohqsg
Ite seems like whole year round in scdf,btohqsg
It doesnt make sense to be the big triangle to q=600 right coz the stuff wun even be sold  like a price floor essentially results in a shortage,btohqsg
The one bounded by supply demand curve and 200,btohqsg
Then what happens if after aug still pes d,btohqsg
The real ps should be the one projected from q=200 since it is the real amt transacted?,btohqsg
The one i shaded looks correct right?,btohqsg
The dark blue portion for dwl,btohqsg
Just that lower dark blue portion,btohqsg
Ok thanks i cant imagine doing my midterms studying the wrong thing,btohqsg
I revising for finals then erm realised my previous one dun look rightüíÄ,btohqsg
Is my red shaded portion (PS) right,btohqsg
Pes D means you can't enlist,btohqsg
So you gotta keep pushing CMPB to give you a Pes that is not DIf they sent you to medical appointments  go,btohqsg
Once you are pes D it's a waiting game,btohqsg
i look like beanstalk that was inpregnated with a baby,btohqsg
i wish i was born fat,btohqsg
idk why my line of thought is so unconventional,btohqsg
fat to buff is so much easier than skinny to buff,btohqsg
i was skinny my whole life,btohqsg
cb my collarbone length and chest insertions,btohqsg
but it's hard to keep track,btohqsg
At the end if you are still Pes D 3 months after your last scheduled medical appointment then write in to cmpb and ask...if they don't reply  use the time while waiting to be productive.Dw  it's not malingering...but make sure you check all the accs where you gave cmpb to communicate to you by,btohqsg
Idk man I gained 4 kg AND my weight shot it's highest since sec,btohqsg
wait if u actly still pes D after aug  isn't it somewhat like NS deferment,btohqsg
Yeah then upper blue portion is CS,btohqsg
Can't imagine but I look like a twig,btohqsg
lol right cause u not enlisting,btohqsg
Yea kinda but you have no schooling alr...so more like a longer wait time lorh,btohqsg
oh wtf so still need to enlist one,btohqsg
Pes D means cmpb have not decided what pes you will be.So yes eventually cmpb will give you your pes,btohqsg
And if it's not F  yes you have to enlist,btohqsg
If you got uni lineup...have fun with schedules,btohqsg
i mean if you are a gymbro then it would be beneficial but for those that dont workout then gg,btohqsg
its the only thing keeping me from going gompletely insane,btohqsg
Workout if you mean gymming yes  people don'tbut if you are talking about light workouts..Alot of people do it,btohqsg
It depends on what you define as workout tbh,btohqsg
like yea Ryan is rightalot of ppl do like light workouts like maybe play bball or soccer with frend  or cycle at ecp but less ppl do hardcore gym,btohqsg
^ precisely most people won't pickup a metal rod and do squattingNor lie down and push something heavy above their body,btohqsg
finally I subscribed to Ark Grit,btohqsg
Actl i am considering starting gymming after WAs,btohqsg
i j waiting for someone to hop on with me,btohqsg
I just restarted after retiring for 12 years from the gym,btohqsg
cause now senior high can go sch gym alr,btohqsg
but they dont open the gym to jh kiddies,btohqsg
bro is the definition of ‚Äú20 years experience at 15 years old‚Äù,btohqsg

You are so old even History Majors don't study you,btohqsg
then someone found out her real identity and irl shes a habitual liar and a failure,btohqsg
she was homeless for some time apparently,btohqsg
idk how tf they find out but,btohqsg
i think they cannot expose real identity to public bc that would be illegal alr,btohqsg
but yea that E girl a bitch,btohqsg
History Majors study quite recent events. Mine is Archaeologists,btohqsg

We are using a service run by 30 people???,btohqsg
How do you know what's inside you unless you test yourself? Don't do one push-up  do 100. Don't run one mile  run a marathon. Don't have one family  have a second family all the way across the country. Don't just have a second family  have a third family in Santa Fe with an alternative lifestyle. Don't spend any time with the first two families  make a commitment to family number three  and double down by announcing it at his war-hero father's retirement party. Don't go to the funeral  'cause  remember  you got two other families to deal with and a marathon to train for. Don't just let Kenneth walk out of your life  take his life from him. Don't just go to jail  go to death row by killing the other two families. Don't just let anyone have their closure by apologizing  send a message that you're not afraid of hell. Nike. You may not know this  but our full name is Nichael.,btohqsg
Yall talk as if WhatsApp is a for profit venture,btohqsg
I doubt Meta makes shit from that they probably bought it only for market share,btohqsg
WhatsApp is a very small part of Facebook‚Äôs overall revenue. It generates almost all of it from WhatsApp for Business  which charges businesses for usage after 1 000 conversations.,btohqsg
It's an estimate btw we don't know the numbers,btohqsg
I mean it's not big enough for Meta to even give a shit about em in their 10-K,btohqsg
Youtube found out years ago... hosting content is really fucking expensive to maintain,btohqsg
If I recall correctly you cannot enter SST using PSLE score  it is like NUS High and SOTA where you apply directly to the school before PSLE,btohqsg
i thought sst is like dsa+ psle t score of at least 200,btohqsg
Yea I think you have to DSA and your PSLE should be above a certain cut off (it's def not >250 though),btohqsg
i mean it came free w the phone but goddam,btohqsg

i meant like didnt know it in the past,btohqsg
yk those frens u joke w but can never have a deep convo,btohqsg
or know whats going on in their mind,btohqsg
But there is no real me: only an entity  something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze  and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there.,btohqsg

blud offered to help me get a tuition job there and then proceeded to badmouth me to the boss,btohqsg
3/4 of what she said is inaccurate either way,btohqsg
and she knows and hates that i dont support palestine (i mean which normal pereon does right) and attributes it to ‚Äúlack of proper decorum‚Äù,btohqsg
and have u never heard of public vs private personas,btohqsg
a cease and desist is just a letter telling them to stop or else you'll commence legal action,btohqsg
you technically don't need any grounds,btohqsg
it's not a formal thing yk,btohqsg
def doesnt cover the financial damages that she did,btohqsg

I guess it depends on the insurance plan  some will still cover,btohqsg
