Huat ah! So lucky.I got wife with kid. $2.8k cannot save a single cent every month.,btohqsg
Check out maybank website or if u have treat app login,btohqsg
But you spend a lot.. to get so much miles accumulation,btohqsg
No choice have to borrow from future self. Life is tough. But still must earn miles.,btohqsg
Not difficult once you learn the tricks from miles gurus.Eat for free with Priority Pass.Fly for free with miles.,btohqsg
From when I see you guys can put so much $$ 100 to 200k into uob or hsbc.. must be strike toto...,btohqsg
Fly for cheap  not exactly free haha. Still got tax to pay. Like Chris mention still got opportunity cost when opt for miles over cashback card.,btohqsg
Main thing is expenses. 700k miles. Wow. I guess need to spent at least 120k to 200k per year. [after sign up promo],btohqsg
For UOB EBOL  Paying with Apple Pay on online merchants is it considered online payment ?,btohqsg
72 000 miles from PayAll means spent exactly 120K üòÇ,btohqsg
Why do you even put 10k in stash  there‚Äôs no interest on it first 10km also,btohqsg
You mean now .. previously they say 2.5 to 2.8 %,btohqsg
On 10k balance? In 2020 till now  10k balance doesn‚Äôt earn you bonus interest iirc,btohqsg
If we use Amaze+shopback/Favepay  insta points won‚Äôt be awarded?,btohqsg
Local transactions don't earn amaze pts,btohqsg
Then that answers your questions already,btohqsg
All the while I though local transactions are awarded with amaze points,btohqsg
thanks Chris  can i confirm its based on FCY x 7x treat points? and converted to KF miles I see MB recently adjusted 20k TP for 1 000 KF miles  can i confirm?,btohqsg
Oh no..  I misread...Bro. So I move the fund 10k to hsbc EGA to get 3.2% ?,btohqsg
Can confirm with Maybank  I don't hold this card yet,btohqsg
Move to where you think has a higher interest than 0.05,btohqsg
I thought someone in the group here say have 3% for stash account per month,btohqsg
Any reasons why they wont waive the charges?? Need to fulfil criteria of annual spending perhaps?,btohqsg
Maybe you can read the tnc and search the chat again. Believe we had provided screenshots to you the previous time you said stash gives 5% or something. And Chris sent you a video to explain the mechanics of it,btohqsg
I used my Amaze card + CRMC overseas for dining but I don‚Äôt get any insta points is there some delay or changes ?,btohqsg
I guess they don‚Äôt need a reason since they are not obligated to waive the annual fees?,btohqsg
Transactions posted? And is mcc not excluded by crmc?,btohqsg
Hey guys  first month receiving the ocbc 360 bonus interest here. Usually which date  do they credit in?,btohqsg

Ohhhh  just under 10 SGD thanks you !,btohqsg
Usually on the 6th or 7th working day. Likely next tues,btohqsg

Citi PremierMiles is the least used card. Mainly use for CitiPayAll also.My wife hold my AMEX Plat Supp  that card spend the most at 0.78mpd.But happy wife happy life‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Max bonus ma. No? ü§£ I forgot liao.,btohqsg
Citi premier miles I use for designated agoda . Book hotel also,btohqsg
Legit spend. Got black & white just in case.,btohqsg
829k miles. Bro you can take first class flight to Euro,btohqsg
Hi guys  just checking. does fast transfer SALA work for ocbc 360?,btohqsg
So hard to get for family of 3.,btohqsg
Can teach me how to transfer miles to them?,btohqsg
Yes. Cannot. From child to adult account can,btohqsg
Since we're talking about this  if I have a Krisflyer account  can I use my miles to buy tickets for my family as well?,btohqsg
My son a lot of miles. Later I try if can.,btohqsg
Same here and I have a payment scheduled with cardup. Looks like have to cancel.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know where to find the MCC eligibility list for Amex True Cashback card? I tried searching and only managed to find TNC documents without the eligible MCC information TIA!Specifically  I want to know if it covers MCC 7011,btohqsg
I heard they will update again terms n conditions,btohqsg
‚ÄúDo note that linking of accounts is permanent and cannot be changed or reversed. The accounts will automatically be delinked once LITTLE MX turns 16.‚ÄùWow. So cool. üòé,btohqsg
I would say amaze + Uob krisflyer cc. If mcc matches whitelist.,btohqsg
Ok nvm. I did a quick search and found this. Sharing for everyone's benefit.,btohqsg
