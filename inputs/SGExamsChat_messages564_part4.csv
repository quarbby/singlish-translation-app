i worked so hard for every subj since i have been hospitalised and sick throughout my entire 4 years in sec sch. i hv been neglected my health to the point that the doctors are even concerned abt it as the probability of getting cancer from gastric was high. i also have ion deficiency but i often skipped lunch to go to teacher consultations js so i wld achieve a single digit. it got to the point that there was stomach ulcer. to make it worse  i’m allergic to wheat so i can’t eat anything in the canteen. i calculated my marks  for prelims and did not exceed my expectations. what hurt me the most was my trusted teacher telling me that i would not be successful w/o having a decent grade. i neglected my mental health and spent 10h studying everyday js so i can exceed everyone expectations. aft exams  i calculate my results and i only achieve b3 / b4. i heard frm my teacher that the bellcurve would make it to C5/c6/ d7… i feel depressed that my effort all these years would lead me to a pathway that i would definitely not expect.,btohqsg
allergy to wheat sounds hella depressing,btohqsg
yes LOL but still forced to eat by teachers,btohqsg
there’s not much GF food in sg so its kinda hard to eat here,btohqsg

hi  great job on taking the courage to rant!! thats honestly an insane amount of work you put in,btohqsg
no one should tell you otherwise,btohqsg
This is how i spend my friday night,btohqsg
also your teacher is bullshitting about the moderation,btohqsg
only time will tell what happens next (quite literally too) and i wont tell you to keep your head up because thats probably difficult as balls rn  but your health is more important than an exam,btohqsg
do what you need to take care of yourself yeah,btohqsg
