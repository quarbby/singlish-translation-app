SG without subsidies can go to hell,btohqsg
Tokyo take home salary may be slightly lower.. but the housing prices are way cheaper,btohqsg
Of course places like Ginza and Azabu are pricy  but Japan property in general is very affordable,btohqsg
Must study a bit.  See what‚Äôs the theory behind,btohqsg
$500 only but rural la haha,btohqsg
Rental yield is good  loan cheap  just have to stomach the risk of earthquake damages,btohqsg
Need to commit 8-10 years staying there,btohqsg
these few days loss also more than $500 liao hah,btohqsg
The take home salary is not accurate... Because there are other 'taxes' to pay,btohqsg
Indeed   land tax city tax.. etc,btohqsg
JP has their unavoidable Âπ¥ÈáëÔΩ§‰øùÈô∫ expenses...,btohqsg
i dun mind also  open minsu got some customer can survive liao so cheap,btohqsg

Q pop will conquer the world,btohqsg
old mah old lo  my heart also old ah,btohqsg
Really really old  don't know internet type leh...,btohqsg
A good indicator to know if the country is sunsetting..is to look at rent seeking behaviour,btohqsg
If cannot innovate then just suck rent,btohqsg
That is why SG must always stay ahead even though by short cut way üò¨üòÇ,btohqsg
i go hiking alot old ppl too  so no worries haahah,btohqsg
Old until cannot walk properly Liao  let alone hiking...,btohqsg
maybe the no kids  give me their inheritance,btohqsg
That's the key point! Inheritance tax is about 50%,btohqsg
"Effectively  you have to pay the gov to ""buy"" over any inheritance",btohqsg
ok la then  i go up mountain talk to flower and trees ahaha,btohqsg
Many descendents don't even wanna entertain the inheritance notices,btohqsg
then just everything cash put in tongs so can pass to descendents haha,btohqsg
Must give under table  over many years,btohqsg
ppl die liao  descendents take liao no ppl say how gov know,btohqsg
As long as not in banks,btohqsg
It takes a lot of effort to avoid inheritance tax,btohqsg
Sorry I spoke too much again,btohqsg
It's always a give and take... Key is to select a place where you can take what matters to you more and give what's not,btohqsg
Make best use of both countries laws,btohqsg
I am surprised Tokyo salary less than Sg,btohqsg
Hold. Market will recover. Buy sell buy sell now will loss more money,btohqsg
Wow never thought cheaper in Japan.,btohqsg
The media stereotype is outdated liao,btohqsg
Sg is actually one of the more expensive cities.. in terms of rent to pay ratio,btohqsg
It's not Japan getting cheaper  it is more of Singapore getting really ex,btohqsg
Agreed. My wanton mee getting more ex,btohqsg
Later they still want increase gst,btohqsg
Because covid used so much reserves,btohqsg
This one ...won't ah. They have to use income tax to attract FT,btohqsg
If income tax level same as Tokyo,btohqsg
Why would people come here instead of Tokyo,btohqsg
Scare of winter  Singapore best climate all year long,btohqsg
SG is still one of the lowest personal income tax countries,btohqsg
Winter cold can wear more clothes..  but hot summer cannot strip down beyond naked,btohqsg
I wonder how much room we have for adjusting,btohqsg
Rich bosses will still come because of competitive corporate tax rates,btohqsg
Recycle the argument used for rasing GST,btohqsg

Sharing on MC Payments - new MD  new strategy. And what better way to discern their strategy than their hiring plans? From the JD  they seem to be pivoting to a PaaS (payments-as-a-service) provider  with moves into crypto  DeFi (decentralised finance) and CBDC (central Bank digital currency). I like what I saw and have been accumulating. The fintech Rapyd just raised $300M recently on a $8.7B valuation recently. Detected smart money buying this morning as well. DYODD,btohqsg

Focus on reducing counters and minimising damage. Many people lose this period  gonna take some time to bring back sentiments to usual. Today's bounce looks like a dead cat. Not sure  but stay wary. I took about 30-40k damage cutting this 2 days. Just play safe  survive and fight when times are easier.,btohqsg
Thank god I did not buy warehouse there.. if not stuck..,btohqsg
Yea  play safe. I lose your Clearbridge about 10k. Biolidics all‚Äôs another 10k,btohqsg
Dax hope you huat back from Moya,btohqsg

Dax only lose 30k but he nvr tell us how much he profited?,btohqsg
I still haven‚Äôt cut  was -$40k yesterday  recover till -$33k for today,btohqsg
Chasen managed to flip up 73/74. earlier i was hesitating within 2 decisions.1) Cut my balance 300 lots 72 or2) Mouth the entire 73.Went for item 1. Wrong choice... Confidence hit...,btohqsg
Chasen strong somehow.. I need the funds for some work venture so i take back some from market today.,btohqsg
Choice 2 might have triggered the BBs perhaps to clear 74 and 75.Can tell that got some players supporting Chasen.,btohqsg
See lasup stock.  Fry up and down using story.Now dry liao,btohqsg
My biggest fear is a wide market crash like last year Feb 20 type.,btohqsg
$30k profit from YZJ and STA and another $19k from other counter investment help me stay cool  else every night cry to sleep,btohqsg
Power la bro...previous profit so much...heng,btohqsg
Chasen $0.077. All Should be in the money. OTOT. Good luck!,btohqsg
chasen bb flexing to our boss dax üò≥,btohqsg
Chasen BBs wants the attention. Run in a difficult market,btohqsg
should have went for my option 2 to mouth the 73. Argh. nvm  i will be back lol,btohqsg

Healthway you reckon can bounce to 36 at least?,btohqsg
i didnt get to run the last round. this one really hold super long.,btohqsg
hopefully it runs again when TM runs,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so bro. Such crash happens like once in a decade. Last yr one was overdue. Covid was just a narrative. In between  will have corrections and pullbacks for sure. Nevertheless let‚Äôs not predict nor follow news. Let‚Äôs get the clues from SPX. If price remains below dma50 for more than 3 days then watch out. Currently all MAs sloping up nicely,btohqsg
last round spike to 39  u didnt out?,btohqsg
didnt. was busy that morning. by the time see  it was back to square. my EP 36,btohqsg
Hopefully man  anyways  sentiments not good now. retailers not in the mood to risks. lesser players also. not much buyers. I'll stay light for a bit.,btohqsg
Hmm  these days the BBs dont give us much time to take profit. they really just provide a short time window span to make decision on tp,btohqsg
See already scare to touch penny stocks .,btohqsg
i missed the 73 mouth  if i mouth 77 and stuck  i'll tilt though haha,btohqsg
hmm not sure on this.. depends on the new buyers tgt scalp or tgt higher i guess,btohqsg
yup  looks like broke out of a downtrend and trading sideways for now.. resistance 89/90,btohqsg
i think it was the right mouth to do 77  nonetheless.. hope you did it,btohqsg

Chasen tomorrow still will chiong ma.. Still holding üòÇ,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt just evaluate based price falls. Everything is going to get ugly at some point. Even great companies.,btohqsg
yea  we will get over it. Will wait for the right opportunity to hoot back to win,btohqsg
Anyways  watch Moya closely. Flush is over.,btohqsg
Maybe tml it turn cos chasen run liao,btohqsg

Will chase .. BB likes ppl chase .. .. gogo,btohqsg
So you have 3 choice when facing these type of counter: Continue to Invest with risk  Reduce Risk or Skip it totally. My recommendation is to skip loss making money company  prefer company that keep building its cash flow which comes with a premium.,btohqsg

Chinese President Xi Jinping issued the clearest evidence yet that the Communist Party‚Äôs recent assault on China‚Äôs biggest Internet companies has a broader social agenda rather than the ‚Äòtargeted‚Äô measures against individual examples of bad practice  as officials have tried to portray the attack.Chinese state media reported Xi as telling a government meeting of the need to ‚Äúregulate excessively high incomes and encourage high-income groups and enterprises to return more to society.‚ÄùThe news comes a day after new draft regulations were published by antitrust regulators that would ban many of the practices used by the country‚Äôs big Internet platform companies to squeeze money out of their users.  Separately  shares in the country‚Äôs biggest real estate developer Evergrande fell to a new low as its founder stepped back from the group‚Äôs biggest operating entity  Hengda.,btohqsg
