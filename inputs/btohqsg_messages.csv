Hi  anybody knows if planning to get a hdb loan still can book a flat if dont have HLE letter yet?,btohqsg
but if I recalled  I also never have my HLE done upon attending the signing of LOA (2nd appt)  it was done on spot by the HDB officer  if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
hi  does anyone here knows about Punggol Waterway Sunrise 2? It seems like the workers inside are not working. Whereas Punggol Waterway Sunrise 1 is working round the clock :(,btohqsg
Normally they will ask you to get a HLE done first as it is a pre evaluation kind of thing how much HDB can loan. So at least when you choose your flat or unit then you won‚Äôt over short on the finance.,btohqsg
Hi Does anyone have an idea for SBF 2020 ? Like any news so far ?,btohqsg

Anyone knows Bidadari 2020 Nov estimated completion date?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know is the people knowledge declined or technology cause work becoming slow... and also the final work so many issue/ problem.  I still remember my father‚Äôs time only 2-3 years and with very strong foundation,btohqsg
I'm supposed to get my BTO 2017 keys this Q4,btohqsg
dragged another 6 months at least,btohqsg
This is how unprofessional  unproductive  inefficiency nowadays,btohqsg
thought normally 4 years was what it takes to build,btohqsg
Not as it stated... when you went down.. date is 6 years,btohqsg
the current house I'm staying  was 2003 BTO and it was TOP 4 years later,btohqsg
and it was already considered slow lol,btohqsg
i see some 2-3 years only,btohqsg
Is it cos the block lesser?,btohqsg
5 years??? That‚Äôs very Long. How many blocks are yours?,btohqsg
Mine 6 block 38 storeys @ 6 years,btohqsg
So the TOP date is actually not accurate,btohqsg
Mine 2015 may bto 2 blocks with 16 storeys extended to q2 2021 too,btohqsg
Don't know will delay till when,btohqsg
Den what for they put there. A few months delay we can understand but 1-2 years of difference is really not acceptable,btohqsg
Yah i heard from my friend,btohqsg
Tot they need to deliver as per what we signed on e agreement,btohqsg
Hdb sure say cos of covid,btohqsg
Den Mayb next time covid 20 or 21 then house forever no need come,btohqsg
I think I die already also house haven come,btohqsg
Mine before COVID already state 6 years... so long and COVID still state can still TOP on the same time,btohqsg
Think they trying to rush also lor,btohqsg
any of you know what happens if I can't make up the shortfall upon collecting keys?,btohqsg

haha just wait for another week,btohqsg
Anyone knows when Sales of Balance will be made available?,btohqsg
Good luck for all balloted aug de,btohqsg
easier to get for Pasir Ris,btohqsg
to have 20% chance to get balloted  PR =#190 for 3rm  PR=#442 for 4rm  PR=#386 for 54m,btohqsg
I think pasir ris is the least popular isn't it,btohqsg
if you opt for 3rm confirm can get it since its below 1.0 for first timee,btohqsg
Usualllly ahhh results out on friday,btohqsg
so either 4th or 11th sep,btohqsg
But 11th over the 3 weeks mark liao,btohqsg
however  I got the result on a Monday via email,btohqsg
during my 3x of balloting  the results were out after 6 weeks,btohqsg
so for this launch  1st week of sept is very early,btohqsg
Feb bto results was out on mar6,btohqsg
Same as mine . Balloted in late may   result out in early july . But that was 3 years ago liao,btohqsg
Yaya 3 years ago is tt long.,btohqsg
yaya means we are getting keys soon,btohqsg
Tbh bida seems really long from start to completion,btohqsg
punggol northshore is long too since 2015,btohqsg
Nope . Another 2 more years before i get my keys . Woodlands project,btohqsg
my BTO was may 2017 too but earliest to TOP is next June,btohqsg
Oh . Mine earliest 1st Q 2022 . 5 blocks of 30 floor   so far 2 blocks are at 10 floor . The other 3 blocks are at 5-6 floros only,btohqsg
Doubt i can get keys in 2022 Q1 üòÅ,btohqsg
30 floors no wonder the duration,btohqsg
Halfway through my bto project seems to chang contractor too thats why so delayed,btohqsg
All the machines were pulled out suddenly . So i assumed is change of contractors,btohqsg
Oh as long as HDB hands over you the key before the mentioned date OK lah,btohqsg
No worries  its well taken care of üòâ,btohqsg
Hi All  quick question  I‚Äôm on the HDB page and saw this page  is this sales of balance?,btohqsg
Would like to know about tampines greenflora progress. Any idea?  I can't find any thing about the progress. üòÖ,btohqsg
But some bto can see the progress update. But my BTO don't have.,btohqsg
"Hi guys  want to check what is a ""airwell"" stated in the BTO site plan?",btohqsg
the air vent from the underground car park. Additional air for you to dry clothes lol.,btohqsg
Airwell is a non box up area..Allows light to penetrate and air to circulate..,btohqsg
Oh! So that is a airwell,btohqsg
Weirdly  I'm shock why there is a whole stretch of particular units not being selected for the tampines greencourt,btohqsg
It's beside a airwell and nothing else but not sure why that whole stretch of unit wasn't taken.. Any advice?,btohqsg
I don't mind  but what's holding everyone back  that's what I'm curious,btohqsg
eh if bought resale and ballot for BTO  need to pay levy right,btohqsg
I still don't understand the concept of open booking,btohqsg
open booking also need to ballot?,btohqsg
no idea I only know first come first serve,btohqsg
oh so open booking was known as reoffer of balance flats ROF previously,btohqsg
unsold balance flats from sale of balance flats SBF,btohqsg
no idea how did the old flats ended up with SBF,btohqsg
Buy this lock one must careful ok,btohqsg
like you and your dad/mum co-own a house  and you have to put back the amount of money which you have used for mortgage loan to your CPA OA before you can own your own house,btohqsg
My BIL is a co owner with his mum . Someone have to take over the ownership from him and pay him the money he contributed to the home via cpf before he can purchase his own house,btohqsg
currently I coown this house with my mum so that I can service the mortgage  so in the end my mum has to pay me back the money back to my OA right?,btohqsg
in order to purchase my own house,btohqsg
Yes . Another way that i foumd on hdb web states that u can give up ur co owner status without getting back the money if u wan to buy ur flat immediately . Cys transfer of ownership takes about 10 weeks,btohqsg
means I can forgo the money if I  am buying flat immediately after the transfer of ownership is done in 3 months time?,btohqsg
If im not wrong its possible . U might wan to call hdb to check tomorrow.,btohqsg
ya going to my side hdb branch and check it out,btohqsg
Cus now u are owning a hdb flat. So u need to give up ur co owner status before u can purchase another hdb flat. U can check with hdb if u can give up tbe cpf that u have contributed .,btohqsg
And also ask them to check if ur mum is eligible to own a flat with only her name,btohqsg
but because my mum's CPF wasn't sufficient to deduct for the monthly mortgage,btohqsg
so I applied as a co-owner to pay for her since I was single and never thought much,btohqsg
Oh . If u pull out ur name  can ur mum still fork up the mortgage?,btohqsg
it had been fully paid up years back,btohqsg
come to think of it I had no idea how come my mum was able to ballot for this 4rm BTO as she was the only applicant,btohqsg
bought it at 162k in 2003,btohqsg
I just downloaded this from hdb. Take a look at section 1.1,btohqsg
Maybe in 2003 single can purchase 4 room flat?,btohqsg
means the money has to be put back into my OA if I am removing my name of this house,btohqsg
thank you so much Shi En for your time and effort,btohqsg
No probs . Can call hdb tomorrow and check if there is alternatives,btohqsg
Shi En  yeah must put back the sum,btohqsg
Anybody can take over ownership from um,btohqsg
Anyone got the unit in amk on the Aug batch?,btohqsg
So I have to use this money to put back my cpf since my mum does not have so much money,btohqsg
Wa thats good. Maybe i can tell my bil to do that,btohqsg
Must save up the cash lor,btohqsg
Means not much left for the necessities,btohqsg
Oh true . Anyway he also cant do that cus the house havent met 5 years MOP,btohqsg
Time is long but it is good for saving up too,btohqsg
if husband and wife owned a subsidised house from HDB  the former can't get BTO anymore while the wife left with one chance of getting BTO  so can both of them still eligible to BTO?,btohqsg
Got the unit as in queue number? Haha,btohqsg
Yea the ballot numbers came out le!,btohqsg
Yeap! HAHHA but exceeded by alot üòÇ,btohqsg
Dont think can bto anymore in that case . But too late for them to wait for BTO cus their son 1 year old liao,btohqsg
Thought as long as one is first timer  the 2nd timer still can get BTO,btohqsg
Hello!! anyone got queue no. for Bishan Towers?,btohqsg
Anyone know when the next bro? Is it this month?,btohqsg
Hi i got a hugeee number for the aug bto. If i don't get to select a flat does it count as using up my ballot chance?,btohqsg
Unless you get the letter say you no queue number at all,btohqsg
Ah okay thank you! Also i know that i need to apply for HLE if i get invited to select a flat. What happens if i go down but decide not to choose a flat. As HLE expires after 6mths,btohqsg
If you skip twice  you'll automatically become 2nd timer,btohqsg
And within that year if you skip again for selection exercise  you'll be barred for another year of being a 1st timer,btohqsg
Open Booking of Flats ‚Äì Housing & Development Board (HDB)https://esales.hdb.gov.sg/bp25/launch/open/OPEN_page_6192/home.html,btohqsg
I find OBF is good if only you get to choose brand new condition house,btohqsg
Cannot get queue Aug. Anyone can recommend this balance Flats?,btohqsg
OBF is a rename of reoffer of balance flat,btohqsg
Otherwise  opt for resale as you're allowed to view as many units as you like,btohqsg
Skali after 20% dropouts  you'd be in like queue 170+,btohqsg
üòÇ - so many dropouts expected for amk?,btohqsg
Yea good to keep . I was 181 out of 187 flats . When i go pick my flat that time still got like 80+ units üòä,btohqsg
Because they will screen ur eligibility before u are allowed to choose ur flat . U can expect alot of drop outs cus they fail to meet the eligibility,btohqsg
oh wow thats good to know! what do ppl fail mostly during eligibility?,btohqsg
That im not sure . Maybe income ? Or their desired unit taken up so they dont want the bto anymore,btohqsg
Cus i remember my sist wueue was 320+ out of 187 units . And she was given a timeslot to go down and choose 3 months later,btohqsg
wow - which location was this?,btohqsg
Mine was woodlands so demand wasnt high i guess,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone know when going down to book flat.Does the couple need to go down or can just 1 of the couple will do?,btohqsg
U mean 2 person need to sign ?,btohqsg
Log in to your HDB page and see,btohqsg
What about open booking of flat,btohqsg
I think all is the same. 2 owner=2 people sign .,btohqsg
Unless 1 owner the other is occupant,btohqsg
Anyway 4rm and 5rm same amount of option fee,btohqsg
Previously sent email to hdb to ask about it. They sent me this,btohqsg
Opps . 2nd appointment then need 2 people,btohqsg
Ya. Is the downpayment time need both applicants,btohqsg
So now await for news on the selection date,btohqsg
I mean for those who have ballot for Aug BTO,btohqsg
is it normal for HLE Letter to be generated instantly? thought it takes 2 weeks to be generated,btohqsg
I only know it is up to 4 weeks,btohqsg
If I give up my Q number in open booking flat scheme  will it affect my chances in normal bto application?,btohqsg
queue number in open booking wont affect your first timer chances etc  only waste $10,btohqsg
Any idea how often hdb refreshes the page on flat for open booking?,btohqsg
24x/118 units y‚Äôall think got chance or not ah?,btohqsg
If only your number is below 140,btohqsg
Sigh.. can only hope for high drop out rate I guess  since it‚Äôs CCK. üò¨,btohqsg
So I told her she needs a bit of luck,btohqsg
Eh sorry sala should be multiply by 0.85,btohqsg
So should be 85% allocated to first timers,btohqsg
So 85% of 118 units for FT   100 units.. Divided by 0.8  to be below 125 to have 20% chance of getting a unit but on low floor,btohqsg
why divide by 0.8 haha sorry don't rly get the math,btohqsg
Normally there's 20% dropout for each BTO launch,btohqsg
Unless your number is very good,btohqsg
Or can straightaway multiply by 1.25 after counting the allocated flats (5%/15%85%/95% etc),btohqsg
Anybody gonna ballot november de launch? Jaha,btohqsg
Got any info which new HDB area?,btohqsg
anyone collected their apartments after the covid delays ??,btohqsg
