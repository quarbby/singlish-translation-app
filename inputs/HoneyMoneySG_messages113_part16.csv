I am kind of noob with HSBC ega actually. Probably need to look for the video again.,btohqsg
Or it could earn $7 per month on Maribank at 2.88% p.a.  compared to 10 cents.,btohqsg
But also hard to predict when SQ moving to the next tier if only using one Krisflyer account to buy 2 tickets each time. By the time  I buy the final 2 tickets  the price might increase.,btohqsg
hsbc ega bonus is promo right not perpetual?,btohqsg
Yes so far they have been releasing every month but with different rates.,btohqsg
That why use 2 broswer 2 acct side by side  it is lock in i think when u click to the page of passenger detail for a certain timing,btohqsg

I have tried for booking 7 ticket on xiamen air when max is 6 ticket per booking,btohqsg

Hi all  I have a question on Syfe platform and I'm new to investing. Before investing a large amount  I want to know about the money withdrawal process in Syfe.So  I transferred a small amount to Syfe (like 10 sgd)  bought US stocks and then sold them later. However  when I tried to withdraw the balance  I can't convert my USD balance to SGD and even withdraw anything to bank account.Can I know is there a limit imposed by Syfe when withdrawing money?,btohqsg
You need to convert before withdrawing,btohqsg
Let me try try that. Thanks.,btohqsg
Either you need to convert or thereâ€™s an option for you to select from which currency you want to withdraw,btohqsg

Normally with these promos  do we still get to earn bonus miles e.g. with Citi x Agoda using Citi PremierMiles?Also  these promo can be found on the bank's pages?,btohqsg
Citi SMRT card  supplementary costs $90+. Anyone got waiver for supplementary before?,btohqsg
When u do search for 4 the price show should mean the available seat for the cheapest one available in system right now  so changing to 2/2 should not have alot of difference if do at same time as u check for 4,btohqsg

Dbs wwmc if book online as crmc exclude travel spend (which hotel fall under),btohqsg

Anyone can recommend any other platform for house rentals? Seeking tenants,btohqsg
U say no uob ah but infact uob have some of the few best card,btohqsg
Maybe heâ€™s another one that got his account suspended hence the boycott,btohqsg
Not really. I boycott uob cuz they kept rejecting my cc application hahahha! And i refuse to make an acc with them.,btohqsg
Which card you apply for . They reject,btohqsg
When was the last time you hold uob credit card? Did you terminate it?,btohqsg
"Have you tried searching ""reset month""?",btohqsg

For UOB KF  will you still earn 3 MPD if booking non SIA group (SIA & Scoot) flights such as China Airlines or Air Asia through whitelisted online travel sites like agoda?,btohqsg
I think so too! Hhahahaha never had any acc or cc with them. Again last time i checked they asked me to go to branch but nowadays who has time,btohqsg
I would say its worth the time for the suite of cards they provide,btohqsg
Haha . You can go on sat,btohqsg
Okay guys  u convinced me. I'll reconsider.,btohqsg
Make people clock more and unable to pay,btohqsg
Business perspective wise doesnâ€™t really benefit them. They already have enough user base that they donâ€™t need to invest into making something that was alrd there,btohqsg
Is UOB Evol currently down? Im unable to make payment via shopee app,btohqsg
When you tried to convert  could you see how much USD you had available to convert and if it reflected the correct amount gained from your sold stock?I think i might have a similar issue as you but on tiger. I also sold a US stock recently and wanted to withdraw. Needed to convert from USD to SGD but found that the amount of cash gained from the sold stock was not available even though it was reflected on my portfolio cash balance amount. Read somewhere cos' it is still considered unsettled cash which will need 1-2 working days? Anyone else knows if I'm right? Feel free to correct me on this thanks!,btohqsg

Hi can I check if OCBC 360 is the best current deposit account now? With 4.60% when just salary crediting  incremental balance and credit card spending,btohqsg
Which is the recommended credit card to use along with OCBC 360 account?Preference will be rewards applicable for most daily usage spending and low minimum spending requirements.Open to both miles and cashback,btohqsg
Great  thank you! OCBC rewards card is now very restrictive right? Given that not many MCCs are supported,btohqsg
I did videos on this  can compare herehttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ocbc+honeymoney,btohqsg
It changes merchants quarterly  itâ€™s more like you wonâ€™t know whatâ€™s the next change implemented and youâ€™ll have to change your spending habits to suit it,btohqsg
Thank you both! Any recommendation of high interest savings account that is comparable to OCBC 360? I did some research and OCBC 360 seems like the best currently.,btohqsg
You need to do your own research and comparison  then check which one is best suite you. Different people different profile.Eg. Those without salary or income less than $1600  OCBC is not the best. Those who canâ€™t save $500 every month  OCBC360 may be not in their favourite list.,btohqsg
