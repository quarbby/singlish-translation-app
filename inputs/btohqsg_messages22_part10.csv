Anyone knows of any software to use with the floorplan to plan furniture placement all those? Like in The Sims...,btohqsg
will y'all consider doing this if there is an intention to engage an ID?,btohqsg
Still deciding if wanna hire ID or not. But wanna have some fun planning the layout with more accuracies.,btohqsg
Normally the ID is the PM right? Can hire just purely PM one?,btohqsg
"It depends on how detail and particular you are going into itFor example  the laying of tiles.You may want the odd size to ""hide"" in a corner where furniture partially blocks the view. Thus  the full size is laid from the door  and the odd size is left to the side.Some PMs may just want to get the job done without taking notes and start lying from the side. It ends up being an odd size on the side of the door. Thus  once you step in  you can see the odd size.",btohqsg
My friend house having multiple defects ask ID to settle but keep having issues and say those contactor used to be good don't have so much issues in the pastMaybe due to holiday season work very rush,btohqsg
