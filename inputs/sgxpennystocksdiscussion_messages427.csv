Need tighter control  it's not going to end with Westgate and Jems  hougang and pasir ris block.,btohqsg
Might as well announce a full cb2 at that rate.. 🙈,btohqsg
That will be a discussion for the efficacy of a barely open retail vs a full lockdown,btohqsg
A lot of shops along Clarke quay area and Boat quay area not opened for biz on Friday night.,btohqsg
If cb2 happens. Likely gst increase gonna be soon,btohqsg
Give chicken wing take back chicken,btohqsg
Must replenish the reserves mah. I’d rather start replenishing now after this covid shit is over rather than let the burden to be passed over to my children,btohqsg
Can't even afford one to begin with,btohqsg
Might have to start strikingg a balance between satisfying the present and future needs,btohqsg
i got 2. And it changes the mindset a bit. Like... last time no need to think when betting 5k in sgpool. Now.. need to think think a bit,btohqsg
My guess is 2022 GST increase.. Assuming elections in late 2024/early 2025 (usually elections are called earlier than the 5 yr mark...)  they won't want to raise it so close to election time... Just my 2c,btohqsg
likely lor but also depends how fast we’re done with this covid,btohqsg

Paying back is certain. Its the amount that differs if we take things for granted.,btohqsg
Are they continue to move ard after the swap?,btohqsg
Rem don’t go white sands lo,btohqsg
But I think they have to stay home,btohqsg

CB2 is more costly than CB1 because many economies in the west and china recovering  and have increase orders. CB1 time all no business so close not so costly.,btohqsg
Might as well treat it like a common cold soon,btohqsg
