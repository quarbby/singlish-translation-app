Im sorry but that looks like at most a $50 toy,btohqsg

3km i can do in 10mins,btohqsg
when im pissed or stressed i jun go run,btohqsg

that time i was super pissed,btohqsg
i ran from sembawang all the way till bishan,btohqsg
cos of a useless group mate,btohqsg
that decided to spread rumours that i was the one that never do work,btohqsg
and then even told ppl that i traumatised him,btohqsg
next week is practically free week,btohqsg

i think he probably can catch up to me while i use bicycle,btohqsg
how the fk ppl run so fast,btohqsg
my best 2.4 to date oni 12.19,btohqsg
the last time i checked i did a 2.4 was 22,btohqsg
that was when i was sec 4,btohqsg
not bad considering im quite lazy right now,btohqsg
i like run twice a week or go for swim,btohqsg
wtf coming from mono infantry eh üíÄmy best is 12:21,btohqsg
i could not run  could only jog,btohqsg
so i was mono infantry fit,btohqsg
if i do now is DNA,btohqsg
anything related to running i avoid,btohqsg
more then 500m i just cycle,btohqsg
yep..back in sec school  all i ate was cans of greentea and nuggets,btohqsg

reminds me i also need to get my eye checked,btohqsg
want to see if my 600 degree eye is still 600,btohqsg
or i should say unable to use spectacles,btohqsg
when i was sec 4 i was 69kg,btohqsg
did you check whether your degree increased?,btohqsg
my cousin went from 100 to 150 without specs,btohqsg
my right eye 600  left eye 150,btohqsg
when i do coding..my eye is legit right up the screen,btohqsg
not wearing glasses doesn‚Äôt actually make your eyesight worse,btohqsg
ill try my best to avoid it,btohqsg
oh now i know why i got 600,btohqsg
I got lazy eye condition plus  last time i would put my face right at the screen,btohqsg
yea looking close to things can contribute since you‚Äôre causing the retina ends up growing longer to compensate for the blurred image that‚Äôs close up,btohqsg
when you‚Äôre growing it tends to develop more if you have it,btohqsg
once you‚Äôre an adult it stabilised,btohqsg
cause when i was younger..i kept making specs,btohqsg
my degree has remained stable since i was in jc,btohqsg
but like even outside of myopia,btohqsg
yea like your eye kinda stops growing so make sense,btohqsg
it can‚Äôt get more fucked up,btohqsg
i mean it commonly gets worse with age because your eyes start to lose strength,btohqsg
should i invest stocks in starbucks,btohqsg

How do you feel when bro called you a noob,btohqsg

whoever cares about being called a noob is a noob,btohqsg
your free week has historically not been free,btohqsg
Y1 sem1 is like the breain period  sem2 Is where the real challenge starts,btohqsg
no that‚Äôs not what he means,btohqsg
funny how its u thats saying this,btohqsg
Oh..either way yea I guess it‚Äôs true then,btohqsg
Yea indeed it‚Äôs funny  but I‚Äôm working to improve it but it‚Äôs not easy when my poly got a bell curve,btohqsg
It helps me sometimes like when I get 7/24 for a quiz and get B,btohqsg
Other times I practically design a whole app with around 20+ artboard but get a D because my classmates all decided to do 100+ art boards,btohqsg
Nah it‚Äôs the reality of rp,btohqsg
The poly legit has no structure  grades are given out randomly,btohqsg
wah i cant help u sia,btohqsg
for me my tolerance is shit until i hear loud ass music,btohqsg
then im conditioned to tank 500% more alc,btohqsg
its funny bc they will actually push u to sign,btohqsg
the funny thing is i have friends with 100+ artboards and get the same grade as me,btohqsg
please do. abstinence for 2 weeks pls,btohqsg
i seek  your coorperation with the challenge üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
i have 2 classmates that basically made 20 artboards..then replicated those 20 2 times and changed certain details..one got a D and the other got a B,btohqsg
In rp  these two are used to alter the grades according to the bell curve,btohqsg
if SDL drops to level 3  its a C..right now this grade gives a B,btohqsg
This goes to 3 its a A,btohqsg
i got a 2  so i got a B,btohqsg
yep  because you see if you get a level 3 its a Ayou get a level 4 its still a A,btohqsg
prob my poly..cause friends from other diploma's getting the same kind of grades thrown at them,btohqsg
how r u still explaining sth my 12 year old sis knows,btohqsg
"i asked the teacher  after..that is what he said ""If you do the bare minimum  you will get a D because its the minimum""Me:"" So if i replicate my artboards to produce more content  i should be getting higher than a D right?""Him: yea you should",btohqsg
you know this teacher was a module head for a coding module but he told me he hates coding..,btohqsg
i wonder is everyone around him similar capability,btohqsg
i given this same module teacher  just 6 artboards before and gotten a b,btohqsg
you know this teacher was a module head for a coding module but he told me hates coding,btohqsg
but yea alr trying my best to improve alr,btohqsg
Excuse me  I just joined. Are there any chat rules here?,btohqsg

"Spread the news to any Victorian/VS related chat:Tmr don't forget to cheer ""full day"" in hall after announcement that VS won NSG football cdiv.*especially if you want a school day off.*",btohqsg

Someone burnt a piece of their merc to appease the spirits,btohqsg
Looking for advice  shld I drop pure lit now since my results aren't going up,btohqsg
I dowan take it in jc,btohqsg
whole of sec 3 has it been v poor?,btohqsg
where u also struggle a lot with it,btohqsg
The only a2 i got was bc project,btohqsg
And the feeling and memorable qn is quite hard,btohqsg
And if I can't find time to read the novel this year next year it's gonna get worse with crucible,btohqsg
cuz if the results u consistently getting are not what u want and u really tried ur best but can't improve then might be best to drop it,btohqsg
And I realise I can use my 2 sciences and 2 maths + my hist/ss for the r5,btohqsg
And ny ss/hist is usually good by that I mean As,btohqsg
honestly don't talk to us abt this matter  try talking to your teachers or parents abt this  they know more abt you and your performance  here i only know what u said in chat,btohqsg
But tbh I dont rlly like lit,btohqsg
then why did u take it  at first in sec 2 u liked it? or u seemed to be doing good?,btohqsg
I took it bc I thought I'd improve,btohqsg
And i felt it was a little more interesting than geog,btohqsg
at this rate i think its best u drop pure lit as early as possible  no point in trying so hard to improve when it's q evident that u haven't,btohqsg
but again  talk to ur teachers or parents abt it,btohqsg
Ok  thank you for the inputs  I'll consider with these in mind!,btohqsg
it's good you've found out this issue before sec 4,btohqsg
Bc if I'm spending effort it shld be worth it,btohqsg
And I asked myself do I really want to do it,btohqsg
bro learning H1 econs without even taking it,btohqsg
Just curious is h2 econs worth,btohqsg
what do you define as worth,btohqsg
As in worthwhile to upgrade it to h2,btohqsg
you take h1 first then you see how,btohqsg
u no need h2 econs to earn a decent salary mah,btohqsg
you in NS as an ASA,btohqsg
i mean the h2 vs h1 thing is just are you planning to do anything that might use h2 econs and if not  it's mainly how it affects rp,btohqsg
I can't even get an A in jt,btohqsg
Lit is harder to mug also right,btohqsg
Like how do I even mug lit,btohqsg
you should have asked yourself that before taking it,btohqsg
and this is also why i dropped it,btohqsg
I like my other subj more also,btohqsg
And im now getting interested in math,btohqsg
I act find it getting more fun and fun,btohqsg
i dropped everything in upper sec LOLLL  took the bare minimum,btohqsg
My l1r5 this time jialat bc I got 4/16 for history but that's an anomaly,btohqsg
But like would I be losing out a lot if I drop,btohqsg
Why didn't I take triple science üò≠,btohqsg
become a god at organic chem,btohqsg
Is legal studies in temasek poly worth it,btohqsg
Im going to law school and sue your ass,btohqsg
if u want go top courses,btohqsg
i got sick of making mistakes for org chem and in school in general so i decided to stop making mistakes,btohqsg
Woi he's the smartassguy who flexes so much,btohqsg
this stupid shit needs full marks,btohqsg
Yea why didn't I take trip Sci üò≠,btohqsg
I'm 8 months into sec 3,btohqsg
I top in class for chem bro,btohqsg
I only pick double Sci bc at that point idc + I kinda don't understand electricity but its just minor,btohqsg
Why didn't I realise I was on sinking ship with lit,btohqsg
seems like everyone that drops physics is bc of electricity,btohqsg
he can't h2 physics classical mech,btohqsg
What if in jc I tale BPME,btohqsg
u cant take bio and phys together boi,btohqsg
Bc seeing yall talk abt chem I scared,btohqsg
aiya u finish o level then u think about it,btohqsg
I fucking love organic chem at a levels,btohqsg
Ok so how to appeal to triple,btohqsg
I‚ÄômBeing ping but I can‚Äôt find,btohqsg
Idw be hit up on a ckp,btohqsg
7k salary as an electrician in NS,btohqsg
guys the dimer thing for carboxylic acids is what the dash thing,btohqsg
Worst case scenario I just drop lit,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a Morse code for ‚Äòkys‚Äô,btohqsg
sorry babes i can‚Äôt do chem for u anymore,btohqsg
are they just better hydrogen bonds,btohqsg
Or is it an unknown variable,btohqsg
homelander vibes but instead of superpowers he has autism,btohqsg

One possibility is the cray machine down,btohqsg
that time the department who give licence say either no license  or every single guy in your sqn go for test and get a licence,btohqsg

Can‚Äôt relate but imagine sleeping late,btohqsg
I went thru it trust it‚Äôs fun,btohqsg
My form tchers said that changing to triple science is a chance,btohqsg
triple sci must be an extreme torture,btohqsg
don‚Äôt change unless you can cope w the stress,btohqsg
I honestly don‚Äôt see the point of triple sci,btohqsg
Bio must take if u alr indecisive between the two,btohqsg
It's for people who love science.Usefulness not really there,btohqsg
Bio even easier to learn by yourself,btohqsg
In a near future  triple sci is helpful if you ever intend to do MCAT or BMAT ‚Ä¶ in a slightly further future  if you do a degree in any of the sciences  the three sciences are more integrated than different than you think,btohqsg
bruh I did the other way,btohqsg
dab im over this phase im out,btohqsg
You need JC Physics to understand the heavens (all the outer space stuff)  but most probably don't care about that.,btohqsg
Bio? Look at how much bio knowledge many of us gained from the covid years because of the news,btohqsg
i get to see handsome men like stalin and hitler,btohqsg
It shows your bio knowledge is up,btohqsg
this reminds me of atoms or molecules,btohqsg
