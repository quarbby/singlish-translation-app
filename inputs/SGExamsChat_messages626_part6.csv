like like full force throw lah,btohqsg
sch nowadays üî• üî• üî• üî• üî• üî• üî•,btohqsg
may i hv a summary of wht is happening,btohqsg
imagine if the cher like fooking javelin throw lmao,btohqsg
Josh chose to go poly for freedom of expression  eg growing out his hair. Matcha here was making fun of him for it  and also mentioned him going to NS afterwards where he has to shave it off.,btohqsg
how was i making fun of him lol,btohqsg
Perhaps I can give you the benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
i js made a statement that he wouldnt be able to keep his long hair and express himself through his clothing in ns,btohqsg
how you interpret it is uty lol,btohqsg
The point remains that you do not think him choosing to go to poly because of long hair is a wise choice,btohqsg
do us a favour and not come in with a saviour complex and assume a moral high ground,btohqsg
Wah now putting words into my mouth alr ah,btohqsg
also just last week a brand new cher join sch start of yr threaten to throw hands lol,btohqsg
every1 is so hushhush abt it,btohqsg
that isn't making fun of him having to cut off his hair to become almost bald  that's just stating that he has to shave his hair once he goes to NS  or at least the realisation that he has to,btohqsg
even in sec 1 sum replacement cher come in n when ppl doing tiktok vids or smth he knock the phone n sum other stuff lol,btohqsg
by very weird i mean that its very unusual and unconventional,btohqsg
blossomscan don't be so rude ornot? mutual respect here pls,btohqsg
that's not matcha implying that it's a bad choice that's just what matcha is saying,btohqsg
and statistically speaking it is indeed quite unusual for students to choose an educational path based on whether or not freedom of expression is allowed in the institution itself,btohqsg
"we had to go down to another room  gather us and was like ""blah blah blah do not speak about it outside of sch""",btohqsg
The word weird has a negative connotation,btohqsg
Of course it is. Still we should respect his personal decisions.,btohqsg
"so whenever i say weird it means it's badlike""it's weird we only have NS for 2 years not like 3 or 4 years""",btohqsg
who thinks chicken rice is meh most of the time,btohqsg
so it's bad that NS is only 2 years and not 3 or 4?,btohqsg
u eat 1 uve eaten them all,btohqsg
just because it has a negative connotation doesn't mean it's necessarily bad,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt get why you chose that example because I cannot imagine anyone  save for some ultra patriots saying that,btohqsg
its okkkk  but not smth i wld pick if i in a new area,btohqsg
its always the rice too mushy or smth,btohqsg
Why is blossoms wait what is happening,btohqsg
"I was agreeing with blossoms up until ""weird""",btohqsg
Anyways what's everyone favorite plant from plant vs zombies 2,btohqsg
"oritehow bout""It's weird that the amt of carbohydrates on this particular meal is decreasing constantly""",btohqsg
Like fr what does NS have to do with why one goes to poly or not,btohqsg
ite ce east delights chicken riceüî•üî•üî• is so good omg,btohqsg
I sincerely hope blossoms is not an A levels gp student for the sake of cambridge,btohqsg
when u wadio to when uni start,btohqsg
we were talking about josh so one of josh reason to go poly is because he could grow his hair out and wear what he wantsso i made a statement repeated josh's words and said: when he goes nsso blossoms thinks i am making fun of him and his right to self expression,btohqsg
At the end of the day even though the reason is weird doesn't mean it's not a valid reason imoDiff people diff opinions,btohqsg
Eh I missed out the middle part,btohqsg
Alright  it does not have a negative connotation all the time. My badI said that earlier because I felt it did have a negative connotation in Matcha‚Äôs earlier comment.,btohqsg
I mean we all know when Josh goes ns he's gonna have some sense knocked into him hopefully,btohqsg
this online beef get serious üò≠üôè nobody safe fr,btohqsg
Also don't need say that cuz ur just poking the bear,btohqsg
