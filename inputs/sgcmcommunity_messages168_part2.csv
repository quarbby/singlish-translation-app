Guys  is it true that one needs more than 2 years driving experience in order to get a replacement car?,btohqsg
is it written in the policy?,btohqsg
or is it the workshop say one,btohqsg
replacement car is subjective to availability  and i dun see insurance policy having this requirement,btohqsg
so u can ask the ws go fly kite if its not in ur insurance policy,btohqsg
"it says ""requirement for the insurance of rental cars""",btohqsg
then bopian if his insurance got that clause  but its for him also not for u right,btohqsg
"quote:We cant arrange for a rental car for you as you have less than two years of driving experience. This a requirement for the insurance of rental cars""unquote",btohqsg
They should be able to arrange,btohqsg
And if they cannot arrange rental,btohqsg
i more than one year liao leh,btohqsg
my insurance or the other party,btohqsg
i dunno what insurance he took up,btohqsg
Unless you're claiming your insurance then asking them to claim from him,btohqsg
And if your insurance also never allow then bopian,btohqsg
and he told me they will arrange a replacement car for me within these 2 days,btohqsg
now then tell me i less than 2 years???,btohqsg
Whats ur carplate or his carplate,btohqsg
nothing in my policy says that i need to be 2years and above for rental leh,btohqsg
high beamed me while i stopped and then he still continue to ram,btohqsg
What happens if replacement car also langga,btohqsg
Bruh that one another insurance HAHAH,btohqsg
But see before u take rental car,btohqsg
i checked with my insurance and they said i can get replacement car leh,btohqsg
They will tell u NCD and stuff one,btohqsg
Ws prolly no car thats why give u nonsense,btohqsg
but the issue is i took my car to my own workshop,btohqsg
got leh  say will give me once liability is out,btohqsg
the workshop says their insurance dun allow to let drivers who are less than 2 years driving experience to drive,btohqsg
easy then go to a different workshop,btohqsg
