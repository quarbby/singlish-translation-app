For counters that you decide to hold and keep  the most important factor when you make this consideration to hold or not should be based on the gearing. High geared stocks are very risky. Best is not to hold them. Can trade but do not hold in the bag. If creditors go after  they get suspended and go into judicial management etc.,btohqsg
