Either a bad thing or a good thing like what you facing now,btohqsg
I think should be a good thing? Because I haven't encounter any issues with my delivery yet as of now.,btohqsg
No issues using the app either I think if it's a bad thing most likely they will suspend/ban the account even if I didn't pick up their call?,btohqsg
It is a good thing HAHA,btohqsg
Anyway after getting the bag from them how does the priority works? Still need to bid and wait for 8 seconds?,btohqsg
But the bag priority still doesn't work very well if your rating is low,btohqsg
And your service quality is low also,btohqsg
My rating drop to 4.82 its super hard to pull back or get orders..,btohqsg
That's why when I missed the call I was like what went wrong then I check my recent deliveries so far nothing wrong leh. End up evening they WhatsApp. I was like since we on the road most of the time if nothing urgent could have WhatsApp instead,btohqsg
They will text you if you Don answer,btohqsg
So far no bag but out of 10 jobs I bid mostly cam get 6-7,btohqsg
Or they wouldn't paster you if you inform,btohqsg
I bid 10 jobs only get 3 lol,btohqsg
I very sad one de lei,btohqsg
Mine it says 5. Good. I think it's all along like that since I first joined,btohqsg
Then they can book for car service mah confirm no walker,btohqsg
Or because I niao them lol,btohqsg
But most people will cheap out,btohqsg
Some of them really cheap use courier service but expect car and trolley,btohqsg
I think they still think car drivers can pick up courier jobs now that's why they try their luck,btohqsg
That's why one day I see the order need trolley I take and carry show who's boss lol,btohqsg
For my case I guess nothing to worry about right?,btohqsg
If you late or what they usually sms you de,btohqsg
Anyone with lalamove van not using app anymore can lend account? Got van but no order wasting van usage.,btohqsg
As in late for delivery and pick up?,btohqsg
Those late for delivery  cancellation.. all those,btohqsg
Mine nothing. Only missed the call this afternoon then evening receive WhatsApp to collect bag,btohqsg
I see noted. Since they never mention anything else other than the bag I guess all is good,btohqsg

Tandoori Nights from east coast road is now posting jobs on gogoxRider beware,btohqsg
Hello alls . My account is being banned .,btohqsg
I hate that place. I kena once  I took the order  not even 10 mins later keep calling me asking me to faster send. Like hello?! They think I can teleport is it,btohqsg
They should do by grabfood coz riders no choice  once assignedLlm and other platforms the rider can choose not to do,btohqsg
Those kanna already from tandoori nights won't take the job  so hang there long timeGogox very few food job  rider maybe dunno,btohqsg
Ya and the orders are usually roo or grab orders that no rider wanna take. Because they will be out of zone if they take. From tandoori nights usually the drop off locations are quite a distance.,btohqsg
You got cancel orders again or no uh?,btohqsg
That's when either llm or gogox comes into rescue,btohqsg
