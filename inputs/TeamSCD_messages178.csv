custom keyboards when u buy switches,btohqsg
cause most of the time factory lube is trash,btohqsg
it affects how it feels and the sound abhit,btohqsg

depending on waht type of switches u get,btohqsg

MW is always full of bees#mclaren#720s#carswithoutlimits#carsunlimited#carsovereverything#cars247#supercar#cssgcrew#exoticcars#supercardaily700https://www.instagram.com/p/ClhQ15NBjHy/?igshid=NjcyZGVjMzk=,btohqsg
i'd like to believe still have,btohqsg
"Got companies who want to continue supporting ""legacy"" cars while everything is electrified",btohqsg
Porsche being one of them because they want to keep their older cars on the roads as well,btohqsg
i still believe EVs will flop,btohqsg
and too fast for the road,btohqsg
We still don't have a performance EV actually,btohqsg
eventually when 1 starts bowling down other vehicles  people will start to say things,btohqsg
I'm keen to see the new 718 EV coming end of this year,btohqsg
in the long run dt evs will flop bc sustainability..,btohqsg
Battery tech needs to go a long way for it to be sustainable,btohqsg
And sources of energy for the electricity also,btohqsg
There are other ways to be sustainable,btohqsg
but if they can come up with renewable source of fuel,btohqsg
But it's political lobbying that's pushing EVs for the next few years,btohqsg
And something else will come up,btohqsg
A new agenda is always required by politicians,btohqsg
And you dont want every vehicle on the road to be 2 tonnes going 0 to 100 in 3s,btohqsg
Someone eventually will be saying  something one,btohqsg
This would be interesting because they're placing the batteries in the middle of the car where the engine is,btohqsg
that will be when people start dying,btohqsg
And they're not going for range maximization by adding more and more battery,btohqsg
But going for 800v charging to charge faster,btohqsg
Hot nt gd for batt.. cold nt gd for batt.. wlwlwlbbql,btohqsg
I just dont think it's gonna work out in the long run la,btohqsg
EVs will hit a wall when the first batch currently running shed their batteries‚Ä¶ all at once,btohqsg
There is a reason we dont use nuclear cars,btohqsg
Even though it potentially could let u run a car 20 years without any further input,btohqsg
but also see the reactor how small,btohqsg
But if nuclear powered cars  disposing of the car is another issue,btohqsg
This is what i meant. I was equating it to the rechargeable batteries in modern EVs,btohqsg
just go with those artificial fuel,btohqsg
Yeahh  i think hydrogen fuel is better than EV,btohqsg
What do you want me to do with this,btohqsg
cause i wan use as wallpaper,btohqsg
but like got the tiktok shit,btohqsg
The roadblock is safe minituarization and efficiency,btohqsg
Well  pretty much what was said already,btohqsg
Its not going to be a chernobyl  because of the size,btohqsg
Most of the space would be shielding and cooling actually,btohqsg
I think the secret is in minimizing the amount of fissile material carried.,btohqsg
I mean u compare our old batteries to modern ones,btohqsg
Be it chemical or mechanical solutions we managed to make power systems smaller and smaller,btohqsg
or i u talking about nuclear power,btohqsg
if its nuclear power u dont even need to think about ti loo,btohqsg
what if u get into an accident,btohqsg
The kind of explosion u see from nuclear bombs and the damage that will come from reactor failure is different,btohqsg
Probably moot since nobody is researching it anyway,btohqsg
Eh also need make sure ur car goes into speedhunter news,btohqsg
like just the safety in general,btohqsg
I mean. Lithium batteries moving at road speeds SHOULD be scary to people. I dont understand why its not,btohqsg
And people have seen lithium batteries short and burn before  thanks to samsung,btohqsg
Now we wait for the environmental damage for the lithium mining  processing and battery manufacturing to be ‚Äúexposed‚Äù,btohqsg
Anyone have any PDI to recommend at SSDC? 3A,btohqsg
idk lol and tbh uts not that eco friendly either,btohqsg
like how u gonna mine the lithium?,btohqsg
that also like destroys tons of land and eco systems,btohqsg
Welcome to job recruitment center lol hahah,btohqsg
knn fucking cannot read need pay,btohqsg
Its alw the same fucking bus,btohqsg
a tan like me i like,btohqsg
Then you better next time steady like@roincec,btohqsg

This one supposed to be girl do one,btohqsg
all em horny guys in my dms think i girl,btohqsg
they dont even ask my gender bro,btohqsg
dont use social media boss man,btohqsg
who drives a sport car here,btohqsg
hahaha what do u consider a sport car  more than 120hp or one with spoiler,btohqsg
Obviously u need to be coe cat B to even talk,btohqsg
1.3L NA cat A coe shall take a break  u can discuss with the admin who drive Audi TT,btohqsg
I think everyone have different idea of sports car  to some. As long as it‚Äôs 2 door  sporty. It is one.To some  they only take exotic cars as sports cars,btohqsg
As long as the car can play basketball  or football  that one is a sport car,btohqsg
That article nonsense la if you ask me  your financials allows  you get whatever car you wish. Simple as that.,btohqsg
Owning a sports car is more towards if your wallet is thick enough  not your dick,btohqsg
might have mistaken this chat for instagram bruh,btohqsg
His liddat one  leave it lol,btohqsg
I still find that those drive big SUVs are the ones with small pp,btohqsg
Your composure sibeh out tbh. Framing rabak.,btohqsg
just from the way they like to bully smaller cars on the road,btohqsg
it's the same reason why women love SUVs,btohqsg
give them a false sense of security. Which small pp dudes need,btohqsg
Cos i titi tio bully till sian alr,btohqsg
I high beam them only see license plate,btohqsg
nvm u invite them to sepang,btohqsg
i invite them go sepang i scared they roll over nia,btohqsg
i saw cupra formentor that time,btohqsg
got a few fast SUVs la,btohqsg
lose liao ur car small can hide,btohqsg
i also wont buy suv but once awhile sit in it.. the comfort is.. song haha,btohqsg
Thanks for the honest opinions. Appreciate itBenson üõπ@RecRab,btohqsg
thank u boss. grateful for people like u who appreciate the works of the  car community :),btohqsg
You're welcomed with the honest opinion. Try working on your framing. 1/3 rule is a good place to start with.,btohqsg

Come take mine... It's sitting in a carpark doing nothing,btohqsg
I nvr did anything last year for cny. Bc covid pos,btohqsg
Cos the car suspension knn hard,btohqsg
bad idea to hang a katana high up,btohqsg
and you wanna put it above a sofa  last thing you want is when you sit there and it drops on your head,btohqsg
In any case mounting katana high is weird. Its not a deer head,btohqsg
Typically u do something like that ^,btohqsg
I just dont really recommend something heavy above where u sit or sleep,btohqsg
I have the metal ones from caesars. Zenitsu's and tanjiro's katana,btohqsg
They're heavy  but not as heavy as a real full tang katana,btohqsg
the timezone got a katana store,btohqsg
I got my karambit there also  I quite like their knife,btohqsg
That's mine..Can display it this way..Safer,btohqsg
you now resting on the blade,btohqsg
It's upwards position liao ..see the tip,btohqsg
Your handle on the right side also means you're constantly on guard  cos you can easily draw with your right hand. (unless you're left handed),btohqsg
the dull part is on the stand,btohqsg
i wanted to get shinobu's also  cos i like the bladeless look,btohqsg
but no la hahaha i dont like the butterfly tsuba,btohqsg
I think i'm just a geek LOL,btohqsg
that time when i was crazily playing ghost of tsushima,btohqsg
i wanted to buy his katana,btohqsg
life is short. learn/do what you like,btohqsg
If anyone loves samurais and shit,btohqsg
this game is a must play,btohqsg
Only when we were teenagers we think about what others think,btohqsg
Now whatever i buy/do got ppl wanna comment  ‚Äúoh u dont like it ah. Dont do lor‚Äù,btohqsg
"""limpei got money to do what i want  not your problem""",btohqsg
clicking purchase now on next mod,btohqsg
Will we hear stutututu from ur car next,btohqsg
No but really  ghost of tsushima is a must play for samurai fans.,btohqsg
Looks like charwin opening a fujiwara tofu shop in sg btw,btohqsg
this 1 too small to hear,btohqsg
Yes thats what i was implying to u,btohqsg
and hope it is a nice place tohang,btohqsg
ghost of tsushima is on steam,btohqsg
@roincecI zhnged the steamdeck... My 64gb is now 512gb,btohqsg
change to turkish account on steam,btohqsg
Or rather 460gb... The numbers always lie,btohqsg
Already learnt how to pirate games,btohqsg
I commented one thing: i hope got solid parking,btohqsg
8 screws and the top plate comes off. But the clips a bit fiddily,btohqsg
roi need to comment hope got washroom nearby,btohqsg
After that 3 screws for the shielding,btohqsg
If he open those shophouses with only parallel parking  GG,btohqsg
but it looks nothing like the tofushop,btohqsg
Unplug battery and you can remove the ssd,btohqsg
rather than the one in KL,btohqsg
If they open at those 5 foot way to look like the OG  we no need park there liao,btohqsg
Nice but cannot park  no point,btohqsg
The hardest part for me was really getting the case to unclip itself,btohqsg
Now even switchaxe can do it,btohqsg
Also very samurai ish  u get both poleaxe and sword,btohqsg
I think i know where it is,btohqsg
I liddat see  he definitely have the space to make it look like the house in initial d. But at a very high cost of course,btohqsg
so can't blame him for not being able to do it,btohqsg
Oh no there is very little parking,btohqsg
there's plenty of 7-11 with parallel lots in front,btohqsg
The rain is a paid actor,btohqsg
the next one is go tuas,btohqsg
find those final fantasy 7 industrial look,btohqsg
But this is still one of the best bg i ever taken,btohqsg
Even till today road closed they will still bring the bikes in,btohqsg
The last time i went to see  they built a kerb alr,btohqsg
bikes can probably still make way inside,btohqsg
When i went to take photo  there was no kerb  only the red white barriers,btohqsg
then i just moved it and drove in LOL,btohqsg
then weeks later they build a kerb and put plants there alr,btohqsg
During the light 2 night festival  they opened that road for the cricket club cars to access,btohqsg
Also for our set up they had to open it... But expensive don't know why,btohqsg
If ur that one rare my cameron is SSR,btohqsg
Cannot relate  i only go for servicing,btohqsg
Rx-8 kun tries to sympathise with your reliability issues  BUT CANNOT RELATE,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know here still opened or not. Was there over the weekend.,btohqsg
THIS IS WHERE I WANTED TO GO THAT NIGHT THEN WE END UP GO GRANDSTAND,btohqsg
Pardon the dark contrast  the street didn't have lights except for the shops,btohqsg
Lol. Can try if still open to public car access,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong they are closed,btohqsg
But humans are allowed to walk still,btohqsg
Ns square is at floating platform,btohqsg
That road is enter from after the platform,btohqsg
If before means u going via loading unloading,btohqsg
Normally public access is after  near the makan place,btohqsg
I found this. Looks like Marc n I,btohqsg
He‚Äôs still driving it. Stays near you too,btohqsg
But now no long with Castrol,btohqsg
I know near me got red and matte blue,btohqsg
Yeah. He rarely drives so you don‚Äôt really see him out also,btohqsg
Yup. Saw them a coupleOf times too. Our area. Hahah,btohqsg
Small business only boss .. hope all of y‚Äôall will come hangout and enjoy with your buddies! More to come! üôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg

Most importantly is the taohuey must nice!,btohqsg
I cfm eat till my man boobs become D Cup,btohqsg
You can go apply work there since your car already on point,btohqsg
Isaac will visit often i imagine,btohqsg
Brz still in workshop. I‚Äôm itching so badly,btohqsg
Can be expecting lots of car enthusiasts and spotters there too.Can tell my wife I going Geylang for another reason now,btohqsg

Is200 2.0 turboIs250 2.5NAis300 2.5L turbo,btohqsg
Isf not easy to find in sg.,btohqsg
