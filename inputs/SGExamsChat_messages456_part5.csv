My next week is stacked sia cc3 debate  cc5 presentation  phy mid terms  bde mid terms and lab report submission,btohqsg
I dont need A+ can help me get B+?:'),btohqsg
got cc2 writing service aso anot,btohqsg
Ayo cc2 is quite chillz ngl,btohqsg
I took 2 days just to write a 500 words assignment for cc1,btohqsg
Good luck to me for the op-ed,btohqsg
I kinda wanna anyhow zam but,btohqsg
At the same time write decent enough to get at least B+,btohqsg
I shall learn from the best,btohqsg
glhf to all y'all taking a lvl results,btohqsg
Isnt that the stupid useless descriptive writing mod that waste time,btohqsg
The whole ICC is basically described by your last 3 words,btohqsg
Never thought id need to visit descriptive writing again after O levels,btohqsg
Ye but at least for the others I can follow the rubrics,btohqsg
So far I did cc3 and cc5,btohqsg
Worst still is I have a class every friday for cc1,btohqsg
And its the only class that day,btohqsg
So Im dragging myself to sch every friday just for cc1,btohqsg
That used to be cc2 for me last sem,btohqsg
That means almost half the cohort got 90rp,btohqsg
afaik vj standard has been dropping over the years,btohqsg
rj hc op moe nerf pls,btohqsg
Fk man my heart gonna literally explode,btohqsg
Lol the whole point of icc is to make u interdiscplinary but I feel the classes are very fluffy,btohqsg
No news means it‚Äôs good news right?,btohqsg
Apparently icc mods pull up the average gpa,btohqsg
U cs? Too bad bozo wlc back to gp which is 2 au btw,btohqsg
Whats the point of that if they just go through a lot of things at the surface level though,btohqsg
It pulls down ppl who can score higher,btohqsg
And even if they go through more indept  it will eat more time away from the core mods,btohqsg
Cum lord to no cum lord,btohqsg
wah jp median same as vj,btohqsg
It pulls up lower performers and pulls down top performers,btohqsg
Technically ICC (cc3 and cc5) pulled me up,btohqsg
Even tho I would argue I did well last sem,btohqsg
wah jpjc median higher than asr??,btohqsg
But cc1 will be my first B-,btohqsg
