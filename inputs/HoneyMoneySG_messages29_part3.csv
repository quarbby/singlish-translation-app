everything via Amaze is online. But MCC not changed. For Amaze+citi rewards mc  will get 4mpd so long MCC not excluded.,btohqsg
What you can do is imagine Amaze is pretending to be a online store or APP version of the merchant you are shopping. The best way I can explain this is you can go mcdonald and order via the kiosk or counter that is offline or contactless payment. But you also can order via Mcdonald app and that is online payment. Amaze makes everything merchant into a APP. Hope this is easier to understand.,btohqsg
They invest heavily in China market too,btohqsg
they invest into every single thing possible but they are quite diversifed,btohqsg
You can PayNow to yourself or transfer the money between your accounts 5 times,btohqsg
I donâ€™t like too diversified  so I withdraw 1000 every month from OA to invest in US index fund,btohqsg
Anyone know any other option better than endowus for this ?,btohqsg

Invest in index is a form of diversification,btohqsg
US index is diversified but not the most diversified. You want the most diversification  go for MSCI World index funds,btohqsg
I mean I want to focus on us market   Temasek invest in sg china which I donâ€™t like,btohqsg
Sg is good for stable dividend but very slow   china got CCP,btohqsg
For OA funds  using Endowus is the best option for investing in US market (Lion Global Infinity US 500). For SRS  you have the option of S27 on SGX. Cash  can consider Irish-domiciled S&P 500 ETFs like VUSD or CSPX.The advantage of using Irish-domiciled funds is that the dividend tax is lower (15% instead of 30%),btohqsg
Not considering SRS because I want to keep my cash for other purposes,btohqsg
Is it possible to invest in individual stocks and options using OA like a regular broker account?,btohqsg
