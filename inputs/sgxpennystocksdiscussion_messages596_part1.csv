📮Pika World Market’s Insight🪜📹AMC: Money is an issue💿The CEO of the movie theatre chain spoke about plans to refinance some of the debts in 2022  if possible. The move aims to help bring down interest expenses and extend some debts maturities.Indeed  the move is essential as it had taken up debts at a high interest during 2020 and 2021 at the height of the pandemic to stay afloat. Ultimately  this will strengthen its balance sheet given a $1.7 billion of current liabilities and a $5.5 billion of corporate borrowings as of 30 Sept. Long term liabilities were more worrying at $12 billion.It seems that AMC could move to repay some of its high-interest debt  but analysts are less optimistic that it will lower its balance sheet massively. Given a less conducive monetary condition  Pika World has reduced exposure to the company.🚖Lucid: A bull from Citi🕹The company has received a bullish outlook from Citigroup with a buy rating of $57.However  we are sure that analysts can't seem to agree on its valuation as the range is pretty huge  from $16 to $57 per share.At the upper end of the $57 per share  one would value Lucid $100 billion. The rosy prospects are built on the idea that its vehicle has a long-range charging performance coupled with in-house self-driving features.🎙TSMC: A gem as always⏳It has been a while since Pika World discuss semiconductors. A striking clue of the sector's allure is the robust performance of TSMC performance on Monday. There's seem to be a few reasons for the bullish performance. Nonetheless  TSMC has always been seen as a proxy for many stocks such as Apple  its biggest customer  and AMD. These stocks have been performing tremendously well.The semiconductor is a sector in which Pika World is exploring entry opportunities.🧯Growth stocks hit hard💸Nasdaq ended the session sharply lower while Dow hit a new high as potential rate hikes hit growth stocks momentum. Nonetheless  there are encouraging signs that supply chains woes are lightening which may help to reduce the cost increases for operations and thus lesser price increase for consumers.This will bode well for a weaker inflation and hopefully the Fed would not need to that aggressive in raising interest rates. We will bring you more details on the latest economic data.We hope you have a profitable journey thus far and Pika World wishes you a moonatic week!,btohqsg
We are seeing good momentum on our favourites  Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) and is exploring to increase exposure. Cheers  Pika Nat.,btohqsg
