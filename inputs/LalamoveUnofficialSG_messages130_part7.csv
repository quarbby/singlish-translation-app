Can cash out next day is accumulated more than $200,btohqsg
Haha immediate next day reach bank account meh?,btohqsg
Henderson go yishun then drop all nearby. No jam,btohqsg
Who else got do uParcel before? Can share?,btohqsg
Even in the rain no jam meh today?,btohqsg
Prices norm not high I think. That's what I heard/saw last time lahðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Nothing much to share la just that you don't really interact with humans lol but not so time pressure as LLM,btohqsg
Again I think more suitable for bikes,btohqsg
N u have to stack if u want to make it worthwhile,btohqsg
But I nvr do b4  all these is again what I hearðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yeah can stack and must stack,btohqsg
"Depends on order  got sender throw like one cake at me before for delivery lol. And they state ""no bikers please"" in order.",btohqsg
The problem is even with less time pressure you still end up at about $10 to $15 per hour lol,btohqsg
Interesting la haha seen many ppl join uparcel then left. Or should I say not work for uparcel jobs,btohqsg
For me I multi app and part time only so can slowly wait for payout and accumulate credits to cashout,btohqsg
How to earn more? Rent a van? I cannot see Van orders,btohqsg
Llm car orders cannot make it,btohqsg
U see the llm car order. One pick one drop  $10 plus only and so far,btohqsg
Many food orders from oddle. Everytime go kana wait. Parking also cannot cover,btohqsg
Sorry man no idea gotta ask around,btohqsg
But take note Uparcel takes 20% comm.. so what u see is before comm,btohqsg
Do more than 200jobs commission is 18%,btohqsg
Yes correct but that is 200 jobs for 2 weeks not monthly,btohqsg
Car how to fit shopping cart. Siao one leh,btohqsg
If one day one batch  can hit,btohqsg
All done for the uparcel batch,btohqsg
Thank you for anyone advice. Any other platforms can get good jobs?,btohqsg
Uparcel not everyday have batch order so not easy.. either must take the $7 job plus other batch job..,btohqsg
Grab food car order good price hard to come and only meal times,btohqsg
Car not good for delivery nowdays,btohqsg
Got my car jan 2020 then do llm,btohqsg
Sorry if I sound very negative,btohqsg
Uparcel maybe look attractive to you  but that's cos llm fare is bad now. Previously uparcel fare is regarded as cuiðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I think now better off using car for phv rather than delivery. Delivery demand has dropped  ridership demand now better,btohqsg
yeah right now customer know how to abuse u ya,btohqsg
U have to change according to how the environment changes,btohqsg
All these is referring to car horðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Cos I dunno how bike or van or lorry mkt is,btohqsg
As long as using car for delivery alr not worth haha,btohqsg
My car going scrapped liao so now trying out if can get van later,btohqsg
Use TADA or Ryde is best from what I heard,btohqsg
after 20% commission how much only,btohqsg
so many places they cluster tgther,btohqsg
those doing since last time know not worth it ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U divide by per location u only get $7 to $8 per drop.. do llm per drop is more if single order,btohqsg
Basically too many drivers liao. Quite a sizeable number of pple kena retrench recent mths,btohqsg
Not surprised if many doing delivery/phv,btohqsg
But I do the llm order only one drop each time. Distance so far. I saw the hamper delivery on llm $6 and need to do all over the place. After finish still need to return to serangoon to give invoices. How to do?,btohqsg
I saw an ad on pickupp and went to sign up. Sibei jialat,btohqsg
$3-4 also have. Bus fare also not enough,btohqsg
