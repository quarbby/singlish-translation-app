My sleep schedule is fucked up since Uni,btohqsg
Used to think hey 8am class not bad,btohqsg
As long as you come in at the critical period,btohqsg
Like say from 10am to 3pm,btohqsg
Now I wanna murder my prof if he schedules a 9:30 class,btohqsg
They don't care what time you come in,btohqsg
You can start at like 5am and end at 3pm and they don't care,btohqsg
Its very surprising that Japan is more flexible in this aspect though,btohqsg
SG we really like the rule book,btohqsg
Japan is way way more rule book than Singapore,btohqsg
But even Japan can also be flexible,btohqsg
So when you look at such stuff  you go ???,btohqsg
Almost all the offices in Japan are open office concepts,btohqsg
Which ngl I actually like it,btohqsg
does anyone know what does the sentinel cyber programme entails,btohqsg
I think SG is actually open ngl at least the office jobs I had.,btohqsg
I was actually really shock when I saw the statistics before I went to Japan for work,btohqsg
Allows you to pack more too had one whereby it was a hot desk thing,btohqsg
Open office concept means there are no seemingly private cubicles,btohqsg
Like how employees in Singapore work longer than in Japan,btohqsg
I will throw the philosophical question do we even have free will?,btohqsg
I had seen offices whereby it was designed around the idea of a panopticon,btohqsg
Its only bad when you have a micromanager in front of you,btohqsg
And I feel that having the cubicle is more claustrophobic,btohqsg
That one u become director than can,btohqsg
Oh and our office is free seating de,btohqsg
So you can choose your seating as long as it is available,btohqsg
You don't like the colleague  you can choose to sit somewhere far from him,btohqsg
But errr u sit there in the same spot for as long as you are employed rite,btohqsg
Oh... so it's legit like hot desking,btohqsg
Actually I do change my seating place sometimes,btohqsg
Sometimes I want to see the nice view from my office,btohqsg
But then everyday u gotta choose a different view..,btohqsg
My office is actually at 49F,btohqsg
I come into work first thing is I go get coffee and sit down it's like instinct one,btohqsg
So I can see the northern Japan,btohqsg
My first instinct is to get hot water,btohqsg
I mean I sit at the different side so...,btohqsg
Can we see you instead? üò∂‚Äçüå´,btohqsg
No matter where you sit you can't see the Fuji anyway,btohqsg
Do U ship stuff to sg,btohqsg
I know you all want to buy stuff lol,btohqsg
cuz sometimes iw to buy stuff from mercari,btohqsg
Actually it depends on what you buy,btohqsg
Like I can only ship stuff that are non lithium batteries,btohqsg
So if you ask me to buy iphones and ship to here then of course not,btohqsg
And I know where to find actually,btohqsg
Kuro should i cut my nails,btohqsg
