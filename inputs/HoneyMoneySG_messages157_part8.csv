Is it worth to use Citi Rewards card for my overseas online transactions for the 4mpd? Understand there is some fees for foreign ccy  but is it still worth the 4mpd? Or am I better off with 1.6% Cashback? I spend at least $3k on overseas online transactions every month. What other cards do you reccomend? My transactions are not under Shopping category.,btohqsg
Ok but Citi rewards card max $1k a month. What other cards can I use?,btohqsg
If myr idr can consider maybank fnf  otherwise personally I jz use trust cb card,btohqsg

Buying.. but itâ€™s not the bottom yet,btohqsg
Is USD. I use trust cc but now they want to suspend my card cos Im self employed lol,btohqsg
I recently ownself triggered early payment on atome and got the bonus for naked CRMC.,btohqsg
I use Choco debit for 2mpd max $1kCiti rewards and amaze for 4mpd max $1kTrust cc or Citi Cashback plus for cashback $rest of it,btohqsg
They specifically said they suspending the card because you are self-employed?,btohqsg
Based upon your latest income details submitted to Trust  you do not meet the minimum income criteria to qualify for an unsecured credit card.Idk where they get my income details from. Maybe my cpf,btohqsg
This was when you applying for the card or you already have the card?,btohqsg
I apply the card 1 year ago and has been using it no problem. When I applied  I had a full time job. Only few months ago I change to self employed. I didn't submit new income details nor declare I'm self employed,btohqsg
If I remember correctly  Trust checks credit every month. So not sure what other checks they can do.,btohqsg
I pay my credit card on time also... My Citibank and Maybank cc got approved while I'm self employed. So idkk... Now looking for alternativesPerhaps my spending of few k every month and not full time employed triggered their system,btohqsg
Omg first time I hear a cc company will conduct active credit checks while already using the card,btohqsg
Is fine they don't want me as their customer.... Lol....,btohqsg
For UOB privi miles  which should you choose? visa  master or AMEX?,btohqsg
If you download your CBS report  you can see Trust constantly checks for your credit. Should be automated process  if not they won't be so free to keep checking.,btohqsg
Hi. Does anyone use the DCS plat card? Read some reviews and they all say the customer service is bad  any experience?,btohqsg
Cos that's the only Cashback card that I own that gives me Cashback at the moment (for my online transactions in SGD but overseas platform). I know is only 1.6%   better than nothing when I already exhausted my Citi rewards and choco debitWhat other eligible cards do you reccomend?,btohqsg
They were new back then. They need to be more conservative and ensure the portfolio remains healthy. Monitor red flags more closelyBefore finding out too late that the portfolio turning bad and have to close the CC business.So nothing crazy about checking monthly.,btohqsg
CS is bad but it gives the highest cashback for hawker food so bopian,btohqsg

The service is bad when it come to following up my request to terminate card. It took me a few months,btohqsg
A 3.25% FCY transaction fee applies to all foreign currency transactions.So 4mpd minus FCY fee is still worth it right vs 1.5% Cashback with no FCY fee? I don't know how to calculate the effective Cashback...,btohqsg
Ic. The cashback is good  tracker is clear  cashback is also credited right after month end. Really canâ€™t ask for anything better,btohqsg
Until you need to talk to CSO. I guess is by luck one.,btohqsg

When i make payment for via the web for food purchase through apple pay with my citi rewards  is it considered contactless or online? If i key my card details instead  would it be considered online?,btohqsg
Link your cc to EGA giro for 1%,btohqsg
Transactions using with Apple Pay is excluded. Key details on website is online.,btohqsg
via in-app applepay  excluded from 4mpd  at most get 0.4mpd. Key card details likely online  but depends how it is processed.,btohqsg

Hi guys  if a merchant allows Kris pay  and I am planning to use UOB privi miles to pay just to clock my welcome offer spent.I will just be able to claim whatever perks the Kris pay miles to dollar right? No issue with that?,btohqsg
Krispay Miles rewarded can only be used to offset spending at a Kris+ merchant at a ratio of 150 KPM to $1. The extra KPM 'earned' via the bonus earnrate at Kris+ merchants can be transferred to Krisflyer though.,btohqsg
1.5% cashback without FCY is ofc the best  but the question is you are no longer a Trust Cashback cardholder  then it boils down to are you in the miles accumulating game or value cashback more?,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone experience withdrawing money from IBKR to DBS? Is there surely a 10 SGD charge by bank?,btohqsg
