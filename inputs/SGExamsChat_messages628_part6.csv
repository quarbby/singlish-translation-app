if youâ€™re planning to go to sec 5 your end goal is to become the best,btohqsg
because the competition is much more fierce,btohqsg
latest i start was like around mye ah,btohqsg
but that is the last time syllabus idk about now,btohqsg
think of n levels as world war 1  while o levels is world war 2,btohqsg
i havenâ€™t learn cold war yet,btohqsg
i went from sec 5 to poly,btohqsg
but i donâ€™t rmb if ww1 or ww2 got more casualties,btohqsg
i think quite normal ah but yeah,btohqsg
ok but salute for going jc,btohqsg
usually sec 5 you might as well aim for JC,btohqsg
Ngl when I was sec 1 NA   I thought I couldn't go JC so I went exp,btohqsg
people go sec 5 usually is those wanna go poly but dw do ite,btohqsg
then when I was in exp   I only found out then went like eh fk lah too fast pace,btohqsg
oh sec 5NA can actly go jc,btohqsg
but if you canâ€™t qualify for pfp or dpp for n levels,btohqsg
what makes you think youâ€™ll make it to poly for o levels,btohqsg
depend on your subj combi also,btohqsg
some say take coursework will burn u,btohqsg
ur whole first half of the year is gonna spend on doing dnt and art all that,btohqsg
ik a friend who couldnâ€™t make it to PFP but qualified for dpp,btohqsg
but when she went to sec 5,btohqsg
she could only make it to ite,btohqsg
and depend on your sch also ah,btohqsg
so it was a decision that she regretted,btohqsg
some sch give good teacher to sec 5,btohqsg
so if you canâ€™t qualify for pfp,btohqsg
sec 5 is a huge risk,btohqsg
hais everyone say this but i alr in sec 5,btohqsg
in general sec 5 is a huge risk,btohqsg
are you risking something for something greater,btohqsg
are u the one in sec 4 now?,btohqsg
