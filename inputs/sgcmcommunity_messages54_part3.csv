Seats higher  feels like they can see more. Reality they all still use blind spot and parking mirrors despite their height advantage.,btohqsg
Now I know why he lowered,btohqsg
Lowered culture😆 Mazda CX5 ABIT too low😄,btohqsg
Actually what is there to see lol and if it is a lorry or another suv infront also nothing to see,btohqsg
"SUV's got popular because they felt safer but the gas mileage sucked and people wanted ""carlike"" rides from their truck-based SUV's. Enter the car-platform based crossover.Now they have their higher sitting vehicle that gets decent mileage  rides like a car  and isn't a minivan. Bada bing bada boom  every mom wants one  and that takes us to where we are todaAlso.. think about it Minivans exist but nobody wants to be caught dead in one  so they started buying SUV's.",btohqsg
They all just want a truck/van that is not a truck/van and does not drive like a truck/van.,btohqsg
Probably not a popular opinion  but I quite like the lexus ux200 looks,btohqsg
Now Toyota has Corolla Cross Hybrid .SUV with good FC,btohqsg
Women feel more secure somehow being high and being able to see further in front,btohqsg
that is provided the car in front of you is shorter haha,btohqsg
yes corolla cross  better than yaris cross. Yaris the hatchback is good  but not the suv. passenger roof too low,btohqsg
or is it they wanted to be seen😛,btohqsg
Pax with car sicknesses need to seat in car with large window and windscreen.My wife has car sicknesses. She felt giddy in Vellfire/Alphard during test drive. Seat too high.Very comfortable on Honda Freed. Due to larger windscreen and side window. 👍😅 happy wife  happy life & safer drive 😂,btohqsg
Depends  my wife likes low cars  sedans especially 😁,btohqsg
suv is outdated  drive a bus is better,btohqsg
you are lucky ... save half the price😛,btohqsg
Saw once and was amazed by the size,btohqsg
Malay with big family will opt for vellfire,btohqsg
freed is a very practical car in sg context,btohqsg
4235mm long very easy to park😂👍,btohqsg
Walking over to see carnival now,btohqsg
Yuppp  hence the proposal to base the category more on performance and less on body style,btohqsg
The 3RS is a great car and the 992 3RS will definitely be amazing on track  but with the Singaporean context  I don't think there is any use of having a 3RS because it is incredibly track focussed. Makes more sense if you live in Europe or North America and have access to multiple different tracks and track days,btohqsg
And Porsche products tend to be easier to get on track as well as they don't break the sound limitations either unlike the Huracan STO which can't go on most tracks or can only last a lap before it gets kicked off,btohqsg
For the sake of convenience  I would class them as luxury SUVs but in reality they are classed as sports SUVs/super SUVs,btohqsg
Yes  this is what@FatFingers15and I meant!,btohqsg
"Everything classed as body style first  more performance oriented variants classed as ""performance car""",btohqsg
but... i tot its wrong to class people according to their... body type,btohqsg
Mr Xun  we are classifying cars eh,btohqsg
but yes i think coupe cab crossover suv is a good way to filter,btohqsg
wld be good if can use hp to filter to,btohqsg
Wanted to see  but old Kia showroom at ubi no more,btohqsg
i went to see that day when i saw the cerato,btohqsg
idk how ppl drive tht in sg,btohqsg
Yuppp  and there needs to be a split in SUV classifications as well like there is for sedans,btohqsg
But if u check the spec… the size isn’t really as big as what we visual,btohqsg
it's  just a matter of getting used to the dimension.. but I still prefer normal size car as daily driver . less chance to Kena scratch😂,btohqsg
Big car  when u drive  ppl tends to give more space,btohqsg
dun Kena those ah Beng driver😂,btohqsg
I always thought odyssey is very huge,btohqsg
The carnival shrinks around you more than an alphard and odyssey when you are driving,btohqsg
But comparing the spec size  my car is bigger,btohqsg
I know that the carnival is bigger than the odyssey,btohqsg
That’s why I want to view carnival,btohqsg
5.1m long and weight more than 2 ton😅 think is diesel engine same as Kia Sorento diese lShag.,btohqsg
Should've  bought s2k when it was 20k depre 😆,btohqsg
Make sure u get the correct numbers… otherwise later  u will say should have bought these numbers.. ,btohqsg
I think migrate faster. can buy lambo immediately,btohqsg
hearsay Dubai car n petrol dirt cheap,btohqsg
their country dun tax on car imports or very low,btohqsg
