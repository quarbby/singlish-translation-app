Oh no.. din know they calculate SA in investment portfolio too  unless the portfolio goes to zero? 😂,btohqsg
First year cfm non-waiveable  at least that's what I see in DBS website.Second year onwards can if you manage to spend at least $60k in the previous year.But you'll forfeit the renewal bonus.,btohqsg
Not sure if there are any cards that give more than 80k miles sign up bonus now for the other banks? The only other card I have is amex plat charge so can't get the bonus from amex anymore.,btohqsg
Sorry but which utility can pay using SC smart card?,btohqsg
Can use smart card. Just get minuscule points lor like as good as not using lol.Utilities use UOB One or OCBC 365 get higher cashback (3-4%). But all got minimum spend. Otherwise use Amex TCB to get 1.5%,btohqsg
I see! For evol  must it be recurring?,btohqsg
