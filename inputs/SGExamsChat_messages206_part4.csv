bcs i scared one of my factors not correct,btohqsg
i can only think 2 points related to that ah,btohqsg
like land use reg & tsunami monitoring,btohqsg
i wrote land use regulation  infrastructure  preparedness  then warning system ,btohqsg
tbh i cant think of any preparedness & infrastructure example,btohqsg
land use got the seawall oso,btohqsg
mb not accepted thats why i wrote it,btohqsg
i rmb the seawalls stuff can be built to deal w tsunamis,btohqsg
i put land use to build in low risk area and also areas higher than sea level,btohqsg
reduce potential ppl impacted by tsunami,btohqsg
like japan 2011 right they use seawalls,btohqsg
iirc i only rmb it being related to earthquake,btohqsg
so geog if u can memorize then shld be fine for h2 right,btohqsg

didn't they say that the times w most solar activity corresponded to the highest annual temps,btohqsg
i was so sad they say its prep measures,btohqsg
coz i saw long term then i was like ok lemme write long term,btohqsg
iirc sunspots cause more solar radiation to be produced,btohqsg
so it compensates the loss of heat,btohqsg
