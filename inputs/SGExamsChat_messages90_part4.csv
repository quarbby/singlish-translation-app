Oof I was wondering why there‚Äôs 2 John,btohqsg
I thought this was the study group and someone needed help,btohqsg
Wait guys can y‚Äôall help me solve a p5 qn üò≠,btohqsg
Probably just something they need memorise,btohqsg
For any two relatively prime integers x and y  the largest integer that cannot be formed as a linear combination (ie ax+by) is equal to xy-x-y,btohqsg
It's called the Chicken McNugget Problem,btohqsg
Damn  why does p5 math require frobenius problem,btohqsg
My brother is way out of my league üôÑ,btohqsg
Yeah üòî when a p5 is smarter than his Sec 4 sister,btohqsg
Isnt it just prime or composite,btohqsg
No common prime factors between the two numbers,btohqsg
Ie 9 and 16 are relatively prime,btohqsg
Cause they don't share a prime factor,btohqsg
6 and 15 share a common prime factor of 3 so they're not relatively prime,btohqsg
Wait is it the coprime thing,btohqsg
Relatively prime means the number is just a little prime,btohqsg
Isnt it if both have the common factor of 1,btohqsg
Like that's the only cf that they can have,btohqsg
If they only have a common factor of 1,btohqsg
yeah coprime implies gcd of 1,btohqsg
What's gcd? My maths is crap,btohqsg
But gcd is easier to say,btohqsg
Time to invest in Œ≤-glycosidic hydolysing enzyme,btohqsg
Maybe I should have taken bio,btohqsg

Did u just call me an ‚Äúit‚Äù,btohqsg
I am but a humble smiley in a carpark,btohqsg
An disembodied smiley face lying on the road,btohqsg
Waiting to be trampled by humans and machines alike,btohqsg
A disembodied smiley face lying on the road,btohqsg
Yeet today I get to walk alone üé∂,btohqsg
You guys have no idea how satisfying it is to finally get some alone time,btohqsg
why do you not have alone time,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt leave me tf alone,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have my own room lol,btohqsg
Imagine any sort of attraction to anything other than maths,btohqsg
Yall just need to open your eyes,btohqsg
Nothing happens when i open my eyes,btohqsg
If maths is cancer then why does cancer alliterate with Chem,btohqsg
Not if i have anything to say about it,btohqsg
Why is physics much more cancerous than maths and chem combined,btohqsg
