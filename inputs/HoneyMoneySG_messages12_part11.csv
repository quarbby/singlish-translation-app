I‚Äôm temporarily using grab + Amex now after this Revolut campaign is over :‚ÄùD I‚Äôm considering to get the SC smart card for public transport because it has no min spend requirement‚Ä¶ but the 6% Cashback is so sad compared to Revolut 20% Cashback :‚ÄùD and SC might nerf it again next year because this 6% Cashback is just a ‚Äúpromo‚Äù till end of this year,btohqsg
mid oct once grab is nerfed,btohqsg
Anybody know how to transfer Russian GDR/ADRs out from IBKR to which broker that still accepts them and trade?,btohqsg
6% sounds sad but transportation cost is not a lot I guess compared to other categories,btohqsg
Any I know is it Revolut is not only Mastercard network? I just applied one virtual card and it is VISA network.,btohqsg
"DBS wwmc : ""Up to 10X DBS Points¬†(or 20 miles) per S$5 spent on online and overseas purchases """,btohqsg
Does that mean oversea offline purchase ( swipe card at restaurant/ hotel in foreign currency) also can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Yeap  my standard Revolut card is visa  there are another two virtual Revolut cards with visa and Mastercard each,btohqsg
"no  overseas offline only 3x points  1.2mpd. Note the ""up to""",btohqsg
It seems like most to all the premium cards are aimed at miles. Any idea if there‚Äôs any cashback card at the premium catagory?,btohqsg
If you have high spending  then this video is for youhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGQgWbj-JZY,btohqsg
