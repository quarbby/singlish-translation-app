baby formula  while expensive  isn't the biggest cost,btohqsg
Actually maybe their diapers? Their healthcare?,btohqsg
nah. If they don't need me to continue to provide for them when they grow up  that's sufficient for me,btohqsg
When I was a child I got sick all the time,btohqsg
Diapers are like average 40 cents per piece  cheaper when younger and more expensive when older,btohqsg
Unless u were to have a baby born magically with a strong immune system,btohqsg
milk powder about $60+ for a large tin  finish in about a month,btohqsg
if u were to calculate  average 5 diapers a day  it is probably $120 monthly for a kid,btohqsg
so milk powder and diapers are not the main costs,btohqsg
But then healthcare it is subsidised by the govt? And also insurance?,btohqsg
So roughly how much? Do u know?,btohqsg
eg kenna hfmd  and hospitalised. That would be $5k for a week stay,btohqsg
cuz of that  need get insurance. Hospital + accident plan almost $1+k annually,btohqsg
I got life insurance for my kids  pay for 5 years upfront. That's $4+ k annually,btohqsg
I seen some parents opt out of child care?,btohqsg
most expensive. Before subsidy  cheapest near to $800 monthly,btohqsg
U need to educate me more man,btohqsg
Assuming you only let him go kindergarten only so no childcare. I think that can save a bit of money,btohqsg
depends on income  low income can bring down to $200+ monthly,btohqsg
Trust me  go later  learn later  bring more problems in the future,btohqsg
I think good range is anyth 5k and above/parent,btohqsg
it's not about learning content  it's about peer interaction,btohqsg
The fact that we basically created needs for ourselves is funny.A couple of decades ago  going to childcare would be unheard of.,btohqsg
For me a comfortable income is the complete ability to afford necessities at a certain quality while being able to afford small luxuries such as holiday,btohqsg
Then again it's funny that people in the past have better social skills than the generation now right?,btohqsg
those are the basic expenses only,btohqsg
that time sg hasn't developed it,btohqsg
it was because the focus was developing p sch,btohqsg
last time all the p sch have morning and afternoon sessions,btohqsg
Like when only the rich send their kids there,btohqsg
Now we are facing aging population,btohqsg
and last time dual income was not popular,btohqsg
We are working more on average? To enjoy the same amount of time on average?,btohqsg
my parents time  5 rm bto was 80k,btohqsg
Wish we could turn back time,btohqsg
Tbh rn we enjoy alot of shit older gen dont get,btohqsg
turn back time can  go Malaysia ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
Sure we enjoy them... But .... Their causing us problems on another level?,btohqsg
Each gen has each gens issues,btohqsg
Like u guys may say we have the internet and stuff.,btohqsg
Every generation hv their own problems to solve,btohqsg
But... It's like the internet is causing alot of problems for us? So pros and cons,btohqsg
old uncle here says every generation has their own opportunities.,btohqsg
The funny thing is that it's impossible to solve all of them. So the best we can do is to make do,btohqsg
Not old uncle but i agree,btohqsg
U shldnt put urself in the position to solve all our generations issues,btohqsg
Solve a problem  ie create gaming chairs  u can buy GCB,btohqsg
All u need to ensure is that u secure a good life for urself,btohqsg
But rather solve it on an individual level,btohqsg
Like example... U go into your life realising you have anxiety when calling because you mostly text and you are introverted?,btohqsg
