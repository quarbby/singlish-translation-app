Oh right apologies  he graduated from a military academy in Hiroshima,btohqsg
He basically caused the downfall of his own school,btohqsg
Ever thought both was related? It was a military target..,btohqsg
irony would be the general writing a paper on atomic science that gets used to make the bomb,btohqsg
Technically the general was learning skills on defending his country in Hiroshima but what he was taught was ineffective enough which led to Hiroshima getting bombedThat's a stretch tho,btohqsg
when an action creates the opposite effect than expected  we have irony. In this sense the action did not create the intended effect  but did not reverse it either.A clearer case would be the stuff he learnt from hiroshima academy speeding up the use of the atomic bomb. Ineffective training as you said would be a greyer case indeed,btohqsg
That's basically what I'm going for  if he was born in Hiroshima. That would be a coincidence,btohqsg
fair point  I see where you're going with it,btohqsg

When they preface it by saying not trying to be u know damn well they are about to say the most paradoxically moronic shit ever,btohqsg
I bet his psle score is how much ice Milo cost,btohqsg
With inflation these days that might be a complement,btohqsg
Probably his PSLE score is the price of a postage stamp,btohqsg
