If I phrased it as a metaphor I could be sued for defamation,btohqsg
No one knows the identity of John Smith,btohqsg
Can't sue a person if you don't know who he is,btohqsg
I swear this would’ve been useful material for a module that just concluded,btohqsg
It’s titled: Living and Dying in the Internet Age,btohqsg
Now I don’t know if he’s doing this for profit or because it’s fun,btohqsg
What in the world did I just see,btohqsg
The true colours of a busy student,btohqsg
so basically satire is an excuse to smear shit all over my face  spit on all your shoes and push people into marina bay for literally no reason whatsoever,btohqsg
last time i heard that line some blond guy walked into a japanese suicide forest,btohqsg
Honestly  no point trying to engage him,btohqsg
we alr do but sure idm,btohqsg
He means he does zoom pt with his section,btohqsg
Maybe you should change your privacy settings so that others can't add you to groups randomly,btohqsg
He's got a lot of time,btohqsg
Yup probably sad and unemployed and earning -10k,btohqsg
so busy he's spending his time in the best way possible,btohqsg
i feel attacked by this statement,btohqsg
and running dozens of telegram groups,btohqsg
Found the man behind busy student,btohqsg
alright i'll fess up it's me,btohqsg

They aren't testing every migrant worker,btohqsg
Cause if one person is from a dorm with like a 90% infection rate you that same person has symptoms,btohqsg
They won't bother testing him but just throw them into the isolation facility,btohqsg
And they don't count it in the numbers,btohqsg
thats actually the strategy in sweden,btohqsg
they are banking on the herd immunity strategy,btohqsg
scientists there actually calculate the estimated amount of people to get infected before it stops spreading,btohqsg
Basically get everyone immune to it asap right,btohqsg
so life is still per normal there,btohqsg
i think it’s good tho  cause reduce the chances of re-infection especially if you want to open up the economy asap,btohqsg
its like one of those kill 1 person to save the rest dilemmas,btohqsg

That’s assuming ppl get immunity though,btohqsg
Wasn’t there cases where ppl got reinfected,btohqsg
yeap herd immunity for covid-19 is still a theory because there is no evidence for it. people do in fact get re-infected  but i think there is definitely higher resistance against it. sweden is at the forefront of this strategy so we will know whether it works or not in the coming few months,btohqsg
if it doesnt then everyone there gets a participation medal  if it does then they may be on a path to economic recovery much faster than other nations,btohqsg
Lmao PW result over email and phone call.Phone rings: HalloTeacher: Your PW result is ...You can’t tell your teacher “Wait 5min! I need mental preparation”Email: Project Work ResultsEmail Provider: That’s spam.,btohqsg

Is NTU English as in the language English or English literature,btohqsg
I suppose I need to prepare this during the interview,btohqsg
I feel like GP is more applicable to benchmark for PPGA than English tbh,btohqsg
