you see shenzhen all the manufacturing companies the amount of shit they spew into the air,btohqsg
yes cars are a problem but fucking look at those huge ass plants in china,btohqsg
i still think the funniest part of sg is they're more than happy to promote motorsports when it makes them a fat stack of cash,btohqsg
thats a fuck ton of carbon emissions,btohqsg
meanwhile the car enthusiasts like us are subject to constant bullying,btohqsg
the raffles marina thing also LTA waiting outside,btohqsg
exactly. they support certain people when they go overseas and rep sg. but when they do ass they close both eyes,btohqsg
whoever ordered that needs to be shot,btohqsg
there's absolutely nothing fucking wrong with having a car enthusiast scene in singapore,btohqsg
honestly speaking i dislike where our culture is headed. at least the main pricks.,btohqsg
absolutely nothing wrong with new aftermarket exhausts that still comply with emission regulations,btohqsg
too many people are into pops and bangs  absolute nuisances,btohqsg
idk why pop and bang tunes are that popular,btohqsg
i mean on one hand yes your 4 banger now makes some noise,btohqsg
on the other hand who cares,btohqsg
i genuinely have zero clue why they think it sounds good,btohqsg
cars are not about your brand new spanking pop and bang tune,btohqsg
it will sound good without annoying everyone and getting the police to come chase you,btohqsg
as a VTEC enthusiast i am shooting myself in the foot  but holy fuck your pops and bangs sound like hot fucking garbage and it hurts the ears,btohqsg
i suppose maybe the pops and bangs attract kids so that it can fuel the owners ego.,btohqsg
the cars that deserve to be looked at and admired are the ones that are well done up,btohqsg
not the ones that make the most noise,btohqsg
indeed. that's why i started that ig page,btohqsg
all the pages nowadays just shows supercars and shit,btohqsg
let your car draw attention witout making noise,btohqsg
i'd rather put the limelight on neat builds and understated stuff than OMG WIDEBODY SUPERKAR ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯,btohqsg
that being said if i can get my hands on a cherry qq,btohqsg
I'll make that thing pop and bang because that would genuinely be fucking hilarious,btohqsg
honestly  i respect alot of owner that bring their seemingly normal cars to c&k,btohqsg
like the MPS6  and the Manufaktur specced E63S estate a year back.,btohqsg
imagine this thing popping and banging it's fucking hilarious,btohqsg
if you do it i will salute you,btohqsg
i don't get the hype around the hypercars,btohqsg
they're like 20 mil and whatnot,btohqsg
but to me it's hypercar lor  insanely crafted and stuff but i can't appreciate them as much as a 40+ year old survivor,btohqsg
i think hypercars are genuinely some of the coolest things right now,btohqsg
the amount of engineering work that goes into crafting one is amazing,btohqsg
they are amazing dont get me wrong. the technology and r&d is wild,btohqsg
and tbh they're beautiful pieces of art,btohqsg
i nut to molded carbon sry,btohqsg
yet i feel that i'm more drawn to a black plate 30+ year old car that's in great condition,btohqsg
and they sound really nice and make ridiculous power,btohqsg
hypercars are peak engineering  old cars are peak stupid,btohqsg
i'd nut over a Zonda and stuff,btohqsg
but probably not as much for a Senna etc,btohqsg
i suppose the local culture has changed for the worse,btohqsg
i wouldn't call the change worse la tbf,btohqsg
people will tsk you if you accidentally block their shot at c&k  some would push and run to catch up with a super/hypercar that would park up,btohqsg
plus people will always have their own taste,btohqsg
oh lmfao which reminds me my friend told me someone asked him to move his DC5R so they could take a pic of an AE86,btohqsg
