remind me of the time my fucking unit teammate become ckw and while on mc  proceeds to moonlight and do grabfood delivery without permission. then another guy just ord. so me  just one person  have to support all safti events that i had to ot on most days  with a few days stretching from early morning to late night,btohqsg
then someone saw him doing grabfood in woodlands while on mc  kenna caught. fella manages to ord in time without superiors doing anyth and partly cos the superiors are unwilling to bring it up to unit co as the superiors will ‚Äúlose face‚Äù,btohqsg
also  that guy alr has rso restriction. so u know what the fella do? every week go all the way to hospital just to rso,btohqsg
at least bmt u ckw u r not really affecting anyone. u go unit and ckw then other ppl have to do ur work,btohqsg
have to help this person cover duty also. last min suddenly say want to rso then i about to leave camp then suddenly have to cover this person‚Äôs duty,btohqsg
my unit also have but superiors dont really care. dont care until like 1/4 of ppl have more than 100 days of mc in a year lol,btohqsg
only in extreme cases like a person really rso until mc cover literally every day then they will restrict rso,btohqsg
then in my unit  i heard every few years they try to implement new rules on things like rso frequency and lateness  but a month later they will just forget that the rules ever existed  then cycle repeats. if intro new rules but never enforce then intro for fuck lol,btohqsg
yeah. idk how ppl find money to mc every day lol,btohqsg
oh. if ur family got cook just stay home and eat lo,btohqsg
there was one guy in my unit which rso every day and they waited 6 months bef issuing rso restriction,btohqsg
asa complied his mcs into a list as a proof for rso restriction  some of his mcs are literally gotten from online consultations at 3am,btohqsg
then every time go different clinic  probably to avoid raising suspicions with each clinic,btohqsg
bro probably knows all clinic locations in jurong by heart,btohqsg
meanwhile saf mo  covid period  sore throat but u got neg test? 2 day ld,btohqsg
do yall think ss or hist harder,btohqsg
i think both same same tbh,btohqsg
is social studies or history harder  o levels,btohqsg
In terms of skill wise   there's some overlaps so I find that that's when SS/hist students have an upper hand,btohqsg
I mean at first no shit you'll get confused if you're new to the subj combi,btohqsg
overtime when you get used to it  the differences stand out more and that's when u can use it to your advantage,btohqsg
it's not like that for SS/geog,btohqsg
i just wish my humans less of a gamble lmao,btohqsg
first is i can never expect if its an A1 or B4  and on top of that must see the other test do how then can know ur grade pein,btohqsg
real gamble is you go out during mc and your friend post a photo of you outside on his ig story,btohqsg
normally im quite thickskin but for my ss/hist cher more hesitent lol,btohqsg
Like don't send them shit at 2am then expect them reply,btohqsg
