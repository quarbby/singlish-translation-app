omg i js saw the timetable fr j1,btohqsg
is it true we only got dec hols ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
No. December is merely a month with no school but has CCA  just so that you can study hard to catch up with what you were weak at throughout J1.It's only a break if you are doing very well  and even then  it's not worth so.But icing on the cake is that this is probably the 2nd last December in your life to work hard as a student. In uni  probably only final year project then u need to work through Dec (not all projects).When you go to work  December is just another month. Until you have kids going to school.,btohqsg
