but im surprised mr lim yan hock allowed them to advance tho,btohqsg
but tbh they are just doing themself no good,btohqsg
U damn high chance retain alrd,btohqsg
some people apparently got to advance (means never meet promotion criteria but they close eye),btohqsg
idk if is it coz merger and they dw to keep people also,btohqsg
then i think if u still retain  u can appeal to principal,btohqsg
there are people who auto advance right? like dunnid to see principal,btohqsg
Bro kena called by year head or smth abt the fact he kena advance,btohqsg
