I kena once b4. My alternator was dead after going through modding at a workshop. So sat night itself I drove it to my workshop. All the components that runs on electricity all started to give up along the way including steering.Jump start a few time along the way  the engine just can't stop stalling at traffic stops. Last one when reverse parking at workshop then end up no batt  had to run to the nearby bangala hostel to borrow power point to recharge my jump start kit.,btohqsg
Alternator dead it's call tow truck already,btohqsg
Was thinking of saving money for the tow. End up I just went ahead and drove it to the workshop.,btohqsg
Best not to drive if car got issues,btohqsg
I did that for a flat tyre  bicycle pump until look like can drive 10mins and I just went,btohqsg
The steering did lock during the drive. Slowly one by one things start to shut down. Eps  abs everything.Even the dashboard also stopped working. Lastly is the engine  when you step pedal like how many days you never eat.,btohqsg
Now I suspect my starter is about to go too.,btohqsg
