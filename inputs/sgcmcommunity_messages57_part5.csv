If you don't see it  its not damaged-R,btohqsg
How damaged can it be? Not like the rocks will crack the exhaust,btohqsg
i mean.... thats my opinion la,btohqsg
Not gonna see the undercarriage that much anyway,btohqsg
I might sound entitled but its like if you break a stick and glue it back  it will never be the same,btohqsg

For me interior condition is a key factor. Cannot buy car with bad interior condition,btohqsg
im sorry i cannot have ppl jump on my seats and scratch the plastics and leather,btohqsg
Apart from powertrain and suspension being in good condition,btohqsg
Wear and tear on these can be fixed as well,btohqsg
and the steering wheel cannot be worn until shiny,btohqsg
Seats and interior trims hard to fix,btohqsg
Cut to  your dogs doing that,btohqsg
ALSO  those show unit are on 8 hours a day without driving  whoch means its bad for the battery,btohqsg
more excuses for you to change steering wheel tho-R,btohqsg

but the markup COE incurs on to it makes it not worth at all,btohqsg
oh! they gave a new battery for me btw. haha,btohqsg
oh ya  you are a wagon kind of guy-R,btohqsg
Management units on higher models of the brand are good shouts too,btohqsg
Mine was also a showroom unit before it turned into their limousine.,btohqsg
They tend to be given to higher management usually and are never loaners,btohqsg
I thought the PA limos are only A6 or A8s,btohqsg
