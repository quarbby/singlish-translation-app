Where u headed to in your career sia,btohqsg
Bankers has incomparable exits in finance only,btohqsg
Have coffee chat once this is over haha,btohqsg
"Someone said in reddit ""Fin is insanely competitive. Heard around that  some ppl are willing to intern without pay at some small investment firms.""",btohqsg
did u accept or did u not ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ,btohqsg
With or without pay it's very hard to get,btohqsg
I cold emailed 1k plus plus ppl btw,btohqsg
My initial plan considering the appeal fails,btohqsg
Then can see the email format,btohqsg
Then search for names on LinkedIn and email accordingly,btohqsg
I still think sellside is invaluable,btohqsg
Buyside deals are smaller and as analyst u are doing nothing important,btohqsg
Then again u get more deal exp,btohqsg
And in interviews deal exp and the ability to bs about company profitability is priceless,btohqsg
This is for assoc interview in PE,btohqsg
PE doesn't really have structured training and extended networks,btohqsg
Maybe go sellside for half a year and recruit buyside,btohqsg
Eh not from what I hear,btohqsg
I've spoken to over 2 dozen ppl in BB and eb,btohqsg
It's just not directly relevant to buyside acumen,btohqsg
But the modelling exp is there,btohqsg
This can be found in MBB btw,btohqsg
UK and US banks recruit u on the assumption that u know nothing about modelling,btohqsg
SG banks are different I know,btohqsg
If can follow through an entire deal then confirm will have modelling exp,btohqsg
Nonetheless it's enuf to know what deals are going on and form an educated view,btohqsg
PE do more real shit and earn more and more stable,btohqsg
Better hours is very important lol,btohqsg
Not surprising to have 10k applicants for 1 pos,btohqsg
Eh u mean outsource to levfin in banks har,btohqsg
Most junior bankers dunno shit about unit economics,btohqsg
And the senior bankers are those who can't make it to pe,btohqsg
Sales is nothing to laugh at also,btohqsg
MD in PE also do sales,btohqsg
Entire biz of PE is in sales also,btohqsg
Sama sama in finance best resource u have is ur network,btohqsg
So sales is an essential skill,btohqsg
Sales and RS very related ma,btohqsg
Just that u are selling urself and ur cred in rs,btohqsg
Hahaha finally someone knows what shit I'm going through now,btohqsg
I never read much on recent deals btw sadz,btohqsg
See lv know it's l Chatterton le,btohqsg
No la I meant the recruiting,btohqsg
Think school helped a lot in PE recruiting,btohqsg
But not alot in IB recruiting,btohqsg
UK ib take ppl from not so elite school more than those from elite ones,btohqsg
Can't say not elite but can't say sibei elite,btohqsg
To ppl ox and cam has no diff,btohqsg
Eh to me only elite schools are hahvud Stanford and mit,btohqsg
My exp in school seems to support my point to a good extent also,btohqsg
