Even those you did not get,btohqsg
@zoellxregarding our discussion a few weeks ago. Not sure if you had clarified with HDB yet  but if you have not  this is the black and white that it has been reset,btohqsg
For privacy I will re-forward without names,btohqsg
Means there is no 2 ballot chance?,btohqsg
There is. What the screenshot is referring to is the additional ballot chances that people could accumulate from having unsuccessful applications,btohqsg
Last time if you applied for non mature estate and you had 2 previous unsuccessful ballots in non mature estates  on your 3rd try you would get 3 ballot chances instead of 2.Eg applied forTengahThen hougangThen punggolAll 3 are non mature so when you apply for punggol and if tengah and hougang were unsuccessful  for punggol application you have 3 ballot chances,btohqsg
Now  since there's no mature non-mature classification  the criteria is standardSo from Oct 2024  if you applied for standard estate and you had 2 previous unsuccessful ballots in standard estates estates  on your 3rd try you would get 3 ballot chances instead of 2,btohqsg
The question a few weeks ago was  if you applied for non mature last time and was unsuccessful 2x or more and this time you applied for standard  would you get the extra ballot chance for this one?And the answer is no. They ignore all past unsuccessful applications and start you back at the normal number of ballot chances. Which is 2 if you're 1st timer,btohqsg
Hmm...so of my June ballot was unsuccessful  I should have 2 ballot chances for Oct ballot?,btohqsg
No  if you‚Äôre unsuccessful for Oct and Feb and they are standard  and you apply for June standard  you will get 1 extra ballot chance,btohqsg
Still confusing. I applied SBF in Feb and BTO in June. Both were unsuccessful. How many ballot chances I have for Oct BTO?,btohqsg
Mine didn't mention any abt ballot chances,btohqsg
I didn't take any priority scheme,btohqsg
You're single? 1.Whatever you applied for before Oct 2024 doesn't matter for extra ballot chances.,btohqsg
Yes single. No more to scroll down,btohqsg
That's why I wonder why I don't see 1 ballot chance in the box,btohqsg
Yeah kinda strange that you don't see a section for # of ballot chances...,btohqsg
Wonder if any other singles can share if they see the same thing or if they can see ballot chances,btohqsg
If you want@allanyjjyou can try to call HDB to confirm # of ballot chances that they give you,btohqsg
But my understanding is it will be 1 for you for this application,btohqsg
Single too and similarly it doesn‚Äôt state the ballot chances at that page,btohqsg
I'm not sure if it's new but others (couples?) Shared screenshots of their page and there was a section on ballot chances,btohqsg
Any idea why mine only 2 not 3?,btohqsg
Ah I see. So probably that section is for those applying as a couple,btohqsg
If anyone does call HDB to clarify on all this  do update us!,btohqsg
Nope. Same for me. No section indicating my ballot chances. Applied 3rd time then get my appt and number. The prev 2 didn‚Äôt get at all. Oversub,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.Just want to be clear that the extra ballot thing wont apply unless you meet specific criteria + won't apply until at least Jun 2025 launch.Specific criteria being:- you had 2 previous unsuccessful ballots in standard estates- you apply for standard estate,btohqsg
Separately  wondering if the extra ballot chance will apply to singles since there isnt a section for ballot chances for singles...,btohqsg
Welcome. No idea really how the ballot chances work for singles. But yeah if you don‚Äôt succeed  try and try again I suppose? My 3rd time I went down with appt no. But only 3 units left! All the ones I wanted bo liao‚Ä¶. So took me some time to decide to proceed anot. HDB Officer then say ok you have to decide. If you don‚Äôt want to select now  we give it to the next one and you can apply for another BTO once released‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ üò¨,btohqsg
Hence got place also doesn‚Äôt mean you confirm will get a unit. Pray hard. And good luck! ü§ûüèº,btohqsg
You can reject if left 10 units and less . They won't ban you for non  selection,btohqsg
Errrr but I dowan reject liao. 4th time means have to wait another 4-5 years‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
So not so much the ban or no ban,btohqsg
Yup. Not bad unit really. Tho it isn‚Äôt the unit I initially wanted. Was Lucky.Got the keys Nov 2022. Woodlands üôÇ,btohqsg
My appt to select flat supposed to be tmr. However the last 20 units were sold within 3 working days  after hdb contact me with the appt date and time. So now I can only wait for Oct Q result,btohqsg
Exactly! Hahaha. Hence is good lah now got more chances for singles. And Central Area!!! Damn Swee leh those who get this in the upcoming one,btohqsg
Depends on building time of ur project. Like for example the bukit batok brickville building time abt 2 years only. But very popular. 50/130 2R allocated to singles and application rate is 36.2. I feel that it is a trap ü§£,btohqsg
To move at 40  let's say max 5 years building time   at 35 you need to secure a unit alreadyAfter 35   it is possible after 40 then can move. As maybe not every BTO launch you will ballot,btohqsg
If you not keen on the projects,btohqsg
Yet this group of single applicants did not cancel and change to taman jurong on the last day of ballot,btohqsg
1224/130. Single application rate 36.2. Last day of ballot they still persistent and did not cancel,btohqsg
Tbh 130 units flat mix 2R is very little,btohqsg
So there's no point to risk it mainly for the 2 years building time,btohqsg
That's why I say the 2R flexi is a trap for BB brickville .,btohqsg
Singles who did not cancel their applications for BB brickville  i really salute them. They are very persistent. Also have to thank them for not changing to taman jurong thus result in taman 2R low rate = less competition,btohqsg
Trapped by the 24 months waiting time,btohqsg
Guys do you know if October results out alrdy?,btohqsg
Hopefully next week will have news,btohqsg
When are we getting the Q number for the October 2024 BTO Launch? Has anyone who applied got it? I am still waiting in Taman Jurong Skyline.,btohqsg
ChatGpt :Based on past patterns  the results for the October 2024 BTO could be released around18‚Äì20 December 2024. HDB usually announces results on weekdays  soThursday  19 December 2024  is a reasonable estimate. However  it could vary slightly depending on processing times.Keep checking HDB‚Äôs official portal or your registered email/SMS for the exact announcement.,btohqsg
Oh wow let‚Äôs see if chatgpt predictions are any good,btohqsg
Wow~ Similar to waiting for PSLE and GCE results,btohqsg
They're all looking at the flip opportunity. My relatives all wanted BB too  because near ACS etc,btohqsg
Maybe not ACS but i remember them saying it's near a good school,btohqsg
By end of dec. Man its nerve wrecking waiting for it,btohqsg
I rmb the previous launches  some people experienced missing profile  shortly later  result is released. Not sure if it still applies for this launch,btohqsg
Yes but I meant  the moment got missing profile  usually a few days later results is released,btohqsg
But I agree using missing profile to determine if you got ballot number is unreliable,btohqsg
I think maybe system loading or something so got missing profile üòÇ,btohqsg
This week is week 6 alr haha,btohqsg
I am hoping it will be next week,btohqsg
Let's see if anyone spotted about missing profile,btohqsg

Feb 23 so special  the results out so fast and at 10am haha,btohqsg
From an applicant who wrote in to HDB regarding results release,btohqsg
Hi all  it's 3rd or 4th week of Dec.,btohqsg

Hello! Anyone here applying for the next Feb 2025 BTO?We are a bit confused here cos our HFE expires in Jan‚Äô25.The deadline to submit documents for Feb‚Äô25 is 15 Dec‚Äô24. In this case  do we need to cancel/ reapply a HFE letter  while we wait for the Oct BTO results? ü§î,btohqsg
Yes pls apply for a new HFE.  While waiting for it  ur current HFE is still valid,btohqsg
why is it that for this round the deadline to submit is 15 december instead of 15 jan,btohqsg
Xmas and cny  maybe understaff coz alot are on leave so need more time to clear the documents,btohqsg
Hope they won't delay the appointment for selection,btohqsg
Have anyone in Canberra vista TOP ?,btohqsg
Some blks already got pple move in.,btohqsg
"Hi  when the result is out  we click this ""VIEW APPLICATION DETAIL"" then can see the queue number?",btohqsg
Hi is there any west brickville group...üòÜ,btohqsg
Even before the Oct results come out? If apply now  would it affect the current application?,btohqsg
It will not affect. Ur current HFE is still valid,btohqsg
Hello and good afternoon Is there any Taman Jurong Skyline group chat?,btohqsg
Q result should be out anytime this 2 weeks. As after that is Christmas,btohqsg
Yes I think so also. Hopefully next week. Before Xmas,btohqsg
I saw HDB got maintainence on 15 Dec,btohqsg
What you mean so late? Should be by this 2 weeks,btohqsg
Yes. Highly unlikely to be this week too,btohqsg
15 Dec is Sunday maybe not affected,btohqsg
Your earlier msg mention as after xmas,btohqsg
I mean by this 2 weeks. As after that is Christmas,btohqsg
He meant  result will be out by this 2 weeks. Else is Christmas afterwards already haha - so prolly unlikely to have result release then as everyone on leave or break (my opinion),btohqsg
And also usually I wait 6 weeks,btohqsg
This time seems rlly long and draggy....,btohqsg
Ya standard is abt 2 months after application end,btohqsg
Haha ya... Just that usually they release within 6 weeks - 7 weeks,btohqsg
I'm guessing alot staff on leave,btohqsg
I also 3rd try... applied THC  HV and this time Marsiling. How about you guys?,btohqsg
Lol please. Ai known to make things up even if untrue,btohqsg
Whr was this information even sourced from sia hahha,btohqsg
Idw keep my hopes too high. Just gonna set my mind to receive around Christmas ü•≤,btohqsg
I suspect 13th Dec  because it'll be 51 days since the application close.And it'll be quite late relative to all the launches from 2022 onwards.Likely not after Christmas as it'll be the longest waiting time already,btohqsg
Yess but its one of the biggest launch tho 14 projects HAHA A,btohqsg
sure  I got the data from the general discussion channel of this group haha,btohqsg
So far anyone got missing profile?,btohqsg
No. I can still see the JW application in my profile,btohqsg
Then like abit hard to be tmr :(,btohqsg
As much as I want it to be tmr haha,btohqsg
I know we can only wait for it to be out but,btohqsg
Idk possible for result to launch with no missing profiles?,btohqsg
I dunno. Previously I only see when hdb send me msg,btohqsg
Hi ballot results is what date,btohqsg
From an applicant who wrote in to HDB regarding results release,btohqsg
Hi all  it's 3rd or 4th week of Dec.,btohqsg
By this 2 weeks   should be before Christmas,btohqsg
Let's see if it comes out at 4 pm,btohqsg
haiss i dun think will be today ü•≤,btohqsg
Will most probs be next wed onwards since got system maintenance till 17th dec,btohqsg
Probably 17 Dec itself and onwards,btohqsg
All the best to all of us!,btohqsg
Hi all  know there‚Äôs some stress about HFE deadline and how the re-application of HFE works. Pls see below for the letter that was sent to an applicant1 month before expiry of HFE- you canrenewrather than reapply and redo everything,btohqsg
Hi all  know there‚Äôs some stress about HFE deadline and how the re-application of HFE works. Pls see below for the letter that was sent to an applicant1 month before expiry of HFE- you canrenewrather than reapply and redo everything,btohqsg
For my HFE  I don't have to submit any docs. Just enter the payslip information for the past 12 months. Approval usually quite fast,btohqsg
Just don't cancel ur existing HFE as it will still be validWhen ur new HFE application is in process,btohqsg
anyone know how many maintenance prior to this? ü§£ my friend told me when he BTO few launches back it was 3-4 maintenance before getting the results,btohqsg
I am expecting the BTO results to be out by 20th December 2024,btohqsg
are you getting fixed salary?cos mine isnt. and previously i was asked alot of documents for my first hfe. and im resubmitting to get new hfe in case i dont get decent q for this ballot.,btohqsg
ah thanks. hope mine get renew fast enough. or even better my oct ballot is within supply then no need apply for feb. lol,btohqsg
Anyone notice changes to buyer‚Äôs profile?,btohqsg
Pasir Ris BTO got reports of missing profile,btohqsg
I guess taman jurong not overly subscribe so everyone gets a queue number,btohqsg
This is considered missing profile right,btohqsg
Bro good luck.. just take this indicator with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
How to get to this page?,btohqsg
How should a normal profile look like?,btohqsg
"There should be the project name there. Instead of ""you have not created a search profile yet""",btohqsg
Thanks! So without the project name = no q no isit?,btohqsg
Apparently it's highly correlated with not getting a q no. But a few ppl didn't did get a q no.,btohqsg
Even if under your flat applications they show the project you applied for?,btohqsg
apparently if ur profile goes missing it means u wont get a q number at all    some people who have balloted a few times before say this is a common thing that happens 1-2 weeks before the q numbers r released   ,btohqsg
May I know how it got debunked?,btohqsg
Taman Jurong 2 room flats oversubscribed,btohqsg
Just checked  no updates at all,btohqsg
Wait & see how accurate this prediction is ü§£,btohqsg
Shall be any day next week,btohqsg
As after next week is christmas,btohqsg
Any Canberra vista here got your key ready?,btohqsg
Hi   is there any group for Toh guan grove ? üôè,btohqsg
Means out of 546 units for 2R  there are 589 applicants,btohqsg
Number of applicants vs the number of flats available,btohqsg
589 applicants / 546 units for 2R,btohqsg
Thats encouraging right for ppl whp applied there,btohqsg
Obviously those who dont get it should buy 4D because they beat the odds,btohqsg
If u consider a 10% dropout rate  then just about everybody will get a unit,btohqsg
Remember those number also include type 1,btohqsg
Yes type 1 and type 2,btohqsg
Now cannot anyhow drop out unless get ban for 1 year,btohqsg
Why do u think hdb issue q number for beyond supply?,btohqsg
In the event if there are drop outs,btohqsg
Drop outs + in case some ethnic quotas finish,btohqsg
From an applicant who wrote in to HDB regarding results release,btohqsg
Hi all  it's 3rd or 4th week of Dec.,btohqsg
Yes ah cause there‚Äôs still questions,btohqsg
This is the closest to from HDBs mouth,btohqsg
I got no rights to pin,btohqsg
Plus if it‚Äôs in a different topic then cannot ^ it,btohqsg
All the best to all applicants! Hope you get a good good queue no. üôèüèªChaptGPT was one day off from its predictions ü§≠üòÜ,btohqsg
Wish good luck for 2nd timer,btohqsg
Hi guys for those with expired hfe but successful ballot number  we don‚Äôt need to reapply right?,btohqsg
Whats the queue number they will give until if the units offered is about 1200,btohqsg
Any idea what are the potential locations for Feb 2025‚Äôs SBF?,btohqsg
Hi  I got a Bto queue number 16xx but it is out of supply.1) with this  can I apply sbf in next cycle (Feb 2025)?2) my current hfe is expiring next year but I want to reassess my current grant and loan. can I cancel my hfe letter and reapply again? Would I be considered second timer?,btohqsg
Any group for Pasir Ris BTO Costa Reviera,btohqsg
If out of supply can apply for Feb‚Äôs round. But if get called up in the end to choose for this BTO you‚Äôll need to go for it (unless out of ethnic quota or only left 10 units),btohqsg
1. If your no. Is out of supply  you can apply for the next launch.2. If you need to reassess your grant and loan  yes you need to cancel and reapply hfe. No  you're not considered 2nd timer.2nd timer is considered when you receive a queue within supply but choose to reject the unit offered  unless the unit is less than 10 or exceeded ethnic quota. The non-selection count is waived if you have 10 or fewer BTO flats to choose from at your flat selection appointment if you're being called up.,btohqsg
Oh yes then you should apply for feb,btohqsg
But I am allowed to cancel and reapply for a new hfe letter hor? Even when my current hfe letter not expiring?,btohqsg
I think for reassessment you can write into HDB. Don‚Äôt need to cancel ba,btohqsg
When‚Äôs it expiring? Maybe can renew when nearer expiration,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt allow me to reassess  I want to reapply again so it can go through the bot one based on CPF not human assessment‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I wrote in earlier to HDB cos my HFE was expiring in early Feb  but the deadline to apply for HFE for Feb‚Äôs launch was by 15 Dec. My HFE then might not be able to wait till Feb‚Äôs launch.HDB then ended my HFE which was expiring in Feb  to Dec (earlier expiry) upon my request after clarification which allowed me to re-apply for a HFE!Can try writing in to HDB :) they replied me within a working day!,btohqsg
I just graduated this year July and now working full time. So in my case  my first application for hfe automatically went through bot assessment  it counted my internship allowance into the grant assessment. So I got a high grant low loan.But during that period interest rate very high mah  so I call up hdb to reassess. Then they say internship shld not be taken into consideration so they adjust it to a lower grant higher loan.But now bank interest rate drops already  so I want back the first option. But hdb doesn‚Äôt allow it  so I am trying to reapply again to get the bot assessment..,btohqsg
Hmm if reapply won‚Äôt be able to make it for Feb‚Äôs application le.,btohqsg
Even reapply won‚Äôt guarantee will give you back first assessment kind of results since most likely already got your records,btohqsg
Cuz my first time the results come back on the 2nd day during weekend. That‚Äôs why I know it a bot assessment haha,btohqsg
Cuz I got a low loan amount from hdb mah and this amount won‚Äôt change until key collection  but for bank loan  I can reassess again near key collection date.,btohqsg
So in this case  the only motivation for me to take hdb loan during that period earlier this year is due to the lower interest rate for hdb loan,btohqsg
any idea if out of supply for oct 2024 can still apply for feb 2025 bto ?,btohqsg
If out of supply can apply for Feb‚Äôs round. But if get called up in the end to choose for this BTO you‚Äôll need to go for it (unless out of ethnic quota or only left 10 units),btohqsg
"Hi  has anyone re-apply for HFE? I click on ""view letter/ re-apply HFE letter"" but the next page loaded doesn't show anything about re-apply HFE.",btohqsg
Abit too early. You can't re apply yet. Maybe you wait until early Jan,btohqsg
Usually is abt 1 month before expired you can re apply,btohqsg
Another separate question  is there any way we can increase the HDB housing loan? If there‚Äôs an increase in salary  does it mean higher loan?,btohqsg
Can I check the method you used to contact HDB? Someone was trying to use my request and couldn‚Äôt find a suitable option to click,btohqsg
Under HFE  no reassessment of loan is the official stance,btohqsg
Oh! Do you know which option to click below? As there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúHFE flat eligibility‚Äù option only,btohqsg
hi just to check  do i need to provide rom cert on choosing flat phase or can i provide during key collecting?,btohqsg
Within 3 months of key collection,btohqsg
I think we chose either the 1st or 2nd one!,btohqsg
Anyone here have HDB sales phone number? I am trying to call from overseas.Alternatively  anyone here got HDB Sales email address?,btohqsg

Those numbers are for local.But i am calling from overseas.,btohqsg
Better to send your enquiry via e feedback form. Else your phone bill very high.Can try+6568663066,btohqsg
If urgent and you‚Äôre rly looking for a way  you can use Skype and add credit and call any numbers. Just need to add +65,btohqsg
Anyone is a 2nd time and gotten a Q number for geylang bto?,btohqsg
hi! can i ask whether the parent & child units will be located within the same site for mgps?for eg: oct 2024 sengkang has two sites - oasis & sails. wont have 1 parent/child unit in oasis and another parent/child unit in sails right? üòÖthanks in advance!,btohqsg

Anyone got the BTO results for Taman Jurong Skyline 2 room flexi flat.,btohqsg
My income now is twice than what is say in my letter,btohqsg
Hi all. If my number 3x over supply. Do u guys advise to try for feb sbf?,btohqsg
No la  my letter I put low low to get more grant,btohqsg

Pls apply for next launch if there‚Äôs something you want,btohqsg
I just got my queue number 334 out of 546 for a 2 room flexi flat at Taman Jurong Skyline.,btohqsg
Sir  We will be estate mates living in the same estate,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if hdb will request for payslips during unit selection? Will quitting my job now affect?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think they will request since it‚Äôs all put up during HFE.,btohqsg
Not wrong la  that time I work little now work more la,btohqsg
Anyway my old cpf plus grant plus loan plus savings enough for 2 room already,btohqsg
Hello!! Does any one has a sample of how these windows looked like ü§î looks kinda different from the usual bto 5 room!,btohqsg
Is it 3/4 or full length?,btohqsg
Room window looks smaller than usual,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs drawn to scale. Is this from the brochure?,btohqsg
If out of supply always always go for next launch to apply again .,btohqsg
For flat selection start in March  the smallest number will select first... Or all go to the HDB office n select on same day?,btohqsg
Usually it‚Äôs Grassroots/MGPS first followed by the public queue,btohqsg
October results out.I got last night,btohqsg
Can I know if there was anyone q number within the supply but unable to choose unit because of ethnicity restrictions?,btohqsg
My ballot result for a 2 room flexi says -- queue no 700 for 476 flats on offer.476 is the total number of flats on offer at Kembangan. But only 84 units of 2 room flexi type 2.Is my queue number 700 for all flat types or for only 2 room flexi?Do I still stand a good chance if most of the 699 people in front of me are going for the 4 room flats?Anybody has advice?,btohqsg
Only for 2 room sadly. It is room type specific. Try for Feb launch ba,btohqsg
Then how ? Unfair for those have number within supply and not able to choose right,btohqsg
The only way to overcome this is to get Q as low as possible,btohqsg
Ethnic Integration Policy supersedes queue number.‚ÄúTo prevent the formation of racial enclaves. It seeks to promote racial integration in Singapore by allowing residents of different ethnicities to live together and interact on a regular basis in public housing‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äú‚Ä¶there are limits on the total percentage of a block or neighbourhood that may be occupied by a certain ethnicity.When these limits are reached  no further sale of flats to the affected group is allowed‚Äùhttps://www.gov.sg/article/hdbs-ethnic-integration-policy-why-it-still-matters,btohqsg
Select is done all in March or spread out weeks n months?,btohqsg
Depends which project. Some is Feb  some March. Also April,btohqsg
I mean same towner project  select is March 2025,btohqsg
Start in march. But your appt may be in April or May,btohqsg
So the select is online or go to HDB office?,btohqsg
Starts from Mar 2025. Usually 2+ to 3+ months,btohqsg
My number is last 10% of the available units,btohqsg
Den your appt maybe in may,btohqsg
Yes do join your project group chat,btohqsg

If ava unit is 138 my q no is 112  sure can select unit?I cannot apply next year SBU right üëâ?,btohqsg
Yes yes I got it too!,btohqsg
So based on whole Towner Breeze for exampleNot based on just 2 or 3 or 4 rooms right?So my Q number is 112 should be pretty good right?,btohqsg
Each flat type has its own queue,btohqsg
Sorry I still don‚Äôt get this! My total supply of the 5rm is 431  my number is 238.. so what is my %? Am I below the 66.7%‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Oh! How did you calculated that ü§£,btohqsg
Also good units taken up  I assume the poorer lower floor flat unit prices will also be lower... Spend less is a good thing too,btohqsg
Depends also. If the price is too high  people may go for lower floors first. Eg someone shared teban breeze had this pattern. Not so many takers above 20th floor,btohqsg
I buying 2 bed room flexi scheme,btohqsg
$15 000 premium is incorporated into the price of the booked flat for singles buying BTO 2-room flexi.The price you see for the unit  you need to add another $15 000.If you buying as a single. If as a couple  den not applicable.,btohqsg
Hi guys so I got into supply for Bedok  does this mean I can choose units from either of the 3 projects?,btohqsg
Yep  it all depends on what‚Äôs available at each site for you at the time of your selection. So better queue number = more choice from any of the 3 sites,btohqsg
Ahh i see thanks so much for the clarification! Then for now i just wait for the appointment date right?,btohqsg
I read thisPretty confuseHow about Divocee 70 years above?,btohqsg
Maybe check your HFE. I think should indicate any additional amount payable.,btohqsg
Don't forget abt the 15k to add on to flat price,btohqsg
I got queue number 150 but only 130 units available. Does that mean even I get to select is low floor?I can't bto Feb one right or SBF.Have to wait till April.,btohqsg
How u all know whether u will get Kembangan Wave or Bayshore Vista or Palm ar? I remember when apply that time  HDB didn‚Äôt even allow us to choose the area. Only can choose ‚Ä¶ correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
You won't know until you get invitation?,btohqsg
The project comprises of 3: Bayshore Vista  Bayshore Palms and Kembangan Wave. So when you get your queue num  and you‚Äôre invited down to select  you can choose from whatever remaining units in these 3 areas.,btohqsg
Means your number is out of supply. You can apply for the Feb.,btohqsg
Dun like this kind of combine,btohqsg
Means if you want kembangan but when you get invitation  all is sold. Then you have to get bedok. If not you get ban,btohqsg
Issue is how can kembangan and bedok be same estate?,btohqsg
The 2 bedok projects can understand why they are under bedok. But kembangan?,btohqsg
That is HDB‚Äôs discretion le ah haha,btohqsg
But anyway dun matter to me as mine is Taman jurong skyline,btohqsg
Hi there  anyone knows if there is a chat group for the SERS,btohqsg
Anyone knows where to get the floor plan for the Bukit Batok west brick  thank you üôè,btohqsg
My invitation is on Feb 25. Mine is 991 out of 1236. But there is no clear indication where.,btohqsg
They won't indicate. When you get the invitation then they will show you the units available,btohqsg
Means if you want kembangan but all is sold  you have to choose bedok,btohqsg
How did you get the invitation date alrdy? Haha,btohqsg
Its lumped together as 1 project  so by the time reach ur queue no. some may (or may not) have been fully taken up  u can pick from the remaining units that are un picked,btohqsg
Invitation estimates are available to you.,btohqsg
Ur flat selection for the estate starts from feb  but ur selection date likely will be a few months later. HDB will send u notification 2 weeks prior to ur appointment,btohqsg
I never say date  i just say in Feb 2025. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Ah I thought you meant 25th of Feb ya.,btohqsg
Yup the selection starts from Feb 2025  but because it goes by queue number  may take few months. But hdb will send u notifications 2 weeks before selection,btohqsg
Ar.. ic‚Ä¶ but why so long ar?,btohqsg
Because got 991 ppl selecting before u üòÇ,btohqsg
and HDB cannot take so many ppl at once  plus got other project selections too,btohqsg
I just need a house will do,btohqsg
Ya ur queue no. means u will be the 991st to pick a unit in the estate u applied for,btohqsg
Its by ur queue number  and theres other project selections too,btohqsg
Appt date and time will follow ur Q,btohqsg
Lower Q will go first batch by batch,btohqsg
Based on what i experienced previously its about 20-50 queue numbers per day per project but the number is subjected to hdb scheduling,btohqsg
So a good estimation is prolly 1 to 3 months after feb 2025 since it starts on feb 2025,btohqsg
but just know hdb will send reminder 2 weeeks before appointment so dont need to worry too much,btohqsg
Ur queue no. is well within the number of unit  confirm can get unless ethnic quota reach,btohqsg
Hi  sorry everyone can I know where can I get the dropout rate for the recent bto project ? Eg feb 2024 and Jun 2024? Apparently we need to worry even if our number is within the no of supplies,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have as far as I know,btohqsg
Hi  sorry everyone can I know where can I get the dropout rate for the recent bto project ? Eg feb 2024 and Jun 2024? Apparently we need to worry even if our number is within the no of supplies,btohqsg
yup no worries i think u should be fine because ur queue no. is well within the amount of units ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
How about 300 out of 400? üòîüòî,btohqsg
üòÇ im no magic ball but its also well within the amt of units,btohqsg
Prime June has about 20% and prime Feb has about 18%,btohqsg
But according to the metrics of 66.7% I stand no chance,btohqsg
Is it higher dropout rate for prime location ? My is Sengkang bto,btohqsg
If you are within supply then u don‚Äôt have to worry in securing a unit. As long as the ethnic quota is enough for Chinese assuming you are,btohqsg
300/400 is within the queue no. so u stand a lot of chance  unless ethnic quota,btohqsg
I believe it‚Äôs lower but can‚Äôt be sure,btohqsg
18-20% is very low dropout rate,btohqsg
Average was 40% in the past,btohqsg
My selection is estimated in April. üòÇ,btohqsg
66.7% is virtually guaranteed. Historically no one can‚Äôt pick if u are at 100% within supply,btohqsg
Yes this exactly what I worry.. ethnicity restriction will make me no chance to secure.. yes I‚Äôm Chinese,btohqsg
I believe as a Chinese u still get to choose about 80% of the unit?,btohqsg
Serious ?! This is some thg I found it very comforting !,btohqsg
Ethic quota at 67% for Chinese with zero drop out guarantees u a unit,btohqsg
So technically u would get unless u give up,btohqsg
I doubt any land allows less than 67% for Chinese. Lol never heard of,btohqsg
Depends also on the applicants ethnicity for the project as a whole,btohqsg
Also chances of 100% chinese before u is quite low la hahaha,btohqsg
100% Chinese in front of u with ethic quota of only 67% Chinese with also 0 drop out rate is 100% for u to get a unit üòÇ,btohqsg
And u would get to choose mid to good units with that number,btohqsg
I was at 88% percentile and still got to choose a not bad unit. And many Chinese chose after me as well.,btohqsg
I was worried too as ethic quota was 88% for mine. I‚Äôm like very close but then I worried for nothing. Lots of units left to choose haha,btohqsg
How many years ago? Because I heard nowadays the dropout rate is lower,btohqsg
Hello! Anyone has the link to the Kallang/Crawford group? (:,btohqsg
I think generally if within supply should be able to choose.But may not get the block of your choice as the quota also applies to the block.,btohqsg
Hi can anyone advise if they received keys earlier than ECD please,btohqsg
Hi is SBF only for applicants who have applied before? üòÖ,btohqsg
No.. anyone can apply... just quite limited offerings..,btohqsg
Usually is in between. I have heard of one year earlier than ECD pre covid,btohqsg
Nope. But key collection time yes,btohqsg
If it happens to be before ECD would it be possible to request for delayed key collection?,btohqsg
Just figuring out the financial planning haha,btohqsg
I mean if there‚Äôs a particular project you like  the offering for that one is not a lot‚Ä¶,btohqsg
SBF also includes those who have selected at the BTO stage but decided to cancel before they get the keys.,btohqsg
So can I simultaneously take part in SBF and Feb 2025 exercise?,btohqsg
The balance is mostly at Jurong?,btohqsg
Hi all If i got 300+/100+ i pressed proceed for the ballot.And if i didn‚Äôt manage to get  am i still a first timer for next upcoming bto?,btohqsg
The proceed button is nothing actually,btohqsg
Hellooo! ill be heading for  BTO flat selection (on feb 2024) Currently  I am working full time until now and my partner is unemployed since dec 2023 due to some family circumstances. But he had secure a job which start on march 2024. I am able to fork out the 2k during flat selection. So in this case most likely what documents do my partner need to provide though? (as he is unemployed since dec 2023)  are we still able to get a flat or no? sorry as its my first time. As i think they won't reassessing the HDB housing loan the grant??  have anyone encountered this situation be4? thx (sorry for the long message),btohqsg
They see the hfe at point of application,btohqsg
They would still require 12 months of salary to consider hdb loan amount for your partner. Are u able to reapply your HFE?,btohqsg
Flat selection will follow whats stated in hfe. So u just need to prepare to pay the option fee. Usually just need to bring ic. Refer ur email on what other doc needed,btohqsg
Anything regards the loan will be finalise during key collection,btohqsg
When you get the invitation letter  documents required will be stated. . So just prepare beforehand,btohqsg
hello! Asking for a friend. anyone knows what‚Äôs this HDB concessionary loan?,btohqsg
In this case  can still take up bank loan? Or strictly hdb loan only? Does it affect anything? Cos previously when my friend applied  this field was empty,btohqsg
You can change to bank loan anytime  even after you get your flat. Just that can never change back to Hdb loan,btohqsg
May I know is there a minimum hdb loan or bank loan amount?,btohqsg
If u can pay fully with your cpf and cash,btohqsg
If one apply to loan $50k  is it possible?,btohqsg
One more question  if hfe stated no loan  could one take up a small loan quantum from hdb (before the 1st down payment??,btohqsg
Hdb can. Bank i doubt they would entertain such low amount..,btohqsg
Thanks! Can one request hdb for such a loan (even hfe stated no loan)?,btohqsg
Why HFE state no loan ah?,btohqsg
Cos I remember u need to fill up if u r taking a hdb loan or not,btohqsg
So you change your mind and want to take HDB loan? Maybe you‚Äôll need reapply HFE cuz they‚Äôll need to do reassessmentThe loan not applicable for down payment. You‚Äôll need use CPF/cash for down payment.,btohqsg
Grant can be used for downpayment,btohqsg
Ya. The grant amount will be credited into your CPF before the appointment for down payment. üòä,btohqsg
Thank you! But heard that not possible to use new HFE if one gets a unit based on the old one.,btohqsg
Email in to check with HDB...,btohqsg
Feb are for SBFno BTO in Feb,btohqsg
Both sbf and bto will be on Febhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/modes-of-sale/faqs-for-sales-launch#:~:text=During%20a%20sales%20launch%20comprising SBF%20exercise%2C%20but%20not%20both.,btohqsg
Thanks@Lijszzy@torahikowill try. Just afraid I need a bit of $ as the reno and other costs might go very high up down the years while waiting for TOP given such unforeseen circumstances.,btohqsg
Have BTO and SBF for Feb launch.,btohqsg
Everything goes into OA? Or will still split?,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone know if cpf contributions will be reviewed during unit selection,btohqsg
For those who are in between jobs or planning to change job - I‚Äôve called HDB again today - no reassessment during unit selection. However  they will conduct due diligence checks closer to key collection to ensure you can service the loan. I.e they will check if you‚Äôre employed. The loan amount will not change regardless of income changes. However if you‚Äôre deemed as unable to service the loan  hdb may not disburse the amount.,btohqsg
You can submit appeal for loan reassessment  case to case  for example 1 working and 1 not working  can submit to appeal for loan reassessment 9 months before key collection as there is a huge change in income,btohqsg
It happens to me also  called 3-4 diff staff  best is to go down mp to get the proper answer,btohqsg
Also wanted to check for down payment  can you use up 100% in cpf?,btohqsg
First timer is use all the OA  from what I know  the other 2 account can‚Äôt touch,btohqsg
Can share amongst both applicants? Or only one applicants OA,btohqsg
If apply as 2 owner can use both,btohqsg
If apply as 1 owner and 1 occupier  only can use the owner,btohqsg
hi  if my hfe expire on apr 2025 and the selection is also apr 2025 do i need to renew?,btohqsg
so if the selection drag till may then i renew?or totally no need renew at all until key collection?,btohqsg
You‚Äôll see this msg when preparing for your appointment.,btohqsg
HFE validity only matters for flat application,btohqsg
"ya the word is ""before booking appt"". so i not sure if the appt is may or what do i still need to apply or not",btohqsg
Best to keep 10-20k in OA for future/monthly deductions. Dont wipe out all.,btohqsg
Hello guys! Can i just ask anyone know are there any difference with SBF and BTO application? Do we still get ballot/queue number? Because SBF is just choosing from 1 unit right?,btohqsg
Keep 20k in OA you have to top up more cash. If you are working with healthy OA contribution  can just use it for monthly deduction,btohqsg
The OA part is if you get retrenched then you have buffer,btohqsg
Hi hi does anyone know what‚Äôs the ethnic quota assigned to Chinese usually?,btohqsg
The last time ethnic limits were publicly updated was in 2010.At the neighbourhood level  the quotas were 84 per cent for Chinese  22 per cent for Malays  and 12 per cent for Indians and other ethnic minority groups.At the block level  the limits were 87 per cent for Chinese  25 per cent for Malays  and 15 per cent for Indians and others.The 2010 revision  made in response to Singapore‚Äôs changing demographics  raised the limits for Indians and others by 2 percentage points for both neighbourhoods and blocks.Currently  EIP quotas ‚Äì which are updated on the first of each month ‚Äì are no longer listed on HDB‚Äôs website.,btohqsg
pardon my ignorance  but why is the total percentage above 100%?,btohqsg
Not opened until end May 2025,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone has any concern choosing a bto unit near electrical substation? Not sure if there is any health risk due to radiation or if there is an official statement from hdb regarding this. Thanks!,btohqsg
ChatGPT:Staying near an HDB substation in Singapore generally posesminimal risk of radiation. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Energy Market Authority (EMA) regulate substations to ensure public safety. Here are key points to consider:1. Type of RadiationHDB substations emitelectromagnetic fields (EMFs)  not ionizing radiation (which is harmful). EMFs are produced by electrical equipment and power lines but are considered low energy and non-ionizing.2. Regulatory Standards‚Ä¢ Singapore follows theInternational Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)guidelines.‚Ä¢ EMF exposure from substations is well below the ICNIRP safety limits.‚Ä¢ Authorities conduct regular monitoring to ensure compliance.3. Health Risks‚Ä¢ Scientific studies have not conclusively linked living near substations with significant health issues.‚Ä¢World Health Organization (WHO)states that exposure to low-level EMFs is unlikely to cause harm.‚Ä¢ High levels of EMFs (e.g.  from industrial sources) may cause localized heating  but such exposure is not present near residential substations.4. Precautionary MeasuresIf you‚Äôre concerned about EMFs:‚Ä¢Distance: EMF levels drop rapidly with distance. A few meters from a substation significantly reduces exposure.‚Ä¢Shielding: Walls and structures further reduce EMF levels.5. Practical Considerations‚Ä¢ HDB flats near substations are designed to meet safety standards  so risks are negligible.‚Ä¢ Some people might feel anxious due to perceived risks; in such cases  choosing units further away can provide peace of mind.,btohqsg
Question  does a stack identified in a given BTO  specifically the Pasir Ris Costa Riveria II  have ox mixture of flat sizes (2-room to 5-room) or does a specific stack only house one size flat. For example   I am aware that stacks 719  721  n 755 have 5-room units  but r those stacks dedicated to only one size or do these three stacks also have other size units like 2 or 3 room flats in the same stack?,btohqsg
Stack are unit number it only have 1 flat sizeThe floor have mixture of different flat size units,btohqsg

For Feb 2025 bro project  how to know who h is standard  prime and plus?,btohqsg
It is based on locations. Plus/Prime locations is like Rochor  Queenstown  Kallang/Whampoa  Bukit Merah  AMK. Generally they'll indicate which project is under Standard  Prime or Plus.,btohqsg
I think will announce once ready for application,btohqsg
I am an Indian applying for 2 room  in Taman Jurong Skyline.My queue is 3xx.How does the ethnic quota affect me.Will I not be allocated a unit?,btohqsg
My queue number is 3xx out of 549,btohqsg
You should be able to get a unit. Ethnic quota is applicable to the blocks as well so if there‚Äôs a popular block  then you might be restricted if quota for Indian is finish for that particular block.,btohqsg
Thanks for your response.In which way HDB will restrict me. Will HDB not allow me to choose a unit.I was under the impression that ethnic quota has been taken into consideration before allocating the queue number.,btohqsg
During appointment if you‚Äôre choosing a unit from a block that quota for Indian is used up  then officer will advise you have to choose from another block,btohqsg
Yea  will be announced in time,btohqsg

Depends how much time is spent for each applicant,btohqsg
Lunch time for the counter staff,btohqsg
i dont think will be >50 since theres also selection ongoing for other launches,btohqsg

hey all  I just received an email from HDB to select the unit for Yishun BTO (June)  and I need to select next year January. But I already got the queue number for the October AMK BTO and the selection starts from April. Am I able to skip for the Yishun project and go for the AMK project?,btohqsg
Can we make an appeal to waive non-selection count?,btohqsg
If there are fewer than 10 units -> can get waiver of non selection penalty and choose not to selectIf no more ethnic quota -> no issues  go ahead and wait for AMKIf 10 or more units -> sorry you have to select.So monitor the units left :) head to the Chencharu hills group chat unit tracker to monitor,btohqsg
what happens if i just don't attend for yishun  what will happen to the AMK proj,btohqsg
If 10 or more units  non selection penalty will apply -> all projects will be canceled and you will be considered a 2nd timerSo AMK will be cancelled,btohqsg
Hi may i know if i just received appointment date for yishun and then i got ballot queue number for jurong . Can i not come for the yishun appointment?,btohqsg
Hello  those kenna called for selection must go !!! If not they will automatically cancelled your other applications!!! And u will become 2nd timer for 1yr.So please go down to your appointment even u have other Q number.If less than 10 units can don't select and appeal to waived non selectionIf more than 10 units u must choose and give up your other Q numbers if u never choose means downgrade to 2nd timer for 1yr and also hdb will cancel all other ONGOING applications,btohqsg
That's is why many ppl pray hard don't be called up when out of Q,btohqsg
U can't skip yishun unfortunately as u are called to select. U never go   hdb will automatically cancel your AMK application,btohqsg
shag nvm uh  we are going to select yishun flat anyways. Thanks!,btohqsg
If u go to select and below 10 units balance u can don't select and appeal to retain your AMK Q,btohqsg

You can go branch office to pay off the balance loan.,btohqsg
Has anyone here tried reno package before? What was your experience like? Is it worth the $ or are there a lot of hidden costs? Thanks :),btohqsg

Hello  my HFE letter has not expire however it is based on 80% ltv as i applied before the new cooling measure. Do i need to get a new copy or how do i know how much loan im eligible for now?,btohqsg
Hi guys  wanted to check with you.We got a queue number for this time‚Äôs pasir ris BTO. Looking at around $735k.We are both currently students who will graduate in July 2027. The flat is expected to TOP by Q3 2028  giving us around 1 year to work and save. We are estimating a combined income of $7-$8k.During our HFE application  we applied for deferred income assessment and currently our income is $0.Would we be able to get the maximum grant of $120k before 1st downpayment and have our HDB loan reassessed 3 months before key collection?Or would the grant and HDB loan be reassessed 3 months before key collection?,btohqsg
Since is deferred  Grant and loan will be reassessed 3 month before key collection,btohqsg
besides  do note that at least 1 partner have to work continuous for 12 mths to qualify for grant,btohqsg
So if your combine income is 7-8k your grant would be much much lower than the 120k you are anticipating,btohqsg
Based on the timeline  jul 2027 and q3 of 2028  3 mths before key collection shld be about june 2028? means yall will have <12 months of working (unless alr working prior?),btohqsg
So there is a chance will not be eligible for a grant,btohqsg
We are okay with a lower grant around estimated 20-25k  but was wondering how much hdb loan would our 7-8k combined salary be able to get? Because I saw that 75% LTV of $735k is $551 250 which seems quite high for hdb to even consider loaning us that amount,btohqsg
u can use the hdb calculator to check the rough estimate,btohqsg
Grant wise just make sure continuous work for 12 months before the assessment,btohqsg
Means ideally  it would be better if one of us starts working around april 2027 for 1 year till april 2028  which is also 3 months before grant assessment (jul 2028) right?,btohqsg
E.g Assessment on June 2028  work 12 mths continuously till April 2028,btohqsg
Taken from hdb website under ehg grant,btohqsg
Normally when they say Q3  we take it as July or Aug?,btohqsg
So if only one of us manages to work continuously for 12 months  the grant and hdb loan will be assessed based on that one person‚Äôs income right?,btohqsg
Is it better to get a higher grant or a higher hdb loan?,btohqsg
In your opinion  Is it better to get a higher grant or a higher hdb loan?,btohqsg
"Me? If u can cover remaining shortfall with cash  then grant better since its ""free money""",btohqsg
Else  just get high loan üòÇ,btohqsg
So it depends on ur situation,btohqsg
was an ID for a short while! what you pay for is what you get (at least from where i was). but of course changes in materials (like tiles to vinyl) and add ons (e.g countertop material) are bound to incur additional cost. if you want to play safe  ask them to give a break down of your quotation instead of lump sum :) most of the time they provide lump sum to increase the price  or they are lazy to write more details,btohqsg
but yes pls choose reputable firms and ID! look at google reviews too,btohqsg
If you got more cash + cpf (300k ish than go for higher grant,btohqsg
If not much cash than higher loan I guess,btohqsg
When u collect key your cash+cpf+grant+loan must cover the value of the house,btohqsg
Hey just curious for BTO 5 room what's the typical Reno cost like nowadays? Say decently,btohqsg
can't give you a proper gauge cause i left the few almost a year ago. my last 5 room bto project was around 50-60k. it was inclusive of some of these:1. vinyl flooring2. tiles for balcony3. partition wall for wall niche and tv (flushed in seamlessly)4. led strips5. drop lights6. carpentry with niche hole + plugs (kitchen + bedroom)7. painting8. general cleaning,btohqsg
really depends on how much you're looking to do honestly. vinyls are usually charged $5.50 to $6.50 per sqft. tiles pricing is more standardise  $3.50/sqft usually  at most $4/$4.50,btohqsg
carpentry if you wanna do sliding door or glass door  will be pricier. casement is cheaper  but with the space constrain in bto  homeowners usually go for sliding and suck it up,btohqsg
i can't remember the rest already sorry üòÖ,btohqsg
I thought vinyl will be cheaper than tiles?,btohqsg
if you look at the overall costing it might be cheaper  really depends. cause tiling work requires semen screed  per sqft including materials and labour would be $10.50-$11.50 per sqft,btohqsg
Okay thanks for ur input anyway,btohqsg
i wouldn't recommend concealing your piping thou  even though it is a lot more aesthetically pleasing. my bf's neighbour's pipe leaked and they had to knock the whole floor off to replace it,btohqsg
depends if you're comfortable w it :),btohqsg
Maybe by then Inflation again. I am guessing 70-80k will be new norm,btohqsg
Haha saw the tik tok got one find cousin BF the. Alot shortcut de,btohqsg
just have to look for ID with an open mind  usually they charge more than what they promote  but that is for legitimate reasons. if it's ala carte it'll be a lot more pricier,btohqsg
and best to give yourself some leeway with the budget too,btohqsg
yeah hahaha that one really rabak ü§£,btohqsg
Over budget tbh. You need time to build up CPF.,btohqsg
What will happen if unable to cover the value of the house?,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt be able to collect the keys,btohqsg
Can wait out to save the amt lacking? Or will have to give up the flat?,btohqsg
During key collection you need to have enough to cover the shortfall,btohqsg
If not have to give it up,btohqsg
By than you would have already paid 25% if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
I think if give up before key collection  should lose just the first payment of 10% if took hdb loan. 20% if bank loan,btohqsg
Than ban 1 year from applying hdb + downgrade to second timer,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-publications/publications/hdbspeaks/deferment-of-key-collection-to-new-flatCan try apply to defer. Case by case basis,btohqsg
If the hdb loan short abit  can appeal in,btohqsg
"Hello everyone  wanna seek your advice on bto hdb loan.I jus went to select bto flat today  understand from the hdb officer that during the last appointment before key collection  hdb will wipe out me and my spouse cpf OA account (leaving behind min 20k) so that we reduce the loan we take from HDB.Is it possible to ""shield"" my spouse account from being wiped out by Hdb before the key collection appointment by transferring most of her CPF OA $$ to SA?",btohqsg
You wanna shield might as well use for investment. If investment still can return back to OA. Once you do OA to SA transfer  it is irreversible.That being said  if you are risk adverse  it is okay to do OA to SA transfer especially if you are nearing the prevailing FRS.,btohqsg

That is if you are taking hdb loan,btohqsg
If you are taking bank loan  you can rerain any amount. But recommended at least 20k,btohqsg

Oh well doesn't pay off to be helpful I suppose ü´†,btohqsg
Last update was due to HDB took their income of 2019 instead of the latest therefore  they had to redo thr grant based off their current income,btohqsg
Lower pay = more grants ah,btohqsg
If u applied for it and if only u get a Q number within the supply and invited for selection u never go and don't want then u become 2nd timer,btohqsg
