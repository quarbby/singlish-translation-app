🎉Pika World Market Insights- 14 July 2022🎉💰Inflation roar to the moon🔫Investors continued to battle with the fear of high inflation as the latest CPI data released on Wednesday showed inflation hitting a four decades high  surging to 9.1%. As a result  Wall Street is now pricing a more considerable rate increase in its next meeting.There is now a high possibility that the Fed will be geared up for a 1% rate increase raising the Fed target interest rate to 2.5%-2.75%. The market remains calm as President Biden called the latest CPI non-relevant as it does not reflect the newest moderation in many commodities prices.Pika World continued to be cautious about any downside risk as market sentiments tend to swing aggressively.💎It’s the Banks earning season again!🔭As with all earning seasons  the banks are the first to kick off the goal. JP Morgan will be the first to release its latest quarterly earnings. Investors will dive vigorously into the state of business of US largest lenders and how they cope with a clear sign of a slowing economy.Expectations are blurry  but one thing is almost certain: analysts are hoping for an increase in the net interest margin profit while mindful of an economic contraction. Yet  Pika World believed Wall Street should see the tampered expectation of massive profit given a softening of any deal-making climate.We are also expecting Morgan Stanley to report its result on Thursday. Next in line are Citigroup and Wells Fargo  which will have earnings released before the bell strike on Friday.As the banks are often seen as a bellwether of the US economy  Pika World will also review the guidance if any by the CEOs.It is 14 July  Thursday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a moonatic trading week!,btohqsg
