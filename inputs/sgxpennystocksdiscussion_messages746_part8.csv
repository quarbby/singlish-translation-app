Crude oil keep going up after it had dropped to below USD 70 last two weeks.,btohqsg
Crude Oily 78.78USD/ BblWTI crude futures climbed toward $79 per barrel on Thursday  rising for the fourth straight session as an expected surge in travel for the holiday season is threatening to exacerbate tightening US energy supplies. Latest data showed thatUS crude inventories fell by 5.89 million barrels last week  much more than market forecasts for a 1.66 million barrel drop. US distillate stocks  which include heating oil and jet fuel  also declined  defying expectations for a build.
