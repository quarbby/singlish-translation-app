I broker USD to CIMB auto convert SGD.,btohqsg
Maybe I still need CIMB account. Receive in USD auto convert to SGD. so maybe I just need a SGD account not USD account.,btohqsg
So far I think only CIMB inward remittance free. Other banks charge inward remittance fee,btohqsg
Wasted steps and waste time.... Just convert at ibkr. It is fx rates  comm fixed at $2 or $2.50 usd forget actual price.....,btohqsg
No.Capital.comwill remit USD to me by TT/wire after card fully refunded.,btohqsg
Just now earlier u say ibkr. So tot u asking ibkr.,btohqsg
If I make profit fromcapital.com  I will withdraw $ and deposit to IBKR.,btohqsg
This is good. IBKR USD to SGD charge $2. Then withdraw to any local bank.,btohqsg
Capital.comis for trading. IBKR is for investment.,btohqsg
Without CIMB  whencapital.comremit USD200 to me  I need to pay TT/wire charge $30.,btohqsg

Quick question if money changer quote me if i buy use 1.35 and 1.355  the lower the rate better or higher better? Should i choose 1.35?,btohqsg
Ya i buying usd. I was shocked all the money changer quote me around 1.35 in china town. Got one quote me 1.33 i scold him why so low. Then i think again that seems to be the best offer. But his stall no people,btohqsg
What did he say when u scolded him?,btohqsg

Don't think is real. Most likely is scam. Later got commission etc. ðŸ˜‚ Do u think their profession is money changer don't know how to check fx rates. ðŸ˜‚ Even u know is 1.35....,btohqsg
Just wrote an email to CIMB. Let the CIMB officer advise me which bank account or debit card I need in case I am wrong.,btohqsg
Too good to be true to buy @1.33 now  share the places so we can sapu if itâ€™s ever real ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
If you buy USD  the lower price the better. If you sell USD  the higher price the better. Money Changer has two prices. You need to tell them buy or sell. They need to make a living from the difference.,btohqsg
U shld bring along a calculator and do the sums....,btohqsg

if it really work  can use evol or other better cards to pay SP via 7-11?,btohqsg
I think SP does not belong to retail. But telecom belongs to retail.,btohqsg
Well you can see  bill payments via Cash and Nets only,btohqsg
Try to pay online or by credit card. I think is better than NETS.,btohqsg
I am also not very sure. If cannot pay by credit card  I will try Giro by HSBC since there is salary credit at UOB.,btohqsg
For me  1st choice is online transaction or mobile contactless via EVOL  can get 8%. 2nd choice is UOB Absolute  can get 1.7%. 3rd choice is HSBC giro  can get 1%. Am I right?,btohqsg
UOB EVOL must exceed $600 monthly,btohqsg
Omg u are right. I ask them 2 times they say 1.33. I use the calculator they give me to key in the rate. At first i didnt get her figure then i ask her and key in. The calculator figure matched with her figure. Then i check the noteâ€™s quality i think ok.Then i go change my Cambodia riel in another money changer  he ask me if i still want to change USD anot. Then i told him i changed at 1.33  he ask me check the receipt. Then only i realised i changed at 1.355 ðŸ˜­I use their calculator key in twice. Lesson learn better to use my own calculator or pay extra attention to the rates when key in. Lucky my exchange rate loss is about $13 sgd. I think it is a good lesson i learn.,btohqsg
