"My English is weak. Can someone explain me what this sentence mean?""Mr Hasni  however  pointed out that social visitors and touristswill not be exemptedfrom the special dispensation.""Does it mean social visitors will not beexcludedfrom the special dispensation?Because the previous line mentioned ""foreigners""""categories exempted will include those with work passes issued by both Singapore and Malaysia  students studying in Singapore  technicians  specialists  those involved in logistics  transportation drivers foreignersand also Singaporeans living in Johor.""It's a TODAY article titled ""Johor state govt seeking green light from Putrajaya to reopen Singapore border""",btohqsg
this means that social visitors will not be excused from the special dispensation   which means thatthey have to gothrough social dispensation even if they are social visitors/touristsmaybe what he meant by foreigners is like work pass people or expats,btohqsg
That means that the effort by Johor  social visitors/tourists will not benefit from it and would be subjected to the current travel ban even if Johor successfully made special agreement with the federal government to ease the travel ban?,btohqsg
It means cannot anyhow go into JB to buy cheap petrol and lok lok,btohqsg
