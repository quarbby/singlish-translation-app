HMGICS currently produce regular Ioniq 5 EV only. even Ioniq 6 not produced in singapore yet. doubt Ioniq 5 N can be produced here or anytime in the near future,btohqsg
too many performance EVs you can buy for about the same price,btohqsg
yep. all comes down to personal preference and if u got the moula,btohqsg
if i was looking for a performance EV and had the budget  id choose Ioniq 5 N,btohqsg
Hi everyone  i am new here. Looking at getting a second hand car  thinking about audi A1 or 3  what are your thoughts?,btohqsg
U got family? A3 is sedan right,btohqsg
A1 seems small for my liking,btohqsg
Go for the 3. A1 is mqb-a0. Awkward platform.,btohqsg
Minimum a4 to do grab premium jobs If in case u convert to phv,btohqsg
Worth? In every 10 jobs how many jobs are premium?,btohqsg
Cars like Camry  Mazda 6  Passat skip,btohqsg
All. Can set grab app to do only premium jobs,btohqsg
Just wife and one child  saw $59k for 5 years COE A1,btohqsg
A3 yes Sedan but around 63k,btohqsg
63k get a proper Parf sedan,btohqsg
A 1.6 civic or Avante is way miles mire reliable,btohqsg
Even a 1.3 Fit also worth,btohqsg
Smart #1 Pro+ ReviewThe Smart #1 sports a pleasant exterior alongside plenty of quirks in its cabin that make it irresistibly charming.‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!üëâüèª Another EV review for ya'll üî•,btohqsg
Bro ppl want abit of image u ask him drive beng car lol,btohqsg
4k diff isnt alot of diff,btohqsg
Just cough up the amt in cash. Bigger car is easier fr road trips,btohqsg
Just buy whichever car you like better and within your budget,btohqsg
I also looked at these. Nice cars. I disagree with the guy below. Fc of hybrid is better. Battery you can replace if needed  but the battery quite reliable on those models I think.,btohqsg
Some dealer already changed battery. Haha so you think worth to buy?,btohqsg
Nice car and I hear Lexus reliable. Just be aware of high roadtax. Insurance probably higher too.,btohqsg
Can't say for sure as I haven't driven one. Every car unique.,btohqsg
But 63k for an Audi A3 is cheap tho,btohqsg
Try to bring it down to 61k lo. Then depress one year 12.2k nia,btohqsg
No choice leh now market like this I also suck thumb,btohqsg
Unless he can find e 1.8t,btohqsg
Its a good ev for ladies,btohqsg
Its like a beetle on battery,btohqsg
400 quite decent for a small car,btohqsg
Similar model think is the Mini.EV  VW ID  BYD Dolphin,btohqsg
Ya I find it nice haha,btohqsg
Wah bro u c girl only u reply quite a lot n even ask back qns. I ask u qns only after 1 month still no reply,btohqsg

Then worse sometimes even pretend don‚Äôt know what is my qns n can play merry go round lol,btohqsg
fierce! how much u spend on petrol,btohqsg
You must learn from him once you get your license,btohqsg
Buy car that can drive grab premium,btohqsg
Because that is the only purpose in buying a car ü•∞,btohqsg
Bro it‚Äôs a factor. Not the only purpose,btohqsg
You also the same leh.. dodge my question about certain driver.. :(,btohqsg
Let me rephrase for you then.You must admit the toyota driver behavior is very unbecoming right? Only throws and ruins the image of ‚Äúpremium‚Äù drivers. Let alone a 'convert' to seem to be more 'atas',btohqsg
U only see 1 side of the story,btohqsg
