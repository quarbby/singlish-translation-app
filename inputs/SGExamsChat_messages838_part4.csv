Hi  asking for a friend:What's the results/consequences when you fail N-Level English? Basically what are your options on where you can go and where you can't (ITE/Poly/S5) TIA!,btohqsg
I'm not at all sure  but is retaking an option?,btohqsg
I've heard some retake and some just really take whatever they are offered,btohqsg
Im pretty sure sec 5 is still an option as long as emb3 < 20  but then again if he is struggling with n level English  o level english is gonna be a huge jump,btohqsg
Poly is definitely out of the question. N levels to poly you need emb3 < 11 or something so its a basic requirement that you need to pass (or do well) in every subject taken,btohqsg
does anyone know if stalford tuition is a good centre,btohqsg
ITE DPP (higher nitec) requires a grade 4 for every subject iirc  but he could consider nitec,btohqsg
But this is like from my knowledge almost a good decade ago already LOL but idt anything has changed,btohqsg
Yeah no worries I don't think much changed.. did mine last year managed to get 18pts and a decent 3yearHN course after,btohqsg
Its alright many of my friends too wanted to escape the hell that is O levels and went straight to HN,btohqsg
They arent doing too bad now,btohqsg
Personally am alot happier cos I get lots of opportunities to do what I want and what i've been thinking of so it's quite awesome,btohqsg
Is it worth it to go to 42 Singapore for a last shot at university?,btohqsg
So SUTD and Ecole 42 tied up to bring over the Ecole 42 model (which leads to the French equivalent of a Bachelor's) to Singapore as 42 Singapore,btohqsg
It's even free  which makes me tempted to try it out as a last shot at something resembling university,btohqsg
I once taught at one of the branches before for half a year.Felt that branch was a bit not that well managed. They gave me 3 pure physics and 3 combined sci physics in the same class when it was very near exams. And I was new to group tuition at that time.And no materials provided. So I was quite at a loss because pure and combi physics were very different and shouldn't be put together this way.,btohqsg
Maybe cus they have so many branches?,btohqsg
I also did relief for one of the teachers for one of the branches.Throughout the lesson  students were only asking for answers to explanation questions to be written on the board for copying  and not looking to completely understanding it for some reason.Anyway that formed the basis of my Explain That book.,btohqsg
that particular branch closed down already,btohqsg
other branches might probably be OK to be fair.,btohqsg
Hihihi  it is possible to get into nus engineering as an arts student,btohqsg
so theres no like book made for students by the centre like rmss?,btohqsg
as long as u meet the prereq subject grades and have sufficient score  I don't see why not,btohqsg
that time no. Now I not sure.,btohqsg
i kinda scared cuz my mum forcing me to go n it looks p weird,btohqsg
they supposedly have star tutors at some branches. Not sure which branch,btohqsg
