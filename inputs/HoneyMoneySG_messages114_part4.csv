For the HSBC EGA Bonus Interest pay out does anyone know when will it be paid? Say if I put money into it for June and July  Can I take out my money in the month of August? The T&C says pay out by 30 Sept.,btohqsg
You should not put in for more than a month. You answered your own qn for when it'll be deposited into your account.,btohqsg
As in like if I were to take out the money before the interest pay out  will it forfeit my bonus interest?,btohqsg
No. It's based on incremental MAB.,btohqsg
So sad‚Ä¶ my best friend never PM me‚Ä¶ ü•≤,btohqsg
Any link ? I need some entertainment,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have. He probably hates me.,btohqsg
Hello is citi rewards plus Instarem amaze the best combi for credit card spending (no min spend)?,btohqsg
What do you want to achieve?Usually I recommend UOB or DBS because miles can pool together.Citi Rewards can compliment your miles journey  but cannot rely on it. Spend max $1000 also won‚Äôt earn meaningful redemptions.,btohqsg
Just wondering  is there any telegram group similar to this and heymax but for shopback?,btohqsg
For me I'm a light spender ~500 per month  and don't want think so much CRMC +amaze for me is an obvious choice,btohqsg
One good thing is Citibank got CitiPayAll.What kind of redemptions have you made so far?,btohqsg
Not yet made redemption  first month using this card  just nice 10k points,btohqsg
You have other card for miles worth considering?,btohqsg
Nope. If your spending is $500. I think your choice is great.,btohqsg
Okayy for me important thing is also whether card is useful for multiple purposes. For card like uob lady I will only get for travel to compliment my CRMC amaze  especially if I need to travel/book flights alot,btohqsg
Terry living in your mind rentfree,btohqsg
UOB can change category  possible to cover everything if you know how.,btohqsg
you were supposed to destroy Terry not join him,btohqsg
There's 1k cap on amaze ?,btohqsg
1% fee if use Amaze+card more than 1k for domestic spend,btohqsg
Wow didn't know about this . Thanks !But for international spend got cap ?,btohqsg
Is putting into fixed deposit with guarantee interest ~3% good method to invest or save up?,btohqsg
Depends on your age / risk / investment profile.Typically more suitable for older folks with larger amount of assets since you won‚Äôt grow your wealth very much with 3-4% pa.,btohqsg
Yeah true..  more to low risk appetite n looking for something guaranteed.. stock market seems volatile and not guaranteed earnings,btohqsg
Tbills average around 3.6-3.7. SSB average around 3.2-3.3  so if you want something guaranteed and safe  can go for these 2. MMF is generally quite safe and average around 3.7 but there‚Äôs  still an investment risk involve,btohqsg
Hi all  new to all these so I‚Äôve gone for the UOB one account and just applied for UOB EVOL on 1st June for the cash credit promotion. My card got approved on the 5th and I am still waiting for the card but have just learnt that they have changed both the promotion as well and the cashback in August suddenly without warning. The promotion now is Apple Watch SE but only applies if the application is on the 7th June!? And previous cash credit promotion for June was no longer able to be found. Wonder if it is still worth using this card or just apply for an alternative card?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think I can apply for another UOB credit card for promotion anymore because I am no longer ‚Äúnew to UOB credit card‚Äù because of the EVOL approval for any promotions. So I‚Äôll just have no promotions at all?,btohqsg
1) what rewards did you choose? You can just fulfil the criteria to get the rewards and cancel it at a later stage2) the new nerf only kicks in in August so you have 2 months to still earn cashback based on the current tnc3) if the tnc states that you have to be a new to card  then I guess you have to stick with evol for now,btohqsg
You can still fulfill the promotion with UOB EVOL. The card is still top tier till the new t&c take effect.Afterwards you can look at UOB One card to fulfill your $500 spending and get at least 3.3% cashback  and a lot more if you spend mainly on selected merchants.,btohqsg
The reward initially when I applied for EVOL was up to $560 cash credit on 1st June. But the website changed & the rewards changed as well on I assumed 7th June to this new reward,btohqsg
Then you can fulfil the criteria to get the rewards and seeing if you still want to continue the card at a later stage. Main thing now is to get the reward since you have alrd applied for it,btohqsg
Can keep the card until they can‚Äôt waive your annual fee or if you want to be a new to uob card  cancel it( please read what date the promotion tnc states  rewards might be voided if card is canceled by a certain date)   then apply it probably 6-12 months later,btohqsg
https://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/uob-evolThe initial offer can still be found on the moneysmart website but not anymore on UOB website,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see anything regarding 560$ cash credit,btohqsg
‚ÄúUOB may  at any time and at its discretion terminate the Promotion and/or amend any of the Terms  and all persons shall be bound by such amendments.‚ÄùSo I assumed that have voided this promotion and replaced it with the Apple Watch but only takes effect for those who applied after 7th June. So nothing for those who applied from 1-6 June.,btohqsg

In any case I doubt you were the first x applicants,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/one-card.pageThe EVOL page was similar to UOB One on 1st of June.,btohqsg
I doubt so too haha. Just think that it‚Äôs kinda trashy for them to do this. Even for the Apple Watch promo now  it‚Äôs only for first 50 new applicants,btohqsg
Not sure if I still need to do the minimum spend of $1000 for 2 months with this uncertainty.,btohqsg
Honestly their promos are so uncertain and expensive it's just not worth it lol,btohqsg
I believe this is still the criteria you need to fulfil. Not the one on uob website,btohqsg
Yeaa spending 1k consecutive for 2 months when you don‚Äôt even know if you are the first x application,btohqsg
Annual fee waiver is usually quite easy if spend some amount every month even if is small  depending on bank I heard amex wont waive?,btohqsg
