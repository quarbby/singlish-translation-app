Since there's evidence that this spend will reset monthly  then I'm satisfied. Thanks all for the replies and I hope u had a good laugh  ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Next time I wanna ask a question  I'll check here first. But be prepared for 50-100 lines explaining the context first ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No issue for me  same 3.12.5,btohqsg
You still can complain to them that on your app no tracker. Clearly something is missing on your app. You try to reinstall before asking first.,btohqsg
I am off to pluck chilli from next block neighbour liao for my lunch condiment haha,btohqsg
Then I dunno liao. My app is cursed. I guess,btohqsg
The app sometime crazy de  show and dont show so i think is app problem,btohqsg
suddenly I open this chat I was wondering what app allows your neighbor to list chilli to pluck,btohqsg
Even here put 1000 each month and thereâ€™s a tracker,btohqsg
I know got app to list item u want to giveaway de,btohqsg
I think it's olio right? I used that recently to give away Kiehls facial wash that my skin not suitable for anymore recently,btohqsg
Not exactly sure coz my friend mention it before,btohqsg
Hi all  I recently purchased a flight ticket around 2k using uob ladyâ€™s card (i picked travel as a category when I signed up recently). I see that I have only 400 uni$ for this ticket. Is this correct? Seems too little,btohqsg
His app don't have the tracker weirdly. Hopefully it gets fixed with a reinstall haha,btohqsg
Have you read the TnC when the rest will be credited to your account?,btohqsg
Which part of the t&c? Im not sure if they credit the rest at all and more worried if they made a mistake in assigning my categories,btohqsg
Can recommend what broker apps good to buy funds?,btohqsg
btw if u using uob lady platinum (not solitaire) bonus uni$ only capped for $1k eligible spend,btohqsg
whatâ€™s cards can get points for utilities & internet bills ?,btohqsg
Trying to learn more about CC miles!I just apply 3 CC -> citibank rewards  uob lady  and SC smart.im thinking to apply one or two more CC which are the UOB preferred or UOB krisflyer.I heard applying too much CC might affect my credit score. Anyone got the same experience? Also if i request to increase my UOB credit card limit from 2k-3k  Do u think it will affect the credit score.Fyi i also have UOB Evol which i probably gg to cancelWorry about credit score hahaha.,btohqsg
I have solitaire and this is my only spending this month,btohqsg
You can try to apply but whether get rejected or not depends on the bank themselves. But unlikely will affect your credit score for increasing limit or getting more cards. Unless you're planning to get bank loan  no need to worry about credit score.,btohqsg
For retirement planning  is investing in Lion-OCBC Securities APAC Financials Dividend Plus a good option to receive regular payout? Like to hear some opinions from this group. Thank you,btohqsg
Capped at 2k for solitaire  but 400 UNI$ now is still correct.,btohqsg
Not so fast hahaha. Prob get house loan in 4 yrs time,btohqsg
400 or 4000 for the bonus category?,btohqsg
What you define as it is good? This is an investment which means dividend if market is good may go up or go down if market is bad. Or it may not be not be given if there is market crash. You are taking more risk in returns for potentially higher returns of 5% monthly.,btohqsg
What about the bonus then? Of I understand correctly it will be given next month?,btohqsg
Hi  how many days does it take to port in to ZYM? How long will it take for the sim card to arrive?,btohqsg
It's in the t&c on when both base and bonus gets rewarded,btohqsg
2-3 working days upon arrival. As early and as late you can pick on the website.,btohqsg
If i collect the sim card from the physical store  port in will still take 2-3 working days?,btohqsg
hi all  i remember i used to have 1 aapl share in both moomoo and tiger like 4 years back(both is free from new account). now i login to both  seems like i dont even have an account with them? can login but no trading account. anyone has any idea?,btohqsg
Hi  did anyone apply for SCB CNY bonussaver promotion in February and got their rewards ?,btohqsg
Can I check if your crmc+amaze transaction is with the physical card or mobile contactless.. cause i have problem using mobile contactless today,btohqsg
From what I tried  collect in the morning 11am. Port in happen during midnight on that day itself,btohqsg
Mine is physical card.. I canâ€™t use mobile contactless for Amaze cos no Apple pay.,btohqsg
Alright.. nxt time I'll bring my physical card along.. not sure why mobile contactless doesn't work.. thxxGSx@qqplaces,btohqsg
Some time other country machine cant use google pay  so just bring physical card,btohqsg
Uob one card link to shopback for payment counted as $500 spending?,btohqsg
Using Singtel network  so mostly good coverage. But recently got an issue between their network and Singtel so went down for quite a few hours  even their app went down.,btohqsg
Registering for uob big savings end apr and earmarked 50K  means the effective interest rate for 150K is 4.5% per annum in May ?,btohqsg
The collection of sim is only available at their 6 outlets? Cos i see under locate us there are 20 locationsAlso  need to make any payment in their physical shop? Or can make the first time payment in the app?,btohqsg
Yes  it's 4.5% p.a. over the next 4 months. But the cash credit comes in May  so you technically get the 0.5% p.a. for the next 4 months instantly in May.,btohqsg
Oh you opted for sim delivery?,btohqsg
sadly my office site @ paya lebar  is not able to receive their cellular network. But data network is okay  which puzzles me.,btohqsg
If Singtel have poor coverage there  it's gonna be the same for ZYM.. these kind of weird coverage usually you'll see better results on M1 or SIMBA ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
My name is Anna from Singapore what about your self??,btohqsg
Hi. How to get the 4% in uob one account from 1 May onwards? Assuming my account has 100k now. Do i just transfer 50k in on 1 May?,btohqsg
