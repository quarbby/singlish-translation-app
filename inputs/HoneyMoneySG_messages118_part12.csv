Got 4.6% for invite? ü§ØOh invite don‚Äôt care about incremental?,btohqsg
If only first salary might be tough. You can try to apply and they will likely reject and ask for more documents. Then you upload and send them.Alternatively get secured cc for the time being.,btohqsg
Yea lor I moving it to hsbc ega thanks,btohqsg
No. Best I heard is 3.6% pa. Until 31 August,btohqsg
don't have  i think only 3.55% or 3.6%,btohqsg
4.6 % = 3.55 % fresh + 0.05% prevailing +1% GIRO payment cashback,btohqsg
Very low. T-Bill still higher and at discount.,btohqsg
Got 4% already can laugh ü§£,btohqsg
Not really comparable because one is savings one is 6 months lock in,btohqsg
Using fixed deposit as collateral for your cc. With 80% of the fixed deposit value as credit limit.,btohqsg
I got rejected by OCBC even after I had all the premium cards.Stating I do not meet $30k p.a salary requirement.,btohqsg
That 1% GIRO die die MS out of thin air la.,btohqsg
UOB lo. 1h16mins to laugh. üòπ,btohqsg
Hahaha end up one by one your premium cards kena cut,btohqsg
cham  how come i havent gotten any interest for June,btohqsg
GG. I already transferred out the money liao. üòÇ,btohqsg
That 30 days fresh fund clause has been in eSaver since the beginning.,btohqsg
Eh‚Ä¶ really ah? Then it serves like no purpose at all? I have been doing in & out as frequently as i needed and the interest credited has always been ADB x their advertised interest rate.Confirmed I step on that clause multiple times leh. But nothing happened.,btohqsg
I got less faith in SCB than HSBC. Their app is so bad ü§™,btohqsg
Have you updated your salary with UOB?,btohqsg
Woo this no.3 is big problem. Only July can earn wah lau,btohqsg
May I ask July promotion based on which month abd incremental increase please thanks,btohqsg
I updated with amex. Amex called me that my limit from $180k now is only $12k. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµAnd they said by right I cannot be holding 5 amex credit cards with them including the charge card due to not enough credit limit. ü´†,btohqsg
Well  sometimes banks write things into their T&Cs without the intent nor means to enforce it...,btohqsg
Yeah max is 3 credit + 1 charge,btohqsg
They out to find you already,btohqsg

I withdrew over first few days of June. Think I better not participate in July,btohqsg
Personally because I withdrawn from HSBC EGA on 1 Jun  I'm gonna keep my funds in SCB eSaver for the 2nd month ü§£,btohqsg
But my wife retired before I married her. And I retired when I married her.,btohqsg
Me too. But 3rd Jun ü•â üò≠,btohqsg
The other guy huge amounts of money in and out of his UOB One account  then when UOB asked him to provide proof of income  he couldn't give because he got no income. So end up they closed his account.,btohqsg
He went to appeal and was successful,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to tell whole world our story,btohqsg

New UOB earmark promo is here,btohqsg
Q2 promo amounts:20K: $80 (now: $100)50K: $250 (now: $300)100K: $550 (now: $700)150K: $1000 (now: $1100),btohqsg
So if I calculate correctly  at the 150K  the additional interest will be:$1100 / 4 months x 12 months / 150K = 2.2%?Plus UOB One normal interest about 4%. Total maybe 6.1%?,btohqsg
I know why they gave more  the earmark period seem longer now. Earmark in aug  release in dec is ard 5 month compare to last quarter of 4 month,btohqsg
150k tierBonus UOB one 4.0% p.a.Nation of savers 1.76% p.a.(1100/150000 * 12/5)Total 5.76% p.a. effective,btohqsg
5 months instead of 4 months now ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
All eir drop coz of the extra 1 month,btohqsg
5.6% pa for 5.5 months lock in.,btohqsg
Secretly drop the eir haha. But 5.6 quite good liao consider interest rate is dropping,btohqsg
And will affect subsequent promos since will take reference from mab of dec (funds still earmarked)?,btohqsg
Previously Uob one is 5% pa on $100k no lock in. Oh well.,btohqsg
