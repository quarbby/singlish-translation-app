OK  this is for the national saver promo  just wan to deposit on last day,btohqsg
Assuming you put in 100k  your MAB for July is 3225$ and you will get interest for that amount  which is 0.05%.,btohqsg
Cause stash need July mab to be higher than jun.. I find this very grey.. So if my only day which is 31st July in stash is higher than jun mab  is that OK.. Else how I 1 day meet entire month mab,btohqsg
can anybody advise which credit card is best for retail spending?,btohqsg
UOB nation saver is about fresh fund. You can still qualify for that. Just the usual UOB stash interest is very little due to low MAB.,btohqsg
you will get paid stash interest on that incremental MAB loh..let's say1st July = $1000 until 30th July31st July = +$150k.. balance is $151kYour July MAB = APPROX $150k / 31 = $4xxxThen you get bonus interest on $4xxx - June MAB loh x stash bonus rate,btohqsg
I won't recommend pump in last day or last few days...1. system recognition error2. you earn low interest on those last few daysBest is pump in on day 1. You earn the maximum interest on both the Bonus Interest as well as Earmark Promo.Hence I deem the National Saving Promo as 5.5 months lockin.,btohqsg
Yes  Uob acct rewards high interest for the last 25k/30k so better to pump in earlier in the month.,btohqsg
Got it  what is confusing is June I have 0$. 101k in may then the website show 101k for mab..so shld be 0 instead.. Thanks folks,btohqsg
u check early issit? uob haven't updated the MAB figure for June.. check again now?,btohqsg
i would argue you want to play the national savings promo.. you should maximise for the entire period.. otherwise you are locking in 5.5 months for a lower EIR..,btohqsg
As in u'll count starting from 1 Jul?,btohqsg
Yes  I check on 2nd July.. Thanks,btohqsg
Hi. Does UOB privi miles card able to get 1.4 mpd for MCC 7311 advertising services?,btohqsg
As long as mcc is not in exclusion list u will get 1.4 mpd  u can always ask cso in uob chat assist to cross check for u,btohqsg
Thanks! Didnâ€™t know thereâ€™s a UOB chat assist. Appreciate your reply,btohqsg
If that's the case then the realistic lock in is 6 months  since it makes more sense to keep the funds until end Dec given that u are locked in until 17 Dec,btohqsg
Actually as long as for month of jul u park in a higher yielding bank it is fine to transfer in last day of jul,btohqsg
yes true.. also right... 6 months then!,btohqsg
also can but you become JIT warrior loh..any earlier (say 1 day earlier) you earn peanut interest for the month,btohqsg
Yea that's what I did the last round  though Mt's point is it's probably easier and safer to just do it 1 Jul,btohqsg
since the competitor is HSBC 4.6%  vs UOB One 4%.... i would rather very much just dump into UOB One on Day 1 and keep until end of Month 6.,btohqsg
For uob one yes  but op is originally asking about stash,btohqsg
just saying ah.... hope i don't black mouth...31st july 6pm u want to transfer into UOB One liao..then HSBC kenna network down or system maintenance how?,btohqsg
More of UOB 6%. any amount missing between 125k and 150k is losing 6% in UOB one acct,btohqsg
Morning all  may I ask if HSBC Revolution Visa card can still earn 4 mpd from Anytime Fitness auto debit after July 15th?,btohqsg
hmm this line of thought... maybe a bit too early on saturday for my brain to follow.. but i 'sort of' get it but i don't think it is 6%,btohqsg
It's the tiered ADB  so the portion of ADB above $125k and up to $150k earns 6%. The EIR of the entire $150k works out to 4% (3% on first $75k  4.5% on next $50k  6% on last $25k).,btohqsg
Hello all  since xnap is down. Can Singaporeans use alipay to pay as an alternative to xnap at hawkers with SGQR?,btohqsg
but you are putting say $150k for 1 day on 31st July... do you really lose 6% p.a. on that one day?,btohqsg
Can anyone confirm if this way earn miles?,btohqsg
This way don't earn miles of we can't pay with alipay?,btohqsg
U cant use alipay as singaporean in singapore,btohqsg
U can only use alipay on china merchant using card,btohqsg
too chiem for me.. i rather keep it kiasu kiasi and easy..Day 1 put in.End of Month 6 take outWhole 6 months don't touch the Original + Earmark amount.(Bonus interest i will withdraw out  but keep $100 buffer at all times).No need to worry don't get earmark  get caught by any TNC  any clawback.,btohqsg
That's fine. End of the day just go with whatever works lah  be it 5.47% p.a. for 6 months or 5.76% for 5 months. For most people it's probably not worthwhile to min max that much.,btohqsg
thanks for correcting me 5.5 months is incorrect. Since have to keep until end of the month on last month.so 5.6% p.a. EIR won't be realised. It is 5.47% p.a.WORKINGS1100 / 150 000 / 6 * 12 = 1.47% earmark bonus+ UOB One 4% EIR = 5.47% p.a. for 6 months lockin,btohqsg
5.6% also not wrong  for those really want to put in end Jul instead of 1 Jul. ðŸ¤£But the Jul interest will messed up.,btohqsg
Any 1 try before using UOB one credit use as net to pay and will lock the 500? Or credit card cannot use as net to pay?,btohqsg
U can use credit card as nets but it wont count toward the 500 spending,btohqsg
Hi guys  just to check  after using the UOB debit one card for spending  how long will it take to reflect in the UOB one account for $500 min spend?,btohqsg
it will be updated the next day in the appsee other comments,btohqsg
Erm it is one day after transaction posting not after spending  have to be careful in reply when u are the admin,btohqsg
Anyone knows when using UOB ppv  in app apple pay vs using credit card itself are there any difference   if it is an eligible merchant for 4mpd,btohqsg
Debit card also need to be posted  it can take up to 14 day for debit card transaction to be posted.Debit card also goes thru visa/mastercard. It need to be posted to be count even thou money is debit immediately after usage,btohqsg
Debit card also need to be posted before it will be updated as spending for uob one  it can take up to 14 day for debit card transaction to be posted.,btohqsg
Wdym by it needs to be posted?,btohqsg
to fulfill the 500 min spending of UOB One account  the transactions need to be posted andnotpending,btohqsg
my bad. thanks for the sharing@qqplacesi will clear my comments to avoid confusion.,btohqsg
fulfil = movement of the tracker,btohqsg
