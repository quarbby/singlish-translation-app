Backtracking to this  wallet top-up has no fees and only earn instarem points  no rewards for CC. Linked payment has 2% fees  earn 50% instarem points but has rewards for some CC (e.g. 10X reward points for CRMC),btohqsg
Short answer: no.Long answer: watch the latest video for better high yield cash strategies or even the one on best high interest accounts now video.,btohqsg

Hi may I know what's the best card for miles and cash back for purchase of wedding rings?,btohqsg
offline or online? do a search viaheymax.aifor the merchant(s) u plan to buy from,btohqsg
In my opinion  there's no 'Best'; only the most Suitable depending on your spending profile..For most of us common retail Spenders  we won't be able to spend 'enough' in 2-3 years span (typical points/miles expiry within CC) to accumulate anything meaningful hence I would always advise going for CC that the points/miles won't expire; DBS Altitude/CITI Premiermiles..Unless you have a slew of big purchase upcoming 12 months  then it's best to go for whichever card that gives the highest MPD..,btohqsg
Unless you plan to buy wedding rings every month  just look at which sign up promo gives the best offer after spending on the rings.,btohqsg
You also need to check if the jeweller accepts credit card in the first place. Some smaller artisan jewellers only accepts paynow.,btohqsg
Are there any good REITs ETFs (ideally lower risks and reasonable yields) that you guys are investing in?Looking to build a stable income portfolio but not too keen on investing in individual REIT stock due to the higher potential risks.,btohqsg

Yes  don't use this rub***h card. Try OCBC TR,btohqsg
For everyone else - FYI eateries/some-cafes like Kopitiam  Koufu  Starbucks also code as 5814 (in case anyone still intends tohold),btohqsg
Walao another day another OCBC nerf,btohqsg

If that card is no different from FnF why keep it then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
"Just when I thought the OCBC app ""overreach"" issue (the 'security feature') was bad enough lol",btohqsg
HYSA lo  but ya its a rub**** card now with this,btohqsg
Honestly 365 360 both kinda mid,btohqsg
Better off using UOB One with UOB One Card (tho i use lady's card cause... miles üåπ),btohqsg
Limited spending so EVOL for me üëçüèª,btohqsg
How does STI REITs compares with other REITs such as VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF)? I checked their yield  it is pretty comparable  VNQ with a higher AUM and more diversification  it should be less volatile (hence safer option) than STI REITs right?,btohqsg
I guess it depends on where you want to invest. If you want other overseas REITs  then a foreign ETF is the way to go,btohqsg
As a non US citizen  even if I do choose to invest in US REITS  I won't be taxed on the dividend income right?,btohqsg
will still be taxed. If you want to be taxed lower amount  use Irish domiciled ETFs,btohqsg

Like to know as well  and any underlying fees or conditions *probably higher risk  hence higher return,btohqsg
