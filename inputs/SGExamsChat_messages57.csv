If people do the book alr,btohqsg
What is ‚Äútortoise dont laugh at turtle‚Äù,btohqsg
If u know what I mean,btohqsg
What in the fuck does this mean,btohqsg
Technically they can don‚Äôt ask a bilateral Q  but knowledge of bilateral rs is needed for a higher level answer in other kinds of Qn still,btohqsg
if they remove eg crime and punishment then it 100% won't show up,btohqsg
They are removing topics not modifying papers,btohqsg
Proofs in plane geometry not in syllabus  does it mean I can start spamming about plane geometry in this group.,btohqsg
Why they nvr remove IH  and only SEA for H2 Hist,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no fixed topic for GP,btohqsg
Dear all members  to avoid spams we have temporarily set a time limit of 1 hour to messages. We will lift restrictions once the situation has stabilised. Thank you.,btohqsg
Do u learn IH or SEA first,btohqsg
"But they alr know the qns set so they can be like ""no crime n punishment"" this year",btohqsg
I just see whatever the syllabus doc give for those I dun take,btohqsg
I had no trouble doing at all,btohqsg
But humanities I not so sure for JC,btohqsg
Cheh not all subj they list chronological order,btohqsg
Coz the history syllabus doc does it by paper,btohqsg
H1 math has all H2 math stats,btohqsg
H1 has all the boring stuff,btohqsg
FM stats is where it is at,btohqsg
If you say lit cannot take away a whole book  CSE also cannot take away anything,btohqsg
Idk how CSE will work tho,btohqsg
CSE is like China GP LOL,btohqsg
Coz H1 is non-research so that is fine,btohqsg
China GP =/= GP in Chinese,btohqsg
But to get higher marks need skill,btohqsg
But idk how it work anyways,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a glass ceiling for those that don‚Äôt exhibit the skill,btohqsg
Their definition of skilled based is those subjects with like no topics,btohqsg
H3 math idk what they‚Äôll remove haha,btohqsg
If they don‚Äôt remove anything no one will notice,btohqsg
Honestly number theory they can test almost anything,btohqsg
Change H3 to 'H3 Mathematical Education',btohqsg
The last thing I learn was sequences and series,btohqsg
'Start a project to research and communicate a single mathematical idea concisely',btohqsg
‚ÄòLearn‚Äô coz it‚Äôs just using H2 math sequences and series,btohqsg
But then the sad thing for CSE  they can say remove yes  but teacher still have to test  coz you lose out if you don‚Äôt use the content to link to other chapter Qn  using content from another chapter to create higher order answer for the main asked chapter is an explicit req for new syllabus,btohqsg
Tbh that‚Äôs also true for econs,btohqsg
H1 econs is pretty much u remove one economic goal,btohqsg
"""Valued Contributor"" alert  from that other group.",btohqsg
Hi Yuxiang let‚Äôs have a fruitful discussion here üòÉ,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs nothing we can do but ban on sight,btohqsg
Example possible H3 Mathematics topics:1. Cosets2. Almost functions3. Stable Cohomotopy4. Etale schemes,btohqsg
MT exam move means they have to like go MT exams after lesson,btohqsg
H7 mod 4 is H3. ez,btohqsg
But if they remove Impact of Climate Change it‚Äôs a huge irony for our current situation tho,btohqsg
Well the geog topic for Os they removing is how to deal with infectious disease,btohqsg
And then another topic they can remove for bio is also infectious disease,btohqsg
Reading cobid blogs online will be sufficient education for this,btohqsg
Pure Geog alr removing that topic haha,btohqsg
Lit removing one book sounds stupid,btohqsg
I still stand by how understanding COVID stuff was easier for me because I took H1 Bio,btohqsg
But that depends on what schools teach last,btohqsg
When the fluff of syllabus docs actly comes true,btohqsg
Next thing u see 2 years later in H2 bio exam u see covid,btohqsg
No one said it was fake anyway,btohqsg
We learn too  it‚Äôs squeezed into our climate change ext abit,btohqsg
Probably gonna be remove tho tbh,btohqsg
Unless they deem H1 no need to remove,btohqsg
But ext topic is usually free marks  if they remove,btohqsg
Easier papers compared to the other years,btohqsg
Jk 2018 was alr hard enough,btohqsg
Then physics they removing nuclear physics which is also free marks,btohqsg
They literally removing all the free marks,btohqsg
Transition metals is also free marksBut they removed it anyways,btohqsg
So what happened while I was gone,btohqsg
I found O Level Chem interesting lol,btohqsg
I got added in there idk why,btohqsg
I started hating Chem when I started learning Org Chem,btohqsg
What was it supposed to be for anyway,btohqsg
Chem was fun until Org Chem happened,btohqsg
A level org chem much more fun,btohqsg
Some ambitious idiot trying to build huge groups,btohqsg
U know the admin of that guy is the guy i talked abt right,btohqsg
Trying to sow discord in Singapore boomers,btohqsg
I was actually gonna mention that to you,btohqsg
I was tiltedCos not the first time i got added to his grp,btohqsg
hi guys is there a way to backup telegram messages,btohqsg
Boomers should continue to use WhatsApp,btohqsg
It should be always hosted online,btohqsg
U dun need to backup anything,btohqsg
His minions are prob in here,btohqsg
okay great thanks now I can reset my phone in peace,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why discord doesn‚Äôt have problems with weirdos adding their members to weird discord‚Äôs,btohqsg
What can his minions doGo BABABABABNANABA? Haha,btohqsg
If u all want some background info abt that guy,btohqsg
We need people who get added in to keep a lookout of who added them in,btohqsg
Thinks the whole world is dumb as they disagree with him,btohqsg
B is not a valid erm what do you call AT(U)GC again?,btohqsg
WTF a guy with such credentials running MLM?,btohqsg
I rmb in his covid grp he posted a pic of the old man buying a lot of eggs in his metal trolley,btohqsg
Turns out he wasnt a hoarder,btohqsg
Tbh I still wonder why MLM hasn‚Äôt been explicitly outlawed yet,btohqsg
Ugh I feel like MLM falls under the same category as dorm situation  ignore until explode,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs not even illegal in the letter,btohqsg
Have encoutered Law -> Med people  and Med -> Law people before. Brain smart  street dumb usually. Often chasing things that don't matter.,btohqsg
Ignore until half of SG is in an MLM cult,btohqsg
It is? Then why do we never see anybody getting jailed for operating MLMs ever,btohqsg
No lol. MLM and Insurance as it is currently have the same market structure.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a pyramid  it‚Äôs a reverse funnel!!,btohqsg
If you want to ban MLM you need to tighten insurance sales even more,btohqsg
Insurance is a direct selling association,btohqsg
iirc insurance is explicitly allowed as an MLM,btohqsg
Yes but you cannot allow A and disallow B so easily,btohqsg
Well  moral of the story is just don‚Äôt be greedy for fast and easy stuffs,btohqsg
Not if you want to be called a 'free market',btohqsg
So I Guess the point is why am I seeing articles on sexual predators without putting in the effort to Google  but I need to google to see news about busted mlm,btohqsg
Ban MLMs:List out what constitutes an MLM  what is banned etcClause that states the above does not apply to registered insurance companies,btohqsg
Seek a lawyer/law student bro ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
But non-product-based MLMs are already banned,btohqsg
The snake oil sellers aren't banned under current rules,btohqsg
We‚Äôre not. Look at the mask situation.,btohqsg
So long story short no difference,btohqsg
Better to solve one issue than to reject the solution since it doesn't resolve everything,btohqsg
"It's all ""You trust me right? Give me your $""",btohqsg
Actually any MLM company out there that you know of?,btohqsg
Maybe can share some so we can spread awareness,btohqsg
But there's a list of the MLMs on r/sg,btohqsg
I feel they like to target students like us,btohqsg
dont forget those who just ord-ed,btohqsg
Like the typical ‚Äúhey wanna make fast and quick cash? Join our seminar to learn more!‚Äù,btohqsg
But I guess there are people who actually made a lot of money from MLMsNot advocating! But I guess MLMs suit them,btohqsg
Those are the people who manage to get other people to sell,btohqsg
it means they smart also la,btohqsg
Had a friend previously who went to one meeting thinking it was interesting,btohqsg
Turns out it‚Äôs was a lot of rubbish lol,btohqsg
Don't worry I've experienced it b4 top,btohqsg
but there are actually people in Amway that got rich doing it like,btohqsg
I see them going on trips to Dubai,btohqsg
May be for vanity purposes but dubai and cruise trips aren't cheap so,btohqsg
I am pretty sure the owner of the MLM is rich,btohqsg
"also this is part of the recruitment cus when ppl see em going and being successful they'll be like ""damn that could be me too""",btohqsg
And like apparently one of the guys in the higher ranks didn't manage to go coz NS and in return he got 10k,btohqsg
But to do MLM in NS really tarnish your reputation,btohqsg
He would be suffering in camp especially when your platoon mates know what despicable business model you are into,btohqsg
Ya ik those MLM ppl constant fLEX,btohqsg
like those In the higher ranks,btohqsg
And also there are fAMILIES in MLMs too,btohqsg
like they bring their young kids to learn all these MLM stuff,btohqsg
Yes this is the sad part,btohqsg
but the guy I talking abt right  his whole family all MLM one  all of them upper ranks,btohqsg
Just why isn‚Äôt MLM awareness even covered anywhere from NE to Civics Moral Ed sia,btohqsg
coz got some MLMs r allowed,btohqsg
MLMs literally perpetuate rich get richer poor get poorer,btohqsg
but instead of MLMs they're called direct selling companies,btohqsg
Because they fundamentally exploit the poor to get free ü§ë,btohqsg
There are people who made some money and people who made a lot of money.The question to ask is1. Is it you?2. Do you want to do it?,btohqsg
Yep! But to the govt  Tupperware is legal becoz it's a direct selling company,btohqsg
and don't rely on your opinion right?,btohqsg
Ik but the way MLMs do things,btohqsg
Even my friend's mom is cmg after me,btohqsg
wear nice nice go their building,btohqsg
"The other is Imran style. ""I teach you how to do marketing and sales  so you can also teach other people how to do marketing and sales  so that they can also teach other people how to do marketing and sales.......""",btohqsg
then tell me help them sell magic mattress,btohqsg
i ask them for price they tell me few thousand,btohqsg
when i ask if i need to source for customers myself  then they silent lmaoo,btohqsg
Why? It's just cheating and scamming.,btohqsg
If you're uncomfortable at cheating and scamming bbbbbbbbbbbbboi you need to look at capitalism,btohqsg
but I won't do it uh,btohqsg
AKA  you'd rather submit to AAPL,btohqsg
I tried searching it and I see the apple company,btohqsg
How is AAPL cheating and scamming tho,btohqsg
But otherwise  I think Apple isn't that bad la.,btohqsg
How is this scamming and cheating!? People need wheels to get around!The invention of wheels was a turning point in Human Civilisation.,btohqsg
It's not really within the 'great' category,btohqsg
For one thing I will never tolerate any company that deliberate makes my older shit even more useless,btohqsg
That's like a corporate company installing malware,btohqsg
McDonald's closed until 4 May or 1 June,btohqsg
ü•§ You can still get bubble tea at i love taimei  which has been exempted from closure. However  all bubble tea orders will have to be purchased with food.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/2zoi2HP,btohqsg
The statement still says 4 May,btohqsg
Because they serve food.Apparently Sbux which serve food (practically all? or just .... all) also not closed.,btohqsg
IMO they should have been even more decisive,btohqsg
so if a bbt shop sell snacks  they are exempted!?,btohqsg
All these luxuries-based food should shut,btohqsg
Like if u sell snacks and drinks   basically a variety  you're exempted,btohqsg
If you sell any hot food  you're exempted.,btohqsg
So if you sell Nasi Goreng = exempted,btohqsg
whatever happened to novelty f&b businesses being closed down,btohqsg
There are quite a lot of bbt stores in coffeeshops,btohqsg
Anyway bbt is nice la but still,btohqsg
Just don't drink for one month,btohqsg
You'll be sitting at home everyday anyway,btohqsg
May not be just one month,btohqsg
I suspect this only the beginning,btohqsg
We still might have a second wave,btohqsg
We are alr hit with the second wave lol,btohqsg
I think this is the first,btohqsg
That one is beginning. Not even significant,btohqsg
Not sure what that means to countries like Italy with huge numbers at the beginning,btohqsg
2nd wave might come in around August or September,btohqsg
theres no 2nd wave if everyone is responsible,btohqsg
jk  if flights are reopened then yes,btohqsg
The flights should be the very last phase towards business as usual,btohqsg
If our Govt ever unban tourists before movement control within SG is 100% relaxed  I‚Äôll facepalm,btohqsg
Which can help w covid 19,btohqsg
until i saw this... then nvm,btohqsg
i saw that and thought of my fren,btohqsg
That one really need to apprehend sia,btohqsg
Before that we was selling turmeric,btohqsg
Even the MLM person that has an office near my workplace  is more ethical than that,btohqsg
Sell stuff that claim can boost immunity but strong caveat excluding COVID19,btohqsg
i almost thought we had 10000 cases in 1 day...,btohqsg
sir  imma stop you right there,btohqsg
got one new cluster near my workplace,btohqsg
Wow  I hope you‚Äôre ok  try to get a swab test done,btohqsg
That would bring us to DORSCON BLACK,btohqsg
now still got pyramid scheme ah,btohqsg
An insignificant attack is still an attack,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionsomeone made acjc in minecraft lmao,btohqsg
looks like you‚Äôll have to download instagram ü§ßü§ß,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt you just download the map pack or something,btohqsg
but i want you to make an ig account,btohqsg
Youre right it needs to be 3 times the size,btohqsg
size doesnt matter it‚Äôs how you use it,btohqsg
It works with the brain too right,btohqsg
There is a somewhat linear correlation observed and to certain extent explained however to a small extent due to genetics and neural-plasticity,btohqsg
Everyone freaked out about the bbt,btohqsg
But no one freaks out about the stoppage of manufacture of chocolates  cakes  ice cream  etc,btohqsg
Need to cut obesity rates in SG,btohqsg
Everyone on a diet until covid is over,btohqsg
I wish I had an oven big enough lol,btohqsg
Pls close down all fast food outlets,btohqsg
Close down everything sweet and unhealthy,btohqsg
HAHAHA cannot la idh food handling cert,btohqsg
what's exercise when CB you just grow fatter and fatter,btohqsg
Sell where the government doesn‚Äôt look,btohqsg
Which is why the government needs to close down all BBT stores,btohqsg
i can make my own bbt,btohqsg
i know how 2 make pearls,btohqsg
dalgona whatever the fuck you wanna drink,btohqsg
I give up trying to solve the 2DE,btohqsg
To solve them I prolly need to go back to Laplace Tranforms(easiest way to solve for step-funcs I think?),btohqsg
The  i realised not a lot are manufactured in sg,btohqsg
Is our cadbury from sg tho? I know there's one factory,btohqsg
My mom's birthday is soon though,btohqsg
Hope I can get a cake for her,btohqsg
I only have a microwave I guess,btohqsg
Oh! If you have a normal microwave you can make her a mug cake,btohqsg
Hmm I'll look up on that,btohqsg
We don't like bake or anything,btohqsg
So we don't have flour etc,btohqsg
Buying the materials might be wasteful,btohqsg
If you want something bigger and you own a hybrid microwave oven (those with convection settings) you can still make a normal cake,btohqsg
Prepare for her a nice meal,btohqsg
(Also try microwave mug cookies  I heard they are mega amazing to eat),btohqsg
Do you guys know where we can print notes and stuff,btohqsg
Can I follow you on ig,btohqsg
Guys pls followhttps://www.instagram.com/gov.sgfor latest updates on COVID-19 and to avoid spreading misinformation#approved#ads,btohqsg
It‚Äôs very funny tbhThe most apt channel to advertise given that this is Telegram should behttps://t.me/GovsgNot all Telegram users are on IG LOL,btohqsg
Is there not going to be a mandatory‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave this up because it is an official source by the Govt  but please seek approval before advertising next time‚Äù? HAHAHA,btohqsg
It is for your last line,btohqsg
Well TBH if this group wants to not-promote Govt sources they would be in for a rough time,btohqsg
I know. But I was expecting an asterisk  but you didn‚Äôt seem to be typing. So  I did your job. Now  pay me.,btohqsg
Either FWIW I don't particularly believe that either the tele or insta gov sg propagate insidious propaganda aimed at subjugating the populace.,btohqsg
Pay you? But you not essential services!,btohqsg
Orh hor  now you made a mistake  break CB rules,btohqsg
I feel honoured to be able to view your stories,btohqsg
u are the admin from sg educators,btohqsg
Do you want us to ban both of them or what,btohqsg
What do u want us to do,btohqsg
Actually if you know any other of their accounts,btohqsg
That would be really nice info,btohqsg
Guys I have a question. If SAF says no need to book in until 1 June  and POP for my coy is on 6 June (given we only did BTP  HG for highkeys)  and ORD is not affected  what is the most probable highkey for the 5 days before POP,btohqsg
no gathering at all mah  commissioning parade in june alr cancelled,btohqsg
and also all no heat acclimatised,btohqsg

Ah I see  but outfield camp and SIT test possible in the 5 days?,btohqsg
if they make yall do better call safety hotline,btohqsg
at most maybe BIC but idk whats the pre-requisites cause i not bmt instructor,btohqsg
Erm chances are you will go to your respective TI for further training,btohqsg
For OCS and SCS cadets  training standards will continue to be upheld so y‚Äôall will still go through the same stuffs,btohqsg
Just that the curriculum will be very very packed,btohqsg
Depends where you go also lah,btohqsg
So what do you guys plan to do for national day,btohqsg
I thought every year a glorious celebration,btohqsg
is held at that stately place,btohqsg
I can remember as the glorious army marched past,btohqsg
Is it true that some topics for A Levels are not coming out this year?,btohqsg
What are the updates for h1 Econs?,btohqsg
I think someone sent a compiled list ytd,btohqsg
Ugh I've lost the ability to focus on anything that's not my smartphone,btohqsg
Was watching a 2h lecture and I kept getting distracted,btohqsg
Any key words you remember that I can use to search for the list?,btohqsg
wait hold up i just realised,btohqsg
o lvl pure chem only removed macromolecules  so means organic chem still involved?,btohqsg
Please proceed to the holding bay area,btohqsg
wah elimination removed for H3 chem,btohqsg
elimination is a major component of H3,btohqsg
wew H3 peeps have it better this year,btohqsg
I have become who i hated most,btohqsg
A proficient human being in chem,btohqsg
And therefore i am a nerd,btohqsg
Have fun rotting in SBS transit,btohqsg
Please step away from the yellow line,btohqsg
Someone has been adding people from this group into theirs,btohqsg
Remember to turn on your privacy settings so that you can‚Äôt be added into random groups!,btohqsg
Say you don‚Äôt want to be added in,btohqsg
I‚Äôm really tempted just to create a bunch of fake accounts and flood their group,btohqsg
I got added into the educators gro,btohqsg
Feel free to report spam and leave,btohqsg
Cause they‚Äôve been taking members from this group,btohqsg
i would make a fucking police report if there was any base for it,btohqsg
Remember to turn on your privacy settings so that you can‚Äôt be added into random groups!,btohqsg
LOL chill ah guys some of them can potentially be good business partners!!,btohqsg
I'm also randomly added into three groups,btohqsg
By someone with a US phone number,btohqsg
Would you do business with someone who effectively advertises on your group against your will?,btohqsg
Wtf nobody seems to understand sarcasm and to be neutral before taking a harsh stand!! Bye I am with the boomers,btohqsg
smh u dont understand john's highly advanced form of post-meta irony,btohqsg
and where did u get this info,btohqsg
Ceh dont doxx  even if the dude is annoying,btohqsg
and secondly  if it's not public info  das doxxing,btohqsg
It‚Äôs corroborated by someone else‚Äôs testimony from last year,btohqsg
Seems like the guy was in some groups before and got into some arguments with some people,btohqsg
Yes  we deleted it cause it‚Äôs doxxing,btohqsg
But we appreciate the info on the fake accounts,btohqsg
You are free to insult our admins here though,btohqsg
If you know more please let us know,btohqsg
He created many trouble in many groups,btohqsg
I thought it is public info.,btohqsg
you think i think who confirm,btohqsg
A Privacy AnnouncementOver the past couple of days  you may or may not have been added to a random group you‚Äôve never heard of. This is because the owner of that group is scraping users from the SGExams groups to artificially inflate their numbers.To avoid this happening to you  do remember tochange your privacy settings so that not everybody can add you to groups!To do so  just go to Settings->Privacy and Security->Groups and Channels->My contacts.Have a good day!Telegram rules and guidelines,btohqsg
an F for our fallen comrade in arms...,btohqsg
I think ‚Äúgerlyn‚Äù is busy student,btohqsg
@khotl73you see medicalgiant has been adding people from this group. All the accounts in there are fake,btohqsg
So you mean he is talking to himself there ?,btohqsg
why would he want to do that zzz,btohqsg
It‚Äôs an unethical way of making a big group,btohqsg
But why do those people still stay there if they dont like to be added ? They can leave the group,btohqsg
id go march right in tell them to shove the group up their ass,btohqsg
The issue is that he‚Äôs going to someone else‚Äôs group and taking their members without permission,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just as good as posting ads on a huge group without the owner‚Äôs permission,btohqsg
So what can u do abt it?,btohqsg
meh but like the members are not value adding leh what's the use HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Nothing  except warn our users about it,btohqsg
but they just gonna leave the grp or not talk or be like milo HAHAHA,btohqsg
He add unwilling people. But these ppl dont chat,btohqsg
the assumption is people don't give a shit,btohqsg
I still see a lot in the grp sia,btohqsg
he created many fake accounts to chat among themselves,btohqsg
It‚Äôs for the sake of money,btohqsg
Having a large Telegram grp will have money meh,btohqsg
seems perfectly normal for the internet,btohqsg
He charges people to post ads on the group,btohqsg
lmao advertise to his non value adding members,btohqsg
He keeps attacking other groups and support his own group,btohqsg
Ppl will then defect to his group,btohqsg
wah I wonder what grp he'll attack next,btohqsg
maybe its one of the porn groups,btohqsg
He posted porn in other groups before,btohqsg
And ppl left the group when they see it,btohqsg
how do you even know all this,btohqsg
I am in  others group. He created lots of trouble in other groups.,btohqsg
@khotl73he has been creating many accounts to circumvent the ban,btohqsg
dude wtf is it that limkopi wtf grp,btohqsg
attention seeking is more like it,btohqsg
Why add ppl don't need permission one,btohqsg
I asked you to leave in that group  and they deleted my message,btohqsg
"Someone with the name ""... Girls""",btohqsg
You have to add that setting yourself,btohqsg
prob left brfore u did anyways,btohqsg
got girls in their name somemore uh,btohqsg
time to add ‚Äúdont add ppl into grps‚Äù for our new rule üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
The people doing this aren‚Äôt the kind of people who follow rules,btohqsg
i mean if she or he had been involved in our convos,btohqsg
All we can do is remind everyone here,btohqsg
unless they the bitcoin wtv kinda ppl,btohqsg
To change privacy settings so that you can‚Äôt be added into groups by random people,btohqsg
i wanna drive his head up the wall,btohqsg
dude‚Äôs an attention seeker at this point,btohqsg
dude but the timer buff between messages tho,btohqsg
one grp was fking one hr,btohqsg
smh ppl advertise in my grp with their bitcoin bs and i wasnt informed to charge them,btohqsg
if i knew ads cld be charged i‚Äôd  have been a rich bitch,btohqsg
He wants to prevent ppl from complaining why are they added inside,btohqsg
dk sir but if ur message was deleted it was definitely someone else,btohqsg
took him the effort lets give him a medal,btohqsg
lets all go in and spam,btohqsg
but still is it efficient tho,btohqsg
wld rather throw moolah in stonks,btohqsg
then to sit at the computer trying to hold a convo witth urself,btohqsg
If u write something negative  he will mute u. He wont ban u. Cause he wants u to be in his member list,btohqsg
theres one place without the one hr,btohqsg
one got like 30 sec timer,btohqsg
Do u see ads on this group,btohqsg
These are his fake accounts. Gerlyn  Boris Johnson  Charles  Junxiang. He use these fake accounts to chat among themselves. To pretend that there is a lively conversation,btohqsg
wait a minute junxiang and boris johnson?,btohqsg
i definitely talked to the both of them before,btohqsg
He create fake accounts faster than amobea cell division,btohqsg
