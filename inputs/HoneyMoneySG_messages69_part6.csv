The best is the 6 months and 1 year T bill or FD from banks. Don’t touch those money fund products,btohqsg
Very subjective  depending on individual’s circumstances. If you have spare cash and not able to yield more than Sora 3m + spread  than do clear your mortgage. If you’re near your retirement age  getting a loan will no longer be easy  so you may want to keep the mortgage within arm’s length and maintain the relationship with your bank. Again  many scenarios and fluid  no one right or wrong answer… hope that helps,btohqsg
Go to Menu at the bottom  then you will see Promotion Centre. It's there,btohqsg

HSBC Everyday Global Account | The Multi-Currency Account that Everyone should havehttps://youtu.be/iebYTbH8hYY,btohqsg
Anyone applied for HSBC Revolution card first and then the Everyday Global Account? What’s the process like?,btohqsg
HSBC nerfed the long-running bonus interest program the previous time it was mass-advertised. Hope this does not happen again for the Everyday+.,btohqsg
When you applied for HSBC Revolution  there is a page/section where they will ask if you want to apply for EGA as well. You can set it so that EGA is applied only if the CC is approved. Iirc,btohqsg
ah guess i missed this selection  so i’m applying for EGA separately. Just that it’s strange because in the ibanking it says i’m not eligible and i have to submit a request on the website,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone advise what is the best way to get cheaper Cathay tickets for my aged parents who are movie buffs who want to go to the movies together. The tickets are so ex nowadays. My dad is already getting the senior vouchers but my mum is not 55 yet so she cannot use them. Will appreciate any good suggestion. Thank you!,btohqsg
I applied for both EGA and Revolution card last Thursday. My EGA was approved last Thursday and the Revolution card was approved last Friday. It was fast to be honest. I gotten the physical Revolution card this week Tuesday and physical debit card on Wednesday.Then again  I find the user interface for the ATM and Ibanking horribly non-intuitive. I also made a stupid mistake of using Revolution card to withdraw money at ATM  thinking I could select my EGA for the cash  then kena cash advance instead. FYI  the HSBC ATM does not show which source of cash withdrawal you will be using; so credit card at HSBC ATM will always be cash advance (unlike the other local banks).,btohqsg
So for the EGA can I transfer 2k in and out the same day and still eligible for the 1% giro cashback?,btohqsg
yes if u mean out 5x min $1,btohqsg
No  I mean out 1 time 2k. The 5x my giro is sufficient to meet,btohqsg
ok. $2k in can be FAST out same day. Pls note that (esp. in the first month) the 1% will be awarded only after the 5 transactions is met. Can easily meet it using 5x FAST out.,btohqsg
Better to invest to OA to the upcoming 6 mth t bills or wait for the 1 year t bill next week ?,btohqsg
Berries as per max is 7399  will earn 10mpd with crmc+amaze?,btohqsg

Hi guys  just received this statement from dbs for my cpfoa. It's my first time applying for t bills and I'm having difficulties comprehending this statement. If I paid 24535 for a 25000 T bill means I'm only getting 1.86% yield which is lower than cpf 2.5% ? O.o,btohqsg
If u dun mind GV  can consider GV HSBC movie card...😊https://www.gv.com.sg/GVVouchersAndGiftCards-HSBC,btohqsg
6mths t bills and yr yield divided by half.. that’s why the rate,btohqsg
Oh I see now. Thank you!,btohqsg
Seems like more than CPF 2.5%? 6 months 24535 in CPF only yield 306.The t-bill yield is 465 which is 3.8%.,btohqsg
Do you mean crmc exclude 7399?,btohqsg
Hi guys I’m currently in ns and I’m thinking of putting some of my money that I had over the pass few months into the DBS time deposit  u think is worth it for a ns guy?,btohqsg
DBS time deposit a bit low for the rates  you can try CIMB Fastsaver or Chocolate Finance but pls do your own due diligence,btohqsg
3.2% over 12 months tho  what’s the % for cimb?,btohqsg
I also put some inside the pruwealth plus tho  so thinking to put some more inside time deposit,btohqsg
if you are looking for FD  can use this link >>https://sgfd.neocities.org/>> In short there is better FD out there,btohqsg
But foe now aren't cash funds / t bills better,btohqsg
Oh  or is there another ways to save up my ns allowance?,btohqsg
Currently have some savings in the pruwealth plus,btohqsg
The past few 6-month T-bills have an interest of >=3.7% p.a. which beats most (if not all Timed Deposits atm). Downside is you can only buy in 1 000sSo maybe that's an avenue you want to explore? For cash funds  like someone already mentioned  chocolate finance is currently offering up to 4.5% p.a.? Other cash funds (eg Fullerton SGD cash fund) can be purchased from brokers like moomoo. I think the YouTube channel has topics on this for you to search up on :),btohqsg
I'd advise to avoid insurance investment products as much as possible  imo...While in NS  do educate yourself on financial knowledge and investments  as much as possible......😊,btohqsg
I see still newbie about all this stuff,btohqsg
