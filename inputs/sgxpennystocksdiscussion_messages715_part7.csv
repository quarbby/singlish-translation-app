Today there were sellers at $0.001 for AP Strategic before buyers grabbed up.Seems like a desperate seller throwing to recoup some to pay recent losses ?Anyways  I reckon $0.001 if can get  maybe can keep some for fun. still worth a gamble at this price.With Oei Hong Leong being SSH  there is financial backing and security which makes this one hard to go into suspension due to insolvency. Hence  $0.001 does looks like durians. Any pip up is 100% gain?Quite a decent gamble I would say.Do note there are 10 billion warrants to convert at $0.002 expiring by 31st Jan 2023. Hence  if company wants to raise this funds  we might see a pump come by then.Let’s see. Anyways  $0.001 can get I think safe.,btohqsg
