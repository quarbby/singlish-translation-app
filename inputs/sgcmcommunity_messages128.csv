Plus an upgrade or downgrade is subjective,btohqsg
If u from a BMW X1 change tona 5 series  issit an upg or downgrade?,btohqsg
Or BMW X1 change to Mercs GLB 250,btohqsg
It all depends on what you want lor,btohqsg
But I will always be triggered if someone looks down upon hyundai and kia after what they’ve been doing snd producing,btohqsg
Yeap. A few yrs time I gna be needing an suv alr,btohqsg
Like for me I’d rather get a 3.3 stinger than an R35,btohqsg
I’m not saying kia is better than bmw,btohqsg
maybe kia better than Bus Mrt Walk :P,btohqsg
Plus i didnt compare to any car also her😂😂,btohqsg
I haven say KIA IS BETTER THAN BMW. U did LOL,btohqsg
To have a mindset of a “downgrade” whenever you think about kia  is something you should throw away right now,btohqsg
Sure maybe in 2010 you’re right,btohqsg
sure downgrade in terms of branding but upgrade your lousy conti personality,btohqsg
korean car have surpass japanese car imo,btohqsg
I wud say for some reason around 2013 to 2015 their cars gotten much nicer looking and morw reliable,btohqsg
japanese sports cars still better though,btohqsg
I think avante N is better,btohqsg
It really gave a WOW factor when released,btohqsg
hyundai N division is just an extension of BMW M sports,btohqsg
oh yes that i agree too,btohqsg
Everyone play nice ahhhhhh 😂All entitled to their own opinions. But indeed  KIA has been improving a lot over the years and deserves credit for it.- E,btohqsg

Thanks shall try buffing. It's penetrated the topcoat a bit,btohqsg
It's very minor  once you buff out  probably not visible,btohqsg
Not worth touching up either  the touch up paint will stick out more than the chips,btohqsg
find a cute sticker and paste over it,btohqsg
we can help you make a bigger dent then put a goku figurine there,btohqsg

Got alot problems anot ah? I saw one depre 11k HAHHA,btohqsg
I think for Singapore hot temperatures  COE  service support industries  it’s better to buy Japanese/Korean cars  owners can renew 1x COE too  drive 20 yrs no problem,btohqsg
ya but from 2030 can only buy non ice cars,btohqsg
Continental cars costs a lot to maintain after 5 yrs,btohqsg
We will see  it’s a plan target… 😅😅😅,btohqsg
Simple petrol cars still most effective for normal drivers  not EVs,btohqsg
Singapore government not going to make EVs COEs cheap also…,btohqsg
Tbf.. nth is cheap in Singapore,btohqsg
Dear all. I gonna scrap my Toyota  thinking of getting a balance 2.5yrs Lexus.  Anyone  have any good lobang ?,btohqsg
go back BM preowned? for service support and preowned 👍👍 it’s more expensive though,btohqsg
With the way COE is increasing  it is just a matter a time that Cat A goes up to 100k as well.,btohqsg
don’t think like that bro  our lives are most precious to our love ones  our families! 🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
whole sg car markets waiting for elections  PM Lawrence Wong to do magic and score points in his first term as PM year 2025,btohqsg
Hmm... car buyers in SG are not showing any wait-and-see signs. In fact  the rising COE is one telling sign that that buyers are not waiting at all. 😅,btohqsg
ppl are thinking dun buy now gna go up higher,btohqsg
With that in mind  the only way for lay people to own a car is when there is some form of policy to limit the car ownership. 😁,btohqsg
adds in to the frenzy actually,btohqsg
Ok leh  then I got the rcz & 207cc  both issues came after the 7 yrs .,btohqsg
Upon reaching 7 yrs   time to sell . That my opinion on both,btohqsg
But my friend told me it is getting better now,btohqsg
But i aiming golf or i30 now,btohqsg
Oh the one i saw abt 6 years alr,btohqsg
got turbo means got more maintenance/service  😅😅😅,btohqsg
Anything above 1.5 is a killer...Buy one car for the price of two. 😅,btohqsg
Big EVs cars are highly expensive,btohqsg
Hi may i know the spare tire? If need to pump. Wat pressure shall that be,btohqsg
If you open your driver side door  got all the details at the side,btohqsg
Best check the spec at the driver side door.,btohqsg
COE rising is highly contributed by car sharing company,btohqsg
Why would you think that way,btohqsg
Oh ok. I thought only for the 4 normal tyres,btohqsg
Then if lower  touch wood you need to use,btohqsg
Then later you need to change  your driving will be damn weird,btohqsg
spare tire max speed 80km/h and only recommended to go for about 100km.. this was what i was advised on previously,btohqsg
best is dont drag go tyre workshop fix alr,btohqsg
Highly contributed ah? Any stats to show that car sharing companies bidding the COEs higher? 😮,btohqsg
See how many cars they dropping,btohqsg
just see number of bluesg x getgo x car rental companies also,btohqsg
they are bidding for the same coe quota as us.,btohqsg
idk if u recall  one good example is when blue sg released 500  opel for their users,btohqsg
prior to the news release  coe was rising non stop esp cat A also,btohqsg
2022 Sept 1st and 2nd round bidding 86 and 84k respectively. October 2022 81k and 80k respectively. Aug 1st and 2nd 80k and 87k respectively.,btohqsg
u dun buy 500 cars in 1 bidding eitherway. so its about 2 months back,btohqsg
It's ridiculous that a family who needs a car for the kids is competing with commercial operators. Time for feedback to MP that will be monitored,btohqsg
The “one car per family” thing people are saying is a stupid way to make COE prices drop,btohqsg
MPs won't side with us... 😅,btohqsg
I’d rather have those car sharing platform to have their COE,btohqsg
there is no need… MP tell u public transportation good enough,btohqsg
only the rich gna have cars,btohqsg
the middle class will be squeezed downwards,btohqsg
just a matter of time before upper middle gets squeezed also,btohqsg
but then again MP never take public transportation one la so they wont understand… (can work part time earn 12k/month),btohqsg
https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/details/written-reply-to-parliamentary-question-on-rise-in-coe-prices-and-need-for-affordable-transport-solutions#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20that are%20driving%20up%20COE%20prices.Eg. of MPs turning a blind eye,btohqsg
u mean have their own separate COE?,btohqsg
😂😂😂😂 oops i tot 12 🙏🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
12k was when i in pri sch,btohqsg
Car sharing companies contribute significantly to higher coe prices  just that no evidence only  because consumers and taxi companies are also buying cars ma  that's why. Unless car sharing companies dun need to bid coe in order to put the cars on the road  then I'll believe.,btohqsg

How many of you here own 2 cars ?,btohqsg
You must be hanging out of people in the higher levels..,btohqsg

Yes but total number of cars remains the same sir,btohqsg

But car loan is secured ah so…,btohqsg
But lets not forget Sg is capped at 30% dp  70% loan max for purchases of cars,btohqsg
He's asking about full loan/high loan,btohqsg
Yes ik. Reminding him of the current regulations cus he's a civil servant. Like what Imran mentioned  FE.,btohqsg
End of the day  full/high loan is illegal so that’s why when you look it up  cannot,btohqsg
I heard full loan interest rates quite high... 4% or so?,btohqsg
You shouldn’t even full loan in the first place,btohqsg
Minimum 4+ now. But most people getting full loans don't have a strong profile so they're getting quotes 5 to 6% usually,btohqsg
Oh  so those with stronger profile gets lower?,btohqsg
Pay full amount   do not take loan   better,btohqsg
Anytime want to sell also can,btohqsg
Or just downpayment a comfortable amount w a monthly instalment u can afford to pay per month,btohqsg

Full cash also not the best idea,btohqsg
The SA ask me take mind 10k loan,btohqsg
Depends on how much your car is,btohqsg
If it's a significant amount  full cash not worth as you're hurting your liquidity and cash flow,btohqsg
Your money will be so much better somewhere else,btohqsg
In an ideal situation  most will just pay full amount for anything  don't you think? 😊,btohqsg
Not always  more times than not for big purchases if you can finance it's better because you can easily make the interest back,btohqsg
It really depends. Big ticket item u shud always keep spare cash in the event shit goes down. Eg something happened in the family or ur hse suddenly everything spoil need repair,btohqsg

Just taking a look at some options! Unless yall got any recommendations ~,btohqsg
Can consider finding an OPC car and convert,btohqsg
Wonder how many people do that and if it's worth it,btohqsg
Usually dealers will sell at the converted price,btohqsg
So far I see not worth it. Some opc depre I see same as normal depre,btohqsg
The up side of OPC is generally less used,btohqsg
Like that time my dad bought OPC because he will leave the house for work before 7am and end nearing to 7pm,btohqsg
Like i remember paying $100 for road tax LOL,btohqsg
Sorry you're referring to paying opc car same price as black plate worth it or opc program is worth it?,btohqsg
Dependin on what car you buy,btohqsg
Opc can be the bettee choice,btohqsg
