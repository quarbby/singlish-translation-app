If I pay using UOB VS with RM is it can earn x10? Afraid their payment gateway from SG,btohqsg
Just giro non fast to anyone with funds originate from uob one account or any uob account will clock as giro?,btohqsg
Can't really determine this. Cannot tell whether payment gateway is in sg or not. Depends on merchant. Esp for uob gateway need to be overseas. If not sure better use other cards.,btohqsg
i think the answer is almost always vcma first,btohqsg
6mpd for UOB ladyâ€™s has been extended to 31 March 2024,btohqsg
"hi guys..it this the ""one debit card cash rebate""? got a few dollars credit in...",btohqsg
hm...seems to be the final extension? otherwise they would put longer,btohqsg
Extend by 1mth only sadly haha,btohqsg
VCMA is â€˜superiorâ€™ to RSTU SA because VCMA gives the same tax relief as RSTU yet your money isnâ€™t quite as â€˜stuckâ€™. Thereâ€™s no way to withdraw MA in any situation other than to â€˜utiliseâ€™ it. However  amounts above BRS/FRS can be withdrawn at 55. So the earlier you hit BHS  the faster your mandatory contribution overflows from MA to SA which is withdrawal. Contrast this if you RSTU to SA  that top up canâ€™t be withdrawn,btohqsg
Can be credit card bills too. So you can sign up GIRO for DBS CC from UOB One account  and it counts. To be clear  that GIRO is the one where you send in paper GIRO form to DBS and itâ€™s a recurring deduction initiated by DBS,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is topping up GrabPay considered as qualifying spend?,btohqsg
Yes.. we need to spend minimum 500 per month on the UOB card .. this can be one GIRO and other one can be other banks credit cards as well.Setting up 3 GIRO may not be a challenge unless if there is a minimum amount on each GIRO,btohqsg
Why do you want to set up giro instead of crediting salary? The interest rate are a lot different,btohqsg
Thanks for replying. Yup I understand this. Itâ€™s just that VCMA is in a way also restricted by the CPF annual contribution limit of $37 740 (which includes both mandatory and voluntary contributions)My ordinary wages (OW) or monthly salary and additional wages (AW) or bonuses would most likely already hit the limit by the end of the year  so further voluntary contributions now via VCMA is not ideal I feel  as any excess mandatory contributions will be refunded back to my employer (correct me if Iâ€™m wrong)RSTU to SA to not limited by the CPF annual contribution limitAlso  itâ€™s not a must to hit the BHS (although I think just staying employed with mandatory MA contributions would hit the BHS eventually)  so not sure if I also need so much monies in my MA. Even though itâ€™s currently being used to pay for my hospitalisation  integrated shield plan and careshield life  itâ€™s just a tiny fraction every year. Not sure if I will fully utilise after retirement and in my old age (but guess this is also a blessing in disguise)On the other hand  at 55 my reserved SA monies will form bulk of my RA monies which will eventually be paid out to me in the form of CPF life payouts. So I will definitely utilise the monies,btohqsg
One consideration is many of us will hit BHS eventually. If so  then can consider hitting it earlier so that mandatory contributions flow to SA (which you will get via lump sum at 55 or via CPF life),btohqsg
Vcma is not limited by the contribution limit,btohqsg
Ya so why do you want to setup giro instead?,btohqsg
do you understand that once you hit bhs  all the contribution to ma will flow to sa? if yes and you also know that you will eventually also hit bhs via your mandatory contributions  then you will know your net amount in both accounts will be the same in say  10/20 years time.the only difference is that your sa will be fully unreserved if you topup ma. if you topup sa  that amount will be reserved,btohqsg
I canâ€™t change my salary account due to other personal reasons,btohqsg
Yup and that is why I said â€˜in a wayâ€™. Can refer to this dollars and sense article:https://dollarsandsense.sg/whats-maximum-amount-can-contribute-cpf-accounts-year/,btohqsg
Make a fast payment from your bank to uob and state it as salary payment,btohqsg
uob allows you to ownself transfer ownself  still count as salary,btohqsg
its not in any way. the article is referring to voluntary topup to 3 accounts as in at once ie vc3a,btohqsg
This Reddit post seems to explain it better.https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/17re86g/cpf_clarifications/,btohqsg
Oh ok. I think Iâ€™ll just call cpf to clarify this with them haha,btohqsg
this is referring to VC (specifically to OA/SA)  there's an after note for VCMA. VC cap is aligned with Mandatory contri cap because self-employed people should have the same caps as company-employed ones. but VCMA doesn't have that limit  the only limit is BHS,btohqsg
No fast payment from dbs works too,btohqsg
can confirm for this. as long as you select salary payment as category when xfering,btohqsg
This statement is true for every other banks except UOB. You don't deserve their lousy giro bonus interest rate.,btohqsg
seem like alot of people dunno about this. go spread to friends and families and milk this well deserved 5%,btohqsg
If you cannot meet salary credit requirements ($1.6k transfer into UOB One account)  then better off with a no-frills bank account that also meets 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Did you use the debit card?,btohqsg
What does the the tnc say?,btohqsg
Just clarified with cpf. Ok VCMA is not restricted by the cpf annual contribution limit and is only restricted by the BHS limit (the customer service person actually told me otherwise initially and then called back to clarify again and to  apologise for the mistake ðŸ˜‚ Guess cpf people can get it wrong too haha),btohqsg
VCMA isNOTlimited to the annual contribution limit.,btohqsg
Ohh thatâ€™s good lead .. I will look into it :),btohqsg
Yup I do. Now itâ€™s just a matter of whether I want to one shot top up my MA to the current BHS of $71500 to supercharge my SA  or just $8K a year to qualify for more tax relief in the following years. Thanks for replying,btohqsg
Unless you absolutely have the need to supercharge your SA (i.e. you have no where else to grow your cash from high interest savings like UOB One  SC Bonus$aver  etc.)  there's no real rush to hit FRS on SA.Just use VCMA as a tax relief vehicle and top-up 8k yearly  once you hit BHS  you can start doing RSTU if you need the tax relief (after the BHS increase of course).,btohqsg
Here's a quick guide on what to do to achieve the 1.6k salary credit on UOB One (if salary is credited into DBS/OCBC):https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/164384,btohqsg
Hi gurus  may i know if the spending cap on the uob ladies card is by billing month or calendar month? Thank u,btohqsg
anyone know if the UOB lady $1k capped is based on end of calendar month or statement date ?,btohqsg
Did not state that topping up Grabpay is excluded. But i guess will not be eligible for cashback based on cc tnc,btohqsg
Lol there's someone asking before you  2 comments before,btohqsg
Did you read the other messages above yours before you sent this?,btohqsg
lol. there was a delay in my message,btohqsg
4 minutes delay I guess ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
i was talking with someone else and forget to send out the message,btohqsg
Should be about 3% cashback if you have spent at least $500.Have you considered the UOB One credit card or UOB EVOL card instead?,btohqsg
Hahaha I'm sure most people here not affected by it because they don't use DBS Multiplier account.,btohqsg
Wah DBS going on nerfing spree,btohqsg
