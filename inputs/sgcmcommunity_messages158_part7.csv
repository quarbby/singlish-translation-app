Can I switch car loans? E.g. I find this genie car loan interest not good  I go find sgcarmart loan?,btohqsg
Ya can refinance car loan but usually banks only allow after 1 year,btohqsg
Don’t think can refinance- you gotta settle your existing loan in full  before you can apply another loan,btohqsg
Ah so will increase transfer count?,btohqsg
I did refinance my car loan once around 20 years ago. It's unheard of nowadays though,btohqsg
Yes.Cos need to transfer to the credit company to clear finance and apply another loan,btohqsg

"hi there  need an advice.. those who own an Avante CN7   I plan to change to 18"" rims but what tyre size would yall recommend...I was thinking of either 225/45 or 235/40.",btohqsg
not sure advante  i drive honda  but your tyre spec seems fine. just don't go too wide with 45 profile  will bua the fender.. 235/40 should be the better choice..,btohqsg
225/45 is better with 17 in the rim.,btohqsg
Depends on clearance in the fender lining,btohqsg
Best to check at the shop you get the wheels and tyres,btohqsg
They know what sizes will work,btohqsg
Or look online on wheel size,btohqsg
You can see in some markets Hyundai does offer 18s themselves and they use 235/40/r18,btohqsg
Elantra and avante are the same  this is for cn7,btohqsg
18 and 17 most common sizes in SG I think,btohqsg
Go 20 and up then start getting expensive,btohqsg
Plus 1 size up won't decrease fc by too much,btohqsg
If you do it right with the right tyre sizes,btohqsg
Plus the manufacturer fit 18s on his car also,btohqsg
Can alot zhng avante damn nice,btohqsg
Maybe he wanna poke out then camber 🤪🤪,btohqsg
The other day I saw an avante  the gen before cn7,btohqsg
All negative offset but no camber,btohqsg
Everything stock on the car apart from stickers and taobao lip spoiler,btohqsg
Then got model 3 wheels without the aerocover,btohqsg
Same tyre profile as model 3  assuming they buy as set,btohqsg
That's why I send cn7 link,btohqsg
Cause iirc k3 and avante same same,btohqsg
But follow wheel-size will never go wrong,btohqsg
Can see what rating to get also,btohqsg
I saw a avante N-line in performance blue  damn sexy,btohqsg
Fking stupid like jazz and fit,btohqsg
