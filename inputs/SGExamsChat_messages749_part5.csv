Bro there was General comments like The stronger responses were well-structured and gave clear and well-focused answers to the questions including a summative conclusion which focused evaluative judgements on the question. Weaker responsesincluded apparently ‘pre-prepared’ and poorly directed responses. Evaluative comments were also generaland not well-focused.Many responses provided analysis without using diagrams which is acceptable. However  the strongerresponses used very well-drawn and clearly explained diagrams to support their explanations and thesewere in the minority. Though most used appropriate diagrams in support of their answers  these diagramsusually were neither well-drawn nor well-explained. There was a lack of labelling of some of the curves in alarge number of scripts.,btohqsg

This more abstract question was not especially popular. Some candidates took one society for discussion and  a few simply praised its perceived merits. This approach tended to limit the scope of discussion. Other responses identified criteria which might permit a society to be deemed ‘great’  and these were usually then assessed against specific examples. Balance was considered either in terms of examples which appeared to fall short of these criteria  or those that identified and exemplified negative features  sometimes simply reversed from previous points. Either approach  while valid  tended to include a lengthy description of the selected illustrations  rather than deep analysis of why these criteria  rather than others  were essential to being considered ‘great’.Popular considerations included: human rights  comfortable living standards  economic growth  environmental sustainability  equality of opportunity  stable government and  above all  a willingness to strive to improve  while largely recognising that ‘nowhere is perfect – yet.’ Some perceptive responses recognised change over time  but little reference was made to past or ancient ‘great’ civilisations. The concept of ‘great’ itself received minimal attention  usually being taken simply to mean ‘successful’.,btohqsg
