they get lost in their own little niche echo chamber of their own world,btohqsg
that normal common sense is gone for them,btohqsg
simple things like hitler is bad,btohqsg
Na education has nothing to do with it,btohqsg
All arguments are valid but not all arguments are sound,btohqsg
Just go into WKW and try to make an argument about money,btohqsg
valid arguments means it makes sense internally but sound means it has to actually make sense witht the fontext,btohqsg
I find non woke people making not sound arguments moe often ngl,btohqsg

Everything all the conflicts are due to Kuro,btohqsg
I tot when they say root of the conflict it means look beyond that,btohqsg
From the start it is him.. the Lisan-al Gaib of Kuro,btohqsg

My understanding is always just Israel doesn't wanna live with the 1967 borders,btohqsg
i wna report to isd for fun,btohqsg
So they keep going over to palestine,btohqsg
palestine rejected the 2 state deal,btohqsg
Because the 2 state deal was unfair to them,btohqsg
Time to hide from the Muad Dib Kuro,btohqsg
Why would u not reject it,btohqsg
ppl say ok we give u 1:1 land,btohqsg
If u actually look at the map,btohqsg
and so u rape and kill israelis,btohqsg
Those borders literally don't make sense also,btohqsg
jews very +ev to society cuz they smart and do a lot of thinfs for the world,btohqsg
This literally means nth in this context,btohqsg

as in i rather israel win lor,btohqsg
in the long run good for the world,btohqsg
what? have u not listen to them. esp the first one,btohqsg
Hmm maybe we should fix their low concentration spans and help increase their productivity I propose calling it a concentration camp,btohqsg
yes but look at the mentality of palestine supporters,btohqsg
Wait why are people “boycotting” McDonald’s,btohqsg
also hamas doctored numbers of the deaths,btohqsg
Cuz macdonalds funds Israel or smth then people think boycotting Mcs would do smth,btohqsg
bro doctored the graph of deaths as a linear one,btohqsg
LOVING HIM WAS REDDD YEAH REDDD BURNING REDDDDDDDDDDD BURNING REDDDD,btohqsg
"js like how they r ""boycotting"" everything else",btohqsg
they js want to eat grass,btohqsg
so u telling me every day the women and children deaths increases linearly,btohqsg
Yeah this is actually what happened,btohqsg
Then the solution was the 1947 borders,btohqsg
Which was just fking palestibe more,btohqsg
could have put Israel in Hawaii  okay that wouldn’t make sense,btohqsg
So no shit they got upset,btohqsg
Ever since kofi anan no PKO has ever done anything effective,btohqsg
i lost $20 on plo flip yst,btohqsg
Israel won't cuz Israel is partially us fundedPalestine literally doesn't have any power to go against un,btohqsg
