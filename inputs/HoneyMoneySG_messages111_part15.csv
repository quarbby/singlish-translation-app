If no sms or email  most likely application didn't go through. To check  call their help line.,btohqsg
Keep us updated. I‚Äôm curious. Thanks.,btohqsg
Did you use your scb credit cards? Cos my experience with scb is that they will always waive off the annual fees.,btohqsg
any idea if we can use climate vouchers for dyson fan?,btohqsg
No more LiaoYes I‚Äôm active user especially scb manhattan cards,btohqsg
Oh no. I still have their Manhattan credit card too.,btohqsg
It took me 6 calls to setup online banking  which I didn't have to even call once for any of the other banks.,btohqsg
Be prepared for no annual fee waiver.I use $6 667 every quarter without fail. I will know result this month. Have one annual fee this month end.,btohqsg
Might be their plan to remove this credit card for good.,btohqsg
Take note that insurance can only make up of 50% of the tier you're hitting. And you need to hit 3 months consecutively.,btohqsg
No. It applies to all their cards for me so far.Even simplycash,btohqsg
Did you pay in full (i.e. not minimum payment)? Can ask for fee waiver then pay off in full.Deferred one maybe cash advance  check your transactions if you accidentally transfer out/withdraw money out from your card instead of account?,btohqsg
My suspicion (unconfirmed) they want to kick out priority banking customers who do not maintain $200k assets with scb.,btohqsg
Yes if merchant accepts climate vouchers.,btohqsg
Ok‚Ä¶ so it is indeed charges for not paying in full.Bill was $685 but I paid $658.A stupid mistake.But thank goodness they will waive it off for me,btohqsg
Nice. Thanks for updating us too,btohqsg
Mine just got waive last month and I‚Äôm not a frequent user.,btohqsg
Just to check if you have hit 200k AUM yet they refuse to waive?,btohqsg
Hsbc ega interest when is it coming ? Anyone received alrdy ?,btohqsg
as not a lot of cards allow utilites payments to earn miles,btohqsg
got it thanks. I actually mean the bank acc details for Geneco/Seraya energey as on their website  bank transfer isnt one of the options so wanted to pick the brains of the community :),btohqsg
got it   looking if any UOB/DBS/Citi cards allows,btohqsg
And which card was your AF waived for? Sorry if I didn't catch it earlier.,btohqsg
CardUp has their bank details  why do you need to key in manually?,btohqsg
Have you checked if your cards are eligible for rewards on CardUp transactions?,btohqsg
uob one card eligible for cashback for geneco,btohqsg
Which bank is the best to keep $100k if I‚Äôm just waiting for SGDMYR to go up and convert $85k ? Ocbc is good but hard to manage the SAVE portion since exceeded 10k,btohqsg
Will I kena fall below fee for transferring everything to another bank ?,btohqsg
‚Äú(iii) that are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account 30 days before or duringthe Promotion Period and re-deposited (whether part or all the amounts withdrawn) into theAccount indicated in the Registration (as defined below).‚ÄùDoes that mean I should put $155k on 2nd July instead of $150k on 1st July due to this clause?If I have transferred out the $150k on 1st June.,btohqsg
Someone sharp highlighted this new condition for Uob plunging chicken.Was it there all along?,btohqsg
Like hsbc gives most % on ‚Äúincremental balance‚Äù so have to find another bank to transfer everything over so can start over from initial balance $0 again,btohqsg
Is there any cons using uob privi miles card?,btohqsg
Should be somewhere in current tnc,btohqsg
Yes. Annual fee. 261. Spending cap 1000 each for 2 months to get the miles.,btohqsg
This means those ‚Äúmaximisers‚Äù who go and withdraw the funds before earmark is completed (usually few weeks delay) will fail condition. Maybe that‚Äôs why got some people didn‚Äôt get earmarked.,btohqsg
Lower earn rate than specialized cards (1.4mpd than 4mpd),btohqsg
Bros and sisters. Which are your fav bank in spore now.For me is HSBC,btohqsg
Depends on the promotion of that month/quarter,btohqsg
No I don‚Äôt have   they ask me to topup,btohqsg
I think you are right! ü´°Then that clause is supposed to explain the termincremental fundsto the customers‚Ä¶ ü§£ü§£ü§£https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/common/terms-and-conditions-savings-promotion.pdf?vid=na&pid=CD07Q2SAVE24,btohqsg
Hahahha I understand liao.It is for those that have $1001 now  next month join promo and put $150k in.Then when earmarked $150k  they go and withdraw the $1001.I‚Äôm also not sure if I‚Äôm correct lol.‚ÄúNote:(a) For existing Accounts  the Incremental Fresh Funds must result in at least a correspondingincrement in the Account‚Äôs day-end balance throughout the Promotion Period and Earmark Periodas compared to the Account‚Äôs Monthly Average Balance for March 2024.‚Äù,btohqsg
Ya. By right cannot touchReference month mab amount $1001Earmark amount $150 000Total $151 001 cannot be touch throughout entire promo.,btohqsg
Same experience as me.Hostaging us. Topup to $200k or else we cannot waive scb pb vi anymore. Ok this one I can accept because it is after all a pb card.But when u also don‚Äôt want to waive my peasant $30k simplycash by using the same $200k aum requirement ‚Äúencouragement‚Äù. I cannot accept it.Anyway as a tip. Scb smart has no annual fee for life. I just apply for that to hold my scb credit limit. In the event I need to cancel all my scb cards except smart.,btohqsg
Ya. Let‚Äôs see who go withdraw in the next promo. üòÇThink I remember last year got people go and do swapping.Like $100k now  then join next promo $100k so now $200k  once the $100k earmark; they withdraw the $100k that‚Äôs not earmarked.LOL.It‚Äôs those people who June still $150k now  and never withdraw. Next month whack $150k more.,btohqsg
Aiyah they want to risk then risk Loh.Maybe end up Uob cannot track and they succeed?I will always be kiasi kiasu aunty and play safe.,btohqsg
So just top up and not touch until earmark is released should be safe?,btohqsg
Yes. I will do that. With like $10-11 buffer.,btohqsg
‚Äúthat are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account30 days before or duringthe Promotion Periodand re-deposited (whether part or all the amounts withdrawn) into theAccount indicated in the Registration (as defined below).‚ÄùYou see my bold words‚Ä¶If the user withdraw on 2nd June $150k‚Ä¶And the new promo start date is 1st July‚Ä¶.2nd June to 1st July promo start date is less than 30days.Only those who withdraw the funds on 30th May is safe!Those who withdraw on 1 Jun is 30 days or 31 days? üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Wah‚Ä¶ brain fried liao. UOB ah UOB‚Ä¶ üòÇ,btohqsg
To be honest I cannot remember if this is a new clause or there all along.Maybe the 30 days wording is new.,btohqsg
