Hello queenie  how do you see it disappear from the acct? I check my Uob app and it seems to be still there.,btohqsg
Hi  if my UOB one fund is still earmarked by UOB as of 31 Dec 2023 for NDP promo  do they look at the available balance or the total fund (including earmarked fund) if i register for Rising Dragon promo in Mar 2024? 😆,btohqsg
The current and available number will differ,btohqsg
Got it thank you! My available and current still same amount. I guess I needa call them tmr to sort it out,btohqsg
The earmark fund will be counted as day end balance as well,btohqsg
Same. CPF got smarter. Credited the interest on 31 Dec 2023,btohqsg

CPF just transferred out the MA interest  can topup 3k to MA now,btohqsg
Those on the Webull USD$3k that has to retain funds until 1st Jan .... no point withdrawing today right? Earliest should withdraw tmr.,btohqsg
Just saw this. Thanks for sharing.So the process is:Interest credit on 31 Dec.Wait for MA interest to be credited to OA.Perform volunteering contribution to MA,btohqsg
@qqplacesfor the UOB CNY promo  understand that tomorrow top back up is ideal. But to participate  we can click to participate now and then tomorrow then credit back in right?,btohqsg
So it’s a bug in cpf side to credit the interest earlier? 😂,btohqsg
If I topup MA to BHS  and SA is already at FRS  the future MA contribution will flow to SA or OA?,btohqsg
Not a bug  it's a feature. And in 2025 will get the same question again,btohqsg
Check the following:a). What is your account closing balance as of 30 September 2023 based onPDF monthly statement. Is the amount between the day of your submission till 31 Dec  account balance amount in any day > = (balance(30 Sep) + Earmarked amount) ?b). Did you withdraw any amount from the account after you submitted your registration such that it falls below the required balance ?c). Did you transfer the money from your other UOB account into the saving account?d). Did you use the saving account participated 2023 NDP promo?,btohqsg

Grab wallet means no rewards unless you want to earn 0.3% cashback for top-up on UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX,btohqsg
Thank you for updating us 😉,btohqsg

Hi Mt and all experts  does this uob promo allow funds from several paynow transfers or must be one single transfer? Thanks,btohqsg

Hi  can I confirm if the CPF interest is computed on a monthly basis? Eg. There will no difference if I do cash top-up to my SA account on 01 Jan 2024 or 31 Jan 2024?,btohqsg
I only open the Uob account in December and have not withdrawn anything from it. I have also registered for the Christmas promo.,btohqsg
Don’t think you can  and they are going to retire the website,btohqsg
does anyone know if smart credit card + ipaymy for paying taxes would work ?,btohqsg

For those asking about reserved amounts on RSTU:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158140For those asking about CPF interest from MA to SA on 1 Jan:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/159204,btohqsg
Oh I didn't know evol card is basis statement month. Like that it will be so difficult to keep track.,btohqsg
Just keep a spreadsheet and track daily,btohqsg
Hi all  when will UOB One account interest come in?,btohqsg
02 of the month for me,btohqsg
@Andrewsuxy  you can share about the survey rewards but do not put your own referral code,btohqsg
May I check for this statement I saw on milelion for citi rewards:An overall cap of S$1 000 per statement month applies  shared between (1) and (2). The Citi Rewards Mastercard and Citi Rewards Visa each have their own 4 mpd cap. Any spend in excess of the cap earns 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
Means any spend in excess of $1 using my amaze card only earns me 0.4 miles?,btohqsg
