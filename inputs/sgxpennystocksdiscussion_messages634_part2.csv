GEAR - now price at KGI given EP. Am in Q to add $0.540Prior resistance of 0.51 has now turned support.Momentum indicators are sending a mixed signal  with the MACD recently forming a bearish crossover  and RSI reversing from overbought levels. This may indicate at least some consolidation before the stock can try to retest the 52-week high.Long ‚Äì Entry 0.545  Target 0.620  Stop 0.505Source:https://www.kgieworld.sg/research/apr05ta,btohqsg
