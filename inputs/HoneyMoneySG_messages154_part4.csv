When I booked from TPE to SIN via KF UOB portal (and using KF UOB CC) in Jan  I needed to pay the processing fee.The 3.25% FX fee (or the ~6% DCC markup by Scoot if pay using SGD) is charged on top of the total amount too.,btohqsg
I think u r stuck with uob absolute and its only 0.3% if not wrong. Wallet topup are quite bad now. If charge to cc directly  u got a lot more options.,btohqsg
