You need to write in and request for them to remove the existing VEP. BUT  it wouldn't be easy as they will tell you to ask ex owner remove and they can't do it on their side. Must keep pushing them say cannot contact etc and after that they may assist  and you need to send in your logcard and notice of ownership transfer,btohqsg
So if you did not download your notice of ownership transfer from LTA  and it has been removed  then you need to pay LTA to get it... which i did,btohqsg
