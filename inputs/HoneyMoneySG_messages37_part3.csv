Hi good day.I am buying item that the shop allows to pay using grabpay  or fave.Which combo of card to grabpay or fave is the best return?,btohqsg
and also is the shop for dining or something else?,btohqsg
Grabpay top Amex tcb by April will go,btohqsg
Insta.Citi rewardsCiti cash back.Uob abs (last time I use this for grabpay  but I heard that the cash back drop)Stand chart smart,btohqsg
If you're going Amex route  TCB/UOB Absolute topup GrabPay then link GrabPay to FavePay (1.5% or 0.3% + 1.2% GrabPoints),btohqsg
Or if you pay with Citi Rewards + FavePay you can get 4mpd or 2.27% cashback + Fave cashback on your next return,btohqsg
Next month onwards topup TCB to GrabPay will not earn any cashback,btohqsg
so link GrabPay to FavePay will get you 1.2% back in GrabPoints,btohqsg
+ Fave cashback on your next visit,btohqsg
Considering you don't have Amex TCB card  yes,btohqsg
Understand. So no point for me to get other cards now.,btohqsg
How about if we still need to use grabpay  the still only better only is uob abs?,btohqsg
Just make sure the FavePay merchant you're paying is not under transport or CRMC excluded category,btohqsg
Oh it's not. It's a tcm shop. Buying tonics,btohqsg
If you have to use GrabPay  the only card that gives cashback on topups is UOB Absolute (0.3%),btohqsg
So UOB Absolute (0.3%) + Pay GrabPay through FavePay (1.2%) = 1.5% back,btohqsg
If you're paying through FavePay though using CRMC is almost always better,btohqsg
Sometime still need to order  and get card ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure Citi Rewards will give 4mpd on Grab rides,btohqsg
You mean pay using cc direct. Without top up?,btohqsg
So the best way is to use this?,btohqsg
Sorry I'm totally lost one haha. So payment for ride use direct cc charge.For food use grab top up credit?,btohqsg
You also get 4mpd on GrabFood,btohqsg
So please ignore my previous advise on using GrabPay,btohqsg
From what I understand now it looks like all your transactions are eligible for 4mpd on Citi Rewards,btohqsg
So I don't need top up  just everything direct charge to rewards cc using grab app,btohqsg
But my purchase from tcm shop still have to use rewards cc + fave,btohqsg
If u are using favepay  u can just charge through uob absolute cb directly. 1.7% cb directly. Less hassle  more cb than this way,btohqsg
I'm not 100% sure  but I believe so,btohqsg
use other 4mpd cards for grab ride/food,btohqsg
It does. I recently just use my amex via favepay,btohqsg
Oh they accept that now? Good to know,btohqsg
I still have dbs woman world Mastercard,btohqsg
This card works with grab and fave too?,btohqsg
Grab - yes  Fave - no,btohqsg
good for grabfood/ride but not fave,btohqsg
So this card also another 4mpd card that you all say that can work the same ways as Citi rewards to just charge the food order and car order direct to it?,btohqsg
If that's the case in summary.If I need fave:Rewards + fave for shop purchase.If need food and ride from grab:Charge direct to reward or women world master,btohqsg
Because top up give lesser return,btohqsg
One more help.Rewards card limit is how much,btohqsg
Citi Rewards 1k  Woman's world 2k,btohqsg
One more thing  let's say if you go overseas and book flights or hotels  don't use Citi Rewards card,btohqsg
Top up max before April end of Days,btohqsg
Thank you all for your kind teaching,btohqsg
KL doesn't have Amex TCB card  by this point it's likely too late to apply,btohqsg
Hi all   all those sign up min spending $500 . Payment to telco using telco app consider the $500 spending?,btohqsg
I heard Citibank consider Telco bills as bill payments  and excluded it?,btohqsg
Does anyone know if Lazada Instillment Payment Plan qualifies for earning credit card cash back or rewards?,btohqsg
think this is isolated cases. many ppl got their 10x points or 5%,btohqsg
those 0% interest ipp no rewards,btohqsg
