I oredy mentioned yday. U can scroll up to read as before.,btohqsg
Ya can let her touch wherever she wants üòèüòè,btohqsg
Just wondering  the polyclinic doctor never refer u to hospital meh? I mean if they cant check whats went wrong..Maybe they dunno which dept to refer u to...,btohqsg
Ok.Looking fwd to see him again in jan üòÅ,btohqsg
not yet PK  still can shake leg at home,btohqsg

Mine one they oso took xray..Total i went for 3 xray! Waste $ sia..end up is not just the bones.So i even go mri & ultra sound üòÖ,btohqsg
Just curious. What did you do to cause the extensive injuries?,btohqsg
I didnt do anything. 1 fine evening  i was walking to bus stop as usual after workWhile waiting for greenman    my leg go soft n i cant walk well since mid june,btohqsg
After physio  i getting better.. i can climb up stairs n walk more loSo total im seeing 2 to 3 doctors for my leg . Got 2 diff issues..,btohqsg
Usually office workers have posture problem that can lead to leg weakness,btohqsg
so far it is recovering slowly la very slowly but at least sorta no longer affect normal daily stuffs Liao  there‚Äôs still pain and soreness but I just tank through,btohqsg
Ikr! The bills i pay n pay üòÖ,btohqsg
Because of this I went and buy an accident plan so now I‚Äôm covered hahahah,btohqsg
Lol i oredi got accident plan like 20 yrs le,btohqsg
Mine is more like degeneration.. not accident bah,btohqsg
Y let my opinion stop u üòèüòè,btohqsg
because I am wiling to make an assumption that your opinion is well-informed?,btohqsg
Need to take care of body.. like u wont knw what trigger or causes it,btohqsg
If i din go ultra sound.. i oso wont knw i got the issue in my veins,btohqsg
I still want go travel de leh..,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why time to gym ! Woohoo,btohqsg
Can do whatever you want !,btohqsg
Gym oso must knw ur limits,btohqsg
Not everything but at least something ~~,btohqsg
Ya like i no exercise.. due to diet. I dropped 11kg in few mths,btohqsg
as you age your goal generally speaking should be about muscle retention liao  so not chiong-ing.,btohqsg
go gym cannot be too tired...if not  will lose focus and end up hurting yourself,btohqsg
you can't outrun a bad diet,btohqsg
I think the workout part is also for you to build strength and muscle cause as you age  your muscle will slow say bye bye to you every year,btohqsg
Even think of switch to vertical mouse? I switch mine cos last round i have tennis elbow,btohqsg
you're a bit generous but what works for you ig,btohqsg
it happened to non mouse wrist,btohqsg
This one own self know what is push through your limit versus going overboard,btohqsg
ya recently it acts up again...when i lift heavy things,btohqsg
When habe tennis elbow  the physio ask me use a tennis ball n roll on the nervesPress abit weight on when u roll,btohqsg
lifting heavy things maybe a lot to do with posture.utilizing more of glutes and quads will defo help,btohqsg
i did...but that day i was too tired liao,btohqsg
I see a lot of people lifting heavy things using their back,btohqsg
But most people will not bother üòÅ,btohqsg
anyway it was donkey years ago...at least a decade,btohqsg
do what you love and stick with it,btohqsg
but i need to do more cardio,btohqsg
but still gotta do it LOL.,btohqsg
so i am restarting my workout regime,btohqsg
I used to be very sporty kind but then got a low period then got tummy and whatnot  every time finished a meal like food coma until the galaxy and such so I picked myself up and make a change again   it‚Äôs really a matter of give and take I guess,btohqsg
I think gym training or cardio or whichever is the most fair trade you can find,btohqsg
You give how much you get back how much provided you doing the right thing la,btohqsg
I waiting for the sports complex to reopen in dec or jan,btohqsg
i used to be super obese...then i change my lifestyle...then i met my bf  become fat again...luckily not as bad as last time,btohqsg
good to do aerobics  really helps out the vascular health,btohqsg

now i am more concerned about health than losing weight,btohqsg
our ancestors move around all the time because they're too bored andd they need to farm.,btohqsg
Weight lifting can be a cardio as long as you have a consistent zone 2 heart rate,btohqsg
hahahahah for me I extreme one but this one is individual  I want to achieved those instagram kind of body ! So far getting there ‚ô•Ô∏è,btohqsg

Anyway  these days weather gd for walking hm,btohqsg

my tcm told me to do some cycling,btohqsg
i got a spinning bike at home,btohqsg
cause I‚Äôm trying to bulk and ever since my leg injured can‚Äôt jump I lazy do cardio Liao hahahaha,btohqsg
If taking long haul flight  best to take many toilet trips.I believe yours is an early detection  so I think the outcome is very optimistic?You not covered under hospitalizations plan?,btohqsg

But inside a lot of steroid one,btohqsg
Especially the big size ones XD,btohqsg
Use this cycling station for recovery. Anything else will be too strenuous for you.Aim is to improve circulation now. Not create additional tears.,btohqsg
oh i did a long walk 2 to 3 weeks ago,btohqsg
Wao. You are another gym bod like the other Korean guy here.,btohqsg
Just that always got ah neh there at the bench.. so i nvr go,btohqsg
same like me i will avoid,btohqsg
There is also pre and post hospitalizations coverage. Check with your agent on the duration.,btohqsg
And there no lights or very dim lights,btohqsg
I mean YOLO  since wanna chiong gym  might as well achieve what you desire !,btohqsg
but I focus more on sustainability la,btohqsg
I saw his work out. It's a mixture of everything into one sessions and he has been on it for years. I dont think I can follow. Too messy for my simpleton brain.,btohqsg
No point suffer just to get that kind of body then later rebound back again,btohqsg
So have to come up with your own routine and such that can achieve your goal but at your own comfort,btohqsg
If not comfortable  can bring along another relative? Else can lie on bed and cycle in the air slowly.,btohqsg
I got try cycle in the airrecently.gotonce my physio on mc  another physio taught me do stretching in the air also,btohqsg
Bravo to you. I believe you are quite young too? Then it should be fairly easy for you to bulk.Old man like me with poor genetics will take forever to look half like Rain oppa. üòî,btohqsg
definitely older abit harder  but still can de as long as you want it  the gym have all sorta of age group one my gym friend he close to 60 but he murder us all in every workout hahahahaha,btohqsg
Slowly. Physio works. But it takes a while. Must be diligent.,btohqsg
it‚Äôs not about how fast it‚Äôs about keep doing it,btohqsg
but of coz age plays a part...as long as you are active  it does not matter,btohqsg
andy have not reached old age yet,btohqsg

As long as your kidney dun have pre existing issue and you drink lotsa water  it‚Äôs scientifically proven safe and the best thing you can have,btohqsg
Stay around. We'd spam u at midnight,btohqsg
Actually best thing you can have is real meat.For bulking  red meat like beef,btohqsg
Cos tmr i go back office,btohqsg
Might as well go office gym do,btohqsg
I stocked up on chicken breast,btohqsg
Fireman carry him and do squats,btohqsg
I bought a freezer for it,btohqsg
Ok I go find a female colleague then ü§£,btohqsg
Creatine works. But it doesn't work instantaneously. Need a few weeks for it to build up in the muscle then you will see improvement.Also not everyone benefits from creatine.,btohqsg
In the future  can go JB and carry 15kg of breasts back.,btohqsg
I would say most though  those that doesn‚Äôt are the minority I would say. Cause with CREATINE  it stores more water in your muscles plus it improves your recovery so this itself is very beneficial le and of course not immediate la  give me a good 3 mths you will see wonders if you have a proper workout routine as well,btohqsg
I just left office  on the way home,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ok my house nearby minimart have Liao hahahaha,btohqsg
Was chit chatting with boss n colleague,btohqsg

Everyone has different goals. That's y gym has all types of folks.Some is jus there to control their blood sugar and nothing else.,btohqsg
yea was about to say end of the day see what‚Äôs your goal also la  cause as good as it is  it‚Äôs something you have to keep taking  if you stop you your muscle won‚Äôt retain so much water and you will downsize again,btohqsg
Huh? Didnt know you work in moe.That's late,btohqsg
No la. My colleague is worrying about her boy,btohqsg
I like Bruno Mars+Lady Gaga song,btohqsg
