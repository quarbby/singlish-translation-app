Wise vs youtrip vs instarem amaze?,btohqsg
youtrip better rate  amaze spread wider but 4mpd + instapointfor youtrip vs amaze  not sure about wise,btohqsg
Hi all  do you guys know if paying via installment on Apple's site  does any card still give the 4mpd or as long as it's installment  no rewards given?,btohqsg
Christ video about Amaze Vs youtrip really sum it upin exchange for slightly worse rate comapred to youtrip  Amaze give you 1% cashback on FCY + your credit card reward. Which basically negate the worse rate it give while youtrip is a nett loss due to spread,btohqsg
does anyone know if charity donations count towards rewards for citi rewards card? else any card that count those in for rewards?,btohqsg
Amaze having quite a number of issues eg double transactions etc. I rather forgo that perks and use YouTrip or trust card for the stability,btohqsg
Time cost to settle all these amaze issues is not worth it to me,btohqsg
hi guru  any idea how does banks calculate Monthly Average Balance (MAB) to get benefits?and how can we take advantage?,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com/digibank/in/articles/save/how-to-calculate-monthly-average-balanceDBS has a whole article here  not sure about other banks,btohqsg
Trust card is good for overseas transactions?,btohqsg
Yes the rate is good I always use in Malaysia and fuss free and itâ€™s stable,btohqsg
Recently also used it in Batam,btohqsg
I see...don't have the usual bank surcharge?,btohqsg
Trust does not charge any foreign transaction/markup fees  not even the usual 1% Visa charge.,btohqsg
While they have double charge  but I think the reversal is actually quite fast and efficient.I had 1 double charge in Japan but very fast settled,btohqsg
Yes itâ€™s true but the time cost to monitor whether they reverse the charge etc is not worth it to me. I want a peace of mind and hassle free stable transaction. To me that extra perks from amaze ainâ€™t worth it. But thatâ€™s for me la. No wrong no right,btohqsg
any reward points or things like that?,btohqsg
But hor double points cos I still get points even when reversed ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yes but the points for trust card are measly compare to amaze. What u get is stability,btohqsg
Good bro. I really hate to monitor all these haha,btohqsg
Agree with you. Instarem has been so glitchy and such a hassle. I'm planning to just close it off after my latest dispute is settled and my money is back.,btohqsg
wondering if any has double charge when spending in singapore?,btohqsg
nope  think only spending in japan has this issue,btohqsg
Onky happen to DBS users? Oh amazedI use Revolut no issues,btohqsg
"Anyone with HSBC credit card trying to apply for EGA? Singpass application redirects to a page that says ""It appears that you have an existing relationship with us.Please call our contact centre:""",btohqsg
For citi rewards  when does the monthly limit reset?,btohqsg
known issue  need to go bank apply.,btohqsg
OK thanks  but still applicable for Singsaver?,btohqsg
the new statement month is every 30th reset?,btohqsg
"Cause singsaver writes in t & c ""For avoidance of doubt  an Eligible Participantswho submit the online account application without using MyInfo via Singpass (i.e. via manuallycompleting the Digital Account Opening Form) will not be considered as an Eligible Participant.""",btohqsg
Till bills yield out itâ€™s 4 percent,btohqsg
depends when is ur statement date,btohqsg
how do i check my statement date?,btohqsg
i have not been billed before,btohqsg
then wait until Citi send you a bill then you know already when of each month,btohqsg
ahh okay  so have to wait for the first bill,btohqsg
Hi I want to check   making payment in hospital buy using credit card   will it subject to exclusion for credit like unlimited cash back standard chartered,btohqsg
anyone knows what happens to rewards during a refund?,btohqsg
Need to refer to the exclusion list in the card TnC. Hospital mcc 8062 not excluded for scb unlimited (rebranded as simply cash),btohqsg
Anybody got the TnC for AMEX TCB?Wanna see whatâ€™s the exclusion for the bonus cashback,btohqsg
So in simple as long the term and condition never indicate Hospital MCC 8062,btohqsg
The cash back process can kick in right,btohqsg
hi afternoon- anyone here invests in crypto j curious,btohqsg
maybe can check if stated in citi banking app/website  can call the bank also,btohqsg
Update: just visited HSBC. If you have an existing HSBC credit card  it's considered an account. So you WONT be eligible for HSBC EGA singsaver promotion,btohqsg
Sad that is low. FD now higher,btohqsg
I have citi rewards card  should I sign up for DBS altitude?,btohqsg
due to 2% admin fee per transaction,btohqsg
Used it as a backup card if you overflow the $1000 earning limit plus Citibank reward card doesnâ€™t not reward you for travel.DBS altitude is excellent for travels with 3-10 mpd on travel transaction,btohqsg
what about for purchases crossing 1k slightly? Like macbook  Iphone  bag,btohqsg
