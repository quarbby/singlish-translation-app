Correct. I confused it with that Plus card actually. Plus got no min no max all 1.6%,btohqsg
i am always confused as well. i think it's bad naming for citi. their cards are easily messed up.,btohqsg
I amex coined the  True cashback card so want to differentiate,btohqsg
Which is better   pairing citibank rewards or citibank premiermiles with amaze ?For online purchase in transact in foreign currency    the amaze card <> citibank rewards method will not incur the credit card fx spread? Is that right? And using citibank rewards pair with amaze will earn 10x points?,btohqsg

Hi all - for average spender monthly  will citi reward + amaze be better than hsbc revolution card?,btohqsg
If you have EGA account  should use HSBC revolution instead due to that extra 1% cashback ontop of your 4mpd. If you did the task to join the everyday+ programme,btohqsg
On top of the topic above ^  how to I fully utilize the Citi Rewards & Amaze card?Do I simply just top up an amount to the Amaze card from my Citi Rewards before using the Amaze like a debit card in order to earn 10x Rewards points?,btohqsg
No  you link it directly. Do not top up to amaze,btohqsg
So it's almost like how we attach our cards to Samsung / Google Pay?I just do the same for Amaze app  and all transactions on it would earn be the 10x Rewards points?,btohqsg

For EGA  can I put in 2k/5k(welcome bonus) and withdraw immediate and still qualify? Or must the funds be kept that,btohqsg
Wow. Ok. Will get ega acc then,btohqsg
Yes you can do that then transfer out 5x,btohqsg
So if I fast transfer out 1k 5 times  that will count?,btohqsg
Can that what I did but must be a non-HSBC account,btohqsg
up to 5.55% is Annual yield  not absolute yield,btohqsg
So if apr  I top up 100k x 4.55% = $4 550???? Rly???,btohqsg
