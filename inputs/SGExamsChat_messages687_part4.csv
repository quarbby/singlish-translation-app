Some things that he tell me  i legit dun even know how to respond and it is making me feel worst,btohqsg
i have very limited emotional capacity so i’d rather save it for people that are more important or i’m closer to,btohqsg
which sounds blunt but i mean,btohqsg
some people are more worth my energy,btohqsg
I barely hv emotional capacity for myself,btohqsg
I dunno why i want to go help others when im still helping myself halfway,btohqsg
then don’t let people drain it from you if they aren’t worth it,btohqsg
But it is just i dun feel good ignoring him,btohqsg
i mean i also wanna help and for a long time i’ve put myself in a position to always be there for others,btohqsg
Yea very right  i need to settle my own first,btohqsg
but it has detrimental effects on myself,btohqsg
Actually what u said is very right,btohqsg
I need to settle myself first,btohqsg
end result is your own self is messed up or you can’t cope and have to disappoint others,btohqsg
your people pleasing tendencies is probs a big part of why you feel so overwhelmed a lot,btohqsg
Speaking of my parents  so my dad had a talk to me and what he can say is ‘with ur shitty results  u care about portfolio??’,btohqsg
It became im unappreciative of their care,btohqsg
eh for me i feel like,btohqsg
alot of times i cant do it anymore but js do it anyway,btohqsg
Yea i need to fix it else idk how im gonna survive,btohqsg
saying you know you gotta fix it is really not the same as doing smth about it,btohqsg
it starts by being more aware of yourself,btohqsg
My dad was like ‘see he is trying to psycho u into not doing pre-reg and u still dun see something wrong with him’,btohqsg
It is a bit bad to say this but i think i gotta shut people off if it is taking too much emotional burden on myself and i hv not settled myself,btohqsg
It depends on whether the other party understands my position but i guess there is a reason to everything a human do,btohqsg
tbh i get scolded / flamed many times for shutting people off,btohqsg
I think he said that partly coz he was desperate to get me n my mum back tgt,btohqsg
They can say things like ‘stop pretending u hvnt read my text’ or ‘is it so difficult to give a reply’,btohqsg
But sometimes there are various reasons why i dun reply,btohqsg
Yea i need to work something out (sunny side up actually teaches life stories lmao),btohqsg
It looks nice but the price isnt,btohqsg
bruh half of my class ck tdy,btohqsg
I only know ck is Creatine kinase,btohqsg
i think our CT also knows they not actl sick,btohqsg
Tbh i hv never attended any college events except those im involved in,btohqsg
but then got 2 ppl actl sick,btohqsg
i'm in MRC so i think i will be involved in alot of events one way or another lol,btohqsg
As long as u dun hv too many pl,btohqsg
Those that are near exam days like national day / teacher day,btohqsg
We didnt hv such a thing,btohqsg

Actually i guess it can help w bonding,btohqsg
except for the dinner at the ebd,btohqsg
6pm if ur parents not coming for the session,btohqsg
Wah i feel i missed out a lot then,btohqsg
And actually my parents will stir some shit if they come to the sch meet the teachers,btohqsg

Some random china person just called me wth,btohqsg
And told me off in front of my ct and gp tutor (aka same as pw tutor) that i dun care abt gp and can they do sth about it,btohqsg
