"Then I feel like throwing myself off the building cuz I see stuff like""A family is made out of a mother. A father and a child.""Not even multiple children. One singular child",btohqsg
The father can teach the child how to fish,btohqsg
Very first essay they wrote for me when I taught in ej,btohqsg
just find it hilarious in the opposite sense as someone bi who is part of the community and have seen same-sexed (gays != les) families have children and are still happy together,btohqsg
idk what nat's waffling about 99% of queers in singapore and even in the west are very quiet about their sexuality (speaking from a queer),btohqsg
it rings out better for me LOL,btohqsg
"it's not too far off from how the sg laws currently frame it right? marriage = ""one woman and one man""",btohqsg
also in the west sexual preference is used as a political weapon  so radical queer supporters will exhibit similar behaviours as political extremists (which no one likes),btohqsg
"but people will see such radicals  and extrapolate it to saying that ""oh queer people are radicals""",btohqsg
"most people when they say ""i dont like the queer movement"" simply dont like radical supporters instead of the entire queer movement itself",btohqsg
like  yes  i do enjoy having a father and mother because i do agree in some sense that a dad has different sets of emotions and traits than a mom and i essentially got the emotional side from my mom and the stern strong side from my dad. but this can easily be said the same for a same sexed family. if children like me adopt the same style of adopting emotional and mental strength from both  you essentially have 2 parents regardless of gender being both emotionally in touch and mentally strongdo i want my partner to me a girl (im a bi girl) no because i only like a woman's looks and i dont date for looks but for personality  but thats my own preferenceso i think a person should not say that it goes against human nature and are an nuisance if they arent harming you in any way. we are just tryna live peacefully,btohqsg
my brain is clearly not processing for this,btohqsg
tldr = lgbt is a political matter in the west,btohqsg
maybe i shouldnt say west thatd be unfair to other countries,btohqsg
"my take:the community was amazing years ago before it became a trend. im not saying everyone should stay closetted but making it more and more open to talk about started garnering some people in the community saying shit that well.. i seriously dont agree. attacking those not in the community for no good reason etc.i started getting disgusted that i was part of this community specifically because i didnt wanna be associated as one who causes trouble i just wanna live peacefullythere are so many people who just wanna live peacefully and the people who tainted everyone's minds into thinking what nat said we are  ""a nuisance"" is what you see on your screens  violence  nonsensical attacks that do not base on logic etcbut honestly  aint that also present outside of this communitythats all i gotta say",btohqsg
yes  its important to attack arguments not people,btohqsg
sorry josh its too early i shud still be sleeping but im going out,btohqsg
so based you cant imagine it,btohqsg
i got a navy ship experience with my partner,btohqsg

Hi I clb  what does this mean?,btohqsg
LGBTQ can be pushed to certain demographics,btohqsg
That are undesirable for the growth of Singapore,btohqsg
Which it can be used as population control since LGBTQ can't reproduce hence it can be used to ensure that singaporeans have a better gene pool,btohqsg
If you say that  is there an assumption made or smth?,btohqsg
I mean there's surrogacy and stuff like that,btohqsg
"They still can "" reproduce"" in that sense wot haha",btohqsg
It still greatly reduces the birth rate among those ppl,btohqsg
Another step up then it's Hitler lol,btohqsg

Why we still talking abt lgbt people ngl,btohqsg
honestly js let everyone be themselves and accept who they are,btohqsg
No lol they pay country taxes why remove money,btohqsg
Should we charge lgbt people more money,btohqsg
For not contributing to birth rate of st,btohqsg
I would like to say that none of these aligns to my beliefs,btohqsg
sometimes itâ€™s hard to know whoâ€™s trolling and whoâ€™s serious here anymore,btohqsg
Dk bout this Winstein person but he's sec 3/4,btohqsg
He got paid $100 to piss off a server,btohqsg
And he was proud of taking 6 months to do it,btohqsg
"LGBTQ people should be ""relocated"" to where they're accepted",btohqsg
