No leh lol if I buy I also don’t have lambo or Ferrari,btohqsg
the headliner and all the creature comforts,btohqsg
Dk abt that thou. Hw is it more irritating than a screaming lambo or harley lol,btohqsg
NEWS: Toyota on Wednesday reported a 33% fall in quarterly profit; The world's biggest automaker by sales posted an operating profit of $3.56 billion in Q1  below an average estimate of $4B from seven analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.,btohqsg
it is a modification vs stock from factory question I am guessing,btohqsg
One day maybe SG will have major Blackout like YEars ago cause of overcharging,btohqsg
i wouldn't jump at that conclusion necessarily sir,btohqsg
They wont care as long as they earns.,btohqsg
Sales figure did show ev adoption is gaining pace,btohqsg
Mr Xun  how do you seem to have all the answers! And all with concrete evidence one instead of just say,btohqsg
i am not amber heard lawyer  no hearsays!,btohqsg
That is primarily due to the surge in model 3 deliveries that had been on order for a long time,btohqsg
You Xun zhao da an (search for answers),btohqsg
It is gaining but not high yet,btohqsg
Other brand also manufactured ev and it is world sales figure   most of the nation are pushing for ev and it is generally there will be more and more ev on the road,btohqsg
This is not about brand   but generally ev On a whole in the worldhttps://www.statista.com/chart/amp/26845/global-electric-car-sales/,btohqsg
But are they helping? Not too sure about that one,btohqsg
what if we add toyota to this list hahaha,btohqsg
Ya can add but Toyota sales figure is indeed declining that why they are going into ev too to fight market share,btohqsg
How to sell my car online?,btohqsg
But Toyota is defiantly inside as this is about ev not about brand,btohqsg
you have sort of come to the right place.,btohqsg
100 ev sold in sg   can be 100 Toyotas or 0 Toyota it does not matter   statistic is about ev,btohqsg
Toyota don't have a completely electric model apart from one,btohqsg
Ya I don’t understand why u think Toyota don’t have ev,btohqsg
apart frm one* he say hahaha,btohqsg
think my point is  if you add internal combustion cars the sales figure will cfm be damn high  ALTHOUGH i do agree ev is doing well,btohqsg
And this one not on sale yet also,btohqsg
To what the profit and lost Toyota announce ?,btohqsg
aiyo that’s not my point la,btohqsg
Very good process! Can auction with sgcm also!! Good price,btohqsg
example of how if you add petrol cars to the infographic you sent  the sales will be way higher then EV although yes EV sales are increasing,btohqsg
Maybe it's a bit like saying since BMW USA's 2022 Q1 sales figures are higher than similar quarter last year  Americans are ditching EVs,btohqsg
plus one is volume figures  one is profit numbers,btohqsg
Must also consider that a lot of these people buying EV  especially the European buyers are only buying smaller cars like 500e or mini electric etc. for city use because of congestion charges,btohqsg
If they use their ICE cars need to pay for ULEZ charge and Congestion charges as well which they can get a subsidy on by going electric. But these people tend to have gas guzzlers at home for their weekends and other use,btohqsg
Ya some buy as spare some buy for replacement,btohqsg
Like China top selling car is model y   how many is replacement of ice or how many buy as spare is another thing   and drive which more is also another thing,btohqsg
but i think honestly  majority buy gasoline as their main haha,btohqsg
Here in SG is different. COE plays a big part,btohqsg
If not going for road trip and got home charging most ppl will drive ev,btohqsg
COE still need to pay for EVs  the only rebate is ARF,btohqsg
City driving is good for ev,btohqsg
Ev down side is road trip over 300 km as need to charge,btohqsg
Which will hit you at the end when you go on to scrap because the car will probably not last more than 10 years anyway due to current battery tech,btohqsg
make sense this  but unless they stay private properties  many countries still don’t have a lot of charging points,btohqsg
thought 2021 it was Wuling Hongguang with almost half a million?,btohqsg
Yes   this is well to do ppl privilege   don’t need maintenance don’t need go petrol kiosk,btohqsg
interesting eh haha didn’t know model y was so popular alw thought it was some wuling minivan and vw,btohqsg
which is why i think majority have ICE cars as fault driver still very popular,btohqsg
