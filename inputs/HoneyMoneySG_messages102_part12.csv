Hi does anybody know if we can FAST transfer salary payment into DBS as Salary instead of GIRO? will it be recognize by DBS?,btohqsg
Based on DBS multiplier t&c  it should work the same. But the last data point says not working:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/144276It is a horrible account  with ridiculous requirements for a low interest rate.,btohqsg
Yes this i agree. 10Gbps is really very very overkill. I think it's been documented many times that even 500Mbps is enough for most house hold. If you have issues it's more than likely a wifi issue that can't be solved by a plan upgrade needs a router/hardware upgrade to improve wifi performance (meaning more access points and configuring it properly),btohqsg
i wonder if we can Salary xsfer 30k . so as to hit the volume for max interest savings.,btohqsg
Updated my reply on the data point.,btohqsg
So you have a home loan  insurance and investments through DBS?Those are kinda bad ngl  less home loan.,btohqsg
i only have home loan   investment   no insurance. .. and i can use spending on paylah. . . but if paylah doesnt work.. then no point already,btohqsg
Without two of them (e.g. spend and insurance)  your max interest is 3%  if you somehow deposit 30k every month.You can get same by doing less on UOB One account  if you have less than 75k. Or even more if you have higher than 75k.But based on their website  PayLah spending works. Maybe spend $1 per month? And then spend the rest on cards that gives better rewards?,btohqsg
Thanks. I'm already on uob one. just that i have some spillover cash into DBS right now. so was thinking of using the fast salary method .,btohqsg
How is paynow setup to transfer to uob one account? Cos i only see paynow to mobile number  nric and uen only‚Ä¶,btohqsg
You answered yourself. PayNow to mobile number/NRIC tagged to UOB One account.,btohqsg
I tried the FAST method with sala payment on sat via posb. The app is still not showing the credit your salary under ‚Äúdetails‚Äù > ‚Äúview activities‚Äù . Do i need to wait for a few days?,btohqsg
Did you follow the steps exactly? No more no less.It usually updates on next business day. It should update by today if your transfer was before Saturday 1030pm.,btohqsg
Oh. I did transfer more than $1600. So i have to redo it?,btohqsg
Ok i believe i got to wait till tmr cos the credit was done after 1030pm and i see on my uob the credit date is 22Apr today. Will check tmr,btohqsg

theres no need to buy 10gbps especially if you are using it for normal daily uses,btohqsg
But for $10/month more I can get a better network plus equipment,btohqsg
I concur  most people can live with 512Mbps to 1Gbps. I see no reason for higher bandwidths unless you are into bitcoin mining or everyone in household is YouTuber / TikTok influencer.,btohqsg
Will your devices be able to use wifi 7? ( IEEE 802.11be ),btohqsg
There is no more 512mbps  the reason I‚Äôm thinking about 10g is cause I have lots of iot devices plus devices so whenever at night my family members came back the internet will legit slow down.FYI I using a wifi 7 tp link mesh so is not the router issue,btohqsg
then in your case u should consider upgrading but to fully utilise the wifi 7   your devices should be able to use wifi 7 which i don't think alot of devices   e.g. phone / laptop / pc are able to utilise right now,btohqsg
Yup atm not a lot wifi 7 devices  only wifi 6E which is still able to utilise the 6ghz speed,btohqsg
are you already on wifi 6?,btohqsg
Yes tplink wifi 6 before  but now I on wifi 7 router  just that plan is on 1gb,btohqsg
Jialat  I am only using 100 mbps in Malaysia,btohqsg
My don‚Äôt really need wifi  data faster than wifi,btohqsg
was your 2gbps plan 1 + 1?,btohqsg
Nope it is 2gbps  so essentially it is still 1gb + 1gb. Singapore don‚Äôt have true 2gb plan,btohqsg
u only have 1 router connected to the ONR / ONT ?,btohqsg
The other one is connected to my smart tv,btohqsg
cause the wire is still 1gbps   so technically your router is still giving out 1gbps bandwidth,btohqsg
Ya I know  I got test before  I put 2 router on different ports  u won‚Äôt go over 2gbps. The router will always be 900+ if good on wired if not it will be on 800+,btohqsg
My second port is being used on the smart tv for my family members to watch tv or stream music  hence I can‚Äôt touch the second port if not I can use the second port for my iot,btohqsg
"Quoted from someone very famous: ""640K ought to be enough for anyone""",btohqsg
My experience  UOB takes a while to update the details for both salary and credit card. It can be days. So do all these transactions a few days before end of the month.,btohqsg
It does update the tracker. But whether the interest is given or not I dunno.Problem is you gotta find a bank that lets you choose the salary category  which ocbc and uob doesn't.,btohqsg
what i was trying to say is that you can split to two routers and split the members onto different networks   maybe 2 members on router 1   another 2 members on router 2.,btohqsg
but i would say if your network is hitting bandwidth  and the upgrade is just $10  i will go for it especially since its a generation above and for just $10,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt the ethernet is specifically routed to the tv itself as the position of my network terminal and the tv is some distance away,btohqsg
Ye  paying 76 a month now and the 10g is 86,btohqsg
then upgrade is better since it's true 10gbps  not like 1+1 = 2gbps ü§£,btohqsg
any diff if I m using the uob one card or giro for uob one account?,btohqsg
"No difference since UOB one card is not eligible for rewards on cardup. And you don't get rewards for UOB one account GIRO.Maybe search ""tax giro"" and ""tax cardup"".Read all relevant t&cs firstthat your strategy rely on to see what works for you.",btohqsg
anyone using 4G or 5G for their smart TV? I suspect my ISP is throttling my VPN at night,btohqsg
Hi gurus. May I ask about the risks of participating with moomoo's existing customers promotion?Let's say I deposited 200k in to moomoo  subscribed to the fullerton fund. Then if moomoo folds. Do I still own the funds with fullerton? Will the position get transferred somewhere or it disappears with moomoo? Pardon for my noob questionüôè,btohqsg
Is it similar to tiger brokers tiger vault?,btohqsg
Internet plan is indeed more expensive and limited in Malaysia  using TIME broadband haha,btohqsg
I would like to invest $15k SRS to s&p 500And hold it for long term like 10-20 yearsWhich is the best way to invest ?When market downturnI may add investment  $$ from year to year,btohqsg
