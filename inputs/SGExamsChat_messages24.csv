my ex from rj doesnt mean i let him off on things,btohqsg
why let people get away with shit just cuz they have good grades,btohqsg
I feel like that’s not a common attitude  but then I wouldn’t know i suppose,btohqsg
as if we got the luck to bang dulwhich 😂😂,btohqsg
Wah!! Why you let go of elite bf ley,btohqsg
dulwhich dont even wanna look at us sia,btohqsg
he needed to chiong his a’s,btohqsg
just cuz someone has good income doesnt mean will treat u well will take care of u,btohqsg
felt like we not ready to be tgt or sum,btohqsg
He interested in other girls la. Guys are always like that.,btohqsg
Never knew that even though i was a hci+hcjc student,btohqsg
i only heard abt it during my sch internship,btohqsg
Ok. 95% of guys are like that. The other 5% are lying.,btohqsg
I’m just telling the truth about guys. The sooner girls accept this fact  the easier life will be. Don’t be crying outside Tan Kah Kee MRT at 2am on New Years Day.,btohqsg
Fresh gradates and waiting for uni?,btohqsg
Guys think about other girls but doesn’t mean they will cheat. That’s the most important thing to take note,btohqsg
ive met genuinely great guys  and ive seen other genuinely great guys treat their girldriends like gold,btohqsg
guys always think abt othrr girls la,btohqsg
Oh man  you gonna be disappointed one day,btohqsg
im not even surprised if my future bf suddenly one day come and tell me he banged someone else,btohqsg
im older than u and been in the dating field way longer than u,btohqsg
damn thats why i dont like singaporeans,btohqsg
full of retarded flexes in weird ways,btohqsg
Bless  literally havent done anything in the dating field,btohqsg
be stopping the hoe life man,btohqsg
Why are you in the sgexams group?,btohqsg
Still following the struggles of JC/poly students?,btohqsg
Haha you confirm end up marrying a Sinkie one. Like super Sinkie guy. The type wear his Army singlet everywhere. And after go holiday in Thailand  come back with a lot of Red Bull & Singha beer singlet.,btohqsg
Im probably gonna lurk on the subreddit for years from now,btohqsg
no point rushing to date again,btohqsg
youll find the right one naturally,btohqsg
if i do find one  LMAOOO,btohqsg
Yea  cus they have a fever from COVID 19,btohqsg
yeah but my point is there exist many genuinely amazing loyal loving people of both genders,btohqsg
no such thing as all (insert gender) disloyal,btohqsg
I agree. But loyal guys do think of other girls,btohqsg
i wouldnt forbid my to think of other girls,btohqsg
but if they take action thats another story,btohqsg
Is looking and being friendly to other girls ok?,btohqsg
"It would be controlling imo if you're like  ""You're forbidden from thinking about other girls""",btohqsg
There are two types of people people who checks out other potential mates  and liars,btohqsg
Are these people single or taken?,btohqsg
It's a evolutionary instinct  as long as you don't act on that thought and cheat on your partner  it's fine,btohqsg
in this context  i assume it's people who are already taken,btohqsg
ive concluded that many boys are not ready to date or cmi long marriage relationships,btohqsg
Cuz if I'm with sometime  I'll make sure they're the best  and so that I won't look at anyone else,btohqsg
it's true esp when they're younger,btohqsg
Your type of guys are all fucked up,btohqsg
but doesn't mean no such thing as good guys,btohqsg
caught my exes checking out other girls when we went on dates,btohqsg
well that's the thing  you  as a disciplined individual  consciously stop yourself from looking at other girls,btohqsg
Can easily say the same about girls,btohqsg
Again  your choices of guys are on par with mine,btohqsg
BUT DID IT RLLY HAPPEN THO,btohqsg
i feel like it’s not abt the gender man,btohqsg
Its never abt the gender lol,btohqsg
Millenia >> Dulwich >> Princess E,btohqsg
one of my ex constantly cheated on me and hit up other girls,btohqsg
and got abusive physically and mentally when i said ___ kinda nice,btohqsg
At least you not the side chick mah. You the main chick,btohqsg
or that when i joked that my parents like ___,btohqsg
but when i do barely the same thing he hits me,btohqsg
tfw im my bf's first chick and main chick,btohqsg
yea that’s the problem w him as a person,btohqsg
Wah shit...he hit you? Like really physically hit you?,btohqsg
dont need to know  but ok,btohqsg
polygamy isn't really explored in an conservative asian society like singapore  but having multiple partners isn't an inherent bad thing if you think about it (as long as you're open and honest about it),btohqsg
Same  but my ex was a girl,btohqsg
I have a feeling mine will do the same,btohqsg
it’s rly abt if ur partner minds,btohqsg
Tfw when yall got exes and theres me here,btohqsg
like ive friends who doesn’t mind if the bf cheats,btohqsg
“as long as he provides me w money blah blah”,btohqsg
Hit me baby one more time,btohqsg
A c c 1 d 3 n t a 1,btohqsg
How did u overcome this tho,btohqsg
I have i axis fight me,btohqsg
Ppl who do so r degenerates,btohqsg
the trauma from all my exes combined,btohqsg
How about this guy? Any takers?,btohqsg
sm ppl js use it as an excuse to prolong their rs,btohqsg
say both parties like each other but not ready for commited relationship,btohqsg
Then dont be in a relationship,btohqsg
i mean rn im not ready for serious relationship lol,btohqsg
ok la it’s abt ur own morals honestly,btohqsg
well to be fair  this is a sgexams chat,btohqsg
Then just go stead la. That’s the stage before serious,btohqsg
we're the definition of a conservative asian society lol,btohqsg
if ure fine w it nobody cn judge u also,btohqsg
half of the people here are probably against LGBT,btohqsg
it’s js the way ppl look at u will b diff,btohqsg
i mean it’s not for everyone but why y’all be judging ppl that find polygamy more suitable for them,btohqsg
lgbt is fine  polyamory doesnt work out,btohqsg
cnfm will have alot kf pronlems one,btohqsg
just cuz u don’t agree with it doesn’t mean it’s that,btohqsg
if u cnt stay loyal in a rs tht u promised to  thn its ur fault,btohqsg
Apparently ns guys have more time than uni guys,btohqsg
ya'll can try going into a poly rs,btohqsg
^ sgporeans be calling ppl slut for dating a few exes and having sex with them,btohqsg
unless u both rch a consent that polygamy is fine,btohqsg
tell me if there isnt drAma,btohqsg
No point quarreling with close minded people la,btohqsg
Stead with him first la. Then later break up with him and go out with older guy.Getting dumped in NS is a rite of passage.,btohqsg
also ns alr older than me,btohqsg
Someone ever call me male slut before. Hurtful haha,btohqsg
tbh i don’t understand why ppl have to get angry at others when they’re just doing their own thing,btohqsg
Then how? You gonna be Queen when you graduate ma,btohqsg
Time to have a deep talk with him,btohqsg
U like younger bois ah  so immature LOL,btohqsg
guys usually dont kenna imo but girls,btohqsg
not angry  just saying it wouldnt work out,btohqsg
Not saying u  im saying young bois are immature most of the time,btohqsg
thats why idw date younger boys,btohqsg
it depends how old u r la,btohqsg
why not date a dying dude,btohqsg
@xtrapoajust wondering  are you trolling me or do you just happen to have a really inconsistent worldview,btohqsg
I legit will have depression when im around them,btohqsg
ya js get his money right,btohqsg
eh but got older boys fuckbois also,btohqsg
Cannot last more than a month,btohqsg
Thats why they get used by fuckbois and complain theres no good guys when they get older,btohqsg
Fuckboi will ask you for money to top up their ezlink card one,btohqsg
Girls keep complaining guys are fuckbois  then they say matured guys are boring,btohqsg
Keep going back to fuckbois  then say all men are the same,btohqsg
Actually my best gf was my ex from China. Sad she’s now gone home,btohqsg

Whoa! I hope they’re now dating each other. Like a drama,btohqsg
except hes not back in cheena land,btohqsg
>assuming other people's political leaning to attack them,btohqsg
I opened a door for you why won't you date me,btohqsg
Anyones a bi or gay here 🌚,btohqsg
Men Go Their Own Way. Basically sexually frustrated men who keep getting rejected by girls.,btohqsg
Incels  neckbeards  niceguys  the scourge of humanity,btohqsg
Never mind. We send positive vibes their way,btohqsg
i have a guy like u in my class,btohqsg
alr almost punched him in the first day of class,btohqsg
Normal for girls to crush on each other. My gfs all had crush. All their crushes were cute also. I conflicted,btohqsg
dont like someone’s ideas shut the fuck up,btohqsg
I dont usually fall for gurls,btohqsg
God pls save our wretched souls,btohqsg
I'm sure god blessed the millions of dying african children too,btohqsg
fucking chibai dont know how to respect opinions,btohqsg
Atheist is atheist  I don't like Christianity  but I'm not spewing hate speech on them,btohqsg

As such i respect everyone and love everyone,btohqsg
but u havent been respecting any of our opinions,btohqsg
u dont have anything nice to say then shut the fuck up,btohqsg
cant respect opinions tHEN SHUT THE FUCK UP,btohqsg
weird fuck that has to hide behind a username and no dp that no one likes,btohqsg
Still  it isn't right to call someone a weird ****,btohqsg
Just because you disagree with an opinion,btohqsg
i guess its weird to call you James even tho ur name is James,btohqsg
Why are you insulting me now,btohqsg
Maybe chillax? Online convos arent worth being angry over :),btohqsg
if you really like me right then you should chase after me  girls you know  we like to be pamper hehe,btohqsg
y’all r literally getting upset over strangers,btohqsg
Irony is silencing other people's views when they hurt your feelings,btohqsg
then you should chase after her,btohqsg
so lonely you have to resort to annoying online strangers to get attention,btohqsg
can we like move on frm that argument,btohqsg
What the heck is gg on,btohqsg
he's been like that since forever ago,btohqsg
not tuff if u know tai chi,btohqsg
Yes i m very lonely :(((,btohqsg
700+ messages??? what did I missed,btohqsg
a mental breakdown or two  idk,btohqsg
if you really like me right,btohqsg
U missed some good shit bruv,btohqsg
Basically they were talking abt relationships or smth,btohqsg
It's ironic and sad that you  of all people  find it funnyI'm pretty sure it started with you calling a certain practice 'degenerate' and preaching to us that we need God,btohqsg
Then differing views led to various unnecessary insults being exchanged,btohqsg
i remember seeing some drunk guy at a kfc in bedok ranting about how love is dead and god is dead during valentines day,btohqsg
Message from ⋆✧ 🎀 𝓁🍑𝓋𝑒 𝒾𝓈 𝒹𝑒𝒶𝒹 🎀 ✧⋆ deleted. Reason: external link(?),btohqsg

talking about relationships in sgexams often leads to nowhere good,btohqsg
Especially when there r clowns in the chat,btohqsg
but what if i dont have a relationship to talk about...,btohqsg
tim will you hold hands with me?,btohqsg

Anyone care to highlight some interesting messages,btohqsg
I meant the SGExams chat group,btohqsg
If we include all my messages,btohqsg
The whole chat started because of the Honest Bee guy,btohqsg
Mfw the 700 messages were of uncivilised conflict,btohqsg
It went downhill after the discussion about elitism,btohqsg
spx recovered back to 2500  and is never going back up ever again,btohqsg
Part 1: Elitist schoolsPart 2: Cheating boyfriends,btohqsg
Yes I highly recommend 第三部: スターダストWafflesians,btohqsg

Who should we marry off first? John Smith?,btohqsg
not all rj/hc/ac ppl are elitist  only a few are  its too general imo,btohqsg
Maybe i saw 100% more elitist hc ppl than rj ppl,btohqsg
ik a few ppl in those schs  and some r rly thr bc of hard work and talent one,btohqsg
like ik this one guy who lives in a hdb,btohqsg
Im also teachin some1 there who also lives in 1,btohqsg
But i dont think ur residence dictates ur worth,btohqsg
ya not all of them are rich/have the mindset that ppl of lower socioeconomic background dont exist etc,btohqsg
but ya i agree elitism has a role in some schools  serving as a form of (reverse?) motivation driving ppl to want to bridge that gap,btohqsg
i think elitism to some extent is needed ba,btohqsg
but too much is a bit too excessive/detrimental,btohqsg
I went to ACJC in order to obtain prestige,btohqsg
Pack it up guys. It’s over for us non-elites,btohqsg

Then a fk ton of dust fell down,btohqsg
We stare at him with 'oh we are fked' facesThen they laugh back at us  and walk away to the next bunk,btohqsg

Some dude started being vulgar and all,btohqsg
i dont feel safe on the internet :(,btohqsg
You shouldn't feel safe on the Internet,btohqsg
im gonna be up all night thinking about that...,btohqsg
Internet shdnt be a safe space,btohqsg
if telegram is getting to u,btohqsg
also i’m super scared of her now,btohqsg
Its getting to my sense of humour,btohqsg
dont waste time arguing on some platform when nobody rly cares,btohqsg
There r really better things to do than arguing online :),btohqsg
hi kind reminder to be civil with one another :),btohqsg
Despite being called many nasty names :(,btohqsg

I go stand by bed for 30 mins and wtf just happened,btohqsg
u stand still but the world continues moving,btohqsg
There was very little fight and more implosion,btohqsg
Sry for interrupting but a level doesn't have bell curve right? Does this mean your relative performance to ur peers still matter? Or if u hit 70  its an A,btohqsg
For years when syllabus just changed  its 70 for an A as theres no basis for moderation,btohqsg
Relative performance does not matter  however the A mark may not be 70,btohqsg
After 2017 the minimum for A grade is relative to cohort performance to some extent,btohqsg
It will shift a bit to prevent grade inflation,btohqsg
I thought you don’t believe in bell curve,btohqsg
A bit as in from 70 for an A  it becomes 72,btohqsg
Not 70 becomes 80  thats a bell curve,btohqsg
MOE has alr debunked the lack of a bell curve,btohqsg
Moderation at national exams is less extreme than how a bell curve moderates grades,btohqsg
So dont need to worry much,btohqsg
The real terror of bell curve is in uni,btohqsg
97 for A+ in a math stats paper,btohqsg
I think is the year 1 math paper,btohqsg
Ohh so it can vary slightly based on the cohort performance but the margin is very small,btohqsg
But H2 chem as long as ur overall for real a levels is 73 or more out of 100  i can 100% guarantee is A,btohqsg
So it'll probably always be near ~70,btohqsg
So at the end of the dayIs just like a typical internal exam,btohqsg
Cos the minimum to get A can increase slightly above 70 in certain years  but will never be lower than 70 for sciences.,btohqsg
Speaking of that  i suspect humanities has a lower grade boundary,btohqsg
Based on my raw scores and percentages,btohqsg
I asked like seniors and seniors 2 yrs back their estimated raw score and actual grade for h2 chem,btohqsg
Gp i estimated myself to be 70-75 for my yr,btohqsg
Maths i believe in syllabus change years is 70 rawThereafter usually no lower than 75,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  this is mere speculationYou should aim to do ur very best at the end of the day,btohqsg
My year 65% was good enough to get A I think,btohqsg
How would you know what your raw score for a humans subject was,btohqsg
Thats why GP lowest distinction rate nationallyOnly 20-22% ish,btohqsg
Thats why i wont 'know'  hence its called a 'estimate',btohqsg
Maybe it was easier to mark cos i remembered leaving an 8 mark econs qn blank,btohqsg
It's not in the examiner report right,btohqsg
Just to test the bell curve,btohqsg
Nope  examiner report never reveals grade boundaries,btohqsg
Like u left the qn blank,btohqsg
Tbh  if u leave planning blank (5%)  should be able to get distinction,btohqsg
If you plan to fail planning  you succeed,btohqsg
I remember doodling nonsense on my planning qn,btohqsg
Also bruh why you tag this acc,btohqsg
Im still a 100% no to lockdown,btohqsg
Cos to me  only local transmissions shld be taken into account,btohqsg
SG cannot bear a lock down,btohqsg
Imported cases take up hospital beds too,btohqsg
No one wants a lock down either,btohqsg
Ppl who truly campaign for one in singapore are rly dumb,btohqsg
But good for thoseLet every1 experience NS confinement (again)  gender equality,btohqsg
Is just that most singaporeans rly lack critical thinkingNot saying is wrong to have differing opinions  but whether such a derived opinion to begin with is rational or not.,btohqsg
not even having heard anyone's rationale,btohqsg
