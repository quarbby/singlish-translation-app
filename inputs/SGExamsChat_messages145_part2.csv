Why do a lot of students like to call their teachers 'cher'? I was taught that you don't say 'teacher' in English to a teacher  it is Mr/Mrs/Ms something,btohqsg
They dun care right ü§£ they juz want a good time,btohqsg
Cos ur exposure to sports hub was limited at that time,btohqsg
Don't know. I didn't want to see the results.,btohqsg
Is it? Yes i think so. Thats why one method of teaching/learning chinese is to go by a sequential routine. ‰π†ÊÉØÊàêËá™ÁÑ∂I learnt this from one of my clients who is an indian preschool teacher. She taught me how to teach her indian boy chinese. Not bad. Quite effective,btohqsg
Maybe cos u left things to chance did u?,btohqsg
