later your wiring short circuit in rain,btohqsg
In the move got the light....extra oomph,btohqsg
I just need grill light and leg room light,btohqsg
See how much first. If expensive must wait,btohqsg
old car came with led on the doors  after a while the wire also snap,btohqsg
had to seal it and cut out incase short,btohqsg
Depend on wiring skills n position 😂,btohqsg
Electrical stuff oso very dicey one,btohqsg
Nowadays..wan find a good place with the proper way of doing electrical stuff...not simple😂,btohqsg
you already go to the best,btohqsg

Always ask me to grow up😂,btohqsg

Mine the seats cnnt move after i install,btohqsg
thats why i keep mine loose,btohqsg

Thinking how to move the whole thing into my room and still have space,btohqsg
impossible unless u sleep on the chair,btohqsg
Only solution I have is put a new PC  play using VR,btohqsg

My suggestion you can give your dealer or the person you bought from . Ask them about the colour code etc and where he did it to save your hassle,btohqsg
If for my side I do can match colour,btohqsg
But the best if you have the code,btohqsg
If have the code just touch up will do . If not might worried the colour diff tone etc,btohqsg
