Oh interesting  then maybe itâ€™s a new workaround HAHA,btohqsg
hello  can i ask for cardup monthly payments for income tax  when using the promo codes for lower fees  the discounted fee is only applied to the first month (ie first month). any way to apply the promo to the recurring monthly payments? or have to set up new payment and input promo code every month? thanks!,btohqsg

Hi there  any idea where can I check instarem amaze fx rate?,btohqsg
which ocbc card better? the new rewards card of the 90N? and what difference for 90N visa vs master?,btohqsg
Good day  anyone can recommend a good time deposit acc for CPF? Thx,btohqsg
How did you come up with the calculation?,btohqsg
Depends what kind of spending youâ€™re doing,btohqsg
Hi if i hv 105k now in ocbc but i have excess of 5k as i want to earn the save bonus. Should i put 80k into Moomoo cash plus for 5.8% return for 60 days and the remaining 20k to remain in ocbc 360 account so i can earn in both areas,btohqsg
For Moneybull  the conversion rate is S$1 = USD0.7297 or USD1 = S$1.3704.When converting back from USD to SGD using current market rate USD1 =S$1.3424  we immediately loss close to SGD$3000 in exchange rate  Hence the total earn from promo is only about SGD$1k ++am I correct ?,btohqsg
Im not sure if you need to convert to USD  then lock it in the short term treasury with 5.8% yields  then convert back to SGD to withdraw free of charge. But either way theres a FOREX conversion loss  so your gains may not be 5.8% esp with larger amounts of cashAlso just be careful moomoo as a broker isnt as reliable as larger ones like IBKR or TOS  and your cash needs settlement of 2-3 days (due to lack of liquidity by smaller brokers)  before you can withdraw after the60 days,btohqsg
Incorrect  you could just leave in SGD and won't be exposed to FX Risk,btohqsg
So activate moneybull can be in SGD?Transfer in S$138k  activate moneybull  it will auto subscribe SGD fund?,btohqsg
Your 20k in ocbc 360 will not earn the save bonus  but others like salary or card spend will apply if you've met the requirements,btohqsg
Does applying via your link override this promo?https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/citiplus-welcome-promotion-tncs.pdf,btohqsg
and still give 1.5% p.a. base interest to the first S$50 000,btohqsg
Correct  1.5% p.a. base for Citi interest booster first $50K,btohqsg
ok  if I put 60K  will get $530 + AirPods + $50 + 1.5% pa (for 50K),btohqsg
wanna buy air ticket which card more suitable for use  ï¼Œ want no min spend required,btohqsg
DBS WWMC: 4mpd up to 2k per cal monthUOBKF: 3mpd on SIA and scoot no cap,btohqsg
Hi  if card linked into Fairprice app  is it considered online spending?,btohqsg
6mpd if you have upb ladyâ€™s solitaire card with travel category,btohqsg
For $10k cardup fee is 2.25% or $225. You get 12 000 miles.So you are paying 1.8 cents per mile,btohqsg
Thinking of getting a no-frills miles card in addition to my uob lady card. Was wondering below -Is there any big diff btwUOB PPVandCiti CRMC + amazeBoth 4mpd on online spendUOB PPVallows contactless payment via Apple Pay Amaze CRMCuse physical amaze cardBonus capped at $1110 and $1000 spending per monthDBS WWMCâ€“ 4mpd on online spend capped at $2k  amaze nerfed  cannot convert offline spend to online spendHSBC Revoâ€“ 4mpd on contactless/online spend capped at $1k  travel and OTA nerfedI would thinkUOB PPVis better for local spending andDBS WWMCfor travel bookings. Is there anything I missed out? Any advice? TIA! ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
If you only want one more card then choose uob ppv because it pools with your uob ladys.Is travel related transaction part of the allow list for uob ppv though? I'm not sure. Note that mobile contactless only refers to you tapping mobile device on a terminal,btohqsg
Oh yes travel related excluded from UOB PPV online. Missed that out. Thanks!,btohqsg
Guys. If kris+ and uob merchant  happen to be the same. Then i use kris+ to pay using uob krisflyer. Does it clock the card point?Cause i read t&c of krisflyer uob. They say miles will not be awarded for uob merchant,btohqsg
"Yes. Clocks (Provided u go via Kris+)Paying via this method is like using Shopback  Amaze or what other payment processor to ""get around"" paying directlty",btohqsg
use the lady's card to clock travel spends instead of DBS WMCC. this way you pool everything under UOB (w PPV),btohqsg
yup just in case i've exceeded the $3k capped for the month already  which card would you recommend?,btohqsg
Thanks. Can advice what the difference on contactless  online   offline spend  mobile contactlessI see liao confused,btohqsg
i think HSBC revo travel/OTA via Atome not nerfed. WWMC is viable  but note the points only valid for 12 months  rather short imo,btohqsg
And if let say its a uob merchant  how can i pay using the uob krisflyer? Cause if i tap or apple pay. Then cant clock miles right?Then if the shop dont have shopback or anything. Then how,btohqsg
And if KF miles gonna expire. Anyway to tt to kris+ ? Then tt back. Will it extend?,btohqsg
Transfer to Kris+ cannot transfer back,btohqsg
What way you recommend to extend the miles,btohqsg
Use before they expire or you pay to extend. Donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any other way to extend,btohqsg
Ps. For people that participated in the webull shares transfer in promotion. Once ibkr has transferred the stock to webull how do you get the statement of proof from ibkr to submit to webull? Under clause 6.5,btohqsg
If you use kris+ the merchant is kris+ so you do circumvent the uob$ merchant thing,btohqsg
yup that's one of my concerns also. As a spare card might not clock much points/miles  and have to pay conversion fee. If not can only clock on other UOB card with lower earn rates since the UNI$ can pool  or cashback cards,btohqsg
Layer it with Amaze  then transaction becomes Amaze * ...,btohqsg
During months of travel spend  donâ€™t hit your ladyâ€™s card limit and divert those spend to other cards (PPV  CRM etc),btohqsg
u can go to IBKR website and submit a ticket? or either check from your transaction history on traderstation ALso  when the assets/options are transferred  there should be an email confirming the transfer.Im more familiar with TOS  i transferred from TOS to IBKR,btohqsg
But latest t&c say amaze transaction cant clock liao,btohqsg
Ah ok icic. Because ibkr removed the shares I am transferring from my account but there's no email yet. And webull hasn't received it as well,btohqsg
oh usually ACAT takes 3-8 days  you can put a web ticket on IBKR website to ask them for proof that you transferred and submit the ACAT transfer statements to WebullYour mileage may vary if you are transferring less liquid shares  or shares OTC (out of counter)  like i own some russian shares they cant be transferrred  or if you own NESTLE stock  these are less liquid shares that arent on NYSE etc (i think  in case im smoking you),btohqsg
Where got. Probably just Amaze * Transit not all Amaze trx,btohqsg
