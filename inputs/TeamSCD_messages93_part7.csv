TE37 looks good on almost all JDMs,btohqsg
I hope that means good  if so thanks üòä  if not  i will try and do better üòÉ,btohqsg
Have to.. else a lot of brake dust to clean ü§£,btohqsg
with brake dust it'll go from gloss to matte üíÄ,btohqsg
i think that's silver but it looks better than black,btohqsg
Hahaha my car so small. Cannot la,btohqsg
Replica may look the same  just the material the use to replicate the rims,btohqsg
But to know if its replicate or not,btohqsg
Either have sticker on the rims,btohqsg
when you use 100% of your brain,btohqsg
But nowadays replica rims looks so identical to the ori,btohqsg
Depends lor. Its like branded bag have ‚Äútriple A‚Äù,btohqsg
another point of consideration is the QC,btohqsg
Saw a te37 the other day  looked fine until u realize there are 2 PCD,btohqsg
i've seen ori that offer dual pcd too,btohqsg
4 bolt but has the 5x113.6,btohqsg
How can a rim have 2 pcd,btohqsg
U either have 4 or 5 bolt,btohqsg
Usually the thai one is better and more identitcal,btohqsg
The one i was looking at had 4 bolts. Then i saw the pcd 4x100‚Ä¶ then oei? How come further along also write 5x113.6,btohqsg
The taiwan one just try to avoid,btohqsg
what about those that swg bring in?,btohqsg
In the end  u run reps from unknown factory  it becomes a safety issue,btohqsg
Its a world of difference wearing a chiong gucci t shirt and running your 1.5 ton vehicle on dubious rims,btohqsg
