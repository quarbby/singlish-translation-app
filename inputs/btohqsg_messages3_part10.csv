does anyone has insights on the yellow patch of gazatted area in the URA plan map above WWSR1?,btohqsg
This I'm not too sure. My number is 1799. Too far off liaoo hahaa,btohqsg
All units in Woodlands urbanville have been booked. All paid 2k already.,btohqsg
bro  when was these pics taken?,btohqsg
a bunch of monkeys are always there  right below the estate,btohqsg
I nearly kena attack as I was holding a plastic big,btohqsg
"yeah  got residents go there take pics  kena ""robbed""",btohqsg
I wanted to make a big detour but was held back by those monkeys,btohqsg
so my wife and I uturn,btohqsg
not to hold any plastic bag next time if we are going for some stroll,btohqsg
we saw a baby monkey really so small and cute  but once the parent saw us getting closer  a few of them on alert mode and walking towards us  the baby went to the parent who then hugged him  so cute and warming,btohqsg
they could think that u wanna attack them,btohqsg
I held my stuffs high up  the monkey stay out and stared at the items,btohqsg
but in any case  really appreciate the pics bro,btohqsg
nothing lah  just 2 shots nia,btohqsg
Yah  do not show your teeth to the monkey. Even if we are smiling  baring teeth is a sign of aggression for the monkeys.,btohqsg
What do u guys think abt staying near the bin n lift area?,btohqsg
lift area means exposed to every outsider with the main door opened,btohqsg
but also the first to reach home,btohqsg
don't have to walk along your neighbours' houses to the lift,btohqsg
I have to walk past 4 houses to the lift,btohqsg
Wow thank you! Nv thought of this before hahaa.. but mine not directly outside the lift  so not too bad,btohqsg
Hi all do you know if there are a y units still for sale at waterway sunrise 1 / 2,btohqsg
Ivan Ong  any more available units do u know ? Do I go direct to HDB ? But this project delayed till 2023?,btohqsg
put into perspective of outsider and residents,btohqsg
oops SBF for punggol no info yet,btohqsg
should be the same opening as BTO,btohqsg
Yup. 2 days ago. I'm juz a short distance away from the bin. But at a corner. Should be fine ba,btohqsg
As long the bin is not directly infront of your door should be okay. Do people need to pass by your unit to throw rubbish? If u got inconsiderate neighbour then your doorstep will be dirty,btohqsg
"i open my main door  straight away face the 2 dustbin  head on. they face me  my main door face them  right in the eye.but apparently  HDB is building a wall with ""angled fins"" for light and ventilation due to fire safety requirements.",btohqsg
Hello does anyone know roughly when the feb 2021 results will be out,btohqsg
at this rate  i dun think HDB can catch up with the new BTO projects. They already whining on the news about the dropout rates LOL,btohqsg
those units that are supposed to be picked by the dropout ones and if left unpicked  are to be ended up as SBF and then OBF,btohqsg
normally within 4 weeks after the application is closed,btohqsg
when did the application of BTO Feb closed ah?,btohqsg
then it should be out soon by this week,btohqsg
I'm like one house away to the bin,btohqsg
Yaaa. The direction will be quite windy,btohqsg
As long in front no blockage  and facing North/South  it will be very windy during year end til Feb,btohqsg
I'm clueless on wind sun direction,btohqsg
but no 1 criteria for me upon unit selection  pick one with the nicest scenery,btohqsg
HiCan anyone suggest me   recently one of my friends has applied for nov SBF 2020 but his application was unsuccessful like no ballot direct unsuccessful so May I know what it could be the reason ? Like is it very common or something else,btohqsg
why would you think his application should be successful?,btohqsg
Coz as first timer married couple then applied near to parents house both working,btohqsg
They won't make a loss.. Because they get back the grant plus the interest..,btohqsg
some contributed $100+ still can't get it,btohqsg
I think HDB should change the name from (BTO) build to order to BTA ( build to anyways) coz this nothing to do with order Liao ..üòê,btohqsg
I very lucky.  I got it first time apply.. my ballot üó≥ number was over the expected requirement units,btohqsg
I applied 3x  was lucky to tio everytime,btohqsg
then trying for mature estate on the 3rd time since it is much nearer to work,btohqsg
