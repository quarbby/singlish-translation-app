I accidentally accounted for the 2 mirrors that he put,btohqsg
get called back for reservist when they need people to patrol the streets for real lockdown,btohqsg
I expect a programmer to be more careful,btohqsg
You may call it an off by 2 error,btohqsg
I can’t wait to shoot people for walking on streets/s,btohqsg
Or at least shout at them,btohqsg
But tbh isn’t Tekong like the perfect place for the virus to spread? Shouldn’t they be just letting all the NSFs go home,btohqsg
Oh wait recruits are urged to stay home,btohqsg
Nvm I read the news article wrongly,btohqsg
I have no idea what they are trying to accomplish anymore,btohqsg
Of course  it’s a real human behind them,btohqsg
Let’s see how many mods I can remember,btohqsg
Which prof u took it under,btohqsg
i can't do linalg to save my life,btohqsg
fwiw i did in sem 2 so maybe it's permanently him for sem 2 linalg,btohqsg
He reduced the weightage of final exam from 60% to 35%,btohqsg
i only remember not being able to do half the questions :'),btohqsg
Hahaha my senior say he is more kind than wang fei though,btohqsg
the bellcurve really rekt until no tmr,btohqsg
They should abolish bell curve this sem,btohqsg
lucky my cores all didn't have finals to begin with,btohqsg
so i'm not too affected by the changes,btohqsg
but my UEs all convert to mcq online quiz liao,btohqsg
hell will freeze over before NUS does smth innovative LOL,btohqsg
Some prof mods average grade is A-,btohqsg
In fact level 1k computing mods and cs2030 got no curve,btohqsg
If I ever do become a Prof my average grade will be C-,btohqsg
I thought below C is D+,btohqsg
Oh okay then I will just give Cs and Ds then,btohqsg
dis me when i print hello world into my console,btohqsg
that's pretty much any Tom  Dick or Harry hacking into a computer in any movie,btohqsg
Aw yeah  this is what I was made to do,btohqsg
Also can I just say that CS is the only major where the degree is harder than the job itself,btohqsg
this Andrew person seems like one of the tech nerds from the discord server,btohqsg
If u take cs3216 of course gonna be extra hard,btohqsg
all on board the ben leong pain train,btohqsg
I’m still thinking if I should take a second major in CS  stats or physics,btohqsg
CS and stats I have less of an interest in,btohqsg
If u want go data science should take stats arh,btohqsg
Cs1010s is enough to experience it,btohqsg
according to my friends  3203 is bad enough anyway,btohqsg
can't relate  not my course req,btohqsg
3203 is software engineering project right,btohqsg
An alternative to it is 3216 and 3217,btohqsg
I’m actually trying for 1010E during summer,btohqsg
And I wanna clear by y1 so it doesn’t prevent me from taking other mods I want,btohqsg
Oh u mean special term arh,btohqsg
If 1010e or 1101 is suddenly offered then I will take it,btohqsg
1101s and 1010s are the most hardcore ones,btohqsg
signing up yourself for torture heheh,btohqsg
I have the whole summer holiday to study for it,btohqsg
At least it is not ben leong teaching it,btohqsg
pain is weakness leaving the body,btohqsg
U want see ben leong should go 1010s,btohqsg
Yeah I just hope it’s suddenly offered,btohqsg
They say they are planning to expand the # mods offered,btohqsg
Anyway i heard the 1010e prof in special term quite bad arh,btohqsg
Can always try to learn concepts online,btohqsg
Yeah but I can take E or X if I want to,btohqsg
X is the same as 1010s,btohqsg
because python doesn't have strings as char arrays and pointers  they can move onto more abstract stuff like 1st class functions and focus more on recursion,btohqsg
X is in python also arh,btohqsg
Just that they include 1 additional topic on C,btohqsg
But 1010x this sem not by ben leong anymore,btohqsg
Yea but got 1 additional topic on C lorh,btohqsg
I like prof tan more than ben,btohqsg
Idk man nvr took a mod under him,btohqsg
So doesnt matter which one u took,btohqsg
Just that the order they teach abit diff,btohqsg
Wah cant wait for this year computing freshies,btohqsg
This year computing freshies quite sad,btohqsg
Sure boh CS still majority guys LOL,btohqsg
Join comp club for fk HAHA,btohqsg
Ya so if u cs guy want to know bza girls join comp club lorh,btohqsg
Idw know biz anal or is girls,btohqsg
But now is also need take 2030 2040 alr,btohqsg
I think they gng unify all the computing degrees LOL,btohqsg
U can join lonely heart club,btohqsg
No need cos my heart not lonely :),btohqsg
but tbh not a good thing,btohqsg
i nvr do 2030 then kena thrown to do 2103,btohqsg
2030 and 2040 are more siong than 2105 and 2106 leh,btohqsg

U do the same fking thing as us LOL,btohqsg
no need force to take 1101s also,btohqsg
Ifs and cs are the same degrees,btohqsg
ifs is basically cs but spec into security alr,btohqsg
And no chance of interacting with women lah,btohqsg
Infosec even worse than cs in terms of gender ratii,btohqsg
Thats good in a way tho,btohqsg
I find comp club damn boliao,btohqsg
U want see girls go take a second major in math la,btohqsg

No need big brain for maths,btohqsg
To like getting ur mind expanded LOL,btohqsg
Did u take any mods under prof chin,btohqsg
i tried stats minor  try st2132 i go fly kite liao,btohqsg
Fk computing also dk why the culture change,btohqsg
Why did they make computing into some sexy course,btohqsg
They destroyed my nerd safe space,btohqsg
In 2013 it was like BBBC,btohqsg
Did u caught anybody plagiarising before,btohqsg
70% of them domt unds shit,btohqsg
Cause most are forced to take it what,btohqsg
Wait till u see this incoming batch how many ppl gnna die during cs1101s,btohqsg
Den how many gng drop computing LOL,btohqsg
A lot of bandwagoners cmg in nao,btohqsg
I think most see mission 2 quit liao,btohqsg
Computing gnna chew them out and spit them out,btohqsg
I think the train one den cancer lol,btohqsg
Mission 2 and 7 is the hardest i think,btohqsg
Who dk why they choose computing,btohqsg
U know the gender ratio will tilt towards guys as u go towards y4,btohqsg
A lot jump to biz anal,btohqsg
my course 40 ppl  i think number of girls like can count with 1 hand,btohqsg
He think girls cmi for computing LOLOLOL,btohqsg
But he said infront of all guys lah,btohqsg
Only ah tiongs girls can tahan computing,btohqsg
Singaporeans some can make it but most cmi sia LOL,btohqsg
The more i study computing the more i think its true,btohqsg
I think if u network specialisation,btohqsg
So u took steven halim mods la,btohqsg
Idk yet lah can change again what,btohqsg
i do 3230 liao swear off algos,btohqsg

Idk how the fk she make it so far LOL,btohqsg
so far i haven't met ppl who really jia lat but then again i only did 2103,btohqsg
This chat become computing talk liao,btohqsg
but honestly if you can survive 1010  2030 and 2040 and you still cmi code,btohqsg
It takes skill to bluff their way through compuing too,btohqsg
then theres sth wrong w u liao,btohqsg
