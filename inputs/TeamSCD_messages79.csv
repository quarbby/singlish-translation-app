Some 528 fc more jialat tho,btohqsg
My Fav Car spotted at Suntec,btohqsg
means he can afford even worse FC,btohqsg
Rx8 I think FC not the main priority for owners 😂,btohqsg
Not very de fuel frugal car to start with even stock condition 😂,btohqsg
I think they spend more on engine oil and spark plugs than fc😂,btohqsg
Not sure abt ownership of Rx series..can't afford one anyway😂,btohqsg
Just based on some owners experiences shared nia😂,btohqsg
Rx8 that time when I viewed was only 8k+ depre,btohqsg
Got one is dunno wad spirit something edition,btohqsg
Rx8 are not expensive. Keeping it running is another story.,btohqsg
Too many told me it was a bad idea,btohqsg
I trust u on that sir 😂,btohqsg
Hmmmm  its not any more expensive than a golf gti,btohqsg
Now I think Bo depre 8k manual rx8 liao,btohqsg
The issue is that the parts are less available,btohqsg
I went for the euro r instead,btohqsg
So if u can preemptive maintenance u should.,btohqsg
Oic...hmmmm.similar plight as older JDM cars,btohqsg
In this case your maintenance is probably not much different,btohqsg
Except honda parts maybe easier to source,btohqsg
Why i buy rx… u dunno if there will be another one… my lifetime i want to drive/own/operate at least once,btohqsg
The sound is as promised  like listening to an alien language  dont sound like any other car u ever driven,btohqsg
To me it's the best doors of all time,btohqsg
And when u open the rear door it breaks passerby necks,btohqsg
And their face is like wtf did that door just open backwards,btohqsg
I think it was the seats that didn't work for me,btohqsg
I sat in it and felt like it wasn't for me,btohqsg
It didn't give me the right feel,btohqsg
U got agent OG seats  recaro  bride options,btohqsg
I had the deal in place already  95% settled,btohqsg
Oof  we almost had one more rotorhead,btohqsg
But really when I sat in it  I couldn't do it,btohqsg
Full leather with the triangle hole?,btohqsg
Also the brakes all quite worn,btohqsg
The RS trim recaro seat is the best seat i ever put my ass in,btohqsg
I even wish i can pluck it out and bring upstairs when wfh,btohqsg
Has to be that because I'm very sure it's a RS model,btohqsg
A lot of advert put rs but is bullshit,btohqsg
After that I sat in a fn2r,btohqsg
So I was all set for a fn2r... But ended up with the euro r,btohqsg
Dealer didn't want to play ball with the fn2r,btohqsg
I like my car to have a full backside,btohqsg
I still not into simi sportback fastback hatchback,btohqsg
Euro r when sat inside  put deposit after test drive,btohqsg
The seats also not too bad,btohqsg
Cold start 2 fan running. On aircon one fan got some electrical static sound. Warm start  one fan not running.,btohqsg
Don't dare to on aircon to run,btohqsg
After knocking it then it runs,btohqsg
Knock harder let the carbon deposit loose it might run again. If really can’t then scrape yard find used motor.,btohqsg
