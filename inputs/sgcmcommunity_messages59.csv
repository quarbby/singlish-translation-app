Depends if you wanna drive it or store it at museum as a show piece lor,btohqsg
then reliability is a consideration lol,btohqsg
Like I said lor older cars “reliability” should throw it out the window,btohqsg
There’s alot of wear and tear confirm,btohqsg
You wouldn't want to buy a car that you don't find parts and keep sitting in garage lol,btohqsg
My friend got an old car whose engine gasket leaked...need to custom make one...And wait long long 😂,btohqsg
Peugeot announces updates to 2008 rangeIt includes an evolved trim lineup that brings enhanced equipment and changes to exterior styling.👉🏻  React with 🥰 if the Peugeot 2008 model range interests you!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Another way to keep classic car alive is to EV it...but SG is very slow to adopt this...,btohqsg
I know Classic Motor Works is attempting one conversion now. (CMW is the coy whose orange MG were wrecked by the accident caused by the infamous RS3),btohqsg
That why is a project 😂,btohqsg
I want a drivable car. haha,btohqsg
Electrify yup. In fact I am secretly hoping for another beetle reboot  EV  where motor is at the rear and rear wheel drive,btohqsg
And hopefully more retro looking unlike the ID Buzz,btohqsg
Nah  more like the power and range of Mini EV or Honda E,btohqsg
now drive bus is the way,btohqsg

There is the Hiace Commenter wide body. 13 seater. Non high roof.https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1118615,btohqsg
most family don't need such car in sg. go cp aso troublesome,btohqsg
HDB MSCP carpark maximum weight 2 000kg.All this giant MPV above 2 000kg not sure can get season parking😅If family needs any 8 seater.There is always:Honda StepwagonHonda OdysseyToyota EstimaToyota Noah/Voxy/EsquireMazda BianteOlder model Alphard/Vellfire.All these model are cheaper than giant MPV like Staria/Carnival and lighter.,btohqsg
Starex the best. But sg dont have any registered as passenger car,btohqsg
height limit also another problem . I saw a tall van type literally rub the ceiling😂,btohqsg
Not worth it. When you include the passenger car Parf. Can buy better car like Estima or Alphard/ VellfireThere is P plate Hyundai H1 same diesel engine,btohqsg
2.5 turbo diesel. Damn fun to drive. I drive 2 family to genting/KL hahaIf nt wrong is 13pax car,btohqsg
I see a few SAIC massive MPV.Like Hyundai Starex.For that price.I rather get Estima. Or any Japanese brand. Easy to get partsGo workshop  can leave within same days,btohqsg
Aiya just get VW Type 2 la. LOL,btohqsg
Below 2000kg  checkedSize: Not that huge  breeze to navigate MSCP  checkedSeats: Up to 11 seats  checkedSpeed: 0-100km/h: YES (checked),btohqsg

ALL HAIL ELON AND HIS OFFSPRINGS,btohqsg

Fire can happen to any car,btohqsg
Most important thing is having a manual override to unlock the doors,btohqsg
most American will not buy Tesla. it's considered too expensive for them. even without Coe n taxes😂🤣,btohqsg
You should be more wary of r3tarded drivers than catching fire,btohqsg
My investment finally grow some fruits,btohqsg
Last week when I go hang flower   a taxi uncle in Prius tell me that his car is over 1 k km full tank don’t need care about gas price,btohqsg

the pop pop pop i30 on tiktok is black colour right?-R,btohqsg
The bastuck or the fox exhaust,btohqsg
I rather nice exhaust sound than purpose misfire system.If there is flame on the exhaust for show I can understand la,btohqsg
pops and bangs are just too sharp and distracting imo,btohqsg
(I felt so old saying that 🤣),btohqsg
https://youtu.be/Q_m4-ed0tmULook like HONDAAK-47 backfiring 😂Wanna do pop and bangGo big or go home 😂,btohqsg
the pops are damn shiok when u catcgh one,btohqsg
like an sv accelrating den pop,btohqsg
Backfires and afterfires are worth paying attention to since they can cause engine damage  power loss  and decreased fuel efficiency. There's a variety of factors that can cause your car to backfire  but the most common ones are having a poor air to fuel ratio  a misfiring spark plug  or good old-fashioned bad timing.12 Feb 2020https://www.firestonecompleteautocare.com› ...Why Do Cars Backfire? | Firestone Complete Auto Care,btohqsg
insert a spark plug just before the tip,btohqsg
Rich refers to the mixture of fuel and air not the octane itself,btohqsg
for fire to come out need stagger timing,btohqsg
up the fuel per cm cube of air,btohqsg
Rich would mean that you your fuel to air ratio is high,btohqsg
i.e.  more fuel for amount of air,btohqsg
rich also means you got too much money to spend on petrol,btohqsg
Everytime I start car  there’s always a burst of gasoline smell,btohqsg
just programme to spark when let of the throttle,btohqsg
no means u nvr put cats,btohqsg
To run rich  you must be rich,btohqsg
This one when you start get go,btohqsg
i heard got this civic str pipe w 200cell cat,btohqsg
We know where to send them as well,btohqsg
i had a trans cab drive past my home ytd with a modded exhaust lmao  that thing was LOUD,btohqsg
sometimes yes means u running slightly rich,btohqsg
Thats why TP/LTA is there to correct mistakes🤭-R,btohqsg
But my friend everytime after send his partner home  he clear carbon,btohqsg
your Head Sideways Display says otherwise,btohqsg
Cause I want to netflix and chill but cannot at home,btohqsg
Or if money’s tight  watch movie inside car,btohqsg
🥲 bold of you to assume I have a wife,btohqsg
leaving vehicle on idle is a crime btw,btohqsg
this guy keep digging hole deeper for himself,btohqsg
Then taxi waiting for passenger at pick up point,btohqsg
Or those that camp at airport,btohqsg
that one the queue is moving ah,btohqsg
if you sit inside on aircon leave engine idle watch show  of course offence,btohqsg
camping at airport you report them la,btohqsg
if you say your car moving while watching show  even worse offence,btohqsg
So i can do this on an ev?,btohqsg
