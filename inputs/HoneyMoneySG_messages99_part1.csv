This clause has been there for years lol,btohqsg
i meant if they want to exclude other banks credit cards cashback on giro  they wouldn't just state HSBC credit card.,btohqsg
CSO verified insurance payments will still be eligible. üéâFor now.,btohqsg
Sorry how does this work?Start from 95k. Then each month increase the balance by 500?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best premier banking account you guys recommend? Currently have ocbc 3.3% so want to see if there‚Äôs better deals,btohqsg
Like I said  that clause wasn't changed since day 1. They can even remove it because HSBC themselves are a financial institution lol,btohqsg
Maybank Manchester United Card (you can skip this if 1. You are not a Man U fan 2. You can't be bothered to wait till they win a game),btohqsg
Anyway i just texted my RM to clarify  her response is paying other bank credit card NOT affected.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows what is the best credit card for $1800 travel agency fee? Leaning more towards cashback cards,btohqsg
Ya I hope so too that my RM is good and correct with her response. Also too lazy to change the GIRO even if it's excluded. Nothing we can do if HSBC nerf it  just hope for the best,btohqsg
Called in to the call centre  cc bill payments still eligible  as long not self initiated on online platforms,btohqsg
So no need change GIRO to cc billing organisations ü•π (for now),btohqsg
thanks all for proving me wrong.I AM HAPPY TO BE PROVEN WRONG.. huat ah!!,btohqsg

I redeemed/exited moomoo sgd money market fund today but cannot withdraw it to my bank account. Was told it takes 1-2 days to be withdrawal. Is this normal?,btohqsg
usually they said wait for 7 days,btohqsg
yes if you have additional funds since you won't get the funds from the sale. Also  you risk not being fully allocated,btohqsg
what card do you guys use to pay town council?,btohqsg

Just walked out of HSBC Branch.Everyday+ 1% for Insurance & Credit Card payment is safe!Only crypto and investment brokerage accounts that people have been gaming the system is excluded.Before this people just giro $50k in & cash out the next day.,btohqsg

I don‚Äôt think so  from website FAQ  allotment date when cash is deducted is before the month end‚Ä¶,btohqsg
so sad they closed the loophole but it was inevitable...,btohqsg
OLD everyday+ HSBC T&C  for future reference in case anyone wants,btohqsg

Not true. I done it before.,btohqsg
yes i 'heard' they allow contra... never tried myself b4,btohqsg

thank you for confirmation. Effort of filling up form didn't go in vain,btohqsg
If you are new then you might apply for a high interests salary crediting bank account which likely is UOB one. Best to choose 1/3 cc to spend $500/month. UOB Evol  UOB Lady or UOB One,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fine as there‚Äôs official guidance.https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/singapore-savings-bonds#:~:text=Yes. Individual%20Limit%20of%20S%24200%2C000.If I have reached my Individual Limit but have submitted a redemption request  will I be able to apply for new Savings Bonds within the same month to bring my total holdings back to the Individual Limit?Yes. You can redeem your holdings in SSB and apply for a new bond in the same month  provided you are within your total Individual Limit of S$200 000.However  you must ensure that there is sufficient money in your bank account at the point of application as your redemption proceeds will only be returned to you by the end of the second business day of the following month from when you¬†submitted the redemption application.,btohqsg
