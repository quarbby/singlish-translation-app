If you want capital guaranteed go for savings acc,btohqsg
There is a risk to MMF as it is not capital guaranteed and not as liquid as saving accounts but in return it can give you better returns. So you have to decide what are you looking for.,btohqsg
Anyone able to advise. For UOB EVOL  when will i get the cash rebate?1) The first billing month?2) The following month for the previous cashback?,btohqsg
i think it should be installment plan offer by Amex itself when you pay a big amount transaction (e.g 1K from flight) - Not from atome/shopback (installment)just like other card bank have offer installment plan interest free -when you pay big  amount transaction. (if you convert to installment plan - Mostly it will not eligible for Cashback or Mile),btohqsg
For condo owners...1. Any recommendations to get essentials or all cost home insurance? If I'm looking at GE  the premium is about 2x for all cost. But I'm not so sure if it's worthwhile. My agent told me it's for more 'preventable' things such as accidental loss or damage to contents  which to me is... Probable not things I would claim for.2. How did you estimate how much cover to get under renovations since a lot of appliances  flooring  carpentry may have been provided by mcst?I asked my mcst if they could give me an inventory list with cost breakdown so I can estimateThey don't have  ask me to ask the contractor (which has proven to be quite incompetent when I was undergoing defect rectification with them)  lol,btohqsg

Can 1 person participate in uob earmark promo for both uob one account and uob stash account ?,btohqsg
If you read the tnc  I don‚Äôt think is allowed,btohqsg

Hi  for uob one card  if I use it at uob$ merchants  does the spend get included for:1) uob one card cashback tiers ($500/$1000/$2000)2) uob one bank account interest ($500 per month)?,btohqsg
This means that is more worthwhile to use other bank credit card now then the equivalent HSBC card cos other bank I can still giro the bill to get 1% rebate,btohqsg
1 in Jan and 1 is Apr okBoth in Jan or both in Apr no,btohqsg

Question. If I link Amaze card with UOB Lady and use it to pay for overseas travel expenses (MCC4411)  when Amaze charge UOB  will it be the same MCC code to earn the 4 miles/ dollar?,btohqsg
Thanks. I thought Amaze will charge UOB using their own MCC which may not get the 4 miles per dollar.,btohqsg
Never have been this caseIt only change offline to online transaction,btohqsg
So  I will get the 4 miles per dollar. Right?,btohqsg
Yes correct if the MCC under is under the category you selected  so yes,btohqsg
So now we know the reason why HSBC decided to nerf it lol,btohqsg
yes basically doing nothing at all and money just flow into the bank account.,btohqsg
Shopee = Uob one for 10%,btohqsg
If go for miles.. which is better? üôèüèª thanks for sharing,btohqsg
What options are there ? Dint know we could giro Cc payments and get rebateÔºå interesting,btohqsg
Can use HSBC Revo for Shopee as well. One of the last few safe use cases,btohqsg
this is why bank payment will eventually will be nerfed too. aiya don't discuss this. hsbc rep reading comments and taking notes.,btohqsg
Can always pay revolution using DBS card then giro DBS bill from EGA,btohqsg
Pay using Dbs card will incur cash advance fee isn't it ? Quite risky imo,btohqsg
hi  a question about the uob one nerf  lets say i have been maintaining avg of 100k in uob one thus far (til 30th apr)  so after the change even if i have 150k on 31st may  will i only have an avg balance of 110k (100*4+150)/5?,btohqsg
Sorry what? Why did you calculate like that?,btohqsg
