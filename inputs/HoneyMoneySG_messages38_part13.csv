Does anybody know for the HSBC EGA  the bonus interest 4.35% is for April  May  June  and July. What about the interest rate for August onwards? Since we have to keep the account active for 6 months otherwise there may be an admin charge for early account closure.,btohqsg
it will be at the prevailing interest rate ie. 0.05%,btohqsg

For SP  telco bills totaling about $250+ monthly  should I just charge to UOB absolute 1.7% cashback or is there any other better card?My main monthly spend is on UOB EVOL.,btohqsg
Used to be using uob one  but monthly Cashback is $17+ ($50/3)EVOL can get $40  so more worth it,btohqsg
That means  minimum $300 spend for SP + telco right?Maybank platinum visa doesn't exclude utilities and telco right?,btohqsg
yea  think can just clock $300 each month get $30 quarterly rebate,btohqsg
Checked TnC. No exclusion. Not 100% sure. Anyone can confirm?,btohqsg
Ok. Just wanna ask it's in SG timezone right?,btohqsg
anyone knows if I registered for EGA promo in mar but didn't deposit in Mar  can I still deposit in Apr? also what's the best date to withdraw to still quality for the bonus interest?,btohqsg
EVOL is for my normal spending of $600. excludes SP and telco,btohqsg
Evol Cashback is capped at S$20 on Online spend  S$20 on Mobile Contactless spend and S$20 on all other spend for each statement month. Very troublesome to keep track...,btohqsg
So itâ€™s not confirmed yet? I just use my UOB EVOL card for cashback first for April month bah,btohqsg
Telco online payment counted right? I know utilities confirm excluded.,btohqsg
Received paynow reward from SingSaver. Canâ€™t recall  how do I check? ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Same way as how you receive paynow from anyone. Check your Trust Bank account for the transaction,btohqsg
Should be as itâ€™s from HSBC SG,btohqsg
Yes for Apr deposit  Feb balance is your reference month for 4.55%. As for bonus interest 1% for salary/new funds credit  only first 2 months of joining (max cap at $300 interest on new funds per calendar month),btohqsg
guys which is the best salary crediting account?,btohqsg
For me is Ocbc because I cannot hit min spend consistently to get bonus %. If you can hit  is uob?,btohqsg
ok im currently on uob stash account - it makes sense to switch to UOB one account but im considering OCBC too..,btohqsg
You can stack uob one account with uob one cc / uob evol .. shiok,btohqsg
