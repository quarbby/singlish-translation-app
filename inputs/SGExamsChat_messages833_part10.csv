and imo tutoring doesn't do much either,btohqsg
you can tutor after you settle a levels,btohqsg
what is your purpose of wanting to tutor,btohqsg
tutoring doesn't do anything for portfolio,btohqsg
unless you want to be a teacher,btohqsg
Tutoring also doesn't help in being teacher,btohqsg
for engineering  not much will add value to your portfolio outside of just grinding for those As,btohqsg
ok tutor knows more than me I kowtow,btohqsg
My wife sch teacher some more,btohqsg
if you wanna join MOE you typically want v good grades too,btohqsg
i see from both sides of the industry,btohqsg
so tldr is just grind for A levels,btohqsg
lol I was having a discussion about how much time a teacher spends per week creating his own teaching materials,btohqsg
even for jc tutor  I used to spend hours. Only recent years I taper down cuz mostly created.Now I thinking to create more books to sell.,btohqsg
i'm a TA and still make some of my own materials,btohqsg
My first 6 chapters of H2 Physics  over 200 pages of materials already ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I am a lab demonstrator and have to show a student what is a log log graph,btohqsg

opening the oscilloscope to see what's going on,btohqsg

Trust me when i say my role as a lab demonstrator is to exist,btohqsg
I came for a session not mine  I saw the other lab demonstrator just sitting there,btohqsg
now that there's 3 TAs per session,btohqsg
the business of a lab demo is kinda low,btohqsg
finish uni then understand financial management for yourself I can say good luck to you,btohqsg
cool. You work in Uni Engineering Lab?,btohqsg
but I only understand a bit after I finish unino wonder I gg ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
unless you're earning so much money you don't need good financial management la then... I nothing to say,btohqsg
schools do a non existent job of financial literacy,btohqsg
get paid to goyang kaki in air cond lab. dream job.,btohqsg
Nah. My role is to ask students to sign attendance,btohqsg
sch is to burn students time so thay parents can work for Singapore Inc,btohqsg
But like. They also not coming for their own slot....,btohqsg
i'm a teaching assistant in an undergrad physics lab among my other roles lol,btohqsg
I would argue tuition does that equally well but I shall stop myself and go to sleep LOL,btohqsg
find a partner  settle down with a BTO early. Property prices still increasing,btohqsg
What's the median salary of Singaporean  and and how long to wait and price of a BTO?,btohqsg

Singaporeans still earn so low? Heard NTU/NUS Fresh Grads at MNCs already $5k.,btohqsg
uni grads are not the majorityb,btohqsg
"I did work as a ""curriculum development assistant"" at a private sch/tution before lol",btohqsg
I rmb one of the students just spilled like chemicals onto the paper,btohqsg
It was a sad moment ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
I remember I dripped a drop of HCl or KMnO4 on my lab manual before  it literally crumble and chew through a hole.,btohqsg
Hopefully it isn't an actual exam paper for your student lol,btohqsg
The saddest moment was knowing from the other tutors that that same student attempted to cut before,btohqsg
