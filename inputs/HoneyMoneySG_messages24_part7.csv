yes but incur 2.8% fx fees. can pair uob lady with Amaze to avoid the 3.25% fx fees and still get 4mpd for selected MCC,btohqsg
Ok got it thanks. The other option will be to use <4MPD cards like Citi premiermiles tagged to amaze? But not optimal,btohqsg
can also use uob prvi mc+Amaze,btohqsg
Omg… all along I thought UOB visa signature was capped at 1k spend.. I’ve been wasting my miles..Can I confirm it’s capped at 2k spend for if I just want to use it for local contactless?,btohqsg
capped at $2k  need to meet min $1k local spend to get 4mpd for local contactless/petrol,btohqsg
Shit.. wasted 2 month worth of extra 1k,btohqsg
Some spending can Google Pay but not on HSBC Whitelist. Best to use UOB PPV if it’s not Yuu or UOB$ merchants,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany referral link for HSBC Revo with sign up bonus?,btohqsg
Hsbc points have longer lifespan compare to Uob,btohqsg
Hi Guys can I check.If we use liquid pay or shopback and pair w Citibank rewards card. Do we get 4 miles per dollar ?,btohqsg
cease means will never have again or only for the time being?,btohqsg
Can use to pay other cc?,btohqsg
NP  is my one card solution.,btohqsg
I remember theres discount buying season parking through giro. Not sure how much discount though,btohqsg
I know alot been said abt citi bank rewards pairing with amaze. How abt if we prefer cashback?,btohqsg
anyone know what's shopee MCC? or if HSBC whitelist cover it?,btohqsg
Depends if u prefer Cashback auto credit back to u on next statement mth or u prefer to accumulate them  and then manually one shot redeem them...,btohqsg
Paying for shopee directly with your cc  yes  in the whitelist for HSBC Revolution. Shopeepay is blacklisted and in any case the fee for topping up with cc is too high,btohqsg
Sorry just to check. How about Kris+ and Ntuc FairPrice online app? Also can use Citibank rewards card to earn 4 miles per dollar ya?,btohqsg
Agreed shopee if use cc card don't top up to shoppe pay ifcnot no point just charged directly,btohqsg
Hi.. I'm confused between the below 4 credit cards to apply -1. HSBC Rev2. Citi bank Rewards3. Dbs women's4. Dbs altitudeMainly my purpose is to get quick air miles as I'm a frequent traveler.Also I'm more into online shopping(lazada)  food deliveries  cabs  and my 95% daily transaction are cashless.Monthly transaction exceeds 1k SGDPlease advise.,btohqsg
What are the options for either one?,btohqsg
Crmc+amaze  but can’t use for travel,btohqsg
I can even use 2 cards.. For travel related expense HSBC Rev can be used right?,btohqsg
Cashless do you mean mostly online/in-app or mostly contactless (paywave/paypass)? If mostly contactless then dbs wwmc is not a good choice because it's only for online and cannot pair with amaze,btohqsg
Both online in app purchases and paywave which I'm very frequent on daily basis,btohqsg
I think safest will be hsbc Revo (travel related plus other whitelist categories) and citirewards+amaze (non travel related),btohqsg
That's the two I'm more inclined.. Thanks so much 🙂 🙏,btohqsg
For overseas spending  after spending $1k on crmc + amaze  which is the next alternative? Not considering DBS woman's card because of the short expiry,btohqsg
Roughly how much u will spend for the access?,btohqsg
WWMC will not earn any points with Amaze. Can use UOB Lady's Card or OCBC TR for 4 mpd  otherwise UOB PRVI MC for 1.4 mpd,btohqsg
Kris + is use with apple pay  so u won't get 4mpd with that  As for fair price online  u can use citi reward.,btohqsg
Kris + with hsbc revolution will get 4milesnperndollar,btohqsg
your best bet are gonna be at general spending cards tag with amaze Because u would not want to use your card directly for a fcy charge and the bank spread.reason of other card not recommended is all the other card are specialized spending. esp when u are at overseas  u dunno if the spend is gonna gain u any points. In the past the world woman card is the best when tag with amaze.But now i would suggest after hitting 1k  go on general cards.,btohqsg
Kris + works with HSBC revo at whitelisted spending. so got to becareful  That's for@mrDSYY,btohqsg
I saw kris + I think I will only spend on challenger or Harvey,btohqsg
Honestly Kris plus is an option if u are looking at hitting 13Mpd at a maximum.But is the main thing is u need to source for items that has that extra MPD  and a lot of place don't have it So got to be more meticulous.And transfering the krispay points immediately to krisflyer.but no point in using krispay miles to pay for items.,btohqsg
Yup... earn the bonus and transfer out.. keep till when gave promo den tt out,btohqsg
Guys  for DBS points  how do I see how many have expired?,btohqsg
Seems like the traditional “assets” oil and gold ended the “winners” in 2022. So strange ya..,btohqsg
just called in then realise this HSBC Jan23 promotion must walk in  cannot do online  HSBC website still showing old ratesCIMB fix deposit can do via CIMB app,btohqsg
Can check from your DBS PayLah,btohqsg
You can earn 4mpd on Kris+ through Google Pay by adding Amaze card to Google Pay,btohqsg
Kris+ can only link to Google Pay on Android though,btohqsg
Russia and Ukraine and Flight to safety. Where strange?,btohqsg
No. The white list is as follows:-Qualifying Merchant TransactionsMcDonald’s  KFC  Subway  Burger King  Ya Kun Kaya Toast  Toast Box  Fun Toast  BUS/MRT via SimplyGo  Netflix  Spotify  YouTube  Disney+,btohqsg
For property tax & Town council fees are best to use UOB absolute AMEX top-up GrabPay MasterCard to make payment before 15th January?,btohqsg
Anyone has experience converting your bank points to frquent flyer programs? Any idea if we can choose for example kris flyer or asia miles? I am looking at dbs bank. Thanks for your advice,btohqsg
Hello guys  which bank has to best fixed deposit rate now? Or keeping the monies in OCBC 360 would be better option.,btohqsg
There is a ocbc cny promo for 360acc.i am not certain if the 4.08% for 8mth FD applies to new 360acc holder only or not.,btohqsg
