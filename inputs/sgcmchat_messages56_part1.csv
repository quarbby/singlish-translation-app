Wicked wallop is a decade old automotive event. Mostly for modified and old school vehicles. Typical everyday grocery getter would look out of place in the event ground.,btohqsg

Conclusion - Due to the overwhelming response that I have received  people from my side are changing to Speedo's meet so I have decided as the founder and owner of Team Prestige to cross out my sponsorship with Sonax. So no more free gifts. And also to cancel my meet  so that it makes everyone happy. Even though it took me 2 months of sleepless nights and foodless days to go through the storm just to organize a meet for the community  I guess some people just want it so badly  I'll just take a step back. So do enjoy and please go to Speedo's meet. KLP ain't happening,btohqsg
