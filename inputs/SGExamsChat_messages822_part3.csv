Those are different periods with different structures of control.,btohqsg
Bare in mine the window between A level result release and the earliest university application deadline is 1 month,btohqsg
No the Vietminh was funded and started with CIA money funnily enough,btohqsg
Also your idea of parties just funding no questions asked is problematic as well.,btohqsg
It was more of Ho Chi Minh shifting and playing off sides and vice versa,btohqsg
The communists aren't just a unifed bloc of the traditional view,btohqsg
This isn't the time of Mccarthy whereby u just assume a single Communist ideal,btohqsg
Idk he is tryna say a seminal battle isn't part of the lead up to learning about Vietnam,btohqsg
Also his idea of what constitutes Colonialism is concerning to say the least.,btohqsg
Imo if you don't have the intention to do math or physics major in the future  then you should avoid H3 math,btohqsg
has anyone received their eae email yet,btohqsg
I don't think got anyone here going eae,btohqsg
Ns  poly  jc or uni alr,btohqsg
I think u can check status?,btohqsg
Actually I cannot remember haha coz I also bought a 5-piece box of it for a friendhttps://www.instagram.com/kamakura_singapore?igsh=aHRoa2M1OWx3Y2hoThe matcha flavour is only available at Taka but they have two other outlets: One Holland V and opposite Orchard Central,btohqsg
I want to buy so much matcha,btohqsg
I thought you couldn't buy humans anymore especially after what happened.,btohqsg
I shall go check it out! I love matcha,btohqsg
I hv been yawning like crazy,btohqsg
Maybe coz i woke up early tdy to go to the doctor,btohqsg
the 6 pieces chicken for $10 ?,btohqsg
Funny thing is when i lie down  suddenly not tiredâ€¦,btohqsg
U go turn on the TV and watch CHT talking about Oil Floatation live,btohqsg
You know what else is 100% fall asleep,btohqsg
Will fall asleep in the opp direction,btohqsg
Thing is I prefer Si Yans lap,btohqsg
It's like preferring a hard bed lestin :(,btohqsg
SOOO I GOT TO MOVE ON AND BE WHOOOO I AMMMMM,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s 2-pc(cup)  2-pc+icecream(cup)  5-pc(box) and 10-pc(box)Hope you like it!,btohqsg
Let's waste company time tgt Wyatt kor kor,btohqsg
to me this sounds like you are really discouraging us from doing h3 math or math major ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
aaah okok   i actually have a relative who got into a competitive uni course without any h3s so i think it would be better for me to focus on my h2s and gp ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
It depends on individual  like whether u like mathâ€¦and if u re considering math major  can consider try taking h3 math and see if it is what u want to do (h3 math is somewhat uni math maj foundation,btohqsg
then what about fm? is that close to uni math or no,btohqsg
these questions are just for my understanding,btohqsg
but tldr  for me you don't take h3 unless it's smth you're interested in learning more about be it curiosity or seeing if you wanna pursue it further,btohqsg
the advantage to admissions itself is v minimal,btohqsg
Is H3 Si Yan offered because I wanna pursue that deeper,btohqsg
We will learn about siyan's semiconductor theory,btohqsg
FM is closer to the uni math in like physics and engineering. a math major is very broad in terms of specialisations so harder to say there,btohqsg
H3 is more proof oriented and isn't THAT useful for most courses,btohqsg
well theoretical but regarding semicon systems,btohqsg
So does this mean I get to pursue you further?,btohqsg
once u take fm u have signed a pact with the devil,btohqsg
I would like him to come up with a theory why im bad at physics/s,btohqsg
i would rather buy spring chicken,btohqsg
Na it's just quantum possibility u are both good and bad at the same time,btohqsg
Isn't that a good thing? The smell of Desperation,btohqsg
Also obligatory this link works until teaching week 2https://sso.wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe88/owa/sso_login1.asp?t=1&p2=https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/change_course.pre_main&extra=&pg=,btohqsg
Physics exists as packets of energy which are in continuous random motion. By newton's 3rd law  there is an equal and opposing force acting on the light waves  hence net force = 0  thats why not just only you  but all of us are bad at physics,btohqsg
