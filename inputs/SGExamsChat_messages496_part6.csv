nvm i solved the issue alr but thanks lol,btohqsg
I told my investment agent I stop payment and she say ok,btohqsg
then somehow cos no monthly payment for a while they took my money,btohqsg
like they are so desperate to sell shit,btohqsg
it is called hard selling duh,btohqsg
Lucky I save the rest of my ns money in cash,btohqsg
Theres 3 pages of small print,btohqsg
She told me got nth just sign,btohqsg
I saw the investment agent instagram lol,btohqsg
bro contributed to the insurance agent lifestyle,btohqsg
leave out the most inportant details,btohqsg
not as bad as I thought,btohqsg
i think im on a aia plan,btohqsg
I think you should keep paying,btohqsg
i dont wanna be that guy...but my agent is pretty ok looking too,btohqsg
nvm not gonna call myself that,btohqsg
I spent on tuition and retake,btohqsg
why? your insurance person not nice meh?,btohqsg
nah tf would i do that for,btohqsg
what makes u think i do insurance ⁉️,btohqsg
no i meant like you buy insurance right?,btohqsg
if not nvm  cause i thought it was regular for ppl to buy some form of insurance,btohqsg
you saw the news of that one woman that sold a 50+ million bungalow at sentosa..got a 1mil comission,btohqsg
imagine stooping so low just for the incentive and leaving out the most crucial info,btohqsg
^this is why all the insurance shit is so saturated and full of pawns,btohqsg
I want to warn the young ppl abt aia,btohqsg
im very sure they dont get all the money,btohqsg
didnt you pull out after a while,btohqsg
They are actually pretty fking evil,btohqsg
i mean they provide a service and people pay for it..whether they have done it right or not is up for dabate,btohqsg
but at the end of the day its still a service which they have provided,btohqsg
something i find weird is why especially in singapore context  when someone scams/cheats or sell products here...They get fined less than how much they earned from those products,btohqsg
The profit off the account will easily cover,btohqsg
Its like the law have no idea how to give a justified punishment to these people,btohqsg
2 months ago she said all good,btohqsg
i was going to sign up with another insurance guy,btohqsg
it makes me think  this could possibly a reason why ppl still continue selling illegal products or scam ppl,btohqsg
at least i learn my lesson,btohqsg
because at the end of the day...if you maange to scam and get 1 million  the authortiies is going to fine you like 1/2 of how much you gotten illegally and maybe send you to prison for 5 yrs,btohqsg
but at the end of the day  you leave prison a few years later with 500k still,btohqsg
yes  its just something i have been thinking,btohqsg
