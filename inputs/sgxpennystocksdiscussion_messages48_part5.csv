Yup but you can see it's being controlled,btohqsg
The sudden surge in medical stocks on friday seem more like a relief rally rather than real uptrend,btohqsg
But i do see many bullish posts on MT now,btohqsg
It is. But investors have the company bosses ‚Äúindirect support‚Äù now.,btohqsg
I am holding 3 batches of MT leh,btohqsg
But I don't know what's up with all the bullishness haha,btohqsg
When all so bullish very scary sia,btohqsg
VP unfortunately turned out result pretty bad so not a good comparison. By all counts MT and gloves will be posting good results for few quarters. Beyond that is anybodys guess.,btohqsg
Yup. VP is a valuable lesson,btohqsg
Refer to previous posts before results released,btohqsg
But bro furion did share his write up on VP way before results released,btohqsg
Turns out to be pretty spot on,btohqsg
True but MT and Glove counters have already shown in previous quarters which VP never did.,btohqsg
Next few Q can always don't meet expectations,btohqsg
Provided me a valuable lesson though. I ‚ÄúLOVE‚Äù VP! üòÇ,btohqsg
Paid shouters working for BB  or those hoping to grab at possibly the lowest price.Good stock indicator will be the present of naysayers.Hokkien call them Horlan king.,btohqsg
I foresee TG to move up more than RS & MT though I‚Äôm not holding it currently. üòÅ,btohqsg
Most stocks once results out.. will drop,btohqsg
Latest ISDN results not bad also down,btohqsg
You know why MT one never drop,btohqsg
Released their results late at night,btohqsg
Open secret is no longer a secret leh,btohqsg
Who doesn't know TG results will be good,btohqsg
The day before results hovering around 2.7+,btohqsg
Then last one hour choing to 3 meh,btohqsg
Those can hold one at least not much damage done,btohqsg
I think got upside but limited la,btohqsg
Imagine all 100% this is what all medical stocks will look likeTG - 5.6UG 1.8MT  2RS 7.2,btohqsg
Something to look forward to. Christmas is just 2 and half months away.,btohqsg
Just for Bro AC 200% upside since he tell me MT no 3 no sellTG - 8UG - 2.7MT - 3RS - 11,btohqsg
I dont want to play spoiler as many are vested higher in tis one.. but i dont trust stocks tat suddenly move up on fri esp after dropping for most of the week,btohqsg
It could be just relief rally.. anyway tomorrow we will know,btohqsg
That UG jump was insane wor,btohqsg
Ya. I initially wanna short it at 0.89. Lucky I didn‚Äôt. üòÇ,btohqsg
UG don't seem like relief rally to me though haha,btohqsg
Anyway tomorrow we will know haha,btohqsg
MT also looks good to me,btohqsg
But it was really after DT kena covid then all ran up,btohqsg
Risk is there in all medicals. Anyway my point is risk of down side in MT till Q3 results is less compared to last 4 weeks.,btohqsg
UG most probably will open strong tomorrow.. not sure can chase,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not worth it to chase once the share start running.My MT is below $1 and at most investors should try to buy at that range.Once it start running  it‚Äôs no longer value investing.,btohqsg
Hey magic i am not sure how for rhb invest. I only know for vickers.,btohqsg
The share splits will not reflect in your RHB investment acc but will reflect in CDP acc. As long u checked ur CDP acc & the qty are reflected there  u can sell it thru your RHB investment acc even though it don‚Äôt show the qty. U can call your RHB investment broker if u r unsure just to be safe.,btohqsg
