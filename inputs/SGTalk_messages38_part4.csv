JUST IN: S’pore Reduces Social Gathering & Dine-In Group Limits To 2-Pax From 27 Sep,btohqsg
It's a bit of disappointment that the 2 to dine can come into effect again. Well  it' all for the good of all of us so no point me lamenting over it. Everyone juz b safe. It's not fun to b on QO. It's more to eat sleep Netflix eat sleep Netflix.,btohqsg

Debit card no installment.. only credit card..,btohqsg
