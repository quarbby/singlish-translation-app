110k max is what i will pay for a cayman 2.7 tip with 7 years left HAHA,btohqsg
No offense to anyone but i think it's the jdms,btohqsg
If a fd2r or s2000 or evo can command 20k depre  why should u settle for less than that if u selling a cayman,btohqsg
no leh to be fair porsche has been increasing in price irregardless of coe price,btohqsg
A cayman was 12k depre about 2 years ago,btohqsg

Quick question: what's the best petrol (high grade) for cars in MY?,btohqsg
I believe many ppl choose V-Power when they go pump petrol in MY-R,btohqsg
V PowerRACING. V power in malaysia is not the same as V power in SG. V power in malaysia is 97,btohqsg
if not just get petron 100,btohqsg
Carousell got afew thou  do check out the diff rates and models. Tribecar one is also decent la i rented a few times.  But their bike quite crappy tbh,btohqsg
Dunno leh  they have vans  so I guess they also have motorcycle. Currently they also have BWMZ4 in their list,btohqsg
Hahaha ok la. Blends in with the crowd,btohqsg
Actually i felt that the 97 gives pretty good mileage,btohqsg
And petron 100 is getting quite expensive,btohqsg
Last i pumped was i think 5.60 rm per litre. approaching $2,btohqsg

BLUESG $5000 EXCESS WHERE THE FISH,btohqsg
Didn't ride any of the N cars so I can't comment. But I always like it when manufacturer makes the more Sporter version of the sedans,btohqsg
Yep. Shack balls. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of painful lessons from hirers so far,btohqsg
And some hiring platform charge by the minute... one of the reasons why hirers always drive like fast n furious,btohqsg
Increase the likelihood of accidents only,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure you have seen some of them,btohqsg
Ya of course. Heard that bluesg speed limit is 110 or something but they manage to go faster than that,btohqsg
Plus most who rent cars are usually more inexperienced drivers since they don‚Äôt drive frequently,btohqsg
all these blue sg ppl always drive like mad one  kena accident w/ one b4 also,btohqsg
I see them I Siam far far,btohqsg

fuel oil comes from crude oil field which riggers need to hit rock bottom to extract. our fuel oil mainly comes from middle east or south america (i heard the oil well had dried up so not sure if there are any new explorations.) as for natural gas  as far i can remember  australia has a plant called wheat stone and providing it for oceania region. As to the million dollar question if fuel oil prices will go up  i said it will be cos when one tips the scale  everything lost balance,btohqsg
But why is it going down now,btohqsg
Maybe cuz Esso spoil the market. They lowered their price then the whole petrol village have to follow,btohqsg
Go down 50c then go up $1.50  easier for people to swallow,btohqsg
They go down alot so to move up alot more,btohqsg

Remember when I go my first bike back in 2006 Ron 98 $1.98? If I remember correctly,btohqsg
Price will just keep go up with more ev on the road,btohqsg
Actually I think the petrol price increase is marginal. Comparing to car mods  grooming  tints  exhaust upgrades  etc... Yes some of these you can say is one time cost but most of these mods actually make the fc worse so why do it in the first place if petrol price is a concern? Nothing much can do about the price increase  a better will be to focus on making more money or if that's not possible  then consider taking public transport. Petrol is one  there are more concerned stuff like food prices  electricity  etc. Car is a nice to have not a must have.Don't flame me and my0.000002 cents,btohqsg

Objective question. Assuming 2.5l for both models  between Vellfire and Alphard which would you choose as an owner driver for personal use (not private hire etc).Looking at the two between PIs and Borneo  I cant see a sizeable difference between the two but appreciate any thoughts feedback etc from the group here.Have a good Tuesday,btohqsg
i think vellfire looks nicer in my opinion haha,btohqsg
i know not a lot of ppl think so but unpopular opinion hehe,btohqsg

Prepare jelly cans  go fill up petrol now,btohqsg
Thanks Shane. Would be good to hear,btohqsg
Toyota stop Vellfire production.Alphard sells better due to its Majestic front grill. More pricey too.Vellfire is cheaper.Get it before it gone.You can always install the Alphard front grill bodykit outside.,btohqsg
Thanks Aaron. Pricing I note VF price differential. Do you know year of VF last production? Is this global discontinuation or just export (but still ongoing with JDM Vellfire?),btohqsg

this is before the $700 flat add on road tax for evs that will kick in 2023,btohqsg
probably G way of taking back the petrol duties from EV owners,btohqsg
The government has to make back the taxes that they might lose on people switching from ICE to EVs,btohqsg
The rebates are just to get people to jump ship for now,btohqsg
After EVs something else with lower emissions will come about,btohqsg

my dad got his 2008 car at $200,btohqsg
uh cat A also have before i think,btohqsg

cat B will reach 150k  cat A will reach 100k,btohqsg
Possible quota less than 1000 and always over bid,btohqsg
Rental company out many new cars for PHV usage,btohqsg

"Two major private-hire companies have denied bidding aggressively for COEs and pushing premiums up. ""There's no point. The bids are so high "" says one.https://cna.asia/3IRe0XY",btohqsg
excuses only... they bid high the cost also transfer to the hirer,btohqsg
as long as got people keep renting their cars they will keep doing it,btohqsg
they the drivers cry increased cost  and grab increase fares,btohqsg
And car owners just sit and can't do anything about it apart from paying a higher COE because the demand for ride hailing keeps going up,btohqsg
Hence the number of drivers and their cars,btohqsg
they need to renew their fleet,btohqsg
you think they will let those 7 year old Honda Vezels sit there ?,btohqsg
Many used cars around for sale.Don't have to buy new car.I bought a used 2yr old last year November.Not like everyone is gonna drive it for 10yrs. When new facelift or new technology is out.Most drivers will have some itch to change new model üòÇ,btohqsg
I agree! But used car market doesn't stand unaffected by rising COE prices and supply issues,btohqsg
Actually they can't renew as grab will not allow drivers to use more than 10 or 15 year old cars I believe,btohqsg
So they must buy new cars to lease out,btohqsg
I mean renew by buying new cars,btohqsg
Yuppp  need to replace the fleet,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt play a part.,btohqsg
In influencing the market forces for CoE,btohqsg
They might slow down right now  but need to pickup around 2025 when everything does come up for scrap,btohqsg
Yes. That why you need to negotiate hard.Tell the dealer  if you wanna sell me base on current COE price surge. Then I don't buy.You gonna have another month of no sales and 50-70 cars sitting in your showroom?Sell me cheaper. You get the cash from the bank  you can flip it.,btohqsg

Review of the legendary nasi padang at bedok reservoirDesa Rancapanggung Malay Cuisine run by our brother@awj_moodVerdict: 8.5/10Personally  I love nasi padang. It's always a good alternative to the Chinese cai fan fare I usually have. But   nasi padang is generally always more expensive than cai fan. At this store  you can get a huge packet of nasi padang for cai fan price (which was a pleasant surprise and huge motivator for me to come back for a repeat purchase).I ordered the beef rendang set. The beef was tender and tasty which is heaps better than most stores that serve you a hard piece of dry meat that can become makeshift murder weapons. If you're a meat eater you might want to add a double portion of meat.The sambal also damn shiok. üòçI think@awj_moodscared I not enough to eat. The rice he gave me was like a mini mountain.Definitely will order again. - J,btohqsg

LTA stats on cars active at the end of year by make,btohqsg
I.e. cars still registered on the roads and running with active COEs,btohqsg
Point of COE has been to limit the number of cars on the roads,btohqsg
Recently due to quick influx of EVs and deliveries of cars ordered during the pandemic being delayed is what has caused a sudden surge in demand,btohqsg
Hence the increasing prices as dealers promise to secure COEs for the buyers,btohqsg
not really a mee siam person tbh - J,btohqsg
but if you say must try  i cannot leave you hanging,btohqsg
ah wong may promise coe quota increase to 2k,btohqsg
gift to sporean for becoming PM,btohqsg
As long as companies lie Tesla and the big 3 Germans don't get back on track with deliveries (which they are unlikely to as they are enjoying selling cars at higher premiums around the world) and the continuous increase in demand for PHV rentals doesn't start stagnating a bit. COE may continue to rise,btohqsg
COE increase means less car otr?,btohqsg
Just that the cycle a bit broken this time,btohqsg
or is inflation just playing a part?,btohqsg
Hence the sudden drop in 2020,btohqsg
