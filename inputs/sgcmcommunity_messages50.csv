But a wise person once said “depre doesn’t matter if you’re gonna keep the car forever”,btohqsg

110k max is what i will pay for a cayman 2.7 tip with 7 years left HAHA,btohqsg
No offense to anyone but i think it's the jdms,btohqsg
If a fd2r or s2000 or evo can command 20k depre  why should u settle for less than that if u selling a cayman,btohqsg
no leh to be fair porsche has been increasing in price irregardless of coe price,btohqsg
A cayman was 12k depre about 2 years ago,btohqsg

You sound like a rich man sir,btohqsg

Quick question: what's the best petrol (high grade) for cars in MY?,btohqsg
I believe many ppl choose V-Power when they go pump petrol in MY-R,btohqsg
V PowerRACING. V power in malaysia is not the same as V power in SG. V power in malaysia is 97,btohqsg
if not just get petron 100,btohqsg
Carousell got afew thou  do check out the diff rates and models. Tribecar one is also decent la i rented a few times.  But their bike quite crappy tbh,btohqsg
Dunno leh  they have vans  so I guess they also have motorcycle. Currently they also have BWMZ4 in their list,btohqsg
Hahaha ok la. Blends in with the crowd,btohqsg
Actually i felt that the 97 gives pretty good mileage,btohqsg
And petron 100 is getting quite expensive,btohqsg
Last i pumped was i think 5.60 rm per litre. approaching $2,btohqsg

BLUESG $5000 EXCESS WHERE THE FISH,btohqsg
Didn't ride any of the N cars so I can't comment. But I always like it when manufacturer makes the more Sporter version of the sedans,btohqsg
Yep. Shack balls. I’m sure there’s a lot of painful lessons from hirers so far,btohqsg
And some hiring platform charge by the minute... one of the reasons why hirers always drive like fast n furious,btohqsg
Increase the likelihood of accidents only,btohqsg
I’m sure you have seen some of them,btohqsg
Ya of course. Heard that bluesg speed limit is 110 or something but they manage to go faster than that,btohqsg
Plus most who rent cars are usually more inexperienced drivers since they don’t drive frequently,btohqsg
all these blue sg ppl always drive like mad one  kena accident w/ one b4 also,btohqsg

fuel oil comes from crude oil field which riggers need to hit rock bottom to extract. our fuel oil mainly comes from middle east or south america (i heard the oil well had dried up so not sure if there are any new explorations.) as for natural gas  as far i can remember  australia has a plant called wheat stone and providing it for oceania region. As to the million dollar question if fuel oil prices will go up  i said it will be cos when one tips the scale  everything lost balance,btohqsg
But why is it going down now,btohqsg
Maybe cuz Esso spoil the market. They lowered their price then the whole petrol village have to follow,btohqsg
Go down 50c then go up $1.50  easier for people to swallow,btohqsg
They go down alot so to move up alot more,btohqsg

Remember when I go my first bike back in 2006 Ron 98 $1.98? If I remember correctly,btohqsg
Price will just keep go up with more ev on the road,btohqsg
Actually I think the petrol price increase is marginal. Comparing to car mods  grooming  tints  exhaust upgrades  etc... Yes some of these you can say is one time cost but most of these mods actually make the fc worse so why do it in the first place if petrol price is a concern? Nothing much can do about the price increase  a better will be to focus on making more money or if that's not possible  then consider taking public transport. Petrol is one  there are more concerned stuff like food prices  electricity  etc. Car is a nice to have not a must have.Don't flame me and my0.000002 cents,btohqsg

Objective question. Assuming 2.5l for both models  between Vellfire and Alphard which would you choose as an owner driver for personal use (not private hire etc).Looking at the two between PIs and Borneo  I cant see a sizeable difference between the two but appreciate any thoughts feedback etc from the group here.Have a good Tuesday,btohqsg
i think vellfire looks nicer in my opinion haha,btohqsg
i know not a lot of ppl think so but unpopular opinion hehe,btohqsg
none . just buy a van .. if need alot space,btohqsg
honestly  idk the diff sia HAHAHA,btohqsg
fuel price go up means less cars on the road?,btohqsg
Prepare jelly cans  go fill up petrol now,btohqsg
Thanks Shane. Would be good to hear,btohqsg
Toyota stop Vellfire production.Alphard sells better due to its Majestic front grill. More pricey too.Vellfire is cheaper.Get it before it gone.You can always install the Alphard front grill bodykit outside.,btohqsg
Thanks Aaron. Pricing I note VF price differential. Do you know year of VF last production? Is this global discontinuation or just export (but still ongoing with JDM Vellfire?),btohqsg

Fuel company neeed to spent money to built oil rig and such 1,btohqsg
If margin keep going down is pointless,btohqsg
Best way is to increase petrol price,btohqsg
Let said Singapore for example now got 4 k ev   means 4 k less car go to petrol station.,btohqsg
Then day will come when it hit 100 k car,btohqsg
Gov not yet find a good way to tax people for EV and encourage adoption at the same time,btohqsg
It is growing   and every growth is a lost of income for these company,btohqsg
So it a very simple thing with ev on the rise and esg   petrol price will just go up in the long run,btohqsg
And don’t underestimate the take up rate,btohqsg

this is before the $700 flat add on road tax for evs that will kick in 2023,btohqsg
probably G way of taking back the petrol duties from EV owners,btohqsg
The government has to make back the taxes that they might lose on people switching from ICE to EVs,btohqsg
The rebates are just to get people to jump ship for now,btohqsg
After EVs something else with lower emissions will come about,btohqsg
And a similar cycle will repeat,btohqsg
yeah  make u jump ship first.. then slowly sharpen the blade,btohqsg
We all know what happened with governments promoting and condemning diesels,btohqsg

i would think that those not in the bid wont benefit,btohqsg
"mixing some psychology and economics  i would expect the next bidding to shoot up in price because everybody wants in to the ""$1"" coe so it will easily surpass the quota and cause a surge in coe price",btohqsg
But I think if everyone bid $1,btohqsg
The argument was better in my head,btohqsg
my dad got his 2008 car at $200,btohqsg
uh cat A also have before i think,btohqsg
it was a technical glitch i think,btohqsg
but the motorbike one was solely due to not enough bids,btohqsg

Hence the number of drivers and their cars,btohqsg
they need to renew their fleet,btohqsg
you think they will let those 7 year old Honda Vezels sit there ?,btohqsg
Many used cars around for sale.Don't have to buy new car.I bought a used 2yr old last year November.Not like everyone is gonna drive it for 10yrs. When new facelift or new technology is out.Most drivers will have some itch to change new model 😂,btohqsg
I agree! But used car market doesn't stand unaffected by rising COE prices and supply issues,btohqsg
Actually they can't renew as grab will not allow drivers to use more than 10 or 15 year old cars I believe,btohqsg
So they must buy new cars to lease out,btohqsg
I mean renew by buying new cars,btohqsg
Yuppp  need to replace the fleet,btohqsg
I don’t believe they don’t play a part.,btohqsg
In influencing the market forces for CoE,btohqsg
They might slow down right now  but need to pickup around 2025 when everything does come up for scrap,btohqsg
Yes. That why you need to negotiate hard.Tell the dealer  if you wanna sell me base on current COE price surge. Then I don't buy.You gonna have another month of no sales and 50-70 cars sitting in your showroom?Sell me cheaper. You get the cash from the bank  you can flip it.,btohqsg
pls u heng  wfh trend makes people sell cheap. now no more,btohqsg
now where got cheap cars to buy,btohqsg

Of cos dealer cannot low ball and advertised cheap.Other dealers will not be happy. Spoil market.Go down and negotiate.Many dealer has high employees cost. They need cash flow. They need to sell some cars every mth.,btohqsg

I was driving on a merging lane. I was in front at the right and even signal my intention. This Mazda driver just sped up from the back and horned me and die die want to cut in front of me. I must brake to let him go pass. Drove beside him and tempted to give him the finger. Angst,btohqsg

Review of the legendary nasi padang at bedok reservoirDesa Rancapanggung Malay Cuisine run by our brother@awj_moodVerdict: 8.5/10Personally  I love nasi padang. It's always a good alternative to the Chinese cai fan fare I usually have. But   nasi padang is generally always more expensive than cai fan. At this store  you can get a huge packet of nasi padang for cai fan price (which was a pleasant surprise and huge motivator for me to come back for a repeat purchase).I ordered the beef rendang set. The beef was tender and tasty which is heaps better than most stores that serve you a hard piece of dry meat that can become makeshift murder weapons. If you're a meat eater you might want to add a double portion of meat.The sambal also damn shiok. 😍I think@awj_moodscared I not enough to eat. The rice he gave me was like a mini mountain.Definitely will order again. - J,btohqsg
We need more food review frm sgcarmart! Haha,btohqsg

woohoo 100k is the new low. 200k here we come,btohqsg
looks like they really planning to reserve cars for the rich now,btohqsg
we have 530k private car with 1.37m household,btohqsg
serious? where do you get that stats,btohqsg
the super rich 1 person aredy hoarding 10 or more cars,btohqsg
I’m starting to feel a bit left out here,btohqsg
Lucky you and I have nasi padang to unite us,btohqsg
the super rich person hoard the good cars and maintain it well,btohqsg

LTA stats on cars active at the end of year by make,btohqsg
I.e. cars still registered on the roads and running with active COEs,btohqsg
Point of COE has been to limit the number of cars on the roads,btohqsg
Recently due to quick influx of EVs and deliveries of cars ordered during the pandemic being delayed is what has caused a sudden surge in demand,btohqsg
Hence the increasing prices as dealers promise to secure COEs for the buyers,btohqsg
not really a mee siam person tbh - J,btohqsg
but if you say must try  i cannot leave you hanging,btohqsg
ah wong may promise coe quota increase to 2k,btohqsg
gift to sporean for becoming PM,btohqsg
As long as companies lie Tesla and the big 3 Germans don't get back on track with deliveries (which they are unlikely to as they are enjoying selling cars at higher premiums around the world) and the continuous increase in demand for PHV rentals doesn't start stagnating a bit. COE may continue to rise,btohqsg
COE increase means less car otr?,btohqsg
Just that the cycle a bit broken this time,btohqsg
or is inflation just playing a part?,btohqsg
Hence the sudden drop in 2020,btohqsg
The curse of vehicles with the numbers 6-0-0-0 on their license plate strikes again. But instead of a Cerato  it'sa Vezel this timeThere's 'I love you 3000' and then there's 'You stupid 6000'React with 👎if you're going to start being wary of vehicles with the number 6000 in their license plate.👉🏻 Read the full storyhere,btohqsg
How to estimated the value of the resale car if the price of coe changes all the time?,btohqsg
And also demand drop for sometime,btohqsg
See what the market trends for the model are I guess,btohqsg
correct current coe price to inflation and compare to 10 years ago  relative price will be the same,btohqsg
Usually for each model there is a graph on sgcarmart then you can see basis registration date of car and price what the trend seems to be,btohqsg
the tiffany blue colour disappeared tho…-R,btohqsg
depends... I really know of a rich family that use Bentley to send kids to school .really 買菜車。  they got more than 1 Bentley in the family anyway😂,btohqsg
