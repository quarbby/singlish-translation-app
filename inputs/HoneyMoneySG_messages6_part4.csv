Just to check  assuming i used SRS to invest in May's SSB  i assume its considered under 2022 taxes right cos its the tax period currently,btohqsg
it should be based on when you contributed to srs and not when the invesment is done,btohqsg
anyone used revolut card in malaysia? hows the exchange rate like for sgd --> myr on revolut and are there any fees?,btohqsg
Used before Covid  no Fees  i used to be Metal Card User,btohqsg
I don't think there's any additional fee unless you withdraw from a bank but from my experience there are some apps and some stall which the card couldn't get through.,btohqsg
Today’s rate today  is 3.10 to 1 SGD  the fees are for Fund Transfer,btohqsg
Up to S$350 per month  no fees for withdrawal,btohqsg
Do you guys invest in the silver and gold on revolut?,btohqsg
i invested $100 for fun haha,btohqsg
For use in Malaysia  there are 3 fees: Currency  Weekend and Foreign Transfer.Currency - Standard plan has a 5k limit per month  Metal is unlimited. Anything more  you need to pay a fee for that amount converted. This limit applies to all currencies  eg USD  EUR and resets at the start of each month.Weekend - Revolut charges a fee if transactions are done during weekends  between 5pm on Friday to 6pm on Sunday ET Time (currently GMT -4  which if converted becomes 5am on Saturday to 6am on Monday). Applies to both Standard and Metal plans.Foreign Transfer - if you are remitting money  Standard Plan charges 0.3% if you are on Standard and remitting MYR  up to a cap of SGD 9 (SGD 3K transfer). Metal has free transfers.Cash withdrawal - you can withdraw 350 SGD equivalent in foreign currency on standard per month  1050 SGD equivalent on metal. Fees are imposed for withdrawals greater than the limits. Weekend charges also apply if you withdraw during weekends on London Time,btohqsg
Above dun apply for Card Spending right,btohqsg
I'm not sure about this  as I've been using Revolut for international transfers. Not sure if card spending counts towards the 5k limit  but I think weekend fee applies if you are transacting outside of weekdays in London time.(Note that the weekend fee is not explicit  it is baked into the exchange rate),btohqsg
Exact fee breakdown for the same transfer  without the weekend surcharge exchange rate will bump up to 3.0905 (~0.3% spread from the foreign transfer fee for standard users),btohqsg
Any idea how to identify which ATM to withdraw money from at MY?,btohqsg
There used to be a list done up to see which banks do not charge a withdrawal fee for international customers when withdrawing funds  but it has not been updated for quite a long time (maybe COVID?)https://www.dropbox.com/s/ajifjmncdazhzm6/Revolut_FreeATM.xlsxAs of 2018  the list says that BSN Bank  CIMB Bank and Maybank can be withdrawn from  and to avoid RHB Bank. I think Maybank itself should provide enough ATMs since they are widespread in the country.One important thing to choose while using foreign ATMs is to choose the option of charging in local currency (i.e.  charging your cash withdrawal in MYR). Some ATMs will offer you the option of letting the ATM Bank do the conversion for you  defeating the purpose of Revolut since you will be charged that bank's exchange rate with a spread (typically 3% or more).,btohqsg
Good discussion over Revolut. I will have a video tomorrow discussing about this. Stay tuned!,btohqsg
Thanks  appreciate it! Useful guide especially when the international travel is starting,btohqsg
Hi community  what do you think of this?,btohqsg
There's no exchange rate like Revolut.,btohqsg
automatic as in the investment part,btohqsg
Anyone did a comparison of syfe equity 100 and VOO which give better returns,btohqsg

Hi Chris For withdrawal of up to $350 overseas  does the top-up have to be by bank transfer  and not credit card?,btohqsg
I'm referring to ur latest video on revolut.,btohqsg
It's not like Grab where they distinguish bank or CC funds,btohqsg
I see. Looks like a small loophole for a 'cash advance' :),btohqsg
"Well if you consider that you need to be physically overseas and the limit is so low  there is really not much incentive to ""monetize"" it",btohqsg
May i ask whats the best card for usage if overseas especially Malaysia? Currently using InstaRam for transaction in Malaysia (petrol etc etc...) any better deal? reccomendation? looking for a good exchange rate since for rm to sgd and also since instaram rrquired min spend of 1.5k to earn the cashback  am looking for other good deal. thanks,btohqsg
Take note instarem recent has a nerfed. Do read them out,btohqsg
Watched this and apply instaram through the link there,btohqsg
btw instaram helpdesk is good. always reply promptly,btohqsg
If i was traveling  then i would use citi cashback with instarem link (8+0.5%  with no fx fee). 8% petrol  8% groceries  6% restaurant  $800 min spend. If not enough then come back Singapore and top up NTUC Gift card,btohqsg
Hi Chris  Is there any guides available to sign up for priority pass membership using the DBS altitude card?,btohqsg
Currently I'm paying my insurance and investment from GE and AXA using GIRO. Can I use AMEX TCB to earn cashback?,btohqsg

You can top up your Grab wallet with your TCB card. And pay using your Grab master card via AXS.,btohqsg
