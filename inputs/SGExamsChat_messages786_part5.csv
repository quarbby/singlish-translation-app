Unpopular opinion: the 4th Telco should have been CMLink instead of TPG,btohqsg
unpopular opinion  Trans island services should not have merged with SMRT,btohqsg
CMLink is owned by China Mobile  the biggest telco in China  with much better reliability in its home country compared to TPG's reliability in Australia. SIMBA had a really rough start  and even now they're barely okay  definitely the worst of the big 4 tbh,btohqsg
fr my i used to use tpg and its coverage in mrt esp was bad,btohqsg
now im using gomo tho its 2x lol,btohqsg
eh i think u should join the TM eats channel,btohqsg
Unpopular opinion: why have a 4th telco  just buy a mvno sim card,btohqsg

I saw someone spoiler a photo before leh,btohqsg
I only know how to spoiler words,btohqsg
It is not random coz my point was idk how I wasted so much time in the toilet,btohqsg
It's an SCP. Time dilates and warps around the toliet. Although u may have spent 10 mins on the toliet accounting for relativity 50 years has passed,btohqsg
i tot testimonial is usually like a teacher/mentor/bosss liddat write one,btohqsg
Ok la my sec sch is,btohqsg
Then the chers verify n write in full,btohqsg
JC alsoâ€¦we write whatever stuff we want the chers include then cher write the testimonial,btohqsg
Coz not possible for the Cher to know everything about their students also,btohqsg
All school achivements they know. If you have external achievements tell them,btohqsg
My Cher told us if we donâ€™t write  they have nothing to say and the testimonial will be very short,btohqsg

do you guys prefer to do work on tablet or pen and paper,btohqsg
tbh i still prefer pen and paper T_T,btohqsg
@kohsyani got a Samsung tablet (more like my parents wanted me to get one) and the notetaking function is quite nice,btohqsg
Tbh i converted to ipad only coz there are too many paper to print,btohqsg
i only got a tablet after 3rd year of uni. difference in the actual writing experience isn't too big for me but the convenience is indispensable now,btohqsg
esp for my current work  and i tend to scribble a lot when thinking so less wasted paper,btohqsg
I got now even though i say idw then my parent insisted cause they say my pld was too heavy,btohqsg
I think am just not used to writing on tablets,btohqsg
if it's samsung s pen it's p similar feeling to writing on a notebook,btohqsg
Now bio is all online materials and then i still make hand written notes,btohqsg

i carry both my laptop and tablet everywhere lol,btohqsg
