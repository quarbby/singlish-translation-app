just moderate the results yourself and write stats report on ur peer results,btohqsg
the prof wont trust a bottom fragger on the curve,btohqsg
bottom on curve can be right tail,btohqsg
but u getting paid comfortably right haha,btohqsg
not rly possible to have CLT for them anyways,btohqsg
no la stat boards will peg ma,btohqsg
not cs tho  cs 75th is crazy,btohqsg
Since n is sufficiently large  by Central Limit Theorem  X~N(Mean  Variance) approximately.,btohqsg
i mean is still good  for 75th for other majors in cs,btohqsg
gg time to use t with df 29,btohqsg
hello did anybody c the news on removal of clt,btohqsg
just wondering what were the topics removed last year,btohqsg
need to wait for ur teacher to announce,btohqsg
i lucky lo but anyway increments don't need to talk la,btohqsg
i lookin forward to get lowballed,btohqsg
Asking for chem math and h1 econs,btohqsg
Thats gna take some time right,btohqsg
any science grads in ur workplace?,btohqsg
tm chem  linear reg and corr  globalisation,btohqsg
need to confirm  but shld be this,btohqsg
for now we can only suspect is same as last yr,btohqsg
but globalisation is h2 econs right,btohqsg

dunno whether got price discrimination because your major tho,btohqsg
but they do the same things as u?,btohqsg
yeah they're in very technical roles,btohqsg
wah nice o levels no vectors no organic chema levels no transition metals no linear regression no climate change (bio),btohqsg
my tuition teacher taught vectors for one whole month and now his efforts ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
u in jc or sec sch?,btohqsg
i see a lot of my course mates joining CSA's work-study programme  maybe can consider,btohqsg
i sent the link to my tuition teacher and he just replied with this ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
i taught transition elements to my students,btohqsg
if u go jc u still need to know vectors,btohqsg
haha i planning to go poly lol,btohqsg
i was damn happy no more transition metals (took As last year),btohqsg
Is the total marks still the same,btohqsg
