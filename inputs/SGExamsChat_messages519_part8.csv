also therefore  another reason I was in A-Levels than STPM lol,btohqsg
thought I gotten 8As in SPM was a breeze  then saw A-Level International syllabus  and I said to myself  look at all those past year papers and publically available marking scheme,btohqsg
Ah but as a international student applicant its a disadvantage for AUs,btohqsg
Especially cuz International Alevels as well ðŸ’€,btohqsg
That and SMU SIT SUSS SUTD,btohqsg
well  my friend gotten 3A* (chem/phy/math) 1A in Further Maths got rejected to NUS/NTU lol,btohqsg
so yeah i can see why lol,btohqsg
Cuz its international Alevels as well,btohqsg
technically for Malaysians the easier route would be STPM/UEC into NTU/NUS,btohqsg
but then my tuition friends and I was tired of writing BM essays lol. We all scored like 7As-9As  and we said let's yolo together in A-level college.,btohqsg
rip good that it lasted more than 20 years lol,btohqsg
the issue is the cost not the loan. the value you get from those unis without a scholarship isnâ€™t worth if youâ€™re not intending to pursue further studies or work overseas,btohqsg
uni in the US is extremely expensive even for citizens,btohqsg
If u got into a Ivy most likely u alr choose to work overseas,btohqsg
Cuz the EV is higher there,btohqsg
i mean thatâ€™s based on the assumption you alr chose to do that,btohqsg
but thatâ€™s precisely why itâ€™s not always worth,btohqsg
if i have a scholarship hell yea,btohqsg
and people can change their mind,btohqsg
Isn't that cuz he had to come back lol?,btohqsg
anyhow  apparently UK is very generous on giving offers placment to International Students  even my friend gotten a bunch of Cs managed to get a place in some rando UK uni,btohqsg
U go overseas not for the education but for the experience,btohqsg
And if it's the US the pond is bigger there,btohqsg
for US  no idea how widely accepted is A-levels is  but I think you need to do some add on SATs.,btohqsg
Don't think so most Ivy's are shifting to a Test Blind or Test Optional model,btohqsg
unless you're some child prodigy or have some big cable connection.,btohqsg
Pay is higher in the US tho gotta talk also about which majors,btohqsg
no idea how the 3 folks in Malaysia with International A-Levels gotten into Harvard recently,btohqsg
i just know one is an olymplaid maths winner,btohqsg
pond bigger but also big issues,btohqsg
i mean iâ€™ve a ton of friends that are american citizens,btohqsg
In the US starting pay for Ivy would be 15-20k.,btohqsg
Plus going us is like smurfing,btohqsg
oh  Top in the World Certificates are normally quite common for International A-Levels lol,btohqsg
but not sufficient enough to lead them to Ivy leagues,btohqsg
nah that statistic is very mistaken,btohqsg
its not as bad as you think,btohqsg
There's always downsides but I don't see the point of being afraid of the downsides while not fully seeing the upsides of a bigger pond,btohqsg
no i just think youâ€™re not really having a close look at the actual situation,btohqsg
We are tailored to look at the US and the world in a negative way cuz the news is always fucking negative,btohqsg
You have the freedom to choose your state/ suburbs city or rural,btohqsg
plus you can live in an asian comminity,btohqsg
you mean being gunned down or murdered?,btohqsg
one of my exes was literally from MIT and itâ€™s a big struggle without a scholarship,btohqsg
Us got 300 million ppl hello,btohqsg
i mean not for me because iâ€™ve enough experience personally with the US,btohqsg
1 person doesn't constitute a full view of the US,btohqsg
iâ€™ve friends from like most states,btohqsg
i also have been to most of them,btohqsg
And those friends represent a fully sampled unbiased group?,btohqsg
