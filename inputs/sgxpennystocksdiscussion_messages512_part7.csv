Chinese President Xi Jinping issued the clearest evidence yet that the Communist Party‚Äôs recent assault on China‚Äôs biggest Internet companies has a broader social agenda rather than the ‚Äòtargeted‚Äô measures against individual examples of bad practice  as officials have tried to portray the attack.Chinese state media reported Xi as telling a government meeting of the need to ‚Äúregulate excessively high incomes and encourage high-income groups and enterprises to return more to society.‚ÄùThe news comes a day after new draft regulations were published by antitrust regulators that would ban many of the practices used by the country‚Äôs big Internet platform companies to squeeze money out of their users.
