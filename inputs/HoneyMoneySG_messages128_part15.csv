For hsbc travel one lounge access  it shows 4 visits per year. Are we able to bring a guest? Does it then count as 2 visits?,btohqsg
Only one credit card lounge access package that I know of allows this. The DBS Vantage 10x visits. All else is only for the card holder or one guest if stated.,btohqsg
Is it ? I always goes to PP with my family member and they do not stop me as long as I have enough visit entitlement for deduction . They donâ€™t even check the card that offered the lounge visit privileges so they wonâ€™t know itâ€™s from DBS vantage or not ?,btohqsg
And some PP lounge donâ€™t even deduct my visit entitlement for my 4yo kids,btohqsg
Pp and dragonpass have different policies.,btohqsg
Hello people.  Can I have your advice pls. If u have 600k spare cash  where will you all put for max return? We would need the returns to offset our house loan cost.   Happy to give small token if able to give good advice.  Thank you,btohqsg
Can consider OCBC Premier Dividend account if you can satisfy the top up per month and no withdrawal.3.3% on the whole quantum.,btohqsg
Your question is not easy to answer as you didn't state how many people you can utilise and what kind of risk profile you are.As you may know  higher risk = higher return.Low/no risk = Minimal returns or need to work hard for the return.I would assume you are as similar to my profile and are conservative.Then:$360k in HSBC EGA (you need 2 persons) 4.x% p.a.$150k in UOB One (one person enough) 5-6% p.a.$90k in SCB Esaver (you need 2 persons) 3.x% p.a.,btohqsg
I can utilize my wife and I,btohqsg
Oh dear.  Thanks so much for the helpful advice,btohqsg
Based on personal experience  toast box post on the next day but you can try cold storage or burger king as well.,btohqsg

hi guys  what is the best home & fire insurance to buy from for private property ?,btohqsg
Do you have Online Equity Trading with no minimum commission? If yes  just buy any 100 shares at $0.001... Total it will cost you 10c. I won't even care if the company will still exist the next month or not. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hi guys  any one knows if paying for McDonald's party is the same MCC as normal MCD meal  i.e. can earn additional cashback using UOB One card?,btohqsg

Amex pay is the only one right now.,btohqsg

How do you trigger a 10cents investment ðŸ˜®,btohqsg

@chiangyawanother thing which I just thought of... Before I started doing this 10c investment method  previously I was doing monthly RSP of $100 into a stable fund (but it will only count for 1st 12 months).,btohqsg
Any good credit card for nsf? Currently have standard charged account but the rewards got nerf thinking of getting better card,btohqsg
Hi everyone. I am a miles card noob here. May i know what is the best credit card i should use to earn miles if i want to buy luxury wallet in europe at around $1000SGD?,btohqsg
Rather than using those trust card that just give linkpoints,btohqsg
Trust has a cashback card now ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
If lets say i buy something at 700euro in europe (in sgd around $1013) and pay by UOB visa card  how much additional do i have to pay in SGD for the currency conversion rate?,btohqsg
From my understanding  1% visa fee and 3.25% bank charge.,btohqsg
I saw many people will tie with amaze card. The only benefit is to reduce the bank charges only?,btohqsg
and convert offline to online  and change transaction description,btohqsg
Can all these miles card can convert their miles (UNI$ etc) to krismiles and redeem for SQ etc flight tickets?,btohqsg
What are the best credits cards for overseas spend that have Mastercard and not visa?If Iâ€™m planning to spend more than 1k sgd? Hitting Citi rewards cap,btohqsg
Anyone using hsbc premier mastercard for their 5% cashback and lifetime AF-free?They are changing cashback to miles (at a lousy rate of 1 & 1.2 mpd) and they will be charging $490 AF. ðŸ˜… Time to cancel the card next year...,btohqsg
Spend on or do you mean what currency?,btohqsg
UOB visa signature if you can hit 1k,btohqsg
Is amaze still good with Visa cards?,btohqsg
It's never good with visa but your spending covers too many aspects,btohqsg
Oh  what would you recommend is optimal for overseas spending?,btohqsg
I saw no sign up rewards now. Sigh. Hahaha,btohqsg
Usually some cards will have like sign up bonus,btohqsg
Uob miles ain't known for good signup bonus,btohqsg
May I ask why was this card good? I looked at it before and it was 5% on certain categories that other cashback cards do better.,btohqsg
5% + 1% from EGA + 0.4 mpd (1 pts per $1). High cashback cap ($150 per month) + no rounding in redemption unlike Citi Cashback.,btohqsg
The uob nerfing of amaze has big impact .. 3.25% fcy will be universally charge If we would  still use the 4mpd card overseas like dbs wwmc   uob solitaire lady. For crmc+amaze  couldn't be use for travel spent effectively. we are technically back to the days before amaze. We are left with 1.2-1.3 miles pairing with amaze which lead to higher cpm. wow suddenly trust cashback card makes sense for overseas hotel booking.,btohqsg
I applied for it mainly bcos it was free  and it gives trival perks like a 3gb 10-days international roaming data Sim card for free. Lol. 5% dining cash back I find that it is not too shabby  plus I can get max discount with shell petrol.,btohqsg
I would just use the 4mpd cards directly  4mpd at 3.25fcy vs 1.2mpd at 2fcy,btohqsg
Hi@Matthew What is this platform?What is the benefit to pay through this?,btohqsg
Or maybe explore citi prestige for hotels.,btohqsg
My colleague was sharing this card but he is not aware of the benefits over crmc+amaze etc,btohqsg
