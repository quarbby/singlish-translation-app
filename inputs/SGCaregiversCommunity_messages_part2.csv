i think understanding your care recipient condition and seeing through your care recipient perspective - is still something that many of us are learning  having dealt with special needs i think at times its difficult to understand what the recipient is facing especially when they go into spasms / and passive aggressiveness - i think as a caregiver you need to learn to be calm when handling such recipients  because is not that they want to behave this way but rather their disorder causes them to behave this way  are there tips to better handle passive aggressiveness care recipients?,btohqsg
I use to think my care recipient's depression is very frustrating  why can't she snap out of it or be stronger to deal with it  but as time goes by i realized that unfortunately  our care recipients' situation are not within their control... we're the only ones with the choice to control our behavior and deal with the problem.im sure many of you have the same thoughts at some point of your caregiving journey as i do  is the realization that the only way to deal with it is to fully understand what our care recipient is facing  and that it is only us ourselves have to find ways to deal with the anger and devise with better options or minimize the damage as much as possible.1) Understand their situation  from doctor or phychiatrist2) understand what triggers you and find ways to manage it  or take a moment to yourself before reacting3) understand that showing support to them  helping them to understand you  is better than negative responsesthat's my 2 cent worth of thoughts !,btohqsg

As the Wuhan coronavirus situation evolves  we are stepping up precautionary measures in our social and community services.We are reaching out to our frontline social services - for example  Early Intervention Centres (EIPIC)  Disability Day Activity Centres  Family Service Centres  Student Care Centres  Social Service Offices  social residential facilities such as children's home and senior group homes  and morehttps://go.gov.sg/msf-directories- who have sustained interaction with vulnerable groups (such as children and seniors) to implement the following measures.Staff who have returned or are returning to Singapore after visiting Mainland China should:(1) inform their institutions of their travel history and;(2) take a Leave of Absence (LOA) for 14 days upon their return.This applies to all affected staff returning to Singapore:(a) on and from tomorrow  28 Jan 2020  as well as(b) between 14 ‚Äì 27 Jan 2020.Counting from the date of return to Singapore  they should return to work only on the 15th day.This is a precautionary measure to protect those whom we collectively serve  as well as our social service and community workers.To illustrate:i. If a social service worker returns to Singapore from Mainland China tomorrow 28 Jan 2020 (Day 0)  they may return to work on 12 Feb 2020 (Day 15)  provided they are well.ii. If they had returned to Singapore from Mainland China on 14 Jan 2020 (Day 0)  they may return to work on 29 Jan 2020 (Day 15).iii. If they will be returning to Singapore from Mainland China on 3 Feb 2020 (Day 0)  they may return to work on 18 Feb 2020 (Day 15).Employers should grant the LOA as paid leave over and above the affected staff's annual leave entitlement  and monitor their health.Students in Student Care Centres  children in EIPIC centres/PPIPs and service users enrolled with social/community-based facilities (e.g. Day Activity Centres) with a travel history to Mainland China in the last 14 days are also advised to stay away from the centres and from crowded places  and to monitor their health closely.We seek your understanding and support for these measures. Let's keep our community  our families and our children safe and healthy together.For information on ECDA‚Äôs Preschool advisory visithttps://go.gov.sg/ecda-advisoryYou can get the latest on the Wuhan coronavirus and other important Government information by signing up for thegov.sgWhatsApp channel (https://go.gov.sg/whatsapp) or at the MOH website (www.moh.gov.sg).,btohqsg

Interim List of Household Products and Active Ingredients for Disinfection of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),btohqsg
The Ministry of Health (MOH) had stepped up our risk assessment from DORSCON Yellow to DORSCON Orange on 7 February.Whatever the situation  we can each do our part. One  observe personal hygiene ‚Äì wash your hands often  and avoid touching your eyes or face unnecessarily. Two  take your temperature twice daily. And three  if you are not well  please avoid crowded places and see a doctor immediately. These simple steps do not take much effort  but if we all do them  they will go a long way towards containing the spread of the virus.,btohqsg
For events participants  MOH recommends the following precautions:‚Äî Individuals who are unwell should not attend. They should avoid public spaces and contact with others  and instead seek medical attention. Any staff or participant who becomes unwell during the event should leave immediately to seek appropriate medical attention.‚Äî Individuals placed on LOA should not attend events. They are strongly advised to remain at home and minimise their time spent in public spaces.‚Äî Individuals with recent travel history to mainland China  in particular Hubei province  within the last 14 days should not attend.‚Äî Individuals who are well do not need to wear masks.‚Äî Individuals should remain vigilant and practise good personal hygiene  such as washing their hands regularly and avoiding touching their face.‚Äî Avoid shaking hands with other event participants  and consider adopting alternative greetings.,btohqsg
For this period of time (until the DORSCON status is changed for the better)  please do check with the events website or organisers to ensure that the events are still ongoing if you are still keen to attend.
