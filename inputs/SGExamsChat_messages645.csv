I am near fch but i don‚Äôt think i can pull it up to fch,btohqsg
Im taking a lot of mods in hopes of scoring all As for them to get fch,btohqsg
jiayous but no fch isn‚Äôt end of the world,btohqsg
I feel like it is somewhat,btohqsg
I feel so depressed over it that i was thinking if i can‚Äôt achieve it i want to die,btohqsg

I wanted to cry over it,btohqsg
felt that so imma give a virtual hug,btohqsg

But if i drop i won‚Äôt have a chance of working towards fch,btohqsg
if i may ask  whats your goal for getting FCH?any particular career u aiming for?,btohqsg
more specifically i‚Äôm just wondering what makes you hold fch in such high regard,btohqsg
as a recent uni grad  FCH isnt that important for ur careeras employers look at experience and aptitude,btohqsg
source:- my 3rd class friend is now in GIC earning 15K- his FCH friend is a consultant for him in GIC earning 7K,btohqsg
honestly I scored fch but it's more for showing off,btohqsg
network from uni is quite importantmost of the career opportunities u get in adulthood will be from referrals from ppl who know u be it in uni or whereverif u intimidate ppl from being friends with u  career opportunities will be limited in ur 30's,btohqsg
i like to under sell myself to my peers  so whenever we have gatherings my HR friends will offer me job openings in their companiesppl like to help others who are humble and helpfuljust my 2 cents as an 4y post uni grad,btohqsg
My PSC scholar (its 1 tier before presidential scholar) friend likes to brag about his knowledge whenever we have gatheringsyet he wonder how come my 3rd class friend is in GIC making 2X more than himCommon sense isnt very common these days tbh üòÖagain  my 2 cents again as a 3-4y post uni grad,btohqsg
for personal achievement  its good to have aspirations of your ownat the same time  dont over push yourself. As you are already doing quite well already üëçI would say you are better than 80% of uni students at your ageUltimately just focus on yourself and enjoy the process. Everything in life will sort itself out eventually,btohqsg
