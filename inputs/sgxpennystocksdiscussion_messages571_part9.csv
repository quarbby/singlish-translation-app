This counter actually ran alot alreadyLast year I higher $0.0985 only .,btohqsg
Nav 79.5 and market price 65 not favouring the company .. once any new good news comes or company start dividend it may go range of 120-140 range,btohqsg
Wahüò±but now seem like undervalue with so low PE,btohqsg
Last year when I studied LHN and make the early call when it was only $0.106. It ran big indeed. But I always prefer to buy cheap cheap.Even my Hanwell was bought below $0.20,btohqsg
Yea indeed. It baffles me why the PA is like that for Moya.Quite tiring as an Investor if we keep watching the counter.Will be frustrated with Moya.Good FA but no one want to run it . Weird eh,btohqsg
Yes sanli and memotec already run up once Liao. This moya with solid fa don't run.One thing I can think of is the script.  Bb Haven cornered it.,btohqsg
All the best to us bro.64 better hold too.If break I might cut or reduce first .Use it for those in play,btohqsg
Small float like memotec. After minus the ssh. It can fly up with thin volume.  Cornering,btohqsg
Yea bro. This one really extreme . Ti ti ki,btohqsg
U have one such kind actually in your portfolio.,btohqsg
I buy and  hold my SL will be 44,btohqsg
Which bro. How u know my portfolio hahaha,btohqsg
I anyhow. üòÇ it's Saturday. Haha,btohqsg
You have good holding power . Not everyone have that . I think most players contra usually.Positioning plays can reward handsomely,btohqsg
DBS first one to issue buy,btohqsg
All analysts just follow trend  no matter how much correction.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs true holding a bit risk but rewards also good rather than make few hundred $$ in contra,btohqsg
Mostly I hold unless a good jump in a week .,btohqsg
üëç.. base on current price  this yr div. paid MYR0.30 (+12.34 yield) and not forgetting end last yr 2020 Ratio 1:1,btohqsg
