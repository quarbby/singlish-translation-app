True. Math is the easiest to drill among all subjects  and since the answers arenâ€™t as subjective as other subjects  it could be why math always has the highest distinction rate,btohqsg
Like i practiced chem and phy to a point that im seeing repeated qns in exam,btohqsg
the safety officer STILL hasn't contacted me yet,btohqsg
HE SUPPOSED TO CONTACT THE DAY BEF,btohqsg
you also did it for the entire year. I have seen students who didn't study for the entire 2 years,btohqsg
what was your ppd project on,btohqsg
I also barely any skills so just need a bit  like as long as your a math B3 and above Iâ€™m quite sure for a level math can guarantee the A as long as the person drills copious amounts of math qns,btohqsg
assignment 1 was on covid 19 misinformation,btohqsg
I tot H2 math is much more difficult than O levels,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t do a lot of math qns before prelims lol. I did extra during tuition but I wasnâ€™t like grinding math the whole time. I barely touched my sch tutorials too,btohqsg
So now ur cher helping u find another grp?,btohqsg
did they just steal part of your work and claim it as theirs then,btohqsg
Yeah but I think if a math can get a good pass right means the person has a sufficiently small aptitude such that he/she can make up for it with attitude,btohqsg
But if like no proper basic foundation in the first place no matter how much one practices it would be hard to get A,btohqsg
Like students who didnâ€™t take a math in sec sch but took h2 math in jc,btohqsg
I WAS ABT TO SEND A PATIENT TO FKING NTFGH,btohqsg
istg my whole class is gna know bout this,btohqsg
So they dun do well inside me is a serve u right omo,btohqsg
yall work on your own documents or one document?,btohqsg
U urself dun care  no one can help u bruh,btohqsg
There's still enough done definitely. No one can do 1 or 2 questions per chapter and score A.,btohqsg
like my work all still there lah,btohqsg
cuz if one document got history saved one wat,btohqsg
but they claiming i nvr do,btohqsg
Yeah true. Thankfully my other subjects werenâ€™t too bad so I could spend more time on math,btohqsg
I was actually cramping chem and phy the whole yr,btohqsg
Coz i wanted to stay top in phy  i cannot lose lmao,btohqsg
But arts subj is hard to drill coz it is damn time consuming and tiring,btohqsg
if u don't mind you can go around asking the ppl around you for advice as an indirect way of seeking help but that'll just blow up matters and dk if you are comfy with that,btohqsg
okay so apparently is cuz they go take another 2 ppl then nvr tell me so they kick me out,btohqsg
LMFAOO was this even confirmed by your ppd cher,btohqsg
he say he can oni chang my grp after march holiday,btohqsg
did i agree to them kicking me out? obvs not,btohqsg
And they didnt hv any grp before that?,btohqsg
they were frm a diff grp,btohqsg
hence y my cher say now vv messy,btohqsg
so basically now is i technically still in my old grp but i work with my new one,btohqsg
"So here's what happened:few weeks ago my sgt assigned another medic for this cover  ex bullmastiff  which was from 27th-28th feb. it was all fine until another fking 9 SIR medic injured himself and got like 3 months of excuse RMJ  this is the first time maju fked us up abt this  and because of this now the other medic had to mount at Sembawang wharves to help 9 SIR (supposed to be 9 SIR doing this as they are on ops now not us  but as of now they have only 2 FUNCTIONAL MEDICS  supposed to be 5  and we already have 5 functional ones (2 ORDing soon)So this made me the cover medic for this particular cover  and this happened even before the start of feb  and my sgt alr updated the contact for covering medic for the exercise.Fast forward to todaySafety officer still hasn't contacted me (even as of writing this message) and i was passive duty in the medical centre  at ard 945 ish i was informed that there was a sendout ro NTFGH for a case of abdominal pain  possibly another one for abnormal ECG reading. Just as i was ready to send out the patient to NTFGH  i saw an unknown contact calling me  i picked it up and he was the TO ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€. Basically what he said was ""Hi are you the covering medic for the exercise today? Im currently outside the medical centre ready to pick you up.FYI  i was on passive duty and ready to send out to NTFGH  that was the only thing that was in my mind  NOT TO BE READY FOR THE COVER TODAY.......i then informed my sgt that i had to go for cover right now and luckily there was another medicap centre medic willing to send out the 2 patients to NTFGH  while i was rushing to check medical stores and get ready emcool pads (for a 2 day cover too ðŸ’€)once i was done (at ard 10am ish) we went off to maju. it's almost 12pm and there is still 0 contact from the safety officer  and I have 0 idea of what the conduct is abt",btohqsg
yea uni forced me to reshape how i went about learning physics and math. couldnâ€™t just blindly go about it anymore,btohqsg
Anyone in Olvl sgexams grp chat,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
after5pm conduct for today end  then i gg back clementi for rest/resup,btohqsg
Eh Mr Tan! I can't tell if that's sarcasm in the later half ðŸ—¿ðŸ—¿ wdym by were not actually correct,btohqsg
a lot of things i understood halfway and only the answering technique to it,btohqsg
The ancient of them all sia,btohqsg
