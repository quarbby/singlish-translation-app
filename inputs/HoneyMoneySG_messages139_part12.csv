My wedding is in Oct‚Äô25 and plan to fly around Jan/Feb‚Äô26,btohqsg
Sign up bonus > split cardsThen can do something like dbs vantage & UOB prvi miles for signup bonusThe rest follows Chris video with full UOB card set. Gotta check if ur wedding venue allows that.,btohqsg
Thanks so much  this will be very helpful.,btohqsg
Seen it.. that's why I'm asking since bigpay is not included..,btohqsg
Had a glance. Bigpay didnt seem to offer anything better than youtrip or other options in terms of overseas spending.,btohqsg
Do I still get 6% cashback using DBS LIVE FRESH on Agoda?,btohqsg
I mean  I don‚Äôt mind to cover that 5% for the restaurant ownerJust that I‚Äôm not sure how should I approach him with all this numbers and counteroffer him about the plan  pay everything with credit cards,btohqsg
Just ask the question to the restaurant owner?,btohqsg
We are going to do that just need to reload some bullets in my pocket first üôà,btohqsg
And congratulations to your wedding. All the best.,btohqsg
Dunoe why the restaurant do it this way. Usually they will offer 5% discount when you pay via cash/paynow instead.,btohqsg
Hi can I check how much interest I will earn from my UOB one account if I fulfill the salary credit and 500 spend on credit card with a savings of 30 k ?,btohqsg
Would like to ask if anyone has bought stuff from ntuc online  whether the goods here is authentic or second hand?Also does revolution card works for FairPrice online?,btohqsg
Check who is fulfilling the order. And ntuc so mcc could be 5411 and hsbc Revo won't earn bonus pts.,btohqsg
What if I were to use OCBC 365  fufilling the salary credit + MAB+ minimum spend with 30 k savings ?,btohqsg
There is very useful ocbc 360 interest calculator here.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account,btohqsg
why not just ask for a direct discount and not complicate the conversation further with mention of credit card usage. if he can give u a direct discount then it should offset the perks u can supposedly get with using credit cards. i am not sure if the credit card perks can make up for the 5% additional mark-upunless owner already gave discount ... and using credit card will shave off his margins further  while it might not make sense for you to pay the 5% additional mark up,btohqsg
UOB one savings account vs UOB lady‚Äôs savings account - which is better?,btohqsg
any reasons? haha the interest rate better? or the lady‚Äôs card not good?,btohqsg
You are trading some additional miles for loss interests.,btohqsg
The question is what you are looking for? Miles or cash,btohqsg
Open ended questions will give you open ended answers,btohqsg
wanna see which one is more worth! currently i have a One SA paired w One cash back CC. thinking about switching over to pair One SA w lady‚Äôs card for miles,btohqsg
You can use UOB one SA and UOB lady card. That's what I'm doing.,btohqsg
uob lady account only need 10k to get extra 2mpd  not really for interest,btohqsg
Depends on your valuation of mile and amount you have in uob one  as well as anticipated spending on uob ladies,btohqsg
If valuation of mile * spending on UOB ladies * 6mpd > current tier of uob one interest depending on amount in uob one  then you should put $10k in uob ladies acc and rest in uob one. Else just retain all in uob one,btohqsg
I'm short of $100 credit card spending for my uob one card... Charged that amount on 3rd  till today still pending. üòÖI have a bad feeling tomorrow it will show the posted date as 6th  which my billing cycle starts.Anyone has successful dp for  calling in to ask for waiver for the shortfall in spending?,btohqsg
think can appeal once per year,btohqsg
Scared cannot waiver then spend $100 at same-day merchants. Mr Coconut  Shell  Guardian  Giant  etc.... can search the chat for more dp.,btohqsg
Search chat history ‚ÄùPost same day‚Äù,btohqsg
Looks like it's not always the case all transactions will be posted on the same day...,btohqsg
I always use contactless with my card. Think my case is probably screwed. No way I will spend $100 on me coconut. üòÇ,btohqsg
Can split to different merchants ma,btohqsg
My bad for not keeping a close eye on my spending... Usually will exceed $500 one. Haha,btohqsg
What if I have reached the S$100 000 cap in my OCBC 365 account? In order to continue receiving interest from salary crediting and saving S$500 monthly  do I still need to maintain a S$500 average daily balance increment each month?,btohqsg
You still need to increase above 100k.Usually people will do reset month or ding dong between ocbc 360 and hsbc egahttps://youtu.be/lGvgw03KNxw,btohqsg
btw when the cashback for HSBC EGA creditedI got giro on 20 Oct and this is my 1st time so just wonder if I miss any step beside the sms only,btohqsg
They are rectifying it. But slowly.,btohqsg
Just patiently wait. Don't call cso.,btohqsg
This 1% Cashback via egiro need to do SMS ? Isn't it 2k in   then out 5x only ?,btohqsg
Didn't use referral link but funded my IBKR account already. Possible to get the referral or make new account?,btohqsg
for my case  I am new to HSBC,btohqsg
what does new to hsbc has to do with the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
this is bonus interest promotion. The 1% cashback is under the everyday+ rewards which require 5 transactions and transfer min 2k/5k funds in.,btohqsg
For withdrawing ringgit via atm  isit better to top up to amaze first then used amaze to withdraw from atm or used trust card to withdraw from atmMy experience with trust or youtrip withdrawal is that it will deduct 0.02 from the sgd to ringgit exchange rate.Not so sure about amaze.,btohqsg
never heard of 0.02 fee from youtrip/trust. do you have a source?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs calculated directly from my app transaction statusWhen the exchange rate online shows 3.3  I was charge 3.28This applies to youtrip too tho,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfee‚Äù from trust per se but rather visa or master card rate are lower then what is seen on Google or money exchangeHence getting lower 0.02.But can someone who has tried withdrawing from amaze card  confirm if it‚Äôs better?,btohqsg
