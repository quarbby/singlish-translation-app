I’m also surprised they didn’t let u learn from the erhu,btohqsg
They should hv just upgraded someone from the erhu that hv experience lmao,btohqsg
But how is it like under the nose of the conductor,btohqsg
I was picked on in secondary school lol,btohqsg
Then my senior said it is coz dsa = higher expectations,btohqsg
wait that reminds me of this one person i had in primary school,btohqsg
we had such a shortage of gao hu and zhong hu,btohqsg
she was made to play all 3,btohqsg
In secondary school percussion and French horn and trumpet always get called out,btohqsg
gao hu zhong hu and er hu all in the same piece,btohqsg
Bruh my conductor ask me take flute score play on Glock for majulah,btohqsg
And then I need to memo it for the national day parade,btohqsg
Most pieces have all I think,btohqsg
Then she scolded the flute sl coz there were no extra scores for me atm,btohqsg
yeah but poor girl was made to play all 3 styles,btohqsg
while i was there just holding my sticks waiting for my turn to hit some strings lmao,btohqsg
My conductor is a erhu player,btohqsg
I really actually hope co dun die here,btohqsg
my primary school conductor worked with him before,btohqsg
I think smu is the sco conductor,btohqsg
Ntu is the same conductor as Tjc,btohqsg
Wait Moses conduct sec sch ah,btohqsg
Tj is the grey hair guy idk his name,btohqsg
He was a bit too scary for someone to deal with in primsru school,btohqsg
Got one time we made him so mad he just walked out of practice,btohqsg
once my conductor broke my violin cuz i was so bad at it,btohqsg
after being in music and drama,btohqsg
dad jokes are a sign of aging iestin,btohqsg

how did you take 2 h1 subjs,btohqsg
I remembered my pri sch conductor make ppl stand on chair for various reason,btohqsg
sounds like your conductor was an insulator,btohqsg
the majority just looks like physics at this rate,btohqsg
makes me think that chem is closer to physics than bio,btohqsg
it is. Maths gave rise to Physics  which gave rise to Chem  which gave rise to Bio,btohqsg
You referring to the bad conductor part?,btohqsg
thank god i took h2 phys and not h2 bio then  since i took triple pure science in upper sec,btohqsg
sounds like physics is more useful,btohqsg
i actually love biology more (interest wise) but my bio knowledge is only limited to sec 4 pure science lol,btohqsg
ngl when ppl ask me for my hobbies right,btohqsg
idk if its weird to tell them i like reading about animals,btohqsg
No wonder my bio cmi cause of chem,btohqsg
If I took BCME it's gonna be suicide,btohqsg
yesbcme probably only useful if u very sure and confident to study bio related stuff in uni,btohqsg
s4 physics knowledge sufficient for me to fix up lights and change non led to led lights at home,btohqsg
Man idk is it just me but somehow bio doesn't click w me,btohqsg
Like imo of all the 3 sci like at sec level  bio was the one that has the most terminology,btohqsg
its okay im sure you can do it!! :),btohqsg
yep iʼm aware of that! i could do that after a levels,btohqsg
Nah Im in pcme for a reason😎😎😎,btohqsg
Maybe after grad then take as priv cand😈,btohqsg
oh but idk if they'd allow cause idk if I need to have taken a bio practical in a institution prior,btohqsg
likei only did bio in upper sec cause i was sure i didnt want any physics related courses,btohqsg
Hearsay JC bio no diff from uni kinda bio?,btohqsg
and at that time i has interest in like math  polsci  zoology which were q varied. but i didnt want engi courses or cs at all. so i knew i didnt need physics,btohqsg
i mean i only really decided i wanted to do bio related stuff in the future around y4 promos period,btohqsg
before that i actl  consider not taking bio cause i felt like i wasnt good enough at it,btohqsg
but then like i kind of feel that with my love for bio   if i dont take i will definitely regret it,btohqsg
interest definitely plays a role! c:,btohqsg
before that i actl not really sure also but i js knew i wanted to be teacher,btohqsg
so like when i tell ppl i want teacher then they ask what subj uw i always say i havent decided yet,btohqsg
but yea i rmb when i was really young zookeeper was also one of my job interests,btohqsg
my interests were crazy lol they ranged from lawyer to conservationist to teacher to research,btohqsg
she can teach jc bio 😎😎😎,btohqsg
"but i realised that i feel that i want to help people who are ""weaker"" or in a compromised position than me through my job because i felt like its very sad if no one helps you when you need it because it happened to me before (you against the world) so i wanted to help ppl/animal who need it( in case of lawyer it would be the charged then for teacher itd be kids and the animal ones animal)tbh the one i was the most interested in is the teacher one cause like i feel like education is rly important and a good teacher can really have big impacts on a child life based on my own personal experiences. and i think that educating the next generation is something that is very fulfilling and important  so yea now i think i decided i wanna be teacher",btohqsg
probably a teacher who helps students to become their best self,btohqsg
why not social worker or child protection officer?,btohqsg
It's a signal of too much disposable income,btohqsg
Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on ourdual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Theeconomy has made considerable progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation haseased substantially while the labor market has remained strong  and that is very good news. Butinflation is still too high  ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured  and the pathforward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.Today  the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue toreduce our securities holdings. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been puttingdownward pressure on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased andprogress on inflation has continued  the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goalsare moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after brieflyreviewing economic developments.Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent. For 2023 as a whole  GDPexpanded 3.1 percent  bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supplyconditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year  largely reflecting highmortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment. Inour Summary of Economic Projections  Committee participants generally expect GDP growth toslow from last year’s pace  with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent overthe next two years. Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December reflecting the strength of incoming data  including data on labor supply.,btohqsg
good qni feel like im personally a more academic person  so i would prefer to do stuff that is more academic related in nature . thats why most of my job interests have been related to academics somewhat. so i feel like i could thrive better as a teacher and i also enjoy sharing knowledge or talking about stuff i like to other people. i feel happy when i see people learning new stuff :Dnow  why not social worker? while i think that social worker and child protection officers are very noble professions  i personally dont think i would be very suitable for these positions as my area of interest lies more in education  although i do want to help the students.and since students spend a large chunk of time in school  i feel like as a teacher  i would also be able to support them if they have any difficulties at home. furthermore  children could have healthy families  but be going through some problems of their own such as mental health  academic  rs problems which are big events in the child life but wouldnt warrant any professional interventions. I feel like as a teacher  i would be able to help my students in such situations by giving advice when necessary,btohqsg
personally   i want to become a teacher like my current bio teacher and my y3 chem teacher. they are both very nice and friendly and have motherly vibes LOL   the way they explain stuff is very clear and concise  and they are also very caring ppl who will check in on you. like for example  in y3 i had some personal issues and my chem teacher noticed that i was feeling down so she actually talked to me about it on the last day of school even though she wasnt obligated to do so as she wasnt my FT. Although it was just a small gesture that she didnt have to do at all  i felt very appreciative and grateful to her. Therefore  the 2 of them are like my role models,btohqsg
I think that's a good reason  although just bear in mind that whereas social workers and CPOs get to work on some cases  as a public school teacher you'll probably have like 1-200 students to look after  so it can be hard to focus on just a few.Lemme know if you need any advice or want to hear more about this path!,btohqsg
thank you for your insight ! yea i do agree that the large class size would pose some challenges but i think thats also a part of the job  .to care for all the kids so that no one is left out. ofc we are only human and have limitations but i think that i would like to try my best,btohqsg
You are very suited to be a teacher and you have very clear reasons why you want to be one.Good luck to your path!,btohqsg
it has been useful for me,btohqsg
good skillset applicable for many quantitative uni courses imo,btohqsg
Look up in the sky its a bird it's a plane,btohqsg
Do consider going for Teaching Internship Programme (TIP) after your A level then~ all the best~,btohqsg
Agree. Something to consider.Many people have a false sense of impression of how teaching at MOE schools is like. Experiencing first hand is best.,btohqsg
I won’t say false sense. Maybe more of a skewed sense  depending on which schools one has attended,btohqsg
I watched that video so many times when idw do work 🤣,btohqsg
Why the cu config like that why not 4s^2 then 3d^9 I thought fill 4s orbital first?,btohqsg
or like anyone here can help,btohqsg
just these two for a levels right,btohqsg
There's like a riddle for the special elements,btohqsg
i once pondered on teaching as well and actually have some sort of passion for it and also coz i love kiddos but i felt i am not capable of teaching…i just cmi at teaching:-(Glad u are already knowing ur directions at y5. It would be good if u can get the MOE teaching internship to sort of see whether it is sth u wanna do (coz sometimes it passion and skills are unfortunately not linked😢),btohqsg
I feel like this is really true  being a teacher needs to have a lot of patience especially also extending help to the weaker ones / motivating std to study  not giving up on anyone / leave anyone behind (this is sth very evident that a cher can actually make a difference),btohqsg
and so apparently teaching is not about “inspiring the next generation” and wtv bullshit,btohqsg
its all bullshit that isnt applicable anymore,btohqsg
cuz systematic fuckery and red tapes and retarded parents,btohqsg
they q disillusioned alr but they retiring soon so alls g,btohqsg
What i meant is not about ‘inspiring’ but basically i see how a good teacher can make a difference esp helping weaker students / demotivated ones,btohqsg
heard thst from some ex teachers too,btohqsg
i teach part time too and i can say,btohqsg
lol fuck that uw to learn i help u,btohqsg
dw to learn ok i take ur money,btohqsg
my math tutor in jc was amazing too (i still got a C but thats skill issue),btohqsg
this is me for econs…a change in teacher changed my grades fr D to A in one exam,btohqsg
Never blame yourself (again im a bad person to say this coz others have more confidence in me than i hv in myself lol),btohqsg
but nah i was getting As consistently dk wtf happened on As,btohqsg
Things can happen and we wun know what happened. and u see  this means that it aint a skills issues,btohqsg
lol yst i taught some kid on zoom,btohqsg
the mom cut the call and ran payment,btohqsg
Honestly my econs cher did magic to my class,btohqsg
best thing is the kid was a girl,btohqsg
dont they kill baby girls in china,btohqsg
so the agent had to pay me my half from his own pocket,btohqsg
Uk when the policy was still implemented   I rmb reading up that there wss one particular family who  secretly had more than 1 child but wasn't caught,btohqsg
I honestly feel damn sad when i keep seeing china videos about parents over-pressurizing the kids,btohqsg
bruh this family the kid is 7 years old but the mom put 4-5 back to back classes,btohqsg
Idk how to react  if im in their shoes i will be breaking down constantly,btohqsg
Never had the experience before tbf,btohqsg
Between just promos and mbts  suddenly my class top 3 in cohort…and then suddenly my grade flew from D to A (81 percentile to 5th in cohort),btohqsg
It is the only subject that actually saw this magic💀💀,btohqsg
And it was sustained for the rest of the year,btohqsg
No like 81 percentile to 5th in cohort,btohqsg
Bro does NOT know his own sch,btohqsg
Wah shag u teach in which school,btohqsg
