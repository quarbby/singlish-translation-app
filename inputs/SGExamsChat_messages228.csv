Sorry to hear that you are going through this.DISCLAIMER: This is merely my opinion & suggestions of what I will do if am in your shoes... please don't sue me if it doesn't work out well for you.I presume you commenced work without signing the contract? If that is the case  do you have any other proof of employment?Please don't report to MOM first. MOM should be the last resort.Recruit first is a subsidiary of sgx listed hrnetgroup  quite a big/reputable company  very very unlikely they will play punk on you. Also  hrnetgroup is likely holding onto numerous EA licenses thru its many different subsidiaries  so unlikely that they will be afraid of disruptions in their daily operations if reported to MOM.I suggest you do the following:1. Gather all proof of employment2. Enable phone call recording3. On Tuesday  call/msg the person who you first reported to on that day of work & enquiry status and tell them you have yet to receive salary. If have their email  send email too.4. On Tuesday  send a formal email to the recruit first recruiter to enquire the status & provide your bank account details in the email. Enable send receipt & read receipt for the email. After sending the email  screenshot the email & WA it to the recruiter.Please be formal in all correspondence & do not be rude.Sorry for the less than perfect English  typed everything on my small small phone screen.. Hard to proofreadDISCLAIMER AGAIN: This is merely my opinion & suggestions of what I will do if am in your shoes... please don't sue me if it doesn't work out well for you.,btohqsg
okay thank you for the suggestion :),btohqsg
In the first place whr do you even find that agency,btohqsg
Sg fast job telegram full of people ghosting you,btohqsg
First impression the agency is very sketchy,btohqsg
isn't recruit first pretty well known,btohqsg
Sometimes they might not assess you that well,btohqsg
When i got my previous job,btohqsg
My 'interview' was in a van,btohqsg
A group of people was waiting under boon lay mrt station at a taxi stand,btohqsg

The van floor full of paper,btohqsg
ok ah then that's different story,btohqsg
They filter and then send to the client,btohqsg
Some clients office quite messed up one,btohqsg
no I meant literally what name of the agency,btohqsg
For me you fill up the application they throw you to random workplace,btohqsg
I mean  u get what u want. They get what they want,btohqsg
So end of the day  they‚Äôre all cool,btohqsg
One of my agent when recruiting us,btohqsg

* If a student reads four H2 subjects  the lowest performing H2 subject will be computed as a H1 subject.If a student reads KI as one of the four H2 subjects  he/she will be exempted from reading GP and KI will be recomputed as one H1 subject and GP for UAS.,btohqsg
instead of 4 content subjs i take 3?,btohqsg
oh sorry referring to the ki part,btohqsg
All students take 6 including gp  pw,btohqsg
I believe it splits into a h1 and gp as mentioned lorIn other words h2 KI score is computed as 2 H1 subjects,btohqsg
i take one less content subj?,btohqsg
You take 4 content subjects  including KI,btohqsg
then is ki counted as an art thingy or smt?,btohqsg
KI is a contrasting subject for both arts and science streams,btohqsg
I finally figured it out by looking at temasek jc website gosh,btohqsg
if i can pass the test,btohqsg
i like the idea of KI,btohqsg
Imagine writing on an essay bootlicking about mathematics,btohqsg
So I think it'll go well...,btohqsg
so my subj will prob be smt like ki  phys  math  comp,btohqsg
if i fail the ki shit then gg history,btohqsg

a level year? unless u want repeat make mi a 5 year journey la lmaooo. retain pu1 not enough alr?,btohqsg
Anyone have experience of having ur big toe being numb on one side?,btohqsg
Y1 retain once  Y2 retain once  Y3 retain once,btohqsg
just wiggle your toe gently or move around a bit,btohqsg
then u shld just drop out,btohqsg
i mean if you retain thrice it could be that maybe the syllabus isn't meant for you,btohqsg
Ohh... is it a sign of diabetes? I‚Äôm 17,btohqsg
wait do you experience it often or what,btohqsg
if often you might want to get that checked out,btohqsg
It‚Äôs on my right big toe,btohqsg
to be fair... ppl 5 year journey and end up scoring damn well,btohqsg
y'a la but it takes up so much time...,btohqsg
and idt the school allows you to retain pu3 lol,btohqsg
and what makes u think they not chasing,btohqsg
because they want to get pampered,btohqsg
and why do u think I don't get it,btohqsg
maybe you ate something which caused your toe to numb itself   for me i have high cholesterol so whenever i eat too much or don't move around a lot my toe numbs itself,btohqsg
