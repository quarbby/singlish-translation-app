Oh  also  SUTD's open house is from Feb 24-25  I am graduating from the first batch of their Design and AI major; so if SUTD is a school you are interested in  feel free to PM me!,btohqsg
how it feels like being a guinea pig batch,btohqsg
You get a ton of resources; like there are servers set up for you to use for your projects(to train ML models etc)  and nice  new workspaces.Also your opinions are always wanted since they want to finetune for future batches.The bad stuff would be  it's a little more messy  curriculum isn't always the most streamlined  you might realise certain modules are not what you thought you signed up for.,btohqsg
For what its worth  I was in NTU for a bit before dropping out  and one thing I liked about SUTD is the gender ratio.NTU gender ratio for STEM majors was like 1:7 or 1:10,btohqsg

Day in day out just report to medical center  do normal medic stuff  occasionally do IPPT duty and that's kind of it,btohqsg
