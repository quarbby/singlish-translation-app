A total of 21 vendors had placed bids for the tender.*LIST OF MOH-APPROVED COVID-19 TEST PROVIDERS*https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providersHealthway Medical features prominently in the 3 lists mentioned in the above linkas well for:- Approved Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) test providers- Approved Antigen Rapid Test(ART) providers- Clinics approved to conductPCR Pre-Departure Tests*Extracts from Raffles Medical's recent media release *Raffles Medical reported a brilliant set of results for 1H 2021 recently on 26 July  with operating profit profit after tax patmi all more than doubling.""The year started on a cautiously optimistic note despite an evolving global pandemic situation.TheGroup actively supported the government in its COVID-19 vaccination and Polymerase ChainReaction (PCR) swab tests initiatives.Against this backdrop revenue from the healthcare andhospital services divisions grew by 65.4% and 35.4% respectively.The Group‚Äôs earnings beforeinterest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 78.0% from S$41.9 million in1H 2020 to S$74.5 million in 1H 2021.

Saw buyers stacking lots at 33 to buy late afternoon today and didnt hesitate to mouth 34 sellers right away  looks like BBs are in this stock trying to activate it as this is not characteristic of typical retailer pattern.Hopefully the results come in well & BBs play up this stock which looks like it's heading for a big move ahead üôè",btohqsg
