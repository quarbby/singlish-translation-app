Btw is it possible that 2 of us can apply as co-applicants first. To get a higher hdb loan approval via HLE.Then later upon key collection 5 years time  can we change to occupier if we want to?And vice versa  can change from occupier to co-applicant upon key collection?,btohqsg
Cos the issue we face was  if we just do occupier   the loan is lower at 200K  and we're afriad hdb will reject our application for mature bto even if we are able to fork out the cash,btohqsg
They won't reject your application at this stage. At most during your key collection if you cannot produce the amount  they will repossess back I think... But can appeal also,btohqsg
This is the form you will need to sign when booking of flat,btohqsg
Hi  do u mind sharing why do will u receive less grant when applying as occupier as opposed to applicants,btohqsg
I am in a similar situation. But I thought the lower the income the more ehg grant we will receive? I am also unaware that applying as occupier + applicant will effect grant eligibility. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
PS typo  lower loan .. not lower grant. Yes you're right lower combined income = more grant.Cos the loan  looks at the applicant income n max they give 30% of your salary.So just 1 person income = lower loan given,btohqsg
Tyvm. Cos my friend who already booked the flat a few years ago (haven't collected keys)   said it was possible.  So we had wrong info,btohqsg
üôèOccupier .. shouldn't affect grant eligibility .Only affect the loan amount,btohqsg
any queries can call in hdb to double check. My bf did that. But he had to wait for 10 ppl in front of him to finish,btohqsg
thats amazing  we tried to write in 1 month ago and they have yet to reply,btohqsg
Also if on occupier..half the grant money will go into the occupier cpf...The new rule,btohqsg
thats interesting. We are just afraid our application would get rejected if they think our combined income is too low to apply as occupier + applicant. May I ask would that be possible ? Anyways currently I am studying my masters and only my other half has a salary  we applied HLE previously and they approved,btohqsg
I'm not quite sure on the terms. Is essential occupier n occupier different?,btohqsg
Oh. I think the hdb guy on call said like you can appeal after getting the HLE. But will take some more time   so depends when u looking to apply the bto exercise also,btohqsg
thanks a lot ! that was very helpful. Best of luck with ur BTO!,btohqsg
We also having similar issue. But more like if on occupier scared that cos low loan amount  they may not approve .But only get the HLE then U will know what type of house U approved to get.We were looking at prime area. So the hdb said HLE will also tell u whether u eligible,btohqsg
Did ur HLE get approved for prime too ? I suppose your loan amount would also be similar to mine since it's occupier,btohqsg
previously we applied for a 600k bto as applicants  and our loan was ard like 400k? In the end both were approved.,btohqsg
We have yet to try to apply as applicant + occupier thou,btohqsg
Oh ok this is both applicants right.Ours was if occupier   the estimated loan is only 200K,btohqsg
ya  but I had no income lol haha,btohqsg
so there is good chance that if occupier  we will get even lower loan?,btohqsg
hi! anybody know/can predict if there is any tamp bto cmg up soon?ü•π,btohqsg
Yes.. cos only 1 person income. Duno still can get 600+K BTO not. üòîNow we are also at crossroads. Be on applicants  or occupier scheme,btohqsg
no  you‚Äôll only know 3 months before the whether there will be a launch at the estate,btohqsg
Alot of ppl trying to put only 1 main applicant and the other half as occupier to avoid ABSD so in future the occupier can purchase another property with taxes. It is the game of trust as if your name listed under occupier for BTO  all the downpayment and monthly installment will deduct from the owner of the HDB  all short fall has to be made in cash,btohqsg
Secondly  in the event of divorce  if your name listed as occupier  I dont think you will be eligible to have a share of the HDB,btohqsg
"So there are alot of pro and cons to "" play"" with the system and rules  do consider all the facts before apply for BTO",btohqsg
HDB make it very clear if in the event during signing agreement of lease  not enough CPF or cash to pay  your application will cancel your application. By tapping on only 1 main application  spared cash is required,btohqsg
600k BTO = 120k downpayment  you have to check if depending on only 1 applicant  after wipe out his/her OA  what is the remaining balance gotta fork out in cash  and understand the monthly loan repayment amount VS monthly OA contribution on the main applicant   typically for 600k BTO   monthly installment will be around $2200 ++   only main applicant CPF are eligible to use it to pay off the amount  whatever shortfall need to be in cash,btohqsg
Yea this is to eliminate marriage of convenience  previously the EHG will only credited to main applicants. However there are small amount of people using this loop hole to beat the system.Eg  SC as main applicant   SPR as occupier   based on the old regulation   they will only counted SC utilised the EHG  after MOP   both of them divorce  SPR become SC  he/she can purchase a 2RM or find another SC or PR ( first timer ) to apply another BTO with EHG grantBy revising the regulation  even now listed as occupier   they are no longer eligible for another EHG,btohqsg
Yes we have considered that in terms of cash to see how much we need to prep in 5 years for upfront cash n also monthly cash repayment to topup for any shortfall .Thanks btw,btohqsg
Hi  just to clarify. If under occupant and applicant how would the EHG grant be distributed. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Cause I had the same issue as yours,btohqsg
it was the prelim check.. we did 2x also same result. so probably we are gg to submit for the actual HLE then appeal if it still say we not eligible for grant,btohqsg
