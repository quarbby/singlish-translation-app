DOW was up the last few sessions due to COVID additional stimulus but now all that bust already after DT return,btohqsg
This is different from Trump's mouth. Anyway  the mkt does not really react too badly (only 400pts) when trump said he discontinued stimulus talk previously.Mkt more or less expect stimulus plan only after election,btohqsg

Bank and Insurance companies love to promote Investment plan.Why pay people to help you to lose money?,btohqsg
Thats why i dont want to buy their plan. Invest myself better. Lose money at least can accept it.,btohqsg
"Exactly. If you know what goes on ""behind-the-scenes"".... you would rather invest your hard-earned money yourself.",btohqsg
I think insurance one even worse.,btohqsg

I only buy endowment policy for family and myself.  I educate my children‚Äôs  no investment policy  period.Safest.,btohqsg
Many a time all those young punks promoting funds and investment plans from banks have no idea what they are promoting.There is nothing like risk free investment. Even cash can depreciate due to inflation.If you ask me  investing using dollar cost averaging in a good etf is probably the better way for most investors. Of course how much of your savings you need to invest is purely depending on age  risk appetite etc.,btohqsg
Alot to learn from you sir,btohqsg
They are promoting to serve their own self interest...and distribute to unsuspecting investors....pump and dump - sounds familiar? Haha,btohqsg
If those selling the investment policies are your friends or relative  whoaaaaaa,btohqsg
Nobody approach me leh. I only know make $$ from stockmarket...haha,btohqsg
Asiapho has no fundamentals.... Only like playing big or small.,btohqsg
Most RTO plays cannot make it nowadays. All the RTO candidates cannot make direct listings then try to do RTO,btohqsg
They are there just to make the transaction fees   who cares if we lose our money ! Always have fine prints to say capital and earnings is not guaranteed . 2.5/4% OA/SA are already 2 almost 0 risks instrumental for long term investments for retirement  capital protected as back by Govt. We should just use our cash now to invest due to corrosion by high inflation vs low interest rates . I hope older  people ears not too soft to be persuaded :(,btohqsg
Tomorow whack hard on YZJ Rex and SATS,btohqsg
Must be more ambitious than lim mama,btohqsg
Rex price seems going up on increasing volume. Last Fri very good accumulation. Couldnt even press down to accumulate more.,btohqsg
Rex chart looks good. Supported by uptrend trendline. Broke 20dma resistance on Friday with increased volume. MACD histogram is moving up. Friday PA showed late afternoon still have buyers cleared all 144 which surprise me taking into consideration it is a Friday n price stayed 143-144 for so long. I will expect more upside this week testing the downtrend trendline.,btohqsg
Anyone vested in Asian pay t tr,btohqsg
I forgot to take photo of medtecs chart. So I use this. Price currently is trading outside the downtrend trendline & above the MA resistance. MACD histogram also moving up. If there's no news to affect the price  this setup is bullish. PA on Friday showed it has more buyers compared to the recent sessions.  I see more upside tomorrow for this.,btohqsg
UG Chart. Currently price is trading above the channel. It's supported by an uptrend trendline and formed a bullish pennant pattern at the top. The candles are being squeeze to the apex already. It has to choose a direction to go within 2 trading sessions. T4 just over on Friday. I still believe the direction should be up... Let's see....,btohqsg
MT MT MT! Feeling confident  especially after@Stockchamsharing. All huat tog!!!!üíØ,btohqsg
U sure all Medtecs.... 4D no. also Medtecs,btohqsg
End October will be interesting. New benchmark.,btohqsg
4605 members but yesterday come outüôàlike buy share you buy price drop dont buy price go upü§£,btohqsg
If know the number can openDoesn't matter what prizes  even consolation also goodThen can buy big big like $10000 big as return much better than buy shares,btohqsg
Could be some news coming soon. And oil is on demand,btohqsg
Got any chance to broken 215?,btohqsg
Hard to say. Can't predict so far. Even if have I think will take a very long time...,btohqsg
Very optimistic ahha  your Nick explains.I think one step a time  to break 215 it need to hover at 185 to 205 for some time then have better chance.Believe Many people Stucked that price 200 & 205,btohqsg
Usually stocks will move first before news. Many times we saw oil price at high but oil stocks stuck  it's actually a sign that oil price going to retrace...,btohqsg
Expect the unexpected ... could go below $1.2 again,btohqsg
Yes  im patiently waiting to scoop it at below 1.20,btohqsg
I believe alot had sold already. Cut lost. And buy back at low price,btohqsg
Yzj had been Shared buy back recently.,btohqsg
This counter worth to watch now,btohqsg
This Medical stock like TG UG n medtec all the same. When all the goons here shouting sure cheong ah  Sure go $2 etc  confirm they will U turn and hongkan.The opposite is true also,btohqsg
Any more good news for SATS ?,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt be surprised that many who bought REX at $0.20 still hold on and have not cut loss too.,btohqsg
Yea  because IMO REX is Oil Penny leader and a popular one amongst. Price kind of maintained and $0.20 was the psychological barrier to break and rally to $0.30 which many targeted . Hence  I think many FOMO and went in $0.20 range as they feel it would be really supported well based on how the BBs played it then. So I guessed many earlier REX players went in $0.19 to $0.205.,btohqsg
Yea possibly. Those who still have bullets would likely have done that. Your self yea?,btohqsg
