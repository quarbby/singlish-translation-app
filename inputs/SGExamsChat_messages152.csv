My dumb friend go write foood taster,btohqsg
ITS WRITTEN BY CHEC MARTIN YAN,btohqsg
Quote you should for conclusion on speech,btohqsg
Oh yeah for editing  the 'since temperature rose' is it change since to after??,btohqsg
Cuz like alot of people go change since to when,btohqsg
U mm I don't know how since work lah,btohqsg
Because I know how to use it but don't know how to explain,btohqsg
Its like  it doesnt make sense when you say 'when temperature rose',btohqsg
Like you go back to school since singapore national day,btohqsg
Yeah i know that the wrong word but what to replace it,btohqsg
Okay so the story is that the country is cold,btohqsg
So no body can go to school if it's copdn,btohqsg
After the temperature rose  they return,btohqsg
It's kind of how English works,btohqsg
And figure out if you say is awkward,btohqsg
Yeah i get what you mean,btohqsg
My interpretation of how do I think that the writer's job is a chef...,btohqsg
The kitchen table does not come from the kitchen. It comes from the manufacturer/carpenter!,btohqsg
It comes from seeds that planted the tree...,btohqsg
there is no end to this...,btohqsg
I had to search the internet on what 'irl' means,btohqsg
As in most of a time if you see IKEA category,btohqsg
Why?I used to not even know 'lol',btohqsg
Kitchen table is used in the kitchen,btohqsg
I used to not know 'lmao'. I asked someone. I find it a bit coarse,btohqsg
We know where you are coming from,btohqsg
Same I felt so embarrassed asking someone,btohqsg
For me  the first reaction is not google but more traditional methods,btohqsg
It was a figure of speech 😂,btohqsg
Fking annoyed by that friend asking serious matter all he do is to blue dick,btohqsg
when he need you then he find u. Other times just treat you as air,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know how long does the SPH moe account last?,btohqsg
My sch one is the straittime account. In quite sure after u leave the sch it will be terminated haha,btohqsg
Today’s N level for what subject...?,btohqsg
One cher in my school show answer,btohqsg
And she said the question 4 is when or after,btohqsg
Next time if u want to send  send all at once so the pics don’t show up one by one,btohqsg
those havin prelims today  all the best,btohqsg
Sorry .. my cher one by one,btohqsg
So I also send one by one,btohqsg
U could just wait for ur teacher to finish sending,btohqsg
BRUH WTF IS THE GIRLS FACE,btohqsg
Imagine you sleeping with your GF. Then you roll over and see this face smiling at you,btohqsg
Bold of you to assume people here have gfs,btohqsg
@DDxDCxDunno the story behind that  but if there’s an issue  can let the mods know  rather than putting it out here first,btohqsg
𝘺𝘰 𝘨𝘶𝘺𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘵 𝘨𝘰𝘣𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘥 𝘶𝘱 𝘰𝘳 𝘨𝘰𝘣𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘥 𝘶𝘱 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 ?,btohqsg
Ate rapidly is a verb + adverb,btohqsg
𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘨𝘰𝘣𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘥 𝘶𝘱 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘢𝘯𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘢𝘩,btohqsg
If you include everything means it’s different already,btohqsg
Everything refer to what the writer’s mum cook,btohqsg
They would penalize for excess word,btohqsg
So the answer is gobbled up,btohqsg
Gobbled means you eat something hurriedly,btohqsg
Cause i put the correct answer than change to the wrong one,btohqsg
for 6a i put the writer felt it was so long time ago is it acceptable or what,btohqsg
and q9 i put the writer is giving the start of what influenced his choice of career,btohqsg
To add on  we get the situation  but 1) we don’t act on matters that occurred unrelated our groups and 2) we try to keep this group as drama free as possible,btohqsg
Goodluck fellas taking bio exam today,btohqsg
Hi guys does anyone know how to fix the problem of keyboard having random shortcuts?,btohqsg
I just turned it off and went to school then when I came back ctrl became full screen,btohqsg
guys do you want a link about some hackathon competition to be sent here?,btohqsg
Here not camp dunnid 1st parade,btohqsg
My solution is to restart computer,btohqsg
Is it better to do TYS papers or other schools’ prelim papers for o level preparation?,btohqsg
I personally would recommend past O level papers  not the prelim papers of schools,btohqsg
prelims are higher than o levels if u need the reaffirmation that u can do it,btohqsg
But the style and the phrasing of the questions can be very different for prelim papers,btohqsg
So random ppl cant call u,btohqsg
Is there any place to study apartfrom starbucks,btohqsg
If im not wrong libraries are closed right,btohqsg
We can’t even study at Starbucks :/,btohqsg
They kicked me out so many times,btohqsg
If you’re in the east haha,btohqsg
tbh its better to stay home / study at sch library,btohqsg
idw to be seen as different la but,btohqsg
if ur stuck with covid its gonna be like q a number of quarantine days,btohqsg
I don’t think I’ve heard any answer to this other than ‘school’ or ‘cc study room’,btohqsg
Oh my nearby mall starbucks i saw people studying,btohqsg
Maybe once u stopped looking at them they got kicked out,btohqsg
Nah i camped there hpping they left hahaha,btohqsg
you're diving more into the ecosystem,btohqsg
I wouldn't want to go near it,btohqsg
$16.95 for apple music  tv+  arcade  and 50gb of icloud,btohqsg
the apple watch itself isn't bad,btohqsg
I just wouldn't recommend jumping into the apple ecosystem even more,btohqsg
unless you really got money to burn,btohqsg
However  it only works with Apple devices,btohqsg
So yeah Apple want you to spend more on them,btohqsg
I was surprised that airpods worked at all on anything other than iphones,btohqsg
I heard it's pretty damn wonky tho,btohqsg
0/10 would not recommend go spend your money on something else,btohqsg
bruh for one of the ans i wrote the whole sentence at line 31,btohqsg
I just expected apple to hardware lock it to iphones,btohqsg
Tbh the only Apple device I have is an iPad mini,btohqsg
Just got an Apple Pencil  but I couldn't find a shop which sells matte screen protector e.e,btohqsg
Tbh I don’t think screen protector is that impft,btohqsg
matte screen protectors are the best,btohqsg
I don’t use screen protector on mine lols. But matte is good,btohqsg
Without one  you're guaranteed to get micro scratches on your screen over time,btohqsg
Last time I use screenprotector  and I drop my phone. The screen cracked instead of the screen protector 😂🤦‍♂,btohqsg
For me it's always the tempered glass screen protector that saves the screen,btohqsg
Yea  first time also  it cracked underneath but not the screen protector,btohqsg
And the screen protector was like unscratched,btohqsg
Time to get a more traditional Nokia phone. You can throw them and they don't break,btohqsg
My phone is the screen protector of my screenprotector,btohqsg
Basically you receive the name and don't talk to the person,btohqsg
I reset the computer and it worked I think the driver broke or something,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone have N level Chinese paper 1 and 2?,btohqsg
when u turn off ur camera in zoom right  will ur position change,btohqsg
like uk everyone in the small boxes all  will it change?,btohqsg
Anyone can teach UCAT Decision Making Syllogisms questions?,btohqsg
Those with camera on will be in the first few boxes,btohqsg
say im still in the meeting,btohqsg
and i turn off my camera,btohqsg
is there a way i can keep everyone at the same positions throughout,btohqsg
no idea uh they js want,btohqsg
Have to reward myself for taking exams haha,btohqsg
I always eat the fried chicken only at Jollibee,btohqsg
Do you know anyone who sells iPad matte screen protectors?,btohqsg
But isn't shipping to Singapore not worth for just a screen protector?,btohqsg
Because when I ship  they charge a minimum of 22 rmb if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
22 rmb is quite a lot for just a screen protector,btohqsg
So isn't it not worth to ship just a screen protector from China to Singapore?,btohqsg
That's my thought process  not trying to argue or anything,btohqsg
I preferably want to get it offline and have someone apply for me,btohqsg
is anyone here from n level a math?,btohqsg
Yes but I take E math only,btohqsg
is alpha beta going to be tested for a math?,btohqsg
Only area under the curve not tested and definite integrals,btohqsg
I scored a 1 in math Sec 2,btohqsg
If people ask how are you  you going to reply I ate chicken rice?,btohqsg
But then I decided not to take A math,btohqsg
Because I lazy and I suck,btohqsg
For u all taking subjects that have removal of CLT  the qns are voided in the paper itself?And u all still have the same duration as previous years to finish the paper?,btohqsg
May the moderation work in your favour,btohqsg
There are 2 types of ppl,btohqsg
but i think for chem we are forced to do 1 q for the either or qn,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to fix a black screen for camera,btohqsg
Yup sometimes my camera opens itself,btohqsg
Reminds me when I was young  I thought the sky was taking photos at night when I saw flashes of light.. when I grew up  I learnt it’s lightning from afar,btohqsg
U just force quit n restart,btohqsg
One is bedok gf other isnt,btohqsg
How to study for history/SS ah,btohqsg
The second SEQ question for history is always so anal,btohqsg
Tbh  u need to know ur content well,btohqsg
Just treat it as exploring something new,btohqsg
Dun think of it as the past,btohqsg
history know when to use ck,btohqsg
if u got time then whack essays lul,btohqsg
i realised only now that whacking essays is the best way to score humans,btohqsg
"""exploring something new"" more like propaganda for ss",btohqsg
The issue is that the second SEQ question in history requires you to actually understand the topic,btohqsg
Like unless if you can whack all the possible essays memorizing alone won’t really work,btohqsg
Memorize in a strategic manner not word for word,btohqsg
Like link up the different events n interrelation between the characters,btohqsg
And memorize the underlying factors beneath them,btohqsg
U can draw out these interrelation of events n characters in diagram form to internalize,btohqsg
So when u reurgitate during exam it would not be like u rewriting the whole text book,btohqsg
It will expedite u to a higher level mark range too,btohqsg
So in a way preparation work is required during revision. Linking up these is essentially preparatory work,btohqsg
Reminding me of last year not taking o levels,btohqsg
Singpass can tell you your exam grades?,btohqsg
Luckily I don't have the singpass app,btohqsg
By the way  anyone has experience with or know how to close your singpass account? I don't want to use it anymore,btohqsg
wow you can check your grades,btohqsg
That's unfortunate. I don't even have online banking and still survive. I regret singing up...,btohqsg
Hmm but singpass allows u to check other things as well,btohqsg
Such as ur cpf savings  workskill future credit... etc,btohqsg
Otherwise u have to go down to respective counters physically when u need them,btohqsg
U need these documents that can be retrieved online when u apply for jobs  or apply for bank loans  housing loans... and etc occasions,btohqsg
Thanks for the explanationI have $0 CPF and don't intend to ever work or live in Singapore...I don't mind going down physically,btohqsg
Partially it's also because I currently use the token and they will discontinue it... I can't use the sms option as I live overseas and they insist on a singapore number. I'm concerned about the app as I could lose my phone...,btohqsg
Ya i can see.. that u preparing to detach urself from these.. hahaAnyway which country do u have in mind?,btohqsg
In the future? Probably UK for my PhD.,btohqsg
I do get stuff done  suprisingly without an online bank account...,btohqsg
Oh dear. U have a few fears. Hmmm. Why dont u sign a contractless line? Like zero1 charges you $9.90 per month for 1st 6 months  unlimted data,btohqsg
I am using a prepaid sim. I only have a smartphone because my JC forced me to...,btohqsg
Thats nice. So u go to bank branch? Meanwhile i am curious  what sort of transaction do u do? Without online bank account,btohqsg
Mathematics. I am super lousy at everything else. So so at mathematics,btohqsg
Wow thats interesting. During my time jc dun encourage us to have phone,btohqsg
Oh. Then ure specialized in that alr. All the best man! Very few ppl around us specialize in maths but for that few who do  they are very passionate about it,btohqsg
Yes. I don't have an ATM card also so I only have passbook. Need to withdraw at counter...,btohqsg
Because they have whatsapp group chat and what not and I hate it but what can I do? I used to have a nokia phone,btohqsg
Why not US? I heard US is a much better place to do PhD compared to UK.,btohqsg
Oh ok so u do withdrawal lah. Not like checking of fx rates or telegraphic transfers.,btohqsg
Thank you very much Tiffany! What do you do usually?,btohqsg
Oh. Omg how i wish it existed during my time,btohqsg
My interest is very broad and general. I read up on everything every industry and get my hands on everythign,btohqsg
I just like the UK. I interact much better with British people. I can't really talk to Americans easily,btohqsg
Thats kind of true. Uk ppl r a bit more traditional is it,btohqsg
Hahaha. All the best in your future endeavours too!,btohqsg
Not really. Americans joke and party and laugh a lot,btohqsg
Probably in terms of overall quality,btohqsg
Thx so much !! Well if u ever reside in uk do let me know. Cos if i go there i can pop by ur city haha,btohqsg
In terms of mathematics  maybe Princeton? I'm not sure what the top US unis are in terms of mathematics,btohqsg
Oh. Well then their CDMs are not common 🙃 so u have to deposit cash over counter. But their app is good. UOB app always lag but UOB has many CDMs around the place 🙃,btohqsg
Bro really sounded like a boomer 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Yes yes thisAmericans r way more liberal n wildUk r systematic n traditional.,btohqsg
Ya. China suddenly advance so fast. Like suddenly really,btohqsg
But i look up to them,btohqsg
Cos their actresses r really quite cool n pretty 😂,btohqsg
And the businessmen are smart too,btohqsg
Hmm. Would u mind to be more specific?,btohqsg
MIT IDK  I know their applied math good,btohqsg
But pure math is always a different thing,btohqsg
Sorry i sensed a misconnection of channel,btohqsg
after this i got english orals in like 12 minutes,btohqsg
h e l p i legit didnt study at all,btohqsg
Oh. Ok so is not that psychology ted,btohqsg
English oral is sth u no need to worry or study for DUHHHH,btohqsg
If u can chat here for so long,btohqsg
Be confident in what you say and have faith in yourself,btohqsg
U hv no problem carrying on conversations,btohqsg
i mean technically as long as i can speak english can alr-,btohqsg
Okay but actually when we talk here  we are informal and sometimes our grammar and sentence structures go all over the place,btohqsg
Hhaha thats all it is about,btohqsg
But u have a good gauge of language accuracy right?,btohqsg
Ye see yourself as a pro who can rekt the oral,btohqsg
Ur grammar all over the place here is cos u allow urselfNot bcos u dunno the right style,btohqsg
I had a really hard time writing essays in lower sec because my English cher then was bad at communicating. At the start of sec3  I was writing essays like how I would talk in a normal conversation and my sec3 english teacher had a really hard time helping me,btohqsg
Hope u feel more relaxed now,btohqsg
Good leh 12 mins is like soon,btohqsg
It is the waiting that kills,btohqsg
How can a language teacher be weak in communication haha sounds grave,btohqsg
Language is largely communication cos u see  ur language assessment requires high content input,btohqsg
She basically read off the slides and couldn't really explain herself to the class,btohqsg
How r u gonna do well for essays n orals if u dun hve content n knowledge? Or interest in any field in the society? I cant imagine,btohqsg
My essays improvement comes from reading sample essays and compre passages,btohqsg
yeah how did they become a cher in the first place,btohqsg
HAHHAAHAH??? So funny 😂😂couldnt explain herself to the class. Sorry but whcih sch u in?,btohqsg
My jc gp tutor was bad too,btohqsg
I freaked out during a levels gp  not once  but twice,btohqsg
Which i am quite surprised cos,btohqsg
I handed in empty script n shd be getting a U,btohqsg
Ya sia. Her heart must be missing somewhere,btohqsg
She quit my school after 2 years,btohqsg
Uh yes! And if best  a living person who can engage u regularly on the different examinable topics. But that sort of teacher may be hard to come by,btohqsg
Aiyo she has to. Or else more students may fall,btohqsg
This method works for essay starters,btohqsg
Ipad air is better u mean?,btohqsg
You can compare on Apple website,btohqsg
Ipad mini is more restrictive in a few ways?,btohqsg
Ya thats was what i supposed too,btohqsg
Oh  the software features r detailed ? I learnt it cos of user experience only,btohqsg
And i agree ipad mini is not good to invest in,btohqsg
The software phases out too fast too soon,btohqsg
Keeping in mind there's new iPad air releasing (15sep20 Apple wwdc),btohqsg
This one talks about physical features n specs only. Dint say much about the software compatibilty,btohqsg
Anyway i am budget tech user. I invest in a multi purpose phone,btohqsg
Cos we ladies like to bring small bags hahaha,btohqsg
Not all. The 2G network there is still available,btohqsg
You are talking about me? Hahaha,btohqsg
i legit want the ipad pro so much,btohqsg
my mom said if i get l1r5 6 she might buy it but irdk,btohqsg
u can get free airpods with purchase,btohqsg
i think discount on apple care as well,btohqsg
but honestly im waiting for a newer ipad pro,btohqsg
the one with mini led display,btohqsg
so like say ur from what secondary sch then can alr?,btohqsg
Yesss!! Hahaha 😂 at first i tot u were my generation ppl,btohqsg
I thought the Apple discount is for Uni students,btohqsg
im in poly n i bought it haha,btohqsg
wait till uni then get imo,btohqsg
Are you sure you are a baby boomer? Hahaha,btohqsg
it's not particularly useful at poly level,btohqsg
i use it to take notes ba,btohqsg
imma wait until jc at max because i dun wan use notebooks for note taking,btohqsg
I should be the same generation as you.... Millennial,btohqsg
Ipad is useful at all stages of education,btohqsg
Which ipad model do u recommend,btohqsg
the new ipad air seems fire tho,btohqsg
I dunno what the difference is honestly,btohqsg
took Os in 2015 and 2016,btohqsg
uni then too much shit alr,btohqsg
i know but i hate it,btohqsg
ah  yeah then u could get it,btohqsg
my notes are all over the place plus notebooks are just not my vibe,btohqsg
Man how i wish i was alr using tablets during my time,btohqsg
Those flipping of flying papers is so,btohqsg
if ur using the textbooks then quite gg,btohqsg
you wanna see my sec sch notes? legit they’re everywhere,btohqsg
Textbooks  lecture notes  past year papers,btohqsg
JC also majority of work is written  compared to uni where u do more stuff online,btohqsg
especially school given papers. i hope jc gives them out digitally,btohqsg
so more worth if u get in uni,btohqsg
if u wan  just get the standard ipad,btohqsg
if ur jc lecture theatres allow u to use it,btohqsg
i plan to transition to using ipads as my main computer,btohqsg
the pro has added sensitivity for the stylus,btohqsg
wait i thought most jcs allow,btohqsg
but it's not that much of a boost,btohqsg
never saw ppl using it much,btohqsg
whats ur jc (and when was that),btohqsg
I think it depends on who's giving the lectures,btohqsg
even here in my school my juniors can use ipads alr,btohqsg
Would say it depends on the kindness of the lecturer,btohqsg
but oni the sec 1’s idk why but like its part of a program(?),btohqsg
so ur literally at the mercy of the lecturer ah,btohqsg
so old it doesn't exist anymore,btohqsg
Gonna be hard to do PW on an ipad,btohqsg
I used a 2006 ThinkPad throughout my years in JC,btohqsg
I even used it for OP,btohqsg
and today I still use it,btohqsg
but yeah  JC laptops don't needa be very high end,btohqsg
a nice keyboard and light weight work for me,btohqsg
For JC the major use of laptop is PW,btohqsg
If you are in an arts combination  you’ll likely type up a lot of notes as well,btohqsg
but i probably will just write with a stylus assuming i hv an ipad-,btohqsg
Those things look super uncomfortable to type on  but to be fair I’ve never tried,btohqsg
i tried a medium-price one and its quite alright tbh,btohqsg
like i love the flexibility of choosing to write or to type,btohqsg
levitating the stylus still somehow produces an input,btohqsg
i mean yeah but it shows the quality control,btohqsg
early surface products p shit tbh,btohqsg
great build quality but the internals don't last long,btohqsg
apple products oso have high resale value,btohqsg
You can use the school's computer. I didn't have a laptop.,btohqsg
That’s an inconvenience a student would have to bear with then,btohqsg
I mean  if the student is fine with it then sure why not,btohqsg
laptop is not THAT much of a must tbh,btohqsg
esp since the google docs app on phone is decent,btohqsg
Google docs formatting is terrible and horrendous,btohqsg
laptop was mainly for looking cool and productive,btohqsg
yeah but u can input notes and stuff,btohqsg
It's so hard to use... I tried writing an essay and I nearly cried,btohqsg
I’ll die before I write a full WR on phone,btohqsg
Try using it to write mathematics. It is crazy,btohqsg
Yeah but on a mobile phone?,btohqsg
How do I do backslash? So inconvenient,btohqsg
I think you can customise keyboards for some phones,btohqsg
Many people also have the issue,btohqsg
I missed out a 7mark qn,btohqsg
Cos they put it so at the top and I didn't even see the qn,btohqsg
Well it's over... You can't do anything now so please relax,btohqsg
Mood when this is an actual uni exam,btohqsg
Since is not  just chill :D,btohqsg
Ok la 70 good enough le,btohqsg
7 marks gap difference between the highest score and one of the lowest scores in uni in terms of absolute grades stretches from A to D/E  out of 25 marks,btohqsg
Haha just chill now will do,btohqsg
As a student with 0 physics background taking an exam with 50% physics qns  i feel attacked,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to log into their straits times account on a laptop? The log in tool seems broken.,btohqsg
Idk about online  I only log in from the phone app beofre,btohqsg
must see your membership  sometimes only allow login of 1 device per account,btohqsg
Hi y’all’s! I took N and O levels last year. When I log into my Singpass account  I can only get to see my O level grades and not my N level grades. Anyone knows why this is so?,btohqsg
It will be released in batches,btohqsg
Question if you took like n level and O level paper in the same year and the following year just Os would they show the combine ur cert results or just the very latest one on  singpass?,btohqsg
Translator note:you think migrating db so ez ah. wad if something go wrong on production side? who answer? you? me?Even if it's not DB migration  it's something about the data process. It could even be a matter of policy (read  someone decision up higher) to just not whoosh everything at once,btohqsg
But I think I saw A-levels PW grouped with my non PW results  despite them being different years,btohqsg
I dont even wanna see my grades even tho they look nice,btohqsg
? I don't get you. You're trying to say I'm wrong?,btohqsg
Cuz I took like 3 Os paper while in Ns then I left my sec to go pfp(sch dw me stay in sec5)  n took the remaining* subjects (but I took extra subjects too uh) to trnfr to be in JC now.,btohqsg
If you took 3 Os I assume all will be shown,btohqsg
Cuz my cert gonna look weird w/o those sub,btohqsg
Well AFAIK only zhenghu tracks O-levels,btohqsg
Even if SME IDK how much they care about Os,btohqsg
Normal company shouldn't care about Os,btohqsg
Cuz for the company I wanna go requires Os,btohqsg
What company is that? I am curious,btohqsg
Wah  the school is so kind  allow y'all to take 3 o level subjects. :(,btohqsg
Heard my friend say his friend take a lot of O level subjects then go RV after N levels,btohqsg
I'm only offered o level emath. :(,btohqsg
Is it very difficult to do it?,btohqsg
Unless your sch Willing to help you change sub,btohqsg
the person from ctss i think,btohqsg
May be rude but what is the point of just taking 3 O level subjects?,btohqsg
so year 5 no nid take,btohqsg
But I take cuz I wanted to trnfr to take pure sciences when I go sec 5,btohqsg
I come jc the knowledge is so foreign there is no relevance,btohqsg
the atomic structure everything fake one no point in knowing it at all,btohqsg
but I'm good because I don't listen in secondary school,btohqsg
So what shd I do? No matter what I do it seems that I'm screwed,btohqsg
What do you aim to be in the future?,btohqsg
Learn the fake things first then update your machine as you go!,btohqsg
Feels like everytime you move on to the next stage of education your brain needs a reset,btohqsg
Mine wasn't running much during secondary four so no resetting needed.,btohqsg
but then in life everything keeps changing so get used to it bah,btohqsg
So shd I drop to combined?,btohqsg
I got this question that I would want to ask for people's opinion. Which is would you go to the top JC and take a subject that your weak in and not do well for As or would you rather take your best subject but in the worst JC and do well for As.,btohqsg
If you want then drop but I take pure science for points,btohqsg
but depends if you can have both to be 50% each lor,btohqsg
If not you will study like one dying human in the college,btohqsg
Pure science ah drop physics take biology biology is the best,btohqsg
Idk. I'm insecure about every subject in general,btohqsg
Like since chem is 50% and another sci is 50% and if you don't do well for one how are you going to balance well for combined?,btohqsg
Also if you want go something like engineering you have o level physics A can already,btohqsg
yes  considering how i have no physics background and learnin physics in uni now,btohqsg
They told me you cant go science stream in jc if you take combined thou,btohqsg
If not you will study like one dying human in the college,btohqsg
I'm not really sure whether its true,btohqsg
just that you need get a solid A1 for some,btohqsg
Some sch only not all school offer,btohqsg
all the ppl who got A1 for combined science in my class didnt even manage a B for H2 Chem at A lvls,btohqsg
Even pure sciences don't even get A,btohqsg
Well I guess hopefully I can improve my L1R5 lol,btohqsg
@jianjun21You know in the year before pjc merge it was the most value add college?,btohqsg
i find h2 chem easier than o lvls,btohqsg
my junior batch (last batch) did way better than my batch,btohqsg
My teacher just told me that,btohqsg
double the number of 5 distinction and above students and also double the number of perfect scorers,btohqsg
Your batch is first batch of jp?,btohqsg
I dont have a weak or strong subject.,btohqsg
My teacher said the 2018 batch has not very good results,btohqsg
i took a lvls in 2017,btohqsg
so i guess im 2016 batch?,btohqsg

Me @ ri not offering fmath math physics literature.,btohqsg
I dont know whether that's depressing or not,btohqsg
My younger brother now sec 5 then want go Mi but they are not  offering the combi,btohqsg
Mi is the only sch that got accounting?,btohqsg
at the end of the day  compared to national average ofc not so good ah,btohqsg
but alr considered good at the stated L1R5 average,btohqsg
ACJC and RJC want you where will you go to?,btohqsg
i would have chose ac tho,btohqsg
Yes now the students going haywire too I don't know what has gotten into their heads.,btohqsg
Honestly acjc will probably reject me :(,btohqsg
Most sec 5 students don't really last long in jc (-- coming from my class HAHA,btohqsg
the fact that l1r5 16 cant get 90 rp?,btohqsg
ah then they deserve to flunk i guess,btohqsg
Like dressing it up is a priority over studying now,btohqsg
My class L1R5 4-8 and rn doing q bad,btohqsg
So..I'm not surprised by that fact,btohqsg
It depends on your attitude in the jc to be fair if you slack then you drop if you drive then you do well,btohqsg
and i still did fairly ok,btohqsg
Do you know of the teck whye secondary guy in pjc?,btohqsg
The one that top the level from j1 to j2,btohqsg
association is not causation dats right,btohqsg
Idk my gp teacher tell me he from debate then he study like nuts,btohqsg
i ended up beating the person who topped the cohort for j1 and j2 in my sch at a lvls,btohqsg
My oldest brother  L1R5 is 19 but for As 88.75 so yea I agree,btohqsg
How do you guys even know the scores of people from other classes?,btohqsg
he graduated like 4 years ago,btohqsg
and also selected students that do well for prelims will get invitations from NUS/NTU/SMU for application during A lvl period,btohqsg
so usually the students selected their prelims is 80 rp and above,btohqsg
my batch had like 24 ppl out of 600+,btohqsg
h2 bio is enough memory space,btohqsg
so they can throw away their A levels right?,btohqsg
figured h1 econs is less content heavy so might as well,btohqsg
but cos i can relate to irl stuff so i didnt do that bad,btohqsg
geog got a lot of stuff,btohqsg
I see some of my geog classmates they take until one die,btohqsg
Wait if take econs still need take hist or geog?,btohqsg
Can I ask you a few qns in pm---?,btohqsg
if you in science but if you go to arts then you need,btohqsg
idk if you got special combi then you can bah,btohqsg
I know some people that take econs and geog because they dropped chem,btohqsg
least stuff to memorise compared to other arts,btohqsg
