If I don't buy hph.. I will want Trump to win.. He got personality,btohqsg
He will be man if you see all your stocks sky rocket,btohqsg
Who can boost the economy will be love by many ppl ba,btohqsg
They now extra time izit? Penalty shootout soon,btohqsg

You also ask these kind of challenging questions leh,btohqsg
fri results bound 2 be good,btohqsg
Sci money alot. Keep share buy back,btohqsg
Assuming he wins wisconsin and holds nevada  he only needs 1 out of the 4 right?,btohqsg
Michigan around 4.27mil votes @ 80%  so still got 1mil votePenn around 5.25mil votes @ 64%  still got 2.95mil votes not in,btohqsg
Michigan most likely out of the 4,btohqsg
Trump want to stop the poll now ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
If Biden win nevada  wisconsin n michigan 270  votes,btohqsg
The lead less than 1mil only. still got more than 1mil votes not in yet,btohqsg
Wisconsin earlier also trump win quite a lot,btohqsg
With 1 m votes not counted,btohqsg
Still hv a slight chance ba,btohqsg
See Biden can last min goal bo,btohqsg
Wisconsin win cause the calculated the absentee votes,btohqsg
The counting very misleading. Don't know those unaccounted votes now belong where?,btohqsg
If absentee or early votes  Biden still good chance,btohqsg
Like our election a lot void votes I also donâ€™t know what they doing,btohqsg
They very complicated. Have early voting  absentee voting,btohqsg
Looks like Biden really have a fighting chance with the mail-ins,btohqsg
Nv see before so tight election,btohqsg
Confirm la. Trump supporters all very brave. No scared covid. Wont vote using mails one.,btohqsg
If Trump lose because of mail in  he will sure create many troubles,btohqsg
I see bookmakers odds better judgement their algo most updated one,btohqsg
Biden might hv some injury time goal,btohqsg
Now 238 to 213 liao.. Biden leading,btohqsg
Biden just needs to take NV  WI  GA/MI then president liao,btohqsg
Ok. My bet is biden win. PN  WI and MI  counting the mail in votes and will not be declaring winner until all votes count.PN have 1 mil mail in votes.,btohqsg
As long as got winner good.,btohqsg
Hahaha. Trump will win for sure,btohqsg
But the uncertainty is the uncounted votes loh,btohqsg
Pennsylvania still have 2.9m votes to be counted,btohqsg
Trump lead Penn by huge margin,btohqsg
Biden need 2/3 votes for the remaining votes not counted,btohqsg
its the mail-in vote that may the surprising factor that will cause an upset,btohqsg
Wah if Trump lose WI quite jialat,btohqsg
PA almost certainly might turn blue after mail in votes counted,btohqsg
How come leh? Mail in all biden supporter?,btohqsg
No la I never check la,btohqsg
Sure got some places in US got changes,btohqsg
Quite likely I believe. Trump was criticising mail-in all along. I believe most of his supporters will go in person,btohqsg
Yep. Biden was encouraging voters to mail in,btohqsg
Wah from underdog to favourite now,btohqsg
But pre voting biden was overwhelming favourite,btohqsg
Lol  I have Sitra also . Holding in bag already. 800 lots 15 & 16 .Wait for BBs come to play micro penny then we have chance.,btohqsg
The time should come  this or early next year . Need to wait for it,btohqsg
