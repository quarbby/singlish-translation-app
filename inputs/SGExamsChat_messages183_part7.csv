Yeah  as if your pay is high,btohqsg
LOL then you can take back your ‚ÄúORDlo‚Äù,btohqsg
Sign on is always an option if u have nowhere else to go,btohqsg
If they don't offer you to sign on? Then how?,btohqsg
Anyway thanks for the talk just now,btohqsg
I am aware of what you guys are saying,btohqsg
After NS  brain rot as you said.. sign on  rot further?,btohqsg
Yes both jc and poly got downside,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok  if u sign on you won‚Äôt need to use brain anyway,btohqsg
But for interest i will go towards poly,btohqsg
pls have any wospec without criminal background or health problems been rejected,btohqsg
Hmm if you want to climb,btohqsg
Just get 1WO and farm there,btohqsg
Do PES C and E get to sign on?,btohqsg
Sometimes people get PES C or E and they didn't expect it,btohqsg
My JC class had a number of people in PES C and E,btohqsg
Some people didn't expect anything  went for the checkup and they discovered a heart issue. Then PES F,btohqsg
You saw with your own eyes?,btohqsg
and everyone is half naked in bunk,btohqsg
How easy is PES C life,btohqsg
Guys i kenna mental condition before,btohqsg
Probably anything from PES B to F. Depends how serious and all that.Not sure if PES A is possible.,btohqsg
To manoeuvre oneself into Pes C,btohqsg
Because I have no medical condition but really don‚Äôt want to be in Pes B or A,btohqsg
C or E depending on severity,btohqsg
That's why fighting it is important,btohqsg
Most NSFs do not do enough to combat brain rot,btohqsg
PES F is also possible  depending on the condition.,btohqsg
Not going to say in front of 2000+ people,btohqsg
But my class was more unique as most if not all other classes did not have anything close of that ratio of foreign scholars,btohqsg
Eh same my class had nearly half from China,btohqsg
Honestly I just don't want to say it here but if you really want to know you can PM me,btohqsg
My class had Thai  Malaysian  Cambodian  Chinese and Indonesian. As far as I recall,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt heard of this word ‚ÄúWuhan‚Äù for a long time since the virus was renamed as COVID-19,btohqsg
It used to be called 2019-nCoV not Wuhan something,btohqsg
Wuhan used to be three cities  Wuchang  Hankow and Hanyang,btohqsg
Haha ‚ÄúWuhan‚Äù was convenient representative name of the virus,btohqsg
And don't tell me that the name RJC is outdated because I know. I just want to use the older terms,btohqsg
Y know that big fuss china blew up over the naming of the flu,btohqsg
Well  mers and the spanish flu kinda pinpoints the location of the flu as well,btohqsg
China just kicking up a fuss for nothing,btohqsg
Now people think covid aint origin from china,btohqsg
Just because change name to english name,btohqsg
Everyone knows is from china tho,btohqsg
Uh MERS is middle eastern  so the parallel is calling covid the 'asian' or 'east asian' flu.The Spanish flu did not come from spain  but due to misinformation. Therefore  the argument is that the use of wuhan or chinese flu is racist and implicitly accusatory is subjectively valid,btohqsg
hi y‚Äôall! was wondering if there‚Äôs any chance the ss chapter for n levels will appear again for o levels? im trying to cut down what i study cos i have brain capacity üòîüòî,btohqsg
