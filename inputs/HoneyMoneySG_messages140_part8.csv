hi guys  for DBS interbank GIRO form (for EGA auto debit)  is this the form?https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/iwov-resources/docs/giro-cards_dbsv2.doc.pdfso far UOB  and Stan Chart there's the part where you can fold up and mail it  this is only a single page? like the postage fee will be settled by the receiving bank,btohqsg
Postage fee settled by you if u dont have BRE,btohqsg
Dbs brehttps://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/forms/business-reply-envelope.pdf?pid=sg-dbs-pweb-default-forms-footer-bre-pdf-textlinkOr you can drop it off at the dbs bank branch. No need queue.,btohqsg
Hi can i ask for the uob one credit card for the quarter  2 months i hit above 500 and 1 month above 1k  how will the cashback calculate?,btohqsg
It will be $50. They take the lowest qualifying month for the quarter,btohqsg
But whatever i spend on 1k that month  i will still receive extra 5% like those grab etc?,btohqsg
This question better to ask CS. I‚Äôm not sure if they prorate it for monthly or not even though they count the bonus cap monthly.The bonus spend will only be given at the end of the quarter.,btohqsg
Is it ideally for uob one credit card  if i hit 500 minimum   i shouldnt spend extra more on this cc?,btohqsg
I personally do $2k so better to let the others advice. This card is another good dumping ground for all those weird MCC barring the usual insurance  hospital  financial services  tax and government services.This card used to be one of the champion cards for CardUp and iPayMy but both have been excluded for about 2yrs already so cannot use it for those.,btohqsg
For example for the quarter  i spent 600   700   800. I wonder if the excess from 500 minimum spent is wasted for the cashback,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre chasing cash back  can put the excess after UOB One into Amaze CRMC. No min spend and it can give 2.27% cash back on almost everything except travel related and public transport.If you change your mind about cash back  can exchange for 4 miles per dollar.,btohqsg
UserAshishhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:not a place for job recruitment,btohqsg
yes still get additional 5% for those specific merchants,btohqsg

Hi all  I have to make a payment of $6 800 for Invisalign treatment. I am able to split this amount and pay it by $3 400 in two visits.I already have UOB Evol and Citi rewards credit card.What will be the best credit card strategy to maximise for this payment? I believe getting a new credit card for the payment  will it be worth it that comes along with a free cash reward?,btohqsg
UOB PPV $1110  UOB VS $2000  Amaze+Citi Rewards $1000  total $4110.,btohqsg
If annual fee for my UOB credit card has been deducted for more than 2 months ago  is it still possible to seek for annual fee waiver?  And if fee waiver is not successful  and I terminate the credit card  possible to get the annual fee refunded?,btohqsg
Any requirements or minimum spend to get 15% overseas?,btohqsg
Hi if the merchant allows online payment as well  will you recommend any other cards?And the benefit of UOB PPV and UOB VS is the miles right? Alternatively  can use citirewarda for a payment of $3K as well right since there is no cap?,btohqsg
Is this MCC under hospitals? If not  consider Citi SMRT card for online. 5% cash back and can do in one single transaction.,btohqsg
Okie for the MCC  I should verify directly with the merchant if they are under hospitals right?,btohqsg
Is it private? If private I don‚Äôt think you will have a problemEdit: I think better just check haha. Sometimes some clinics under Mount E also bill under hospital MCC,btohqsg
citi rewards 10x points capped for 1k eligible spend,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I use my dbs altitude and pay using atome. Will I be able to earn the miles?,btohqsg
Came across this from HWZ.StarHub 5Gbps for new sign up @ $29.55https://www.starhub.com/personal/store/broadband/browse/products/exclusive_-ultraspeed-5gbps-onr-at-2955_ultraspeed-5gbps.htmlFor ONT (no router)  then here is the linkhttps://www.starhub.com/personal/store/broadband/browse/products/exclusive_-ultraspeed-5gbps-ont-at-2955_ultraspeed-5gbps.html,btohqsg
If you are looking for broadband,btohqsg
Yes. But it's not as bad if you haven't max out additional cashback since they're at 5%. So just purely spend on such merchants.,btohqsg

Should I be using UOB preferred Platinum to buy Scoot air ticket and hotel (agoda or booking)? Does it give 4 MPD?,btohqsg
How about UOB visa signature ?,btohqsg
I prefer to accumulate miles with UOB since the miles are pooled together. I‚Äôve maxed out UOB ladies card for travel in Nov.I have hsbc revolution  but I don‚Äôt accumulate miles in hsbc anymore. Citibank rewards doesn‚Äôt reward travel expenses too. What is the best alternative card to use for travel?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
no. for local spending only contactless or mobile contactless can,btohqsg
You didnt have uob scoot card?Oh i meant uob kf ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Nope.. sounds too specific for my liking.. why the emoji ü§£ tho? üòÖ,btohqsg
I was making fun of uob kf card. kf in the name but doesnt offer any benefits for sq flights but scoot flights instead. Its more of UOB scoot card üòÅ,btohqsg
I also don‚Äôt accumulate points/miles in DBS. Mostly in Citi and UOB. Thanks for your help! I‚Äôll just use any card then  and earn base points.,btohqsg
