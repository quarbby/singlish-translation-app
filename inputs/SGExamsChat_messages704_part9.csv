do you want the school to get cancelled on reddit,btohqsg
EJC is one of the better JCs I think,btohqsg
very impressed with the students I have from there,btohqsg
I mean there are majority IP classes and majority JAE classes,btohqsg
But full IP and full JAE will just lead to trouble,btohqsg
my time was full IP sch so a lot of content was fr accelerated,btohqsg
If the results for IP fell since 2020 a levels then itâ€™s quite likely the extra stuff yall learnt early was beneficial,btohqsg
thats what my friend who grad in 2018 said,btohqsg
But dhs doesnâ€™t disclose results results for Jae students only and only ip so itâ€™s hard to tell the fall in performance was due to Jae students or this  or both,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s all? XD. All of you are taking the same A levels in Y6 or J2 not in Y5 lol ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
with the speed of the chat ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i think the person got lost in the discussion,btohqsg
I think ej chem is generally still okay,btohqsg
Even the weakest of students still kinda know what they're doing,btohqsg
not the sch stuff but the student attitude,btohqsg
Oh wait ur the math teacher,btohqsg
math and physics are binded together,btohqsg
thereâ€™s no diff between the two,btohqsg
the weakest H2 chem student in mi would probably still be failing o lvl combined chem,btohqsg
doesn't it depend on the course and school,btohqsg
this is my first time hearing this,btohqsg
JC content is very hard to self study,btohqsg
but poly teachers are still nie trained right,btohqsg
poly donâ€™t need to be nie trained,btohqsg
if they aren't nie trained it makes sense,btohqsg
tbh the correlation isnâ€™t quite there anyway,btohqsg
at least uni professors actually need to become professors,btohqsg
how do you think they become profsâ€¦,btohqsg
most profs are hired based on their ability to do research and teaching is just part of their contract,btohqsg
the focus was never on teaching,btohqsg
the exceptions are certain teaching focused positions,btohqsg
but a lot of them donâ€™t even touch teaching for years,btohqsg
and itâ€™s diff when you get them to teach smth thatâ€™s undergrad level,btohqsg
bc itâ€™s really way too easy for them,btohqsg
anyway in uni you shouldnâ€™t be depending on profs at all,btohqsg
not even taking into account their quality,btohqsg
nah no discrimination shld be made,btohqsg
how do i become like you,btohqsg
what does unbalanced load in circuits mean,btohqsg
sit around all day and ask for treats,btohqsg
uneven distribution of loads in the three phase system blah blah,btohqsg
Poly lecturer + tuition teacher on the side is good pay,btohqsg
poly lecturer is gonna be my retirement job,btohqsg
I WAS SUPPOSED TO ASK A QUESTION SHE ISN'T ABLE TO ANSWER,btohqsg
my dad is an electrician so i do kinda know a bit about these kind of stuff,btohqsg
i mean you didnâ€™t ask a hard question,btohqsg
my dad is good at math and physics while im ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
like what you asked is smth i never explicitly learned,btohqsg
kuro is gonna grad with gpa 4,btohqsg
helped roll the skin  cant fold it for shit lmao so my mom helped,btohqsg
