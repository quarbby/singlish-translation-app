Guys  check with u all. Today i got a MPV job from 12 buffalo road. Zigzag lines along the road. So i called restaurant at 10.33am told them i arrive. So that they can quickly pass me the food at the road side. However  i was told  food not ready have to wait another 15mins. So i drove to nearby n park. At the same time i tried to live chhat with CS.15mins later i went back to the restaurant food still not out yet. 10.49 the lady boss called me and said food ready can go back to collect. I told her i am standing right at the entrance waiting for it. And the food not ready to hand over to me. I waited about another 5mins  someone from the restaurant came out with 1 bag of food and said somemore coming. After collecting the food i swipe loading completed and continue to live chat with CS. Reporting about the waiting time. CS said will check with user. And after a while CS came back to me and said food was hand over to me at 10.42. WTH!! I want to ask how to protect ourselves with the pick up n drop off timing. I only have proof of call log when i called the restaurant n when the lady boss called me when food ready.,btohqsg
Usually after 10 mins I start chat with CS already  then they will ask me to let them know when I collect food.,btohqsg

Hi  anyone knows if rating affects u?,btohqsg
When you bid for job against others goes by 3 criteria: sticker  rating and proximity.,btohqsg
You forgot another criteria... Listed as favourite rider...But I am not sure which criteria comes before another criteria. All I know is that if proximity plays a big part in getting the job.,btohqsg
Favourite rider lets u see the job earlier by couple of seconds. Doesn't affect whether u get the bid or not,btohqsg
