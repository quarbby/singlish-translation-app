Bcos they might have prepared lesser than YOU,btohqsg
think that its just a practice den like idk i just do dman fast and left w bout 45 mins? den keep checking ah redo the workings,btohqsg
but in the exam room im jus like telling myself its just a paper,btohqsg
Oh my tuition got one jessica also,btohqsg
I suggest u guys fllw Jessicas Advice,btohqsg
u need to calm urself during exam tbh,btohqsg
and oh i last min  studied for math LOL,btohqsg
I think she almost got full marks. Or she actlly got full marks,btohqsg
i started math on friday night,btohqsg
Surprising during exam i not that nervous,btohqsg
Oh I think most people got almost full marks thou. That's why we say the bell curve is 95,btohqsg
Look Gan if Jessica managed to do it and stayed calm. You should too.,btohqsg
Bruh i start june and i cant get full mark,btohqsg
i just do the emath tys,btohqsg
i finished 6 papers on sat,btohqsg
I mean maths shd be a continuous effort,btohqsg
7.5 hrs tuition on saturday BRO,btohqsg
Does tuition help? I've never gone,btohqsg
For me still can go ite,btohqsg
7.5 hrs to do 6 paper 1 and go thru them all,btohqsg
7hrs of math tuition. You go lunch with ur tutor halfway?,btohqsg
mine is private 1 to 1 sooo,btohqsg
Idk my classmate spends a lot on tuition idk if it actually helps,btohqsg
like 2pm-5pm den 730-12am ard thr,btohqsg
Bruh i spent alot and cant excel,btohqsg
Did u do the same for amaths?,btohqsg
its coz i last min ma,btohqsg
Tuition wont work if u dont revise also.,btohqsg
I dont think I have the mental willpower to sit through that,btohqsg
i had tuition in the morning nefore paper,btohqsg
I dont think tuition is necessary thou self study is prob enough,btohqsg
uhm my tutiion 1 hr 35$ uh,btohqsg
Yea bobian i no motivation to do self study as private candidate,btohqsg
Yes. Tuition imo is just a helping hand for people struggling to understand a concept or lack basic ubderstanding of fundamentals,btohqsg
uhm sunday i had tuition till 1230?,btohqsg
I feel like going to tuition is more of a pain than self study,btohqsg
U not the only one here. Im one too,btohqsg
den monday 845am math tuition till 12 den go exam lor,btohqsg
For me i always need school,btohqsg
hi.. sorry... does anyone have the english paper 2 pdf,btohqsg
But uk alot of them offer damn less,btohqsg
i mean he stay OPP my block sooo,btohqsg
Like one subject one week 2hour,btohqsg
I dont think it was posted here sorry,btohqsg
HAHAHA idt distance is a issue for him to travel home,btohqsg
tbh im really thankful for sucha  great tuition teacher haha,btohqsg
I also want stay near me der,btohqsg
do tys but mow no time alr,btohqsg
If anything can just fast game come,btohqsg
Just opt to live with your tutor Gan,btohqsg
Bellcurve for amaths is prob gonna be 90 or something,btohqsg
I was thinking of that before,btohqsg
just like think of the workings in ur brain,btohqsg
Jessica also said previously in her interview that She kept telling herself to not panic etc,btohqsg
I no tutor can stay up with me to midnight lol,btohqsg
it worked when i was in the exam venue,btohqsg
issue 2 ss lets go HAHAHAH my brain dying le,btohqsg
its so hard to get r5 below 12,btohqsg
Do people normally panic during exams?,btohqsg
if not all ur prevs hardwork gone,btohqsg
like there no time to panic ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yea once i panicked bcos my hand got stuck in a Mouse trap placed beside my stationaries. So it took me an extra 5mins to draw the curve graph,btohqsg
all my words like linked tgt alr,btohqsg
Then u write too fast they say yr handwriting unreadable,btohqsg
mamaged to finish for prelims FOR ONCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,btohqsg
Humans u just gotta keep writing and writing. Dont spend too much time thinking of the answer. Max 5mins to analyze the source,btohqsg
thats why even linked i make sure is readable,btohqsg
I've never finished a humans paper before,btohqsg
i only finish during timed prac before prelim lol,btohqsg
den read the qns and syraight do alr,btohqsg
actually i dont even care abt my handwriting,btohqsg
I donâ€™t annotate at all lol,btohqsg
coz annotate alr so think no more,btohqsg
Same haha that's why my humans marks fluctuate like roller coaster,btohqsg
i only study when exams cming,btohqsg
my section B very nice also,btohqsg
Bruh anyone here retake o level,btohqsg
wna study ss n geog tgt,btohqsg
saturday morning managed to force my chem cher out and help me w chem HAHAHAHA DEN TUITIONðŸ¥´ 8 hrs,btohqsg
aiya next week papers i need study also,btohqsg
i force my sch chem cher out,btohqsg
den after that i got tuition,btohqsg
chinese dunnid study one HAHAHAH jus noe the  trick,btohqsg
im like struggling with hcl ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
uhm paper 2 first 10 mcq is frm the highlighted words frm textbook sec1-4normally out of the 4  3 of it is not in the highlighted ones so its the one u lesrnt nefore ah that wld be the ansanother scenario is u lesrnt all the 3 before n U SHLD noe the meaning of those 3  if it doesnt fit in the sentence its the one not in highlighted words de  but the first scenario happens more often,btohqsg
den for compre is by order normally,btohqsg
qn1 first para and so on,btohqsg
Sounds like A1 student to me,btohqsg
for the last qns for each comprehensiom coz got 2 right,btohqsg
basically after u write whether u agree or not and ur reasoning  ur eg/ scenario u write a story like compo but short one,btohqsg
i wld love my eng to have same standard as my chinese as well,btohqsg
go thru ur prevsly done amath papers and makse sure u noe how to do all of them,btohqsg
just make sure u know how to do all those u did before n the wrong ones rmb ur mistakes,btohqsg
Although not that good either lol ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
cover it m redo it in ur brain,btohqsg
u weak in both papers ah?,btohqsg
i mean o cmi the theory in both papers only Lol so i need memorise,btohqsg
my calculations and drawing up the ledgers all cn,btohqsg
idk man i aint a scholar ya noe shld ask those r5 single pointers HAHAHAH,btohqsg
mostly can but correction of error i always get wrong ðŸ˜‚ soz,btohqsg
my results r just meh shit,btohqsg
L1r5 prob 7 to 9 :(,btohqsg
Why do you always think you gonna fail?,btohqsg
I think his correction is wrong,btohqsg
my friend got 7 lah but yeah ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U guys have been talking for 50mins,btohqsg
I think u guys shld sleep,btohqsg
HAHAH im memoriseing ss into my brain,btohqsg
Some people actually have to use the full duration of the paper,btohqsg
i decided i shall leave it to tmr lol,btohqsg
i think i need at least 2 days ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i spending 8 hrs on tuition on sat thts why i gotta start esrly if not no time,btohqsg
8 hrs tuition on poa yaHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
yeah like i tried memorising geog in one day before my prelim but i cant ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i think i torturinf my tutiion cher this mth,btohqsg
Honestly I cant relate to all of u tuition folks,btohqsg
Ur mental stamina must be insane,btohqsg
my tuition started like last mth ot this mth only,btohqsg
i used to not have too okay,btohqsg
dealing w tuition another week and im done,btohqsg
yes but im not performing well,btohqsg
Still have a lot of chances next week and tmr,btohqsg
nxt week comes the torture lol ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You still gonna go to top notch jc,btohqsg
How to get rid of it,btohqsg
I drank 2 cups of warm water,btohqsg
You need to learn factor formula,btohqsg
I think students have enough of trigo formulas,btohqsg
Back in my parentsâ€™ era  they need to memorise atomic number of elements,btohqsg
No such thing as periodic table given,btohqsg
Yeah but wonâ€™t see such questions anymore,btohqsg
Itâ€™s like doing factorization.. you put the ones that can be converted using factor formula tgt,btohqsg
Haha can check out. Phased out since 2014,btohqsg
That was when matrices was tested in A-math,btohqsg
Partial fractions used to be in jc math year 1,btohqsg
Then multiply this by the matrix,btohqsg
Tbh inverse matrices not really applicable,btohqsg
Yeah back then itâ€™s in jc,btohqsg
is anyone working out the lc answers or nah,btohqsg
Anyways they are alr teaching modulus in inequalities so I guess they can put that in there,btohqsg
Or just teach modulus in graphing,btohqsg
I think flexible for schools to adjust coz some schools start different topic first,btohqsg
Content can be learnt. Anyways the modulus function is so easy to define. It doesn't really matter to be honest,btohqsg
Yea but itâ€™s going to be quite a shock for the JC chers,btohqsg
Coz not like they pay attention to the O level syllabus,btohqsg
I mean if u take FM then u know where u can apply it,btohqsg
I now learn not to be shocked when people don't know certain things. What you learn previously isn't that important. What is more important is problem solving skills and remembering the definitions and theorems,btohqsg
Nah I just scared the JC Chers will just not go through it properly,btohqsg
Coz they would assume they know it from sec sch,btohqsg
But do you know how to find it for an arbitrary nxn matrix? If you don't  it doesn't matter  I'm sure you can pick it up quickly,btohqsg
I mean itâ€™s even inside the H2 math syllabus that the prerequisite knowledge is modulus,btohqsg
Wonder if they gotta modify the syllabus doc again ahaha,btohqsg
How long does it take to learn? One minute?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not the time that matters itâ€™s whether theyâ€™ll even teach,btohqsg
Some teachers dun give a shit one,btohqsg
If they don't teach  students can pick it up easily on their own,btohqsg
Then a bit unfair lor but oh well,btohqsg
Well  if a teacher doesn't care about the students  does it even matter if the students know about modulus? The whole 'package' would be delivered poorly anyways,btohqsg
Not knowing what modulus is would be very minor,btohqsg
Anyways  JC students aren't even supposed to know how to properly define a function and how to prove a function has an inverse.,btohqsg
The horizontal line test doesn't constitute a proof of one-to-one and a function being one-to-one does not mean it has an inverse,btohqsg
A function is One to one is equivalent to saying a function has a LEFT inverse. Not an inverse,btohqsg
You still need to prove a function is onto  or equivalently has a right inverse,btohqsg
Oh well all subjects have some form of loophole liddat,btohqsg
Yes  like in H2 physics  they assume the planets have circular orbits. Hahaha,btohqsg
Teach us some proving method/derivation that has assumptions/dun work,btohqsg
Yea fuck in FM itâ€™s elliptical,btohqsg
Ok we dun learn it explicitly in FM but we know coz got qn on kepplerâ€™s law and elliptical orbits before,btohqsg
Then the Heisenberg principle is incorrect number some more ahahaha,btohqsg
But anyways what people do in JC is no match for uni. I have to know how to do double and triple integrals  how to formally prove limits in higher dimensions etc etcNot my cup of tea  but well,btohqsg
But the thing is that orbits of planets aren't perfectly elliptical,btohqsg
Yea even FM can only go so far,btohqsg
And I have seen the notes. It's so funny,btohqsg
H3 fucking joke bro all the Cherâ€™s make the notes one,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s basically almost no guideline on the content,btohqsg
So all schools teach different things,btohqsg
Itâ€™s just a oh good if u familiarise with this thing not u must know this,btohqsg
You're in which JC? That is  if you want to say.,btohqsg
I alr grad I from TJ,btohqsg
What do you plan to do in uni?,btohqsg
Why so many people go into computer science? I feel the market is so saturated,btohqsg
Maybe it's because I hate coding,btohqsg
Oh well...Too few people these days go into pure mathematics  which is a pity,btohqsg
Do TJ students stay back to study until 10pm?,btohqsg
That's only for 2x2 matrices. Easiest way for nxn is to do row reduction on (A | I) to obtain (I | A^-1),btohqsg
Coz people perceive pure math as just can go teach only,btohqsg
Err maybe for night study peeps,btohqsg
But in general I think no,btohqsg
Who are the night study peeps?,btohqsg
But I think the school closes before 10,btohqsg
Are they forced to stay back?,btohqsg
Yea there are those who need to go,btohqsg
Well  research as well  that is if you want to stick to pure mathematics only throughout your life,btohqsg
Some no need to go but still go anyways,btohqsg
I mean for some they like the environment,btohqsg
But now I dun even know if have night study,btohqsg
Maybe have but only those who need to go can go,btohqsg
Oh well some people can barely handle the H2 math rigour and also FM isnâ€™t rly as hot as it was last time since contrasting subject is a thing,btohqsg
Yep. Used to be double maths double science.Some take triple science and core maths,btohqsg
Even those good in math dun even want to go into pure math,btohqsg
Yea heard like it was 1/3 of the cohort last time,btohqsg
One of my GP Chers and one of my FM Chers took it,btohqsg
To go into pure mathematics  it is a different thing altogether. You can do terribly at school mathematics and end up excelling in pure abstract mathematics.,btohqsg
Meanwhile my other FM cher is 2006 J1 so he first batch of H1 H2 and H3,btohqsg
One of my maths teachers in the past was born in '88  so the 2006 graduating cohort,btohqsg
Funny thing is this FM cher he PW deputy head but got C for PW,btohqsg
But tbf first PW batch so the marking maybe quite whack,btohqsg
At the time the new system was quite messy and people didn't know what to expect,btohqsg
Yeah  I was already attending school at the time,btohqsg
Cant imagine how itâ€™s like to go research in 2006,btohqsg
Coz nowadays itâ€™s a lot of online research,btohqsg
Well  mostly from books. The internet was nonsense and most of my classmates did not have a computer at home,btohqsg
Then how did u write the WR lol,btohqsg
I mean I was in primary school at the time,btohqsg
Nowadays u have google drive for ur teachers to feedback fast,btohqsg
My family's desktop at home took 10 over minutes to start up,btohqsg
It came at a stupid timing,btohqsg
That will be in 2027  when MF26 runs out,btohqsg
But when I did PW we frequented the library to do work,btohqsg
Luckily now have google drive can do all at home,btohqsg
How are you so sure it would be exactly 2027?,btohqsg
There was google drive  but google docs is so lousy,btohqsg
Coz the old MF was MF15,btohqsg
26 stands for â€˜valid until 2026â€™,btohqsg
Oh MF15 was valid until 2016.,btohqsg
Coz the old MF which was MF15 was valid until 2016 exam,btohqsg
Just a theory but seems logical to me,btohqsg
Meanwhile the CIE one is MF19 which represents it start at 2019 Y1,btohqsg
Yea but u dun even use half the shit in MF26,btohqsg
Fucking funny sia half the pages are like for FM,btohqsg
Itâ€™s ok just memorise/familiarise with MF26 I dun like to waste my time referring everytime,btohqsg
This is when it gets scary,btohqsg
We didnâ€™t even do partial derivative yet ahaha,btohqsg
This is my assignment in undergraduate mathematics.Partial derivatives are super easy. Just let all other variables be constants then differentiate. Complex analysis is not easy. Even with double and triple  integrals when you only consider the reals you often have to change your coordinates because the region you are considering is on a sphere or a cylinder,btohqsg
Implicit differentiation is actually harder than doing partial differentiation.When you evaluate a double or triple integrals you also treat everything else as constant then integrate,btohqsg
Well  as I said  not my cup of tea.,btohqsg
Maybe I gonna be calculus master,btohqsg
I prefer group and graph theory. The proofs for graph theory are a bit weird when you first look at it but once you get used to it  it's quite normal.The issue with calculus and analysis is that I find it is very arbitrary -- and they do use this exact word frequently.,btohqsg
One of the interesting theorems in graph theory:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuratowski's_theorem,btohqsg
Analysis uses a lot of approximation,btohqsg
That's what makes it my worse nightmare,btohqsg
Shouldn't it be approximation uses a lot of analysis?,btohqsg
I guess it depends on what is meant by â€˜approximationâ€™,btohqsg
If itâ€™s approximation as in numerical methods  Iâ€™d agree,btohqsg
What I meant was approximation like  eg with some epsilon delta proofs for a given epsilon  we can choose a lot of deltas  as opposed to there being a single perfect delta,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” i guess i get what you mean (but ðŸ˜¬...),btohqsg
Sounds like taking a large samples of deltas,btohqsg
The epsilon Delta definition states that for all epsilon >0  THERE EXISTS delta such that...,btohqsg
Delta does not need to be unique,btohqsg
If you don't know  this is the definition of a limit,btohqsg
Even elliptical orbits are an approximation,btohqsg
Anyone got 2019 a math p1 and 2018 a math p1,btohqsg
There's also the divergence theorem and green's theorem,btohqsg
Divergence theorem is just Stoke's theorem applied to a scalar and 3D volume,btohqsg
Don't know and don't care. As long as I get good grades for an analysis course I'm happy. Because I hate those modules and do not wish to have anything to do with them in the future. Sorry.,btohqsg
I mean  thank you for letting me know. But I mean I would not care about it after taking such a module,btohqsg
Then why are you even taking the modules,btohqsg
Because it is compulsory for me  i.e. core modules,btohqsg
When it is optional then I simply avoid taking them,btohqsg
u nvr know when they will haunt u again,btohqsg
they are core mods for a reason,btohqsg
If they do  then I'll look at them in the future. If they don't  then I will not bother.It's not like I will suddenly forget everything,btohqsg
Clearly people like to chat more than studying,btohqsg
me and mochi gon panfry ur salmon brother,btohqsg
I will be eating salmon later,btohqsg
The meat of my friends tastes good,btohqsg
Hard sia the area under graph,btohqsg
Bruh I forgot how to integrate,btohqsg
ya lor I died on the speed,btohqsg
i was stuck at the kinematics part,btohqsg
Idk whether need to find k lol,btohqsg
I find all but never find where v is equal 0,btohqsg
U need to square both sides rite,btohqsg
Wouldnt they say constant to be found,btohqsg
It didnâ€™t say in terms of k so pretty sure need,btohqsg
Yeah and both d2y/dx2 is 8 right,btohqsg
But how u all explain the m,btohqsg
Need to square both sides rite,btohqsg
I completely forgot how to do trigo,btohqsg
ya sia  Both angle A and B are acute idk sia,btohqsg
I just use opp hyp and adj,btohqsg
And got 4 as the other side,btohqsg
d last qn was beautiful tho no cap,btohqsg
What was the acceleration question answer? :0,btohqsg
How to get the m thou,btohqsg
Then I deduce it cannot be negative 4/5 since B larger than A,btohqsg
I got 300 plus its wrong,btohqsg
I got 222? But it was 3sf,btohqsg
What is the bell curve gonna be,btohqsg
Hopefully a steep decline to hell,btohqsg
No not so soon  normally is one hr after paper,btohqsg
HOW TO DO THE SHADED AREA QN?,btohqsg
Find the area under the curve between A and B then minus the square/rectangle,btohqsg
How many marks was yhat again,btohqsg
The -root3/2 minus the curve then integrate,btohqsg
wlao i minus so many marks alrd,btohqsg
got like surd and pi inside,btohqsg
idk i havenâ€™t count but estimated like 10+ which is bad fr me la,btohqsg
My friends and i all got the same ans,btohqsg
Forgot the exact answer in pi but I remember in calculator it was 0.0 something,btohqsg
The m qn is d same as 2018,btohqsg
Thought the root 3 is somewhere on top or maybe I rmb wrongly,btohqsg
Did you sub your answer with a random value of x to see if itâ€™s the same as the given eqn,btohqsg
If so  u must throw  cannot keep.,btohqsg
I think I got a slightly different answer and when I sub back in got the exact same,btohqsg
were we supposed to find k,btohqsg
i left everyth in terms of k lmao dead,btohqsg
wlao that qn i fking dumb,btohqsg
U hv to use value of b,btohqsg
Wonder whatâ€™s the grade threshold for A1,btohqsg
why the 2nd part for q1 is emath?,btohqsg
LOL same I left the last 6 marks blank tho Iâ€™m confident of the rest of my ans,btohqsg
i was contemplating on e funct but the ans weird af,btohqsg
u also cld hv manually calculator,btohqsg
bruh i fcked up all my papers LMAO,btohqsg
HAHAHA AT FIRST I CALCULATE ONE BY ONE SIA,btohqsg
huh u alr took it issit,btohqsg
then like left 1 min i hurry cancel everyt then i do compound interest,btohqsg
i almost no time finish ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
My kinematics I messed up on accident,btohqsg
how do get tanA = 1/3 sia dead,btohqsg
wlao last qn i sudd forgot how to do trigo,btohqsg
Plus I have 30min to Chelsea shit,btohqsg
I got some reason forgot how to do those sort of trigo questions cos never revise hais,btohqsg
I could do all trigo but i decided to fuck my alpha beta marks,btohqsg
Whats ur ans for part b,btohqsg
Is b greater than a or smaller,btohqsg
But I managed to guess cos(A-B) is 4/5,btohqsg
U need sub in everything they give u,btohqsg
Shit if I say quadraple root 4 is instead of root 2 would marks be minus,btohqsg
gg la i got like A = 2/5 or smth,btohqsg
Iâ€™m guessing they might minus 1 :/,btohqsg
For Q1 if I left it as one for coefficient x^2 instead of making everything whole number should be ok right,btohqsg
Paper 2 should have the clt question,btohqsg
So should be upon around 92-95,btohqsg
You said 1/4+something for the area so isnâ€™t ur that one wrong,btohqsg
I roughly rmb getting 1/2 plus something with the fraction and pi,btohqsg
I forgot to change it to surds pls send help,btohqsg
Wait that one need modulus? When I enter everything inside the calculator I got a positive number,btohqsg
for the kinematics qn part b  if i found k but my distance is wrong then how many marks?,btohqsg
last q last part i tot is find B,btohqsg
Yo dis paper is only 44% apparently,btohqsg
Iâ€™m pretty sure paper 2 will be harder,btohqsg
Cause the first paper not too tough,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s d invite link to dis grp btw,btohqsg
for me I was able to do everything (not sure about my m answer) plus part of the trigo qn so if harder I might not be able to do more,btohqsg
anyone have pdf version of paper?,btohqsg
Humanities is it true that the grade threshold for A1 is very Low since a lot people donâ€™t tend to do very well for it?,btohqsg
I heard itâ€™s only 70 plus,btohqsg
2020 4E5N 4047 A Math P1.pdf,btohqsg
whatâ€™s the percentage for emath paper 1 & 2?,btohqsg
A math is not my tea,btohqsg
Minus 7 can say Bai to a1 already,btohqsg
If paper 2 is 100 then let's say common last topic was abt 10-7 marks,btohqsg
There was one year they just tested 5 marks on the clt in one of the math papers,btohqsg
Hi a math 60% is what,btohqsg
Paper 2 better score 80 plus alrd,btohqsg
Bell curve need how many marks for A1,btohqsg
Itâ€™s now bell curve itâ€™s moderation,btohqsg
? If its 90 I'll cry,btohqsg
