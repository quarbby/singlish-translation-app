Guys anyone encounter issue applying dbs card through their app?,btohqsg
Previously when I tried to apply Vantage  same issue. Went to the bank to apply personally  but was informed through mail I can't qualify. I figured it was due to the haircut so didn't qualify for the income.But now for visa altitude  same issue on the app.I would think if income sure meet I won't see this error.
