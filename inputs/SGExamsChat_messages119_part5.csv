I dunno about the other unis  but Oxbridge only recently made FM a requirement,btohqsg
FM is only one of the recognized subjects for most courses  you can use Physics or Chemistry in place of it,btohqsg
I just realised john and the other dude photo are opposites of each other,btohqsg
I've never heard of H2 FM being required,btohqsg
Wait i thought h3 was for scholarships or for meeting 4h2 req,btohqsg
We dont got * in sg though right,btohqsg
This is not the correct one,btohqsg
The correct one for SG is thishttps://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/singapore,btohqsg
"""Applicants should take relevant H3 subjects""",btohqsg
They have a page specifically for SG,btohqsg
Yeah  but it appears that many don't know about it,btohqsg
Well  the FM would be part of the 4H2s,btohqsg
But apparently H3 merit may count for a H2 A,btohqsg
Too bad the step exam is already over,btohqsg
Maybe Iâ€™ll try next year if__doesnâ€™t accept me,btohqsg
Well  I need TS to go to either uni anyway,btohqsg
The prestige doesnâ€™t seem worth the price tag,btohqsg
The content is made for FMaths students,btohqsg
If thats coming from you im worried how i would fare hahaha,btohqsg
Do they test out of syllabus?,btohqsg
I mean not much of a syllabus to follow,btohqsg
They state their syllabus  and they follow it,btohqsg
If you dont go oxbridge is it generally good to go for other uk unis,btohqsg
Or is it basically oxbridge vs nus/ntu for post a lvl choices,btohqsg
Usually I went to the study room at the CC though,btohqsg
Which uni do you go to*,btohqsg
