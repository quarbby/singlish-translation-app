Can i know what is the price of the key to collect For 3 room Bto?,btohqsg
You mean the price of the house or the balance you have to pay upon getting keys?,btohqsg
I have a hle letter already  am i able to cancel and reapply again?,btohqsg
If can  use which reason to be able to reapply immediately?,btohqsg
My recent pay higher than my feb one 😂,btohqsg
What stage are you at now,btohqsg
If it makes a difference to which your loan amount can't cover the balance you must pay then maybe have to call up HDB and ask,btohqsg
Like every $500 can loan $30k,btohqsg
Still waiting for my selection appointment,btohqsg
Ohh i see ... ok thank you 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Like example your loan quantum is 400k and have to pay balance of 100k  you would like to minimise the loan as you have 150k  does not matter if your current pay is higher than the previous time you applied for HLE,btohqsg
others  please correct me if I am wrong thanks,btohqsg
Unless you want to take the max loan,btohqsg
In order to maximise the interest returns using cash/CPF,btohqsg
Actually my partner advised me if can  don use cash for it . Just buy using loan & cpf.,btohqsg
1. use cash for home loan while accumulating OA+minimise AI of 2.5%-can't save up2. use OA for home loan while topping up SA+accumulating 1.5% of interest-can't save up3. use OA for home loan+save up-accumulating 2.5% of AIunless can use cash to generate >2.5% of interest  accumulate CPFOA,btohqsg
Yes the freedom of liquid cash,btohqsg
Will try to ask hdb tmr 🤔,btohqsg
So is it better to max the 25yrs loan or take a loan with shorter loan term?,btohqsg
if your cash is able to generate higher than 2.5-3% returns than CPFOA then maximise the loan tenure using CPF,btohqsg
otherwise use cash lor but you won't be able to save up unless you are a high earner,btohqsg
anybody know if example i have a 5room hdb now  can i ballot 5 room bto and sell mine when TOP?,btohqsg
can sell 2 months before your new house TOP  to have a buffer of 8 months to compare the offer made by the potential buyers,btohqsg
plus got the money to pay the balance which is the proceeds of the house upon getting keys unless you have sufficient lah,btohqsg
can 5 room to 5 room ah?,btohqsg
cos i always tot only can upgrade,btohqsg
you mean HDB disallows one to ballot the same size of flat?,btohqsg
You just can’t downgrade that’s all iirc,btohqsg
but my mum has chosen a 2r flexi via SBF  she owns a 4r currently,btohqsg
Lol no reason to have such rule,btohqsg
At which stage now for not flat at length -garden vales,btohqsg
If you sell your first flat after you have received the keys to your second one  then the resale levy is deducted from the sale proceeds. Any shortfall will have to be paid in cash. If you sell your flat first  then you need to pay the resale levy in cash before you’re allowed to take possession of your second flat.,btohqsg
for 30yo your ERS by 55yo would be $584k,btohqsg

what about transferring from your SA to RA of your loved one? can't find any info  read can top from personal CPF but never stated from which account,btohqsg
