Hi  is there any group for Bishan Ridges?,btohqsg
Hi! Is there any group for Bishan Towers? Thank you!,btohqsg
Anybody got tampines greenglade group chat?,btohqsg
Hi  is there any group for JurongWest Jewel?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm wondering  is it good to sell my resale 5 room flat in Elias and get a BTO in non matured area?,btohqsg
Because I think our flat is too big for 3 ladies after my dad passed away 2 months ago.,btohqsg
you don't need to sell until within 6 months after key collection for the BTO.,btohqsg
yeap i read  hopefully can sell at a good price because bto is kinda costly,btohqsg
i think we can't get 4 rooms since they prioritize 1st timer,btohqsg
Well it depends on where you pick... Non matured estate you need to balance between your budget for the BTO (taking into account the downpayment and buyer stamp duty fees) and the subsequent costs  as well as reno cost and moving cost.,btohqsg
yeap i'm looking out for tampines and pasir ris,btohqsg
oh but those areas are matured estates though. Doesn't seem to fit in your original question of BTO in non matured area...,btohqsg
my friend complained to me that her apartment walls are too thin in BTO flat,btohqsg
yeap  can just ballot and try but i doubt we can get it,btohqsg
got ballot means got hope üòÅ Btw  if you're balloting under MCPS  then it might be best to add in your youngest as the essential occupier. Hopefully young enough that when the flat reaches MOP  your youngest will have ample time to BTO herself.,btohqsg
i'm the youngest haha  both my big sis and i will be buying the house and add my mom as occupier,btohqsg
we are second timer because our mom previously used up the grant 2 times üò≠,btohqsg
but both my sis and i haven't even purchase any HDB flats before,btohqsg
I see... Then maybe can try appealing to HDB to see if they willing to give yall first timer priority. No harm trying to appeal.,btohqsg
oh it's possible? how to? need to get a BTO first?,btohqsg
in getting a bto or grant?,btohqsg
Try from second timer to first timer ba. At least that will give you more allocation percentage.,btohqsg
Any one knows how to generate the ballot number? Is it based on the registration time/queue number or not?,btohqsg
Only HDB know. But unlikely based on time cause they have to also factor in priority scheme allocation and they mentioned that it is not based on fastest fingers before.,btohqsg
Expect every one to help and give in to her,btohqsg
Feb 2023 bto started already? Today last day of feb liao,btohqsg

When do I need to sell my current 5i room at Bishan as I need the money to pay for the new downsize bto in non matured estate? Will they give me keys for me to start reno whilst I look for buyer?,btohqsg
You can sell anytime. Just have to complete the sale by 6 months after key collection for the new BTO.If cannot then gotta appeal lor,btohqsg
I thought that I need to sell before key can be collected because have to pay for new flat. Am I wrong?,btohqsg
Grace  HDB is not so heartless to leave u homeless one,btohqsg
Hi Vin great to know that. üëç,btohqsg
That means we can take the key first and delay downpayment to after 6 months of key collection after sold our house?,btohqsg
No. You still need to pay for the downpayment according to the BTO timeline.Option fee during first appointmentDownpayment of 10% (assuming both owners are above 30) during second appointment  buyer stamp duty  HDB conveyancing feesDownpayment of remaining 10%  lease in escrow  survey fees  HPS  fire insurance,btohqsg
Ok thanks  means need to prepare 20% before key collection if i decided to sell my house within 6 months after key collection. Thanks!,btohqsg
must get HLE letter before BTO application?,btohqsg
no need. HDB will inform u if needed,btohqsg
You‚Äôre right if you‚Äôre in this situation where you can‚Äôt loan anymore due to age  and you need the funds from existing property to fund the new BTO  you will  need to fully paid before you can collect keys.,btohqsg
