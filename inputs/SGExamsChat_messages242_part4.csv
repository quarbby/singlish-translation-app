Jewel was just eerie to look at,btohqsg

The police do  if you come Jewel,btohqsg
Explore sungei tengah. I like to go there alone,btohqsg
Then a lot of fish shops,btohqsg
The house is a closed area,btohqsg
Just why would you torture me like that,btohqsg
ok heading for you house right now,btohqsg
Why would you hurt my people,btohqsg
Good for your brain I heard,btohqsg

Hi I’m Emath is not my passion,btohqsg
wah we shld create an iggy club,btohqsg
hi guys here to ask about smth so like my sch got send us email about june internship to the s3s (which is my batch) so i’m thinking whether to sign up or not. my concern is that i may want to use june hol and like chill and hopefully catch up on some hobbies and revise  but then internship seems to be a good opportunity to learn irl life skill and stuff. not sure which to choose  what do u guys think?,btohqsg
what would be the priority for you? is it possible for you to intern and also chill/study after work hours?,btohqsg
intern isnt easy to get in this time period so you should take the chance,btohqsg
personally for me intern is more impt ah,btohqsg
i think possible  tho i don’t know the exact schedule of the internship cos i havent like sign up w them yet,btohqsg
if there are no impt exams coming up soon  then studying definitely takes a back seat,btohqsg
intern experience can be q eye opening at sec 3,btohqsg
yall got go intern b4? can share exp haha,btohqsg
go and see if they interest u i guess,btohqsg
for me is you mostly get thrown into the deep end  learn how to do things by yourself  google is your best friend,btohqsg
but probably sec 3 they probably wont expect too much,btohqsg
what kind of intern did u do?,btohqsg
more for you to shadow and learn,btohqsg
Which is a good thing ah  learn the more practical side of the job responsibilities,btohqsg
teaching intern and other jobs and stuff,btohqsg
depends la  shadow also can learn a lot if u damn proactive,btohqsg
i heard usually younger people do work shadow cos its shorter period,btohqsg
But u can personally extend it if u can negotiate with ur employer/supervisor,btohqsg
how i did it was to do the small tasks really well and slowly gain trust from supervisor then u get big tasks,btohqsg
Sec 3 hard to get internship wihout connections ah  so shadowing still ok i suppose,btohqsg
ya... only the top sec schs get intern opportunities,btohqsg
can also  just sec 3 a bit the hard,btohqsg
write a damn good cover letter,btohqsg
cold emails worked q well for me,btohqsg
@sovietseagullwell wtv the case  maybe u wanna inquire more details abt the internship at the organisations u eyeing for,btohqsg
they say intern so probably is,btohqsg
i think  research is one of the hardest roles lol,btohqsg
how did the person get in lol,btohqsg
