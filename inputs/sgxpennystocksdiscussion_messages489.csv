Singtel rebuffs energy player's offers for its Thai telecoms investmentshttps://ift.tt/3C6DJIjJuly 30  2021 at 06:31PM,btohqsg
This also interesting.Thank you so Much sharing üôèüòä,btohqsg
Monday see whether the short will cover or not,btohqsg
Moya Asia  I have tried many rounds to time the break out play but it have failed so many times.I hope this time is for real. With upcoming results (profitable as they have given heads up) . Hope this is the catalyst for the break out.If failed breakout and they decide to flush  need to careful also,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the advice.I just interested their company (water treatment business)Will take note see what the outcome first before invest.,btohqsg
Results swee. Need analyst to re rate for share price to rocket,btohqsg
This counter is funny.The more orders he received the more the share price will drop,btohqsg
Because stock price was never determined directly by news,btohqsg
It's the reaction to the news,btohqsg
Yea shortists very strong in yzj,btohqsg
Can you trust them not to take profit ?,btohqsg
And not to pawn other sinkie ?,btohqsg
In US   more funds and more greed bah,btohqsg
Might make a big move soon tho,btohqsg
Really don‚Äôt know how to invest in STIGood results share price dropsGot more book orders share price dropsReally ar can only buy good dividend stocks in STI suay,btohqsg
No wonder the stereotype come about... All the auntie uncle buy dividend stock only,btohqsg
But TA on yzj is damm painful.. need to put on weekly scale,btohqsg
Or else cannot see any meaningful movement,btohqsg
You maybe wrong  many uncle auntie buy based on tips and follow blindly,btohqsg
Really ah... Power. Really understand the hearts of auntie and uncles,btohqsg
Usually in US   even with YZJ float size.. can move quite a bit one weekly,btohqsg
Yes open . Prices will be very stable,btohqsg
Many of them holding counters with huge loss but they don‚Äôt know sell,btohqsg
Market always say when many uncle untie goes into stock market you better run away,btohqsg
I think the BB buy low sell few pips  short it down from high cover low rinse and repeat maybe  same as moya BBs,btohqsg
I find penny counters more n more difficult to trade ...,btohqsg
Maybe ah.. quite a fail safe way for them to rinse and repeat,btohqsg
Ya can tire out retailers rinse them out also  when rly want to breakout easier to pull higher and distribute back to retailers,btohqsg
@Desmondsgcan u tell us trading blue chip vs penny experience?,btohqsg
Ya lor BB all like park funds in strong FA companies now,btohqsg
Companies with Strong FA also kenna hiaz. Dunno is SG bb brutal or retailers fault,btohqsg
All my reits and banks got good capital gain and receive dividend at the same time,btohqsg
Some blue chips if buy low bo Jiak one,btohqsg
Reits give good dividend up  meanwhile penny like gke samudera give dividend kena whack,btohqsg
Before penny I was play a few reits n SATS nia...not so stressful n really can see profit....just boring,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt shake out by BBThey want to collect cheapKnn BB,btohqsg
I not vested yet but looking for good ep in  knn BBs sure kill contra chasers first then pump,btohqsg
Now mostly high already  esp the banks,btohqsg
That time the dividen supper good,btohqsg
Ya CB period I think a lot made money....,btohqsg
I love sg bank stock..buy at covid now you harvest man..,btohqsg
For example ISDN BB shake out retailers the share price from 0.8 to 0.55.My friend paper loss more than 20K  luckily he got holding power u turn from loss to profit now,btohqsg
Not easy because nobody when was the bottom,btohqsg
Wa CB time buy banks...now shiok man,btohqsg
Coz I love blue chips never die..,btohqsg
My paper loss 2k plus now turn profit,btohqsg
You managed to buy during CB?,btohqsg
Yup! First I go OCBC once drop.. then follow buy UOB n DBS,btohqsg
Wonder why many investors dunno to set stop loss,btohqsg
We are not lucky we know what is the company doing and FA.We confident to hold,btohqsg
Ya good investors like u will know what to do,btohqsg
I feel that some stock long term  if you can tahan,btohqsg
If you asked me to hold high debts and loss making companies I never buy,btohqsg
True. That is why now I‚Äôm at -$30k but still holding,btohqsg
And also good companies can be bad investment if you buy them at wrong time  high price,btohqsg
Anyway for those who lose chor  or stuckist  or newbie kenna jialat from the market for the past 1 week....here is a very good advice from Master Furion......,btohqsg
Ya there‚Äôs only so much hypeAfter hype is hopeHope turn to diminished hopesThen despairThen lost what to doAsk for opinions. One hand hope someone say good things to justify holding on because taking the loss too painfulAnd also see if got fellow stuckist. Not sure why but it feels better to have comrades in this caseAt any price level nobody can advise what to do. If someone ask u cut and Monday u sold 20 centFor whatever reason it come up to 21 cent the ouch and pain and blame game...I have been victims of similar scenarios countless times. Can clearly understand the emotional rollercoaster. Not proud of it but part of learning experienceA fellow forummer many years ago once said it bestTreat your money as soldiers and those in stuck counters are POWs. Chiong to save them may lose some soldiers but at least u have army to fight next battleWhat‚Äôs the point of keeping them alive if they can‚Äôt fight for u. U have no idea what‚Äôs happening behind enemy lines. They may be massacred and all u got are bodies eventuallyFor whatever reason they might escape and bring some POWs back. Best case scenariosHow many rambos do u have,btohqsg
Sometimes I lure by tips also after I see some pennies shot up 100% but I stick to my discipline,btohqsg
My Dairy farm now big paper loss üòÇ,btohqsg

Miss earnings expectationsWhen the PE too high when miss earning expectations the price will dump,btohqsg

People paid high PE expect it grow higher if miss than dump,btohqsg
I bought unit trust using CPF because I supported my ex staff when he switched to insuranceAfter 12 years I still loss 1k I cut,btohqsg
I opened CPFIS account just in case market big crash  I use CPF to buy shares. But so far never use,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt trust unit trust now,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know about unit trust.Don‚Äôt have dividend,btohqsg
Bo dividend.. They help u reinvest it,btohqsg
Last time I used cash to buy unit trust from a friend too. After 5 years just managed to breakeven  I quickly let go,btohqsg
Few good counters can huat liao,btohqsg
Unit trust got some hidden fees. I understand the agent earn recurring fees every year too  cutting into our profits,btohqsg
Other than the initial bid offer spread,btohqsg
You paid trust manager about 2~2.5% every year be it the investment make or loss money.sohai feed the trust manager fat,btohqsg
That‚Äôs y more than 90% cpf members loss money in unit trust,btohqsg
Where is young boss? Go drive Grab?,btohqsg

Now the price a bit high already,btohqsg

Unit trust it depends what price you enter and which unit trust you bought,btohqsg
"US Vice President Kamala Harris to visit Singapore and Vietnam next month to strengthen ties with ""two critical Indo-Pacific partners"": White Househttps://cna.asia/3j66dJb",btohqsg
Unit trust is quite safe if you buy the right want .. and the price too .,btohqsg
So far unit trusts seldom close down or delisted all this ..,btohqsg

Unit trust you also expert ah,btohqsg
Lucky boy buy everything also earn,btohqsg
Stock only to 1 company .. unit trusts is diversified .,btohqsg
Buy s n p 500 sua,btohqsg
I have some unit trust .. the rest is my mother want,btohqsg
Diversified your headYou know what they invested?How to sustain to pay trust manager 2~2.5% every year?,btohqsg
"Estate is ""all the money and property owned by a particular person  especially at death""",btohqsg
Since when we need to pay the fund manager 2 to 2.5 percent every year ? Did you get wrong idea Bo ?,btohqsg
It is absorbed into the fund price,btohqsg
I never pay anything ? I only pay 1 time commission 1.5 percent only .. and I hold for 6 year Liao .. every months day good dividend .. and capital gain .. with right entry price,btohqsg
I bought through a financial planner using don't know what platform  so still got platform charges and his admin charges  he told me,btohqsg
No .. I bought through bank only .. and some I bought my self .. save some commission fee .. haha,btohqsg
Sure must pay fund manager ...need to hope your investment grow faster than the manager fee lor,btohqsg
Bank charge me 1.5 percent comission base on the amount we invest .. that it .. you hold 10 year sell also no commission involved,btohqsg
Like syfe also.. Got draw commission,btohqsg
No .. I use posb savings app account inside also can buy .. .. now tiger app inside also can buy unit trust .. so good can save alot of commission,btohqsg
There is  but is absorbed into the fund prices. As your fund is performing well  you still have profit after less out the management fee,btohqsg
Pay fund manager is a yes .. but so far my mother and I hold the unit trust more than 6 year Liao .. every Month take 5 to 6 percent dividend .,btohqsg
Should be a percentage of the investment amount,btohqsg
No bro .. my mother bought 500k of unit trust .. comission not much too .. 1.5 percent,btohqsg
The banker can adjust the comm rate. So for big amount  they charge lesser,btohqsg
This is my mother and mine portfolio for unit trust,btohqsg
Every mth 5-6% knn yr yield is 72%,btohqsg
Wait .. I make mistake .. haha  is yearly 5 to 6 percent,btohqsg
72% really no need work liao,btohqsg
Invest $1Mil every year take back 720k,btohqsg
My mother 500k in unit trust she every month take about $2500 to $2800 average .. cos got up and down and some is fix,btohqsg

Time to borrow money hoot stocks,btohqsg
The banker is my client he charge me 1.5 percent only,btohqsg
Ya .for her retirement loh ..,btohqsg
Ya.. Mapletree family mostly more than 100% capital gain,btohqsg
So most investors shares are free,btohqsg
Cos stock market risk is higher than unit trust ..,btohqsg
When you compare the risk ... Bond and unit trust and share ..,btohqsg
The script free one.. Jin shiok,btohqsg
I bought unit trust before they paid me every month 9hundreds plus but principal value drop every year,btohqsg
True.. But track record is good more than 10yrs.. So is deem a good management,btohqsg
