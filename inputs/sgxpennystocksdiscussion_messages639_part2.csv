✈️Pika World Update – 19 April 2020✈️⌛️Equity Markets Directionless⏰It was a market of see-saw on Monday as investors aimed for a direction but none to be found. Equity markets swing from losses to gains as market participants made short term bets on stocks given the volatile environment as latest news roll points to different directions on development of the Ukraine war as well as outlook of inflation  which we will take a deeper dive in this update.🧨Are we reaching peak inflation?🗽The latest CPI data shows a promising sign that inflation is peaking. As with all arguments  analysts are pointing to another isle of view.Investors are considering the PPI data as perhaps more crucial than the CPI. After all  the March PPI had risen by 11.2% compared to a year ago  which is worst off than the CPI reading.Indeed as one Citi economist pointed out  the PPI was not a reliable predictor of CPI before the pandemic began. Yet  it has become a more accurate indicator with such erratic development over the past year.🥔PPI data showed strong inflation🥦Let's consider the main staple of food  vegetables  which rose 82% in price in March from a year ago. The same applied to grains that had grown 40%. Meat and fish categories also jumped around 23% compared to March 2021. The list goes on  and so is energy too.Nonetheless  the Core CPI  which the Fed focuses on  had stripped out these categories in their consideration. Hence  saying that inflation peaked appeared to be a flawed argument.⚖️Ukraine War building high food and energy prices🚘Indeed  given the importance of fertilisers  oil  and crops derived from the region  the war is expected to push prices further and lead to food comprising an ever-larger component of consumers' expenditure  which tends to lift inflation expectations.Analysts are calling for investors to be mentally prepared for a renewed burst of inflation in the coming months as commodity price hike risk persists.📉Profit margin risk💰So far  companies have held on to their fat profit margin. Nonetheless  Pika World does not see this as a permanent feature  given that corporations do not have infinite pricing power.The surge in producer prices should prompt management to convey possible profit margin pressure in the coming quarter as the outlook for the second half of the year. The equity market will face a stricter period ahead if this is true.It is 19 April  Tuesday  6.40 am in Singapore and 6.40 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a safe trading week ahead!,btohqsg
