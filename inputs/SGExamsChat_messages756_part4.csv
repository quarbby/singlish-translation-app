He's always like that it ain't the first time,btohqsg
Just gotta wait for him to resign or die,btohqsg
It’s not that they can be reappointed for a 2nd term,btohqsg
Well if you do so then technically a senate can wait out the period,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately. But it’s quite funny that George hw bush chose a liberal justice and an ultra conservative justice,btohqsg
It was a compromise most likely,btohqsg
Clarence Thomas’ nomination was barely confirmed by the senate  it was 53-47 iirc,btohqsg
The other justice George hw bush nominated got over 90,btohqsg
If I don't agree with the certain justice  I can just remove em after 10 years,btohqsg
No I mean  one single term  and that’s it. Once they’ve been appointed after 10 years they have to step down regardless of whether the incumbent president wants them to continue or not,btohqsg
Could also be more or less than 10 years  but 10 sounds reasonable to me,btohqsg
If u did so then a senate in power can just elect who they want for the entire court,btohqsg
Even if u staggered em usually Senate's have some form of swing and remain for about a decade,btohqsg
Isn’t that what’s alr happening anyway? Just that the justices usually serve until they’re very old and retire or just die,btohqsg
And since its a decade it would not be very reflective of the current thinking too,btohqsg
Oh I mean if we start it now,btohqsg
Doesn’t have to be such that all at once,btohqsg
Could be one justice slot per year,btohqsg
Aiya honestly best is that the president or congress doesn’t get to pick scotus justices,btohqsg
I mean the people shouldn't pick a justice too,btohqsg
I don’t get why they have elections for state courts  but honestly  having elections for scotus justices might be better than the incumbent president nominating them,btohqsg
For state courts those are closed elections,btohqsg
Meaning the public doesn't vote for em it's like a group of legislatures or smth,btohqsg
But is that what you meant when you were referring to state court elections,btohqsg
?? I mean for some states its just direct nominated by the governor,btohqsg
Oh I thought it wasn’t voted by their state legislature  like the public gets to vote on the Attorney General,btohqsg
Idk a lot about this part,btohqsg
In some states yes but those are in the minority for direct voting,btohqsg
Then what do you mean by this tho? I just meant that the president shouldn’t be deciding on the nominations at least.,btohqsg
Also an Attorney General is still beholden to the courts with the judge as meditator,btohqsg
I just meant there isn't any alternative as well.,btohqsg
I have to research more about the US judicial system,btohqsg
Meanwhile trump who lost “bigly” did the exact opposite and caused so much chaos,btohqsg
guys i just realise..the last hr ive been plucking at the side of my laptop not realising that it is..i just looked and realise im plucking off the plastic,btohqsg
all of yall need to play just shapes and beats,btohqsg

"""sit in the corner and reflect""",btohqsg
