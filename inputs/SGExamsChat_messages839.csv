boeing has been a lil messed up for awhile,btohqsg
company infrastructure and management problems due to internal conflicts relating to workplace drama ( including and not excluding-- insubordination  power struggles  backstabbing  petty arguing  misunderstandings  complaining  issues with managing emotional in and out of different times  gossiping  ostracizing aka cliques etc,btohqsg
a lot of companies  not just boeing have issues slowly brought back to the public's eye or the attention of the crowd,btohqsg
I hate how SQ is forced to keep these old planes because Boeing is dragging their asses with the 777X,btohqsg
at the same time I think good to not put all your eggs in one basket bah,btohqsg
as much as idl boeing and their bs,btohqsg
btr to have half a fleet of planes than to have nothing when one plane goes bonk,btohqsg
i mean i do like the max but idg why wasnt A321neo a option fot SQ,btohqsg
ya same I wldve much preferred going w the A320 neo family  considering Scoot already has A320s,btohqsg
I rly dun get why they went for the max,btohqsg
like you have the A321LR and A321XLR variant,btohqsg
I shall continue flying my A320neo on msfs and pretend that sq has them,btohqsg
and 787-10 for regionals is just...,btohqsg
I mean I guess I get 787s  it's like in between A350s and A320/B737 in terms of capacity  but with the range of (p much) an a350,btohqsg
but I think partially it's also due to being able to expand fleet faster ig,btohqsg
queueing for the a350 vs getting both a350+787 at the same time,btohqsg
It generally flies to SFO from Changi  plus the Dreamliners have a nice ride,btohqsg
Guys any last minute tips on chrysalids,btohqsg
There is this course at RP which has 26 cut-off point and lets say i have 20 points but i dont have the relevant subjects can i still appeal for dae or is it a waste of time?,btohqsg
what school is it? cause 26 sounds like its school of infocomn,btohqsg
Actly im curious wats the starting time like for those studying in poly,btohqsg
shouldn't it be based on the lecturer's schedule?,btohqsg
depends whether your lecturer works in multiple colleges/university?Or is it those industrial lecturers  who only can come work after 5pm?,btohqsg
that's for the case in malaysia lah. singkie. not sure this thing is common.,btohqsg
specifically for rp tho its 8:30-9:45 starting time dependent on yr you are from,btohqsg
if the cut off point is more than your estimated aggregate points with ELMAB3 or L1R4  you can still try to appeal even if you don't meet the MER (minimum entry requirements) for relevant subjects needed for the course you're looking at,btohqsg
ngl i don't think poly  ite  uni timetables in class is as straightforward as pri  sec sch & jc,btohqsg
but should be relatively easy to remember with a copy of the schedules you have,btohqsg
uni isn't even on the same level as far as scheduling goes,btohqsg
especially since it's usually repetitive order time,btohqsg
sometimes  there will also be last minute changes to the start of certain modular lessons or lecture timings,btohqsg
which won't always be known to students,btohqsg
rp is starting to do that now  doing last minute shcedule shift with no announcements until the very day itself..,btohqsg
to get my final diploma  i just have two ESE's for two mods  thats it,btohqsg
the other 2 are pass/fail mods where both have 70% of lessons are home based,btohqsg
rp is really changing up how they run their classes,btohqsg
at least you're near the end,btohqsg
the two mods legit go and waste time,btohqsg
one is safety management...literally listening to safety breifings every lesson for 1hr+,btohqsg
My classes tend to be scheduled all over the place in uni,btohqsg
I have a strict rule in uni  any class that starts before 12pm does not exist to me,btohqsg
then my body will be there but my soul wouldnt,btohqsg
My 8am to 12pm Organic Chem Lab begs to differ🤧,btohqsg
I fully agree with this though,btohqsg
hi guys what week of November does olevels usually end 😔 my parents are booking flights for next year soon and im scared it’ll clash with my o’s,btohqsg

Does anyone have this year 2023 NA MATH PAPER 1 and Paper 2?,btohqsg
Guys why is the ans sheets so different,btohqsg
Which ans is correct and why?,btohqsg
usually in cases like this  it's possible to have more than one correct answer to the question when meeting the requirements needed to certain concepts of a subject,btohqsg
"unless it's a ""choose one  correct answer* type of qns with hidden traps",btohqsg
Makes sense but this deliberately said the other one was wrong,btohqsg
probably a case of not answering with unorthodox formats that isn't officially recognized by taught syllabus,btohqsg
Anyways ask in the o level chat u prolly can get faster response thr,btohqsg
Why must the positive side be facing away from the switch tho,btohqsg
if the current flow of a diagram is different then obviously it'll affect the whole set-up even if it's drawn the same as the correct answer,btohqsg
ya i know but i don't understand how exam papers and answers are leaked right after they end,btohqsg
It's not abt the switch it's more of just ur direction of current must be consistent,btohqsg
Cus tution centres will take the paper and memorise the questions,btohqsg
i understand this concept but not of those who leak the entire batch of school papers and in extreme cases  national/international exams,btohqsg
the other question was way easier for me,btohqsg
starting time depends on ur lecturer availability and sch allocated timing fr u. fr prev sem  lessons started frm 8-10am. fr this sem  lessons starts frm 9am to 2pm,btohqsg
Typical student 😂I used to go for classes in sec school without text booksMy bag was the lightest in class but also missing Alot of assignments,btohqsg
can be frm 10am to 6pm… some days   u can have a 2h-4h class. fr np  we have a one day no lessons every week unless there is replacement class,btohqsg
Right now as a yr3 in rp  I got 2 days of no lessons,btohqsg
I went to sec. school just to do / discuss homework from tuition classes.Because tuition class lectures > school lectures.And Malaysia Sec. School are mostly quite bad  since teachers are somewhat underpaid  so not much resources  and teachers still teaches on whiteboard or dry talk without reference to the gov. textbooks . 🙈,btohqsg
Helloo anyone know any jobs good for students with decent/high pay,btohqsg
"what is ""decent pay"" in Singapore means now for Singaporeans?",btohqsg
i am guessing like 10 plus?,btohqsg
last time I remember someone posted about@sgIntership@sgCareers?,btohqsg
Not sure how applicable is all this:@sgCareers- Where careers start!@sgTechCareers- Be part of the next big thing!@sgInternship- Learning on the job!@sgQuickJobs- Quick moolahs into your pocket!@sgAirfarePromos- Fly cheap anywhere!@sgWhereTo- Ideas on WhereTo go!@sgFoodies- We live for food!@sgAskEveryone- Ask and learn what the rest thinks!,btohqsg
If youre young and physically capable and dont mind being tired  banquet jobs are usually decent and fast money,btohqsg
i feel crazy whenever i see a part time banquet job recruitments that say $15-$17/hr but it's based on your luck with how well you find  get and work with certain jobs,btohqsg
i still work banquet every now and then when im free and yeah its not terrible i guess  somedays you're unlucky to deal with a wedding but somedays its a reception etc,btohqsg
depends on one's ability and limits of working in a jobfor all u know  ppl want money but can't with those high paying part time jobs like banquet because of the high intensity and instructions you need to pay attention to  in one go,btohqsg
but sg banquet jobs still ok la,btohqsg
idt anything can compare with your most recent experience,btohqsg
Uhm.... yeah we dont talk about that,btohqsg
On the brightside i was paid to do nothing....not by choice,btohqsg
that's like the basic pay 20 years ago  when I was just helping to count the number of cars turning at a junction every 15 min interval.,btohqsg
That's really low  I'm sure there are jobs that pay better than that,btohqsg
I think should have people automated car counting by now I guess 😂 using computer vision,btohqsg

tele i suggest u stay far far away,btohqsg
alot of those jobs are pretty sketchy,btohqsg
ya most of them are fast cash and illegal,btohqsg
btw talking bout jobs  anyone here work part time in muji b4?,btohqsg

Damn liddat also have one ah,btohqsg
Wah the reviews are pretty bad on iOS app store man,btohqsg
Alr i’ll try it out after os thanks,btohqsg
aside from those more illegal crimes  there are jobs being advertised on tele that go against MOM (ministry of manpower) regulations like hiring underaged employees without declaring  deploying filthy ways of marketing in the job scope like convincing someone to pay one box of ice cream worth $16 over dollars for some unknown brand and tricking people to pay more than whatever they agreed to pay,btohqsg
since when has it not been,btohqsg
iirc there was another system like leomatch before such a matchmaking on telegram became popular,btohqsg
i never liked leomatch from day 1 for how eerily similar the experience was to using dating apps,btohqsg
i once saw primary school aged users on leomatch,btohqsg

as in you're still deferring for further studies,btohqsg
today's society has no humanity or normalcy left,btohqsg
nah because kids be identifying as furries and changing their races,btohqsg
that is so weird.. like I'm okay with trans & gays but CHANGING RACES?,btohqsg
idk why are people turning actual issues to stuff like rcta,btohqsg
how do I even talk to them,btohqsg
but ok  a lot of concept with stuff like therians (anthropology and liking furriee )  vegan & lgbqt aren't inherently badi admit that sometimes it gets illogically unsound but it's usually the same group of people that make such stuff seem like it's seen in a bad light,btohqsg
Vegan and lgbtq is normal but acting like an animal is just plain weird tbh,btohqsg
have u heard of baby space,btohqsg
baby space are those ppl who are older but love to imitate being younger than their actual age (usually children or babies),btohqsg
it's not childish immaturity at the point,btohqsg
baby space / little spacethe feeling you sink into when you're feeling safe  loved and childlike.,btohqsg
Idk if we should consider everything like a race 😭,btohqsg
but if I see a furry in singapore I would literally RUN.,btohqsg
i would rather mix with therians compared to those littles,btohqsg
Vegans and lgbtq is fine but other than that I don't see a need of more identities and stuff,btohqsg
ok  this one i definitely agree,btohqsg
Yeah it does but not everything must be a race ah,btohqsg
the rest are just got mental health problem,btohqsg
Uhhh not really? But like behavioural related issues?,btohqsg
"no way someone looks at themselves in the mirror and thinks ""I wanna be a cat and use a litterbox""",btohqsg
"or ""hm.. I think I wanna be oli London and be Korean""",btohqsg
because neodivergence got so popular at one point where everyone just begun making their own funny pronouns like k/y/s and indirectly snarky remarks about these same group they're using clout fot,btohqsg
Oli London is the original RCTA 😍,btohqsg
Honestly idk how this whole thing works but everything must have limits ah,btohqsg
I don't get anything abt pronouns just use he/him or she/her or they/them,btohqsg
if you don't get it  you don't have to hate it either,btohqsg
like there is no way I'm gonna call you xi/xe/xer,btohqsg
or like make nasty remarks  no?,btohqsg
It's not bad to explore identity but I think as humans we should be able to draw a line with what we are exploring to be,btohqsg
nah I keep to myself but I find it weird tbh..,btohqsg
there needs to be a fine line to be drawn,btohqsg
maybe I'm traditional like that but yeah..,btohqsg
ok to be fair  there's no way anything aside from he/him  they/them  she/her will be normalized,btohqsg
I mean yeah but let's be a bit professional while talking about sensitive topics like this yeah?,btohqsg
like if I guy wants to use she/her fine..,btohqsg
just think of those xi/xe/xer as other they/them pronouns,btohqsg
i give up with this topic,btohqsg
Only if ur trans and the pronouns are all linked to lgbtq,btohqsg
lemme go back to my chinese romance novels,btohqsg
AHAHAHA don't worry this topic is truly heavy to dissect,btohqsg
leomatch used to be great until the yubo people infiltrated,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAHA i went a long way knowing that you can't ensure everyone understand the realistic issue of somethingor like be on the same page realistically speaking,btohqsg
everyone worries about this and then no one actually sees people like this irl,btohqsg
"there is no ""mental health crisis""",btohqsg
its just the benefit of an online space allowing you to get away with less acceptable things,btohqsg
98% of this is ragebait lol,btohqsg
like it took me SO LONG to realise it,btohqsg
I am more sensitive of this issue cause I have friends who are lgbtq and we openly talk about these issues. It took me a long time to understand their perspectives and I truly agree with u,btohqsg
people have never fought for such rights,btohqsg
twitter and the pandemic has damaged everyones media literacy,btohqsg
man sad to realize that ragebait is another form of clout in this era,btohqsg
its so fucking funny sometimes icl,btohqsg
have yall seen the olivia shot glass one,btohqsg
actually its not just US political issues but they're the main thing you think of when you hear about craziness in politics,btohqsg
i always laugh at people trying to use discord text on tele,btohqsg

i thought only can follow mother/father or legal guardian?,btohqsg

getting driver's license is also 18,btohqsg
"lookup the term ""transabled""  that is something america particulaly has enabled",btohqsg

Hmm u can change ur name to ur mom's one? I am not sure on how it works,btohqsg
oh I'm changing to maybe a white last name,btohqsg
this seriously should not be normalised,btohqsg
this term is also backed by a medical condition called Body integrity dysphoria/disorder,btohqsg
Crazy but I somewhat understand their point of view,btohqsg
😭 this isn't normal why is this acceptable,btohqsg
No clue but everyone is generalising everything,btohqsg
im gay but this is so weird..,btohqsg
😭😭 please get these people some help,btohqsg
this is not okay to RCTA  be a therian or amputating yourself to be 'Transabled',btohqsg

"According to the brother  his sister would enter his room sometime between 10pm or 11pm until 4am. This was corroborated by another sibling  who shared a bedroom with the brother.This sibling testified that the sister would ""choose the wrong timing to clean the room"" when she did not stay in that room.She used to enter at 9pm but changed this to 11pm  and she ""may come back in the middle of the night to clean and clean until the wee hours of the night"" before going back to her own residence at 3am or 6am.The sister did not dispute that she had gone into her brother's room to clean it at night.When asked by the court why she felt the need to do so  the woman said: ""Because I need to work  my dear.""She explained: ""I need work  my own schedule. I got to go according to my own schedule  my free time. I cannot say  you want me to come at 8am  means 8am. I'm not their maid  I'm not their worker.""She said she could only clean the room at her own discretion as she had a ""tight schedule"".According to their mutual sibling  this cleaning had been going on for about eight years  with the siblings being unable to sleep at night  rushing in on weekends to lock their rooms quickly to prevent the sister from entering.Judge Tan said: ""It is not difficult to imagine that having someone in one's bedroom in the wee hours of the night would be disruptive and distressing.""He accepted that the sister's conduct had caused the brother anguish  with tensions erupting one day such that he assaulted her.""While this was unacceptable – and was the reason why I granted the PPO for the sister – it provided further support for the finding that the sister's conduct had caused the brother deep distress "" said the judge.He said the evidence clearly showed that the sister was aware that her brother did not want her in his room.Their other sibling stated that the sister would not take ""no"" for an answer  trying to enter via other means if they tried to lock the door.The judge rejected the sister's case that she had to clean the room for hygiene.She had stated: ""If the person does housework themselves  clean up their own room themselves  it's fine. But they don't even do so at all after 40 years of age. Not even one finger ... the whole window frame can be black (in) colour.""She said the unit was on the second floor with ""a lot of pests"" and that her siblings could ""even let ... lizards go into the cupboard and stay inside there"" and let cockroaches lay eggs.She also claimed that the cupboard had ""turned mouldy with yellow dots"".""So  when things (are spoilt)  who is the one who (repairs them)? I am the one who (repairs) and (pays) for everything. Huh? They don't even pay a cent  they don't even ... bother. When (the) light is (spoilt)  I repair (it). Everything I do "" said the sister.However  the judge said there was no evidence to show that the brother's room was in such a squalid state that it had to be cleaned frequently against his will.There was also no evidence of pests in his room or house. The photos tendered by the sister showed ""at most a messy house""  said the judge.""In any event  both parties are adults and it was not necessary for the sister to impose her own hygiene standards on her brother "" said Judge Tan.He said he was satisfied that the sister had committed family violence against her brother  and that it was clear she had ""no insight into the impact of her conduct on her brother"".When asked if she was willing to stop entering his room given his discomfort  she replied: ""No  because ... this unit belongs to my dad  not him. If he's not comfortable  he can stay out. You ask him to stay out or get his own place. Because  literally  he (doesn't) upkeep his room and he'll breed all the (pests).""Breaching a personal protection order or a domestic exclusion order is a criminal offence punishable with a fine  a jail term or both.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/brother-granted-court-orders-against-sister-who-repeatedly-entered-his-room-clean-it-4717321?cid=telegram_cna_social_28112017_cna",btohqsg

rp to go common sci is it difficult? like i saw sch web say l1r4 12-19(if i’m not wrong) so if i get 19 l1r4 does it mean can enter or no,btohqsg
cannot guarantee bc depends on your batch,btohqsg
the cut off points that u see are from previous batch,btohqsg
depends on how many ppl jae to the course,btohqsg
wait so if i go sp FM then first year i dropout to RP IT thats a thing?,btohqsg
can try but other choices put those that you meet,btohqsg
sp has a criteria to promote to y2  you dont fullfill  if im not wrong. you will be kicked out alr,btohqsg
no im not talking about retake the year,btohqsg
referring to changing schools as a whole,btohqsg
sorry for asking so much but how to apply if i change i mind in sp?,btohqsg
depends on the sch. for np  u don’t pass the mod  u retake next sem. if u dont pass 2 mod or more  stay back one sem,btohqsg
also if i change school doesnt that mean im joining in the middle of the year so thats the first time i heard about this and it sounds really shocking,btohqsg
u need to seek a ecg session w a counsellor then they advise u on what to do,btohqsg
when you rejoin another school  you basically join the incoming school year,btohqsg
Guys for NP infocomm EAE aptitude tests what kind of qs will they ask ah,btohqsg
HI for the past DAE students is there a high chance of getting in a course of 18 points if i have 20 points but i state my super strong passion and beg for it through DAE?,btohqsg
Or are they very realistic as in only DAE above cutoff points  hinting that passion doesnt make too significant of a difference,btohqsg
i think you forgot to rename your acc+ put a pfp for it,btohqsg

i bet $150 on kamala bro she is ruining my week!!!!!!,btohqsg
kamala harris has a bunch of members dragging her down in her party ngland meh  donald trump is pulling his strings (connection wise) behind the scenes,btohqsg
"I don't understand how 70mil ppl can show up to the polls and think ""trump wld be good for my country""",btohqsg
all good politicians play to peoples emotions,btohqsg
and he does it well enough,btohqsg
just find something to blame and if ur convincing enough win liao yay,btohqsg
imagine electing a rapist into office,btohqsg
Democrats are the most shittest campaigners ever,btohqsg
The difference between donald and kamala,btohqsg
Is that Donald gets people to vote,btohqsg
He gets people off the couch to cast a ballot,btohqsg
Kamala on the other hand is doing practically nothing to motivate her base,btohqsg
This defeat is entirely the DNCs fault.. not on the American people,btohqsg
anybody that can talk  will win whatever event they enter...Its all about how you sway the crowd and trump did it better than kamala by a mile,btohqsg
Lmao   this is what happened when they put a woman up to compete against trump . Not saying a woman is bad but it's the wrong timing .,btohqsg
Kamala just played the wrong cards.. from the start of her campaign her PR team has gone crazy..,btohqsg
1. Aligning herself with Biden2. Not doing progressive policies3. Demonising immigrants essentially reaffirming GOP talking points,btohqsg
sorry the whole enviroment is general was just simply horrible for dems to even salvage,btohqsg
Trump is a strong candidate and America is not ready for a female prez,btohqsg
respectfully  2 is not an option.,btohqsg
They are trying to force one out,btohqsg
Trump should be the easiest candidate to defeat,btohqsg
casey jr is down in PA,btohqsg
Do you know how popular progressive policies are?,btohqsg
She doesn't even have to believe in them,btohqsg
No bro after surviving a gun shot rlly?,btohqsg
She just has to say she'll do it,btohqsg
Obama spewed random progressive shit and didn't do it in office,btohqsg
That's exactly how she should've run the campaign,btohqsg
Because the GOP candidate is a literal nazi,btohqsg
if you think this  you have not travelled the world enough,btohqsg
liberals would think kamala didn't go right enough,btohqsg
She needs to go left actually,btohqsg
She is a blank piece of paper?,btohqsg
No bro the only issue with Kamala is that she is female . Lmao,btohqsg
Jill stein is a Russian asset fyi,btohqsg
That is practically the biggest and only issue,btohqsg
trump knows what hes doing and its populism  its dangerous,btohqsg
The only issue with kamala is she grifted to the right,btohqsg
look at what the minimum did to jobs,btohqsg
America is mostly very discriminatory towards Female. Esp prez,btohqsg
nope  its because people dont actually know what she is going to do for america,btohqsg
minnesota is barely in her column by 5,btohqsg
Democrats are dogwater on implementing policy,btohqsg
she did run a better campaign than clinton but sorry lah,btohqsg
suck it up  move on to 2026.,btohqsg
No she didn't move to the left enough lol,btohqsg
class 2 senate races there are pickup opps,btohqsg
Leftist policies r popular..  she doesn't even have to believe in them or want to implement them..,btohqsg
Imagine there is a female PM in SG   do you actually think most voters who do not read the news or care much abt politics vote for a female ?,btohqsg
Esp if they are male voters,btohqsg
if she went to the left  u think shed win,btohqsg
she should've gone left and progressive.. instead she's just a Republican with a rainbow flag,btohqsg
It's not policy at this point . Not everyone give 2 shit abt policies . Most voters just want to vote for what they think and they're mostly quite simple.,btohqsg
Is that the Democrats put immigrants in prison,btohqsg
But put a gay flag beside it,btohqsg
Democrats are just gay Republicans fyi,btohqsg
if the US votes how they want  respect the vote.,btohqsg
i think sg should have dedicated lessons on global politics,btohqsg
65% of American voters support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour over five years,btohqsg
if u were to move the min. wage to 15/hour  there will be job losses.,btohqsg
57% of Americans say the government should ensure health coverage for all  and 43% favor a government-run health system.,btohqsg
most pt jobs pay more than federal minimum wage btw,btohqsg
"i believe whoever becomes the ""loudest"" will get the vote  gender is honestly not a contention to determine who leads something",btohqsg
Finland is the happiest country on earth,btohqsg
the point here is not let the government decide.,btohqsg
they are happy with their system too,btohqsg
free market might not always be the most effective,btohqsg
That's because of the massive socialisation of their system,btohqsg
Maybe in the younger gen like Millennias and Gen Z's but older gen   no,btohqsg
Not to mention Scandinavia is capitalist,btohqsg
without proper coverage you pay thousands for life preserving medication,btohqsg
the free market approach is not the best  however its better than govt control,btohqsg
safe to say that’s a failure of a lassez faire approach,btohqsg
govt control to a certain extent yes.,btohqsg
It's because of the generous levels of socialisation,btohqsg
because they have good healthcare good security,btohqsg
No one cares they will pay taxes for good healthcare,btohqsg
This is why kamala gotta go left,btohqsg
And campaign for such policies but too late ig,btohqsg
trust in government is when sanna marin lost.,btohqsg
if you are a women and can put yourself out there more than males candidates..you will sway the older generations as well,btohqsg
And americans are really very 😵😵😵,btohqsg
hi anyone did eCOMMS in poly,btohqsg
its all about how big of a impact you give the people the impression of you is,btohqsg
kamala wants to sell your children to china….,btohqsg
Um there still is high levels of socialisation?,btohqsg
The NCP isn't gonna change it,btohqsg
youre arguing a trust in government and ure moving off tangent,btohqsg
Government doesn't mean same party all the time tho?,btohqsg
should we get ready for a ww3 now,btohqsg
u vote out the party if you lost any trust in the incumbent,btohqsg
Wow the statistics must be so wrong then,btohqsg
Because there have been 50+ changes in Finnish Government,btohqsg
Since the founding of the nation,btohqsg
Trust in government means trust in the system..,btohqsg
It's trust that your elected officials will do the right thing for the country,btohqsg
the US has 8 attack submarines stationed around the world at any second  and almost no one knows where they are located. Just to show the kind of capablitilies they haveAny nation that pounce will be euthanised really quickly,btohqsg
i’ll go to the us commit voter fraud and vote for whoever can do that,btohqsg
bro wants to avoid ns so badly,btohqsg
So you're trying to imply that Kamala and Hillary did not put themselves out enough ?,btohqsg
To sway enough votes to win against Trump,btohqsg
kamala ran a better campaign than hillary,btohqsg
hillary got more votes than trump,btohqsg
That's what I'm trying to say lmao .,btohqsg
it was just because of the swing states that trump won,btohqsg
Hillary was scandalous let’s be honest,btohqsg
yes she did im not saying that she didnt lose,btohqsg
she had so much dirt on her,btohqsg
They see the feminists people and feel disillusioned,btohqsg
kamala shldnt have been the nominee.,btohqsg
i wouldn’t want someone like hillary running my country either,btohqsg
not having a open convention was stupid.,btohqsg
ideal ticket wldve been having shapiro at the top or veep,btohqsg
yup it was all down to pennsylvania.Kamala hit a nerve with fracking..whether what she said was true or not. That was the impact that sealed her fate in loosing pennsylvania and loosing the elections,btohqsg
I wonder if trumps gonna get the PV tho,btohqsg
And Democrats getting the house would be amazing,btohqsg
never heard of those people before,btohqsg
Still she lost in the swing states.  If you're a politician   you need to know how to play to win . It's the game unfortunately.,btohqsg
she doesn’t do enough to galvanize the people to her cause,btohqsg
Bro she just had to do obama style campaigning,btohqsg
rationality aside emotion plays a rly big part in voter choice,btohqsg
The Fracking industry is what pennsylvania natives thrive on.When she said this  she sealed her fate in the crucial state of pennsylviania,btohqsg
She just wasn't progressive enough lol,btohqsg
She went on to backtrack her statements approaching the 2024 elections but it was too late.Trump already used this statement against her,btohqsg
she wasn't because nobody knows what she actually wants to do for america,btohqsg
That's the exact reason why she should,btohqsg
Kamala literally is a blank piece of paper,btohqsg
You can frame her as a ANYTHING candidate..,btohqsg
you dont run for a country and not have a plan in mind for said country then expect to win,btohqsg
She could've been a hope and change progressive one,btohqsg
But she's decided to be Moderate and shifting centre,btohqsg
the only time i agree w u,btohqsg
the chat is only active when these scenarios occur1) political discussion2) drama within the community or a mutual circle3) exam periods4) random news sharing sessions which can also lead back to scenario 1,btohqsg
no politician in american is ever progressive for their nation,btohqsg
"it's just done within their own benefits and whatever benefits they can receive under the excuse of ""national interest""",btohqsg
excluding point 3  insn't this how your generic online grp chat goes,btohqsg
my random shower thoughts being accurate scares me sometimes,btohqsg
Babes just be a fake progressive like Obama,btohqsg
They don't care if you act on it or not,btohqsg
Just say u want free healthcare,btohqsg
omfgggg what's so difficult to understand,btohqsg
what is your exact issue with such people because a lot of us know where you're coming from (talking about),btohqsg
Lie that that want free healthcare,btohqsg
Lie that you support pathway to citizenship,btohqsg
does such situations or circumstances affect you,btohqsg
Lie that you want a national minimum wage,btohqsg
Just lie be a fucking politician and Lie that you're a progressive,btohqsg
that is how you also ensure you dont win the next time round,btohqsg
Did he do the Progressive shit that he campaigned on?,btohqsg
Just lie and be good at it,btohqsg
👀 In a tense exchange  the prosecution accused Pritam Singh of giving an “obtuse” answer during his trial.“If you want to be obtuse  that’s fine. But the question is a very simple one ” the prosecutor said.➡️https://bit.ly/4f9gmkeFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
Idc abt local politics + very boring.,btohqsg
Nothing changes.. I'm happy with pap,btohqsg
sucks to break it to you but PAP's downfall is sooner than we singaporeans ever expected,btohqsg
that's what not caring about and finding local politicians broing,btohqsg
I don't think singapore is a democracy,btohqsg
Girl pap can ban elections and ill still back them,btohqsg
LOL so you rather live within a monarchy ruling or a communist?,btohqsg
not commenting on an individual themselves,btohqsg
clearly you don't know the definition of communism or democracy 😭,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure we are a technocracy,btohqsg
Ngl all the opposition parties here r dogwater..,btohqsg
clearly you don't understand the points other people bring forward to you,btohqsg
broski why are you getting so deep,btohqsg
broski there can't be a state or a government under communism,btohqsg
my efforts won't be wasted time and time again over such conversations,btohqsg
Marx says Communism is a stateless  classless  moneyless society where the workers control the means of production,btohqsg
Socialism is a step towards achieving communism,btohqsg
If there's a government behind it  it's not communist.,btohqsg
bro is only listening to whatever opinions in mind,btohqsg
it's not just about the government at the point,btohqsg
sometimes you can be very relatable,btohqsg
sometimes you can be obnoxiously stubborn,btohqsg
I can't wait for trump Presidency tho,btohqsg
Bet he's gonna line up every migrant on the Mexican border and gas them in chambers.,btohqsg
if this conversation is going around in circles (never-ending)  then im just going to go back to reading my braindead novel instead after getting mixue sundae,btohqsg
1 in 5 Americans live with an immigrant.. so I can't wait for the tanks to invade neighbourhoods to purge the immigrants in this christofacist America,btohqsg
okay  then leave it at that,btohqsg
Immigrants are equivalent to Jews. This is a repeat of 1939,btohqsg
im casually minding my own business so MYOP  too,btohqsg
you probably have a life to live as well,btohqsg
if it doesn't concern you too much  then just close one eye and go about your own way,btohqsg
i said that but 5 minutes later  im still here,btohqsg
46.2 million immigrants 😍 easy task for Donald to deport em all,btohqsg
Then he's gonna pull a hitler and say that's too expensive to deport everyone & logistically impossible  so let's just gas them in chambers. (Sarcasm),btohqsg
😭 he's preaching white replacement theory (same as jews r replacinf the aryan races)'immigrants r gonna replace everyone' to scare poor white folks into voting for him.. not to mention he's endorsed by the KKK and has preached actively against immigrants.. He wants to deport every illegal immigrants that's like 46.2 million people (including his wife) and he's also preached for a national abortion ban.. he also supported the proud boys which is a white supremacist nationalist group.. & he's a threat to American democracy..,btohqsg
Claims to be a Christian but has cheated on his wife,btohqsg
I still believe he's a nazi..,btohqsg
Just look at the things he's campaigned for,btohqsg
He said he wanted 'the generals that hitler had',btohqsg
That's not a good thing brother,btohqsg
many things you see are seen because they want you to see it,btohqsg
not a conspiracist but so  so so so many of these quotes are taken out of context,btohqsg
hate trump as much as the next rational person but i think likening him to adolf hitler is a stretch,btohqsg
and a huge one at that,btohqsg
It's not a stretch he has quoted hitler several times in his speeches,btohqsg
literally project 2025 will purge almost every Democrat in the US Federal government..,btohqsg
And install a dictatorship in america,btohqsg
project 2025 is a side project of republican extremists btw,btohqsg
no way a dictatorship will be installed in america in this lifetime without armed revolution,btohqsg
the system has its checks and balances to prevent such a thing,btohqsg
The court has a right wing super majority,btohqsg
Compared to the people who created project 2025? nope,btohqsg
😭😭 there is no checks and balances,btohqsg
Ronald Reagan literally ruled through Executive order,btohqsg
There is no checks and balances,btohqsg
it really gets tuah point 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
1. Supreme Court has a conservative super majority (after the 2 old Democrats retire)2. Trump can essentially rule through Executive order like Reagan (I forgot what the thing is called)3. Congress is literally going to be GOP control in both houses,btohqsg
Um Reagan was not a good man?,btohqsg
Literally every problem in America can somehow be attributed to him..,btohqsg
nearly every US president has had massive scandals or made controversial decisions,btohqsg
politicians might not always be as bipartisan in nature as the people too know,btohqsg
Yet Reagan is the cause of every problem in Modern day america,btohqsg
I don’t think many would support the perversion of american democracy just saying,btohqsg
The second trump Presidency will be much worse.,btohqsg
For every marginalised group and also men.,btohqsg
can u get off tiktok please,btohqsg
u r beginning to sound as ridiculous as the president trump pls save me guy,btohqsg
but for the other side of the coin,btohqsg
reagan was by no means a dictator too btw,btohqsg
he stepped down after his 2 terms,btohqsg
and if that’s your definition of a dictator then was roosevelt a dictator? churchill? because they ruled on executive decree and elevated authority? but still respect the democratic process,btohqsg
okay whatever i’m gonna go study for h2 chem tomorrow goodbye have a good day,btohqsg
US election 2024:Donald Trump has secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the US presidency  according to US media.https://str.sg/dGGK,btohqsg
It iz wat it iz ig,btohqsg
And it was really attractive to ppl,btohqsg
why is everyone saying we are fucked ?,btohqsg
he's not going to start ww3 guys chill,btohqsg
unless he woke up the wrong side of bed orsmth,btohqsg
he's a businessman not a general .,btohqsg
WW3is /= to business for the US .,btohqsg
Feel like he is kindaaa aggressive tho esp with US China relations,btohqsg
doubt he will go to war with china. It's not economically productive for both countries,btohqsg
when has the US-China relations not been full of tension though,btohqsg
ya he's just the type to taunt and provoke,btohqsg
it's also a stratagem in the political  business and military industry,btohqsg
