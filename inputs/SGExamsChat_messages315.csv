U have a wife in ns thou. The rifle rite,btohqsg
if i cook instant noodles with the bunsen burner during olvl prac will i get an auto fail,btohqsg

Fail or not you're definitely appearing on mothership,btohqsg

if you are boring (personality wise) it would be kinda hard to date around ah,btohqsg
Im glad ns enriches people then/s,btohqsg
if i give the examiner some do u tk i will pass,btohqsg
plus if you don't actively go around to meet new (and current people) its also makes it hard to meet ppl of the opp gender ah,btohqsg
I wld take the noodle and fail u,btohqsg
cos i have an air fryer in my classroom that i use to cook food,btohqsg

Hi everyone! I launched the original university telegram chat bots many months back (https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/npt4sw/university_telegram_bots_for_random_convos_w/) and now with the JAE period in mind (and the introduction of additional features)  I am expanding them to the JCs  Polys and Secondary schools as well.If you are considering a particular JC or a particular Poly course  you can join as a “incoming student” and try matching with seniors! If you’re a current student in a sec sch/jc/Poly  you can help incoming students out  match with random schoolmates/those of other schools to make new friends  or find study buddies!Do check them out below!JC:@JuniorCollegeBotPoly:@PolyChatBotSec Sch:@SecondarySchoolBotI have introduced the option of student email verification and the choice to match only with those with student emails—this minimises the risk of abuse. You’ll still be anonymous to other users.The university bots also have newer versions(if you are waiting to enter uni  you can also choose to join as an “incoming student”!)@nusmatchbot@ntumatchbot@smumatchbotwhich allow you to match w ppl of specific majors/year.(the older versions @nuschatbot @ntuchatbot @smuchatbot @susschatbot @SITxSUSSbotare still running too!)Do remember to stay safe—while risks of abuse are minimised with the option of student email verification  it’s not entirely foolproof. Use the/reportfeature or DM me directly if you need any help!If your student email address doesn’t work for some reason  drop me a message too. :)[msg sent w admin approval],btohqsg
^ thanks!!p.s. there might be some lag due to a sudden influx of new users!Drop me a msg if you face any glitches/issues :),btohqsg
Not yet! I’ll be releasing them for other institutions (ITEs and the other unis for e.g.) soon though! :)You can follow@unichatbotchannelin the meantime for announcements on this!(https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/s4gqq8/junior_college_poly_telegram_bots_for_jcs_polys/),btohqsg
If anyone interested in SP Applied Chem and have queries  feel free to look at my AMA:https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/rdys4t/unipolychemistry_ama_sp_applied_chem_ntu_chemistry/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareAlso included NTU Chem as well as career stuff  if you have further questions feel fre to ask,btohqsg
So if I wanna ask stuff about poly (coz I just ended my O's and wanting to go poly) I should go for poly bot?,btohqsg
Yep! Just head over to@PolyChatBotand select that you’re an incoming/prospective student under “My Profile” (and under “Match Settings”  you can choose which poly/course/year your match should be from! :),btohqsg
Ah I see okay... How about the verification part? Remain unverified?,btohqsg
Yep  incoming/prospect students will remain unverified for now (until they actually enroll and get a student email)!,btohqsg
Ah I see okay noted! Thank you!,btohqsg
@nusmatchbot@smumatchbot@ntumatchbotare the new uni bots for more specific matches where you can match by major/year etc. (for prospective students too).,btohqsg
you can also head to the@nuschatbot/@ntuchatbot/@smuchatbot/@susschatbot/@SUTDxSITbotfor more instant matches (but less specific),btohqsg
P.S. for those who aren’t sure how the JC/Poly/Sec Sch bots work  the bot acts as a “middleman” for both you and your match to exchanges messages.Haha there were a couple of tiktoks made by some users for the uni chat bots so you can check out to get a rough idea! The new bots I just released allow you set your match preferences though! :)https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeCWLBPf/https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeCWNVWe/https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSeCWNf12/,btohqsg

Hi does anyone here know if evolve mma offer students a cheaper rate?,btohqsg

But i heard only can book 1 class a day,btohqsg
Evolve can book more than 1 a day?,btohqsg
Btw if you're under 21 must need your parents consent,btohqsg
I don't think so since it's covid,btohqsg
Is there still bell curve for o levels?,btohqsg
I think now they call it moderation lol,btohqsg
But people still use the word bellcurve ah,btohqsg
THATS WHY... I don't see the differences here,btohqsg
What I know is o level ended for me finally,btohqsg
Yea from the website I’m reading,btohqsg
But what should be the A1 mark range for Amath,btohqsg
But if u work hard can one,btohqsg
Isnt he supposed to make u less weak?,btohqsg
hi guys  I need your advice! i am currently planning to put a course from NYP on my first choice for JAE. The Cut off point is 15.My ELR2B2 is 18 & cca pts is 2.Do you think it’s possible for me to get into the course if I put it in my first choice? Is the selection process very stringent on my points or do they allow any leeway?Thank you!! :),btohqsg
If 16 points net might have chance,btohqsg
It also depends on the course planned intake/popularity etc,btohqsg
My friend last time wanted go for pharms then abt the same situation as her ^,btohqsg
Yea that's why there's 12 choices in case you don't get in,btohqsg
Never know when the management will change the intake,btohqsg
My friend went social georontology course,btohqsg
Net pts mean without cca deduction?,btohqsg
Didnt meet the cutoff by 1 point,btohqsg
Im not sure if dae is possible,btohqsg
Advise you to just put it as 1st choice but ensure that you're willing to take your 2nd/3rd choices if offered,btohqsg
ah alright  thank you so much !,btohqsg
No one knows for sure whether the COP will change bc that's supply and demand but no harm trying but just prep contingencies,btohqsg
Thank you so much guys :),btohqsg
You send to wrong group j think,btohqsg
Or any essay heavy/ subjective courses,btohqsg

Hii im about to start work,btohqsg
Can i ask what are cpf contributions,btohqsg
Actly is just that 20% out of ur pay will go to ur cpf acct and 80% will be in cash (I think),btohqsg
ur employer also will contribute 17%,btohqsg
i still student also so nt too sure,btohqsg
So basically cpf is sucking my actual salary,btohqsg
Not entirely true because ur cpf account eventually is still ur money ah,btohqsg
like nxt time u can use to pay for housing (OA),btohqsg
hahaha SAME lmao i just learnt about it recently as well cos i just started work :>,btohqsg
Is there a way to calculate how much i actuallt earn with cpf,btohqsg
I calculated how much im gonna earn without cpf alr,btohqsg
oh x 80% of the pay lor,btohqsg
If you're talking about how much cash u're getting,btohqsg
OA is 2.5% and SA is 4%,btohqsg
SA goes towards your retirement funds (I think),btohqsg
And it helps you 'save' money,btohqsg
CPF got three accounts - OA (ordinary)  SA (special) and MA (medisave),btohqsg
so like diff accounts can use for different things  like e.g. OA is the one that can use for housing  the rest cannot,btohqsg
Since when working got so many things 😭,btohqsg
u actl dunnid to care abt this? HAHA,btohqsg
like u just know 20% of ur pay goes to cpf,btohqsg
Is it a good thing that $ can only be taken out from cpf when we die,btohqsg
Well i mean if u live long enough  u can take it out,btohqsg
Damn sounds like a solid plan,btohqsg
I heard even if thats the case  and you didnt meet the requirement or smth,btohqsg
lol all the scammer acc all girl pic,btohqsg
I guess scammers have a sexist mindset,btohqsg
Is there any age limit to going to JC-? (My friend's sister asking),btohqsg
not sure sia i had a friend who was 20 when she came in or smthg,btohqsg
I mean most of the foreign scholars are like 2 years older at least,btohqsg
Cuz my friend sis next year shud be 20/21?,btohqsg
Idts i mean theres no age limit for retaking  Os if wanna enter jc/poly,btohqsg
i think should still be ok,btohqsg
but the age limit may be around there,btohqsg
need check with MOE to confirm,btohqsg
Ik got no age limit to taking private Ns Os As,btohqsg
But going to school got age limit for JC,btohqsg
You can apply for the DSA-JC if you fulfil the age requirement for the level. If you are Singapore Citizen (SC) or Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR)  as at 1st January of the year of JC1 admission  you must be between 16 and 20+ years old. If you are non-SC/SPR  you must be between 16 and 18+ years old,btohqsg
My bro 20 he barely made it thro y1,btohqsg
i had a classmate 4yrs older than me in jc,btohqsg
Ok then again iirc the maximum age to enter j1 is 19,btohqsg
🇬🇧 is moving towards an interesting development as of today.,btohqsg
Forward a message to me pls,btohqsg
HAHAHA this is damn funny man,btohqsg
Dont do that you can be goodiam kelly nice to mneet you 🥰,btohqsg
She scolded me and blocked me :(,btohqsg
I guess they accept ex convicts too,btohqsg
"""what the hell you i recruit a job for you you play me hooly shit👍""Kelly's final message to me 🥲",btohqsg
WTF caught me off guard HAHAHA,btohqsg

does anyone here intend to specialise in Medical Physics? (Ie MSc is medical physics)If so  do u recommend taking a theoretical physics degree or go for the applied Physics (AP) route?NTU recently introduced Major in AP  w 2nd Major in Medical Physics Whereas NUS has a BSc in Physics w Minor in Medical PhysicsAny advice?,btohqsg
I dunno how is life there but I know it's q hard to find a good paying job (source my cousin's bf),btohqsg
Omg why didnt i think of that,btohqsg
Imagine climbing up a ladder so high + carrying heavy boxes,btohqsg
The resultant clockwise moment gonna  send me to the ER,btohqsg
It feels like high elements tbh,btohqsg
This one isn't about Physics now. It should be about workplace safety.,btohqsg
Its abt physics and workplace safety 👌,btohqsg
Workplace safety first. If it is not safe  don't do it.,btohqsg
It is safe if i do v slowly,btohqsg
But ngl i kinda feel abit betrayed after person told me there will be restocking too despite its notice saying temp taking only,btohqsg
But pay is good so heh,btohqsg

Sounding great  dosent seem important then,btohqsg
idk i got mine early bc i applied eae then i asked if they can do it earlier,btohqsg
Wondering do we need to listen to that principal talk again and collect it like O level cert LOL,btohqsg
No u just go in and go out,btohqsg
I have never seen that in my life until now,btohqsg
Yea unless u wanna find some teachers and chat for one last time,btohqsg
How many times would you choose to give up taking on a national exam paper?,btohqsg
Uh I think it's badly phased,btohqsg
Would you choose to retake your national paper more 3 times to get a better grade? If yes why. If no why.,btohqsg
I know of people right now retaking O levels for the 4th time and I asked them why and their reasoning is Hella surprising,btohqsg
I mean I was somewhat in that situation,btohqsg
Between sec 4 and 5 I took the Chinese paper 4 times for o lvl,btohqsg
Got C5 then C5 again afterwards c6 finally B4,btohqsg
4 tries for a grade up,btohqsg
HAHAHA ITS OKAY I GOT SMTH LIKE U BEFORE,btohqsg
No harm in retaking still gonna use the best grade,btohqsg
I didn’t want to retake after 3rd round but my teacher persuaded me pretty hard,btohqsg
Why I asked cuz :XX  grad ite 2018 (GPA bad cannot go work learn dip//hnitec)Took Os while working & failed English and Math (for 3 years same results uh) not sure should XX retake one more time.,btohqsg
Hmm no harm retaking but rlly tho,btohqsg
May want to consider private laselle or Nafa,btohqsg
XX resultsEnd d7Math d7Chem b4Bio b3Humanities b3Poa a1Chi b4,btohqsg
@Jiajun04whr would u recommend XX go,btohqsg
I nvr heard this kind of situation b4 so yah,btohqsg
If this xx would have done it 3yrs ago aft the results is out,btohqsg
u dont need to specifically takr drawing arts in nafa/laselle theres other art forms/ things like art management/ art teaching,btohqsg
but nafa is private diploma i heard frm others its tougher to find a uni to go to/job after nafa bc the art field is vv competitive,btohqsg
plus if u retake u can js retake the subjs u need/ go private sch if you can afford that option!,btohqsg
if not u can alw try to appeal to ur sec sch to take u in to retake,btohqsg
But requirements need to pass math,btohqsg
4 subjects under 25 excluding english,btohqsg
d7 shld be ok i think im not too sure,btohqsg
if i recall its c6 so u retake english and combine cert,btohqsg
or u can appeal to nafa,btohqsg
but usually if u dont meet the cut off they wont accept,btohqsg
XX take 3 times alr still d7,btohqsg
Maybe there is an inherent problem with how they study or their environment :(,btohqsg
Isn't that abit l8? For xx,btohqsg
unless they wna retake nitec if thats possible to pull up their gpa,btohqsg
theres not alot of pathways offered ;;; sigh,btohqsg
i get it though im retaking os also,btohqsg
then still cannot go h nitec?,btohqsg
liddat rlly no choice alr sia,btohqsg
I told xx to go work then gain experience then go apply to poly for eae,btohqsg
eae from nitec to poly is 3.5 eh if im not wrong,btohqsg
that one idk much sia paiseh,btohqsg
but if they can go for it bah ^_^!!,btohqsg
hopefully they get in intovthe desired course,btohqsg
But they scared of being judged tho,btohqsg
They're the only ones I can talk to :/,btohqsg
i think everyone just goes at a different route or pace yk,btohqsg
25 year y1 poly w so much complications,btohqsg
You are so much more then a number,btohqsg
they seem willing to work hard so i dont see why not,btohqsg
They asked me if they could go jc,btohqsg
jc is vv risky imo at least,btohqsg
like if u dont do well youre stuck witj an a level cert,btohqsg
at least diploma can find work ykyk,btohqsg
so i think they shld go poly bah,btohqsg
if they got money priv diploma,btohqsg
i have friends also but anyway i think the work option is the best one bah,btohqsg
unless they rlly wna retake os then,btohqsg
they have to consider what theyre not doing to help push up their grades lor i mean maybe some dtufy techniques work and some dont for diff ppl ykyk,btohqsg
I pass the msg to xx when I see xx,btohqsg
I mean can retake os but consider smthing at the side,btohqsg
