Yes just like car on fire is dealer problem,btohqsg
Imagine that dealer sell them a lemon,btohqsg
Owner bought it from dealer only recently. Good enough reason,btohqsg
I just trying be fair ma   how u know the owner did not do anything to the car,btohqsg
How to start with the dealer lol,btohqsg
U mean the dealer put a time bomb Meh,btohqsg
You just imagine u are a car dealer and some 1 car on fire come to you after you sold the car   u of course will said that we had done a proper hand over and I donâ€™t know what u had done with the car ma,btohqsg
of course you star with dealer because that is where you buy from.,btohqsg
just like when you buy a new car from a dealer and the next day it catches fire  do you blame yourself? no. you go back to the dealer you buy from.,btohqsg
you dont assume owner did something.,btohqsg
hand over does not mean they can wash off hands . if this were the case  then car makers can shirk responsibility.,btohqsg
some problems can surface months or weeks later. that,btohqsg
that is why they do recall to protect themselves and the customers,btohqsg
I just trying to point out that this is not that simple and easy,btohqsg
sure it is not simple and easy,btohqsg
but it starts with the dealer. why? because he bouhgt it so recently from him,btohqsg
I also can said your dash cam is not from us,btohqsg
nevermind how to prove it. start it from therew,btohqsg
Maybe the wiring is they do got properly,btohqsg
i am pointing to what must be done,btohqsg
You said wire defect and such without proof,btohqsg
So I said other story also,btohqsg
if i had bought a  car yesyerday and sometihing happenbed i of couse go back to dealer,btohqsg
dont argue like a child please,btohqsg
10 days can do a lot of thing,btohqsg
you are speculating to say owner did someting?,btohqsg
Lol up to you lol   to me 10 days I can do a lot of modification. Liao,btohqsg
let the dealer take responsibility and prove it,btohqsg
U are speculating owner did not do anything,btohqsg
Burden is on the owner not the dealer,btohqsg
i am only saying any sane person would push back to dealer,btohqsg
Dealer is not lodging a claim   why got the burden to proof,btohqsg
Burden is on the owner to proof is the dealer provlem,btohqsg
as owner he bought the car from dealer and it caught fire fire back at him. whya re you taking the slack,btohqsg
Lol why canâ€™t you accept some facts,btohqsg
Keep insist dealer will need do something,btohqsg
if you are the buyer what do you do,btohqsg
and you dont even want to let the dealer know about this?,btohqsg
I will claim insurance and try on my luck on dealer,btohqsg
But I know he will said the same thing to me,btohqsg
What did u do to the car,btohqsg
No proof and contract did not state cover fire   argue what lol,btohqsg
Unless buyer has such a clear case to go after the seller,btohqsg
Ya that what I mean lol,btohqsg
No proof   no agreement   no case lol,btohqsg
Itâ€™s the ownerâ€™s mechanical risk which is then covered by insurance. See how post mortem by insurance surveyors goes bah,btohqsg
aiyo y bother so much . let owner settle. he more miserable than all of us hereðŸ˜…,btohqsg
10 days really can do a lot of thing   I believe every 1 here sure got a freind that go mod the car on the first day   from cam to audio to anything,btohqsg
Unless of course the car sits there with no engine turned for 10 days and the car catches fire spontaneously. But even then the case has to be built.,btohqsg
Anyway  what am I saying. Iâ€™m not even a lawyer. Rickshaw fares are about all I can give professional opinions about.,btohqsg
