Keep in mind ppl. Singapore has no natural resources except manpower of which is depleting due to less babies. And to fully utilise they really make us study everything,btohqsg
because it highlights a wealth inequality,btohqsg
gl to all Os physics people,btohqsg
nani i thought u uni grad,btohqsg
I also wish i uni grad,btohqsg
I tot u were uni... the first time,btohqsg
Those who go schools like raffles. They are the most self controlling ppl. Who study without anybodies supervision. Like they are crazy,btohqsg
Sigh I came from one of those... its a correlation not causation thing,btohqsg
Not entirely because of wealth and stuff,btohqsg
But I think it's oso hard to say it doesn't throw institutional advantages at people early on,btohqsg
i think it‚Äôs not the school that removes obstacles  it‚Äôs the amt of money your parents have. if a rich kid goes to a neighbourhood school they still have connections to make it in life.,btohqsg
They have a 4 day school week,btohqsg
since my academic sucks and I feel I have sth I can do in life so EAE is my one and only choice,btohqsg
I have to go EAE nxt yr,btohqsg
And their school end quite early than other JCs,btohqsg
idk how to say..but u seem to know quite lots,btohqsg
Yea but people of lower SES may avoid ri  acsi  etc cus higher cost lol. U need to pay 500 dollars a month for jc there unless u get ESIS,btohqsg
Really the raffles ppl are up there with their own hard work. No joke,btohqsg
Like... from what I see on the ground not really,btohqsg
Scholarship for top 5% in Os,btohqsg
The guys who go to oxbridge that kind are super driven,btohqsg
I think for last year u needed 8 raw to get it,btohqsg
But a lot of them are also like,btohqsg
i think they have for PSLE also,btohqsg
because of psle  individuals who are not  early bloomer/just playing around got ‚Äúfiltered‚Äù where they spend the next 4 years studying easier syllables and they believe they can only or are capable of doing NA/NT streams,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like this one big exam that u take literally defines ur life,btohqsg
And then it's tough to catch up unfortunately if you realize you share common life goal or profession w the ip kids,btohqsg
And to do well and go uni anyway u have to swim against the tide,btohqsg
Oh yea i feel the biggest joke of the education system is affiliation points,btohqsg
not literally but in sg cannot deny that it does,btohqsg
its a proven early bloomer late bloomer issue. N level is not really meant to make ppl feel stupid but let them learn slower to their advantageüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Doesn't LITERALLY define life bah but it has a lot of influence,btohqsg
ok but what do y‚Äôall think of integrated classes though,btohqsg
are u from N level? How would uk their pov i am speaking from exp,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt really agree w the idea also,btohqsg
Just being in a sch gives u access to better schs wtf,btohqsg
also  SG education system is quite slow alr. i think alot of other countries start P1 at 6 yrs old,btohqsg
like those no matter learning pace slow or fast throw into 1 class,btohqsg
Does this kind of thing happen now? In my time never have,btohqsg
i think they want to make it happen,btohqsg
I'm a rly lousy student but got carried from 12-18 because of psle? I don't think that should happen,btohqsg
like you know those primary sch classes like with the smart kids in one class then the ones w slower learning pace another class right,btohqsg
my n level friends tell me their stories about the express ppl having superiority complex. but they choose not to dwell on such. and work hard to go poly. yes  moe shld find a way to make sure N lvl ppl dun look down on themselves,btohqsg
and just put all in 1 clas,btohqsg
Then why shd sec schs be affiliated to jcs,btohqsg
And pri schs be affiliated to sec schs,btohqsg
Is not just the superiority but the system is flawed,btohqsg
The parents on top want it to be like that,btohqsg
and to ans ur qns. im not from N level but i retain at Sec fucking 1 the amount of predjudice i hv had,btohqsg
But a 50 points discrepancy wtf,btohqsg
The transition from NA to Sec 5  is less than a year to learn o level stuff,btohqsg
Oh wow my friend in jc too retained in sec 1. He became top in his sch lol,btohqsg
Whether it's fair or not let's say the system has room to improve bah,btohqsg
exactly  they didnt dwell  they contniued working,btohqsg
What do yall think about ip then,btohqsg
Who tf gives a shit whether they were connected,btohqsg
Math need to relearn a lot,btohqsg
Tbh as an Os student i dont really have a prob with it. But my jc doesnt have any ip so...,btohqsg
idt it does anything wrong tho,btohqsg
Yea btw why is affiliation given higher priority than citizenship?,btohqsg
honestly it‚Äôs just giving smart kids who want to go to jc a chance to not take Os to develop other interests,btohqsg
Dont they have 5? Sorry not too well informed,btohqsg
is like playing games  spending 4 years playing in beginner channel,btohqsg
NA math and O math r very diff,btohqsg
Even algebra my cher need us to relearn,btohqsg
Btw what u all think abt dsa?,btohqsg
go and hide in a hole,btohqsg
Tbh i think dsa is fine as long as the students can cope w workload,btohqsg
but honestly  the system is already very perfect  but there's no perfect system,btohqsg
if u say the system is bad because not every1 can go to uni  then thats wrong,btohqsg
in a perfect society u cant have every1 going to uni also,btohqsg
Yea thats my biggest gripe with it,btohqsg
what courses r u gg in uni,btohqsg
It just widens the gap between the ses grps,btohqsg
There needs to be ppl at different levels of uh achievement but there needs to also be a lot of possible educational mobility before that,btohqsg
I am not arguing on o level and n level but only on the PSLE,btohqsg
Idt there's enough mobility w funny shit like affiliation,btohqsg
"but ultimately if u believe in ""every school is a  good school"" concept u will still reach ur end goal",btohqsg
Need i remind u the joke that is this,btohqsg
That is your drug to numb the sad reality lor,btohqsg
I want to go cs because i like playing computer,btohqsg
Singaporeans are pessimistic in general ig,btohqsg
If i were optimistic i wld say we were pragmatic  but thats only reserved for gp,btohqsg
well thats smth u can‚Äôt quantify like sci,btohqsg
Lucky we learnt abt growth mindset then,btohqsg
lol u need to take cs1010 to truly understand that,btohqsg
Oo you in cs alr ah,btohqsg
Lol i cant even do a level computing,btohqsg
u dont need a lvl computing?,btohqsg
If i do that i wld just die,btohqsg
a lvl computing is a joke,btohqsg
Yea but i did it for a year,btohqsg
Yea and i cant even do that so im a bigger joke,btohqsg
there are ppl who cant do that and can code,btohqsg
u cannot measure defeatist attitude objectively and universally agreed upon metric,btohqsg
I dont even understand linked list,btohqsg
Teacher taught us in like 3 weeks and then tell us do it for promos,btohqsg
Do u guys think going for double degree is a good idea,btohqsg
especially the first major is a interdisciplinary one,btohqsg
Does it give you an extra year,btohqsg
If u think u can manage it?,btohqsg
If cannot can drop the other one rite,btohqsg
If its the same number of years probably means crazy workload,btohqsg
Is like pure triple sci rite,btohqsg
huh is not like pure triple sci,btohqsg
Dropping one subject akin to dropping one degree from a double degree,btohqsg
What degree r u going for?,btohqsg
but double degree got cut offs one,btohqsg
u cant straight away apply for it unless ur cap is super good,btohqsg
econs degree worth more than PPE,btohqsg
roti prata flip so many times this yr,btohqsg
ya contrasting major means not from same faculty,btohqsg
can but that means u must get into law first,btohqsg
but even if u dont get into law,btohqsg
Well at leasts its not the worst meme ig,btohqsg
in year 1 NUS law will recruit students from all faculties to switch over to law,btohqsg
but ur result must be damn good,btohqsg
But hor last time ppl want to do one sci one art but now FASS and sci sch become CHS then how,btohqsg
and if im not wrong u dont have to restart all over,btohqsg
these faculties still exist in CHS,btohqsg
Btw i heard alot of questionable things abt nus  so shd i try to avoid it lol,btohqsg
Your face then the noisy one,btohqsg
Well people call it a meme for example,btohqsg
For get out of jail free card,btohqsg
anyone interested in south east asia studies,btohqsg
Im not a pervert thou well at least i hope not,btohqsg
I heard dickson yeo‚Äôs from there?,btohqsg
R u in poly or jc?,btohqsg
U can be the kopitiam card hacker,btohqsg
It's not a decision you should make just off what other ppl say bah,btohqsg
i think a student from nus hack the card or smth,btohqsg
Yea but i heard the uni rankings are pretty inaccurate since its based on research output,btohqsg
i mean regretting following ur own instinct is better than regretting on following what other ppl say,btohqsg
So I'd say if you have the money and will for it oversea may be a better option  but if local then just look at what uni suits you lor,btohqsg
So damned if i do and damned if i dont,btohqsg
LOL also nth much to study,btohqsg
I thinking abt changing to h2 hist for sea hist,btohqsg
I tot of doing polsci + IR,btohqsg
But fuck la idk my GPA can enter CHS,btohqsg
Cuz i wan do IR and security,btohqsg
But i nvr see smu yet,btohqsg
SMU IR is just biz lmao,btohqsg
But NTU is geographically harder to enter than nus,btohqsg
TIL NTU had a social sci faculty,btohqsg
Cuz cannot study aviation in uni,btohqsg
I see b4 fucking dumb sia walao,btohqsg
That time no one want to,btohqsg
Basically what i study in poly they repeat in uni wtf,btohqsg
But even if wan work in aviation also dunnid aviation degree,btohqsg
i think NTU only dun have sch of design & env and sch of law,btohqsg
NUS sch of design & env is,btohqsg
Can't wait to be labeledpolitically significant,btohqsg
Tele active tdy  havent seen this for quite some time,btohqsg
We're doing that viral psle question and he went silent for a long time and now he's explaining to me his thought process behind his answer,btohqsg
My answer is in the chat box HAHAHA,btohqsg
Ignore my bad math I forgot to add extra zeroes because I was crying,btohqsg
Now I scared of o lvl wtf,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt weight 20 cent coins,btohqsg
My friend says its 2 marks and he took 2 steps to solve it lol,btohqsg
Its fine O level qns all standard one,btohqsg
If after the paper u feel depressed just read reddit. It will make u feel better,btohqsg
He's trying to explain how to do it but he has like 5 variables in his working and 20+ steps and I'm sitting here with like 4 steps,btohqsg
Let the number of 50 cent coins Helen have be X?,btohqsg
Ive seen some of the most graphic things ive ever seen on reddit,btohqsg
Formequation then solve for X ah,btohqsg
I tried not to do algebra because this is a question for 12 year olds,btohqsg
And also because I didn't want to confuse myself,btohqsg
i found the ans to the psle qn i think..,btohqsg
My batch was the famous ribbon question,btohqsg
U shouldnt worry abt cambridge. They set easy papers. U shd worry abt SEAB,btohqsg
Seems like SEAB got emotional trauma and trying to take it out this year,btohqsg
Last year they oso got trauma,btohqsg
What they thot abt my batch,btohqsg
I think this year idk what will come out alr,btohqsg
Then n lvl ss is that,btohqsg
Oh dont bother just go in and bullshit thru,btohqsg
My Cher say probably chapter 4,btohqsg
I feel like the ss paper u shd ignore and focus on the others tbh,btohqsg
Yea math u need like damn high for A1 apparently,btohqsg
yall realise that national papers are set 2 years in advance rite. so if u want spot topics  just check what major thing happened 2 yrs ago lor,btohqsg
My god i miss Os so badly,btohqsg
it took me half my brainpower to get the ans,btohqsg
If u took combined hist last year u wld be too scarred to do so,btohqsg
yeh  i had fingers crossed for 88% but nope  A2 for Os,btohqsg
I think they say usually need 90%+,btohqsg
i did hist elec for last yr Os,btohqsg
It's not tat bad. Yall just needed to read the qns properly and draw this model,btohqsg
^  it's the second one that's fucking people over. My friend is arguing with me over the first one,btohqsg
The friend who tried to solve it using simultanious equations,btohqsg
2nd one is same concept as first one,btohqsg
HHAHAAHA I PLAN TO DO THAT,btohqsg
u need to think the primary school methods. and in this case  literally Pri 2 models,btohqsg
Part 2 cannot be since we alr know how many coins,btohqsg
Yea I only solved it when I drew a model : ) : ),btohqsg
Even then  still hard for a 12 year old.,btohqsg
Then just use X(number of 50 cent coins ) + 2.7 = 1134g-64(20),btohqsg
its literally just helens masss - 40(2.7),btohqsg
can we get a 3 ppl matchy,btohqsg
i wanna match w my best friend too tho idt she watches,btohqsg
I fucking hated my o level maths paper,btohqsg
Even tho in Hindsight its q ez,btohqsg
Instead they are willing to help me lah,btohqsg
That is kinda true. Which is why i get business from these parents for their kids to gain an advantage.,btohqsg
I don't hate this question  but I think this kind of question is too much for a 12-years old child,btohqsg
every psle has these kinds of qns. with the purpose of differentiating the A from the A*. so obviously is too much for a common 12 yr old. is made in this way on purpose.,btohqsg
Actually I don't understand why secondary school Math and Science are easier than primary school Math and Scienceü§î,btohqsg
Now i feel PSLE math is easy,btohqsg
I don't remember how to use p6 methodüòÖ,btohqsg
I relearn everything like 3 years ago,btohqsg
i think the qns quite wordy so ppl freak out. but they legit gave all the clues SAME NUMBER OF COINS. in the end the qns supposed to just solve with Model  which is learn at like what? P2?,btohqsg
Then finally realise it is actually manageable.,btohqsg
Back then when i see the question. Like 4 or 5 marks question i will give up easily.,btohqsg
Maybe now I feel part a is easy for p6 kidBut for part b...ü§î,btohqsg
tbh  SG education system make us learn abit more than others  cos like  it develops fundamentals better  in a sense like. a student sucking at A math  can somehow ace E math  cos of the mental suffering he been thru in A math,btohqsg
a and b same concept of the 40 coin diff,btohqsg
both are about the same. is a matter of whether the student capable of seeing the pattern,btohqsg
It is  people are overthinking part A when part  B is the one we should all be looking at lol,btohqsg
Is not....kids lack the common or money sense because everything is just digital payment.,btohqsg
Like the previous PSLE qn on weight of coins...kids dun go out and buy things so they don't have a sensing how heavy is 1 kg vs 100g vs 1 g,btohqsg
It will be worth beyond $8 haha,btohqsg
yoo anyone willing to crash course h2 math statistics for me..,btohqsg
i wlding mind paying a sum for it,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to recover from burnout,btohqsg
I have this tendency to burnout and it has and will happen again . ( I hope not ) it happened during Sec two . I remember once I studied two whole months for science eoy but I then I burnout . I remember sleeping 16 hours before my exam LMAO . To my horror   I got a c5 despite studying this subject . LMAO (cries ),btohqsg
stop stressing about not being able to study,btohqsg
I think my problem is not that simple because it won‚Äôt work .. thanks for the suggestion,btohqsg
I mean I stressed out during prleims,btohqsg
That was like my best sub,btohqsg
But I think as what my Cher said   it‚Äôs part of the process,btohqsg
When I burnout   I always feel damm tried,btohqsg
I ended up not studying for q a period of time,btohqsg
It was like the only sub I rlly Chionh,btohqsg
Hey   I told myself at least I burntout during prelim and not the actual national papers,btohqsg
The fact that we all are burning out in one way or another slowly,btohqsg
I wasn‚Äôt aware that I burnout during Sec two . I thought something just went haywire,btohqsg
I relax all the way until this year,btohqsg
I had burnt out for my entire life,btohqsg
My sec 3 eoy L1r5 was like 28,btohqsg
Lost energy after i was born,btohqsg
Becus i knew seab was coming for me,btohqsg
Yea but in all seriousness i burnt out in jc. Everyday leave sch at 4pm+ and reach home at 5-6,btohqsg
I was still pissed from the mistake I made two year ago . Because I genuinely wanted my desire class at Sec three,btohqsg
I got promos next monday so i guess not,btohqsg
I feel like when I burnout,btohqsg
So u went to the park?,btohqsg
Wait it might not work for everyone,btohqsg
my way of recovering is just,btohqsg
That is this pounding in my head that legit will not leave me alone in my mist of prelim,btohqsg
Then just off my wifi on my phone,btohqsg
And put music on my computer,btohqsg
That‚Äôs like my coping mechanism ish -?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm proud to say I have been on like a 6 day never eat anything except for like water or like one bread,btohqsg
I am honestly dead from o‚Äôs,btohqsg
R u in sec 4 now?,btohqsg
I am definitely going to poly   I realized I only can excel in 4 subjects,btohqsg
I cannot with hum and amath and Chinese,btohqsg
thats ~1/3 of the days u can go without dyingüòÇ,btohqsg
Well ig if uk what u want to do,btohqsg
"I mean how to ""cure"" burn out is really up to the individual LOL",btohqsg
And I taking my o‚Äôs next two weeks,btohqsg
Rip chinese such a pain in jc,btohqsg
some cope by ranting  exercising  do what they like,btohqsg
Wait in the middle of Os got a 1 week break rite,btohqsg
What helped for me was reminding myself that I'm not alone,btohqsg
I lose all my will to live seriously,btohqsg
But I can‚Äôt die I have parents,btohqsg
"Its not uncommon to feel like ""oh id rather get banged by a car rn""",btohqsg
Who genuinely want me to live,btohqsg
But its all temporary manz just push on HAHAH,btohqsg
Is it common to cry everyday,btohqsg
Yup I have 6 days in between,btohqsg
I mean thats rly dependent on individuals? but its not weird to cry and breakfown,btohqsg
crying is a gd way to relief ur built up emotions and stress anyws,btohqsg
No in school I only have two real friends,btohqsg
Well in sec sch i see people cry everyday in sch during classes,btohqsg
I just got to get my act together for o‚Äôs,btohqsg
tough times dont last tough men do._.,btohqsg
And get in to any poly,btohqsg
Mayb try to not focus about the results and just focus on doing what you can to ur best,btohqsg
He still has poly/jc and ns rip,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mind getting into the worse poly,btohqsg
"A lot of the stress you have if you realise comes from within you. So only you have the ability to ""reduce"" them",btohqsg
Exams have taken a toll on my metal health,btohqsg
Yea sg national exams are q bad. Look at PSLE. It resulting in 12 year olds crying over a test wtf,btohqsg
It's the same for everyoen  might be more for some like you and less for others but at the end of the day  think about how life is great after the exams. Pain is temporary üëçüèª,btohqsg
"If you don't believe right just go google like ""sgexams burn out""",btohqsg
Later someone gonna quote me and tell me that gaokao is worse rip,btohqsg
I am feeling dejected more than ever,btohqsg
Pretty sure its one of the better ones tbh,btohqsg
honestly sg national exams overall still better than other country exams,btohqsg
Yea but why shd we judge based on other systems. Shd improve our own rite,btohqsg
I'm sorry for saying this  but if you want to enter RP  good luck for daily gradesDaily grades are currently still 60% of the overall module gradeDaily grades at 60% is worse for many people  unless you're very good at understanding everything within a day before taking daily PQ (practice questions = class test),btohqsg
this brings back to what was mentioned in the morning,btohqsg
Its like saying SG is good because its better than countries like Iraq,btohqsg
and i dont see the uproar over that qn,btohqsg
as in its solvable just that is asked in a weird way,btohqsg
and not like Os in a go,btohqsg
if now PSLE ppl complain then o lvl/a lvl/poly/uni how lol,btohqsg
I heard senior who from 40 points to 15 point,btohqsg
the higher u study the more of such tricks there are,btohqsg
and i feel that such questions must be there,btohqsg
"is to weed out those that just ""memorise"" content",btohqsg
Feel like PSLE is at a way different stage of maturity thou,btohqsg
Actually  quite true ehMy lecturer told my classmates and me that Singapore is probably the only country that has such thing as Combined ScienceIn many countries  it's a must to take triple pure Science (I think),btohqsg
Their pure science is not as hard,btohqsg
Nah I don‚Äôt think combined science should exist,btohqsg
like thats nt sarcastic btw LOL,btohqsg
It reallt doesn‚Äôt enable you to appreciate how interesting science is,btohqsg
The only ones comparable to us are probably Japan  China  South Korea  etc imo,btohqsg
HAHAHAMy English is actually super badüòÖ,btohqsg
people might write classmate and I,btohqsg
Also I think its really just the naming and format,btohqsg
I mean you can‚Äôt really compare us to other countries,btohqsg
Because other countries are huge so there‚Äôs tons of variation,btohqsg
Like from my experience I never really understood the breadth of chemistry,btohqsg
Until I began studying it for myself after Os,btohqsg
it depends on the mode of delivery oso,btohqsg
I mean yea China and India exams are difficult mostly becus of the number of students,btohqsg
LOL whats diff is u made the effort to search beyond,btohqsg
I mean the difference between pure and combined,btohqsg
I feel like cca shd not be made compulsory in src sch,btohqsg
since I heard of people that don't take,btohqsg
Just that they automatically default the 2 pts,btohqsg
Yea its a waste of time,btohqsg
Yea so shd be made optional,btohqsg
just that it comes at a cost,btohqsg
But the thing is ccas wont have enough people if optional,btohqsg
I mean u can drop without like consequences per se,btohqsg
And that cost can control ur future educstion choices,btohqsg
But is good because is passion,btohqsg
Really? It's not compulsory for my secondary school (although it's highly recommended for the students to join),btohqsg
I mean do u see alot of people joining ccas like band if optional lol,btohqsg
U dont lose the 2 pts?,btohqsg
I joined a CCA in secondary school and I got 2 points,btohqsg
U cant enter some schs without the  pts,btohqsg
Yea so u need a cca for the 2 pts no?,btohqsg
But u need 3 years for that shit,btohqsg
Minimum for 2 points is level 3 all no?,btohqsg
Actually  not reallyI joined Chinese Orchestra as I love musicBut thx to my 2 points  I got into polyüòÖ,btohqsg
Level 3 u already need 3 years,btohqsg
Also! all schools can get in,btohqsg
I mean the people who dont like cca are forced to join becus they are pretty much forced to if not their scores are lower,btohqsg
They can join cca thats most interest them ma,btohqsg
The problem is that u cant switch ccas,btohqsg
I wanted to play Liu Qin  but my instructor said my fingers were too weak to play Liu Qing  and there's lack of people playing Yang Qin  so he transferred me to play Yang Qin instead,btohqsg
If not u lose ur pts,btohqsg
or take two cca and drop,btohqsg
Q hard. In my experience the cca showcases in sec 1 are utter bullshit. They try to paint the cca as some holy piece of time well spent but it merely is an abyssal waste of time,btohqsg
If two people raw score are10 and 11 . But and person that got 11 points have two cca points while the other have none .Will poly or jc take the raw score of 10 or the one with,btohqsg
But that person have cca point,btohqsg
Yea basically u have affiliation? Congrats u get 2 points,btohqsg
I get raw 9 but no cca points,btohqsg
Did u not join a cca?,btohqsg
Affiliation just bamboozles ur way thru,btohqsg
Sorry how to fail a cca?,btohqsg
I thought poly will take the best raw one,btohqsg
2 points in Os is alot,btohqsg
Wait sorry   I don‚Äôt think I phrase it,btohqsg
Yea my sch so many affiliated lol,btohqsg
My classmate basically -6 (affiliarion  cca  clep),btohqsg
Let sayPerson A get raw 15 but no cca points do net 15Person Z gets raw 16 but have two cca pointsWhich poly acceptance higher ?,btohqsg
Did no one in ur sch tell u?,btohqsg
Ig ur sch failed u then,btohqsg
-6 is kinda a joke lol,btohqsg
Why does affiliation even exist in the first place ah,btohqsg
If anyone of you want a somewhat easier CCA   just go for library club or something.,btohqsg
Does anyone know the steps for calibrating this kind of Fluoride probe?,btohqsg
Is there like a Google drive link to access this year 2021 o level prelim papers ?,btohqsg
idk if holy grail collecting olvl prelims,btohqsg
unless yall phys on monday dunnid cry lah,btohqsg
if i want to study mathematics at NUS  is the expected IGP going to be the average of FASS and FOS courses (because of the CHS merger)?,btohqsg
Can u guys help me with this?,btohqsg
U msg at 3am here  not everyone is awake,btohqsg
We‚Äôll find out soon I guess,btohqsg
IGP for CHS is coming out soon since this year was the first year of admissions,btohqsg
It seems like it‚Äôs gonna be around 79 though,btohqsg
So can you help me now? 7:55 am there right?,btohqsg
Lol idt theres alot of people here in ur study field,btohqsg
does no one knows for mine?,btohqsg
