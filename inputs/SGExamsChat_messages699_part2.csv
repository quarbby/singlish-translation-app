And then someone told me it got removed,btohqsg
A301 was HELm  A302 was GELm A303 was HEGm,btohqsg
iirc the tsd in my batch was A202,btohqsg
i remembered A201 got H1 phy but that is all i know,btohqsg
a101 has h1 chem/bio/phy/geo/econs/hist/elit in the same period,btohqsg
I unironically had a stroke when I see the h1,btohqsg
