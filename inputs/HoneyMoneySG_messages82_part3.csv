Test with amaze to whichever portal u have first before doing the real big purchase. Recently I discovered a few mcc different from others shared and also on heymax hence test with block card is better.,btohqsg
That one Amaze + KF UOB... assuming you can clock $800 min spend on SIA/Scoot/KrisShop in membership year,btohqsg
Is there any spending cap per month for DBS one altitude card?,btohqsg
any preference  when to do SRS contribution? Like start or end of year?,btohqsg
Earlier you contribute  the earlier you can invest it. Basically time in the market.But if your cash is in a high interest bank account already  maybe it's better to contribute late as investments are not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Wouldn't buying iphone on krisshop via Kris+ be more optimal?,btohqsg
Hi  If I haven't open the uob account  can I open the account now and join this event?,btohqsg
Hi. Does this means we need to keep the increment fresh funds of $100k till 17th May 2024? And also we will be getting the $558 on 29th Feb 2024?,btohqsg
Hi Guys  quick question  I just got my UOB lady‚Äôs solitaire card and selected travel and dining. However  based on the UNI rewards  I need seem to get 15* UNI based on the category.  Do you guys know why?,btohqsg
You got the 1x  14x will be credited likely tomorrow as a lump sum,btohqsg
I see  that‚Äôs explains. Thanks a lot!!,btohqsg
Keep increment fresh funds from 31 Dec (effectively 30 Dec 10pm because of cut-off timings) till 17 May 24.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt seem to indicate a max spend on it,btohqsg
dbs altitude card u mean? No limit if u referring to the 1.3mpd,btohqsg
I guess you got the answer üëçüèª,btohqsg
Guys  are you emptying your CIMB account now?,btohqsg
does the EGA 1% also apply to CPF SA topups through Giro? T&Cs only specify ‚Äúgiro bill payments‚Äù - hoping they‚Äôre using ‚Äòbill‚Äô loosely‚Ä¶,btohqsg
For my promo with CIMB is end of Jan why so early ? I remember first batch should only end of Jan leh,btohqsg
alamak..guys..my CIMB last day got interest $50 deposited...so last day of january i must maintain the figure inclusive of this $50?to continue enjoy bonus interest?,btohqsg
Not really sure abt how they calculate the interest. Can share pls?,btohqsg
i also..short of $1 plus.. from i counted myself..haha..3.5% of daily closing balance.. then add up,btohqsg
Hey guys  which credit card would you advise for local spend on groceries  food etc.fresh grad here  so high interest savings account isn't a big factor for me,btohqsg
Sharing: kiddy palace is mcc 5941 not 5945 as shown in heymax   friends who wish to buy there may take note.,btohqsg
Hi. Just wondering if anyone has received their US$3k reward from Webull US$100k or equivalent deposit for 2.5 months promo yet?,btohqsg
isnt that what the pic says?,btohqsg
Without an established income  you can only opt for cards with no/low income requirements.. don't really have much but once you have an established income  you can breakdown your spending and take a look at the cards that may suit your spending,btohqsg
Try applying after 3 mths payslips  UOB EVOL or other UOB CC New To Bank promo  and UOB One Account.,btohqsg
For renovation new flat  which credit card is best to apply now?,btohqsg
Anyone using circle.lifes here. Do pay bills with them earn cc points? Using amaze+crmc,btohqsg
dont think many reno firms accept credit card for payment,btohqsg
Official t&c for Webull first cash voucher date is 5 Jan 2024,btohqsg
So we don‚Äôt have to do anything just wait till 5 January 2024,btohqsg
how long will krisshop credit miles after i made purchase,btohqsg
can u check the numbers again? Seems like it's updated.,btohqsg
Trust plus ntuc sounds good if u shop at ntuc,btohqsg
Groceries if can hit the $600 min spend can think about DBS yuu if giant/cs is your thing.But do note that the 18% Cashback is valid till Feb 2024 only  dk if will extend or not.,btohqsg
Hello folks  I need some help regarding my new UOB One card. I frequently use Foodpanda to order groceries from Giant and Cold Storage. Are these purchases eligible for the 10% cashback offer?,btohqsg
How about amaze + citi rewards?,btohqsg
No  since it's charged under Foodpanda,btohqsg
Oh damn! Is there anyway to get delivery from any of them and get the UOB one card 10%cashback?,btohqsg
It should work too  but I don't think anyone would think 18% Cashback < 4mpd lol,btohqsg
Buying miles at 4.5 cents each is ridiculously expensive,btohqsg
It is but evaluating the risk of dbs discontinuing the promo (citi will at least have the 4mpd long term)Both have annual fee as well lol,btohqsg
Given the fact that DBS nerfed all AMAZE* transactions  you can't assume that Citi won't do that at all...And let's be honest  yuu card is basically useless if without these upsized cashback. They might reduce the percentage  but to completely eliminate or slash to below 5% is quite unlikely  especially when Citi Cashback Card's 8% cashback is right around the corner and you can shop in any grocers  not just Dairy Farm group.,btohqsg
Also  regarding AF... DK if you've seen Chris' video regarding AF waivers.,btohqsg
Any way to get delivery from Giant and get the UOB 10% cashback?,btohqsg
Either you travel to Giant or back in time when Giant is not on foodpanda ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I didn't ask this  but thanks!,btohqsg
