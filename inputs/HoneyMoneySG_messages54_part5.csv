Ok thanks. Which platform do you recommend buying the Fullerton fund?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  can someone here that buys T bills with DBS iBanking advise me. The auction date was 6 July and subsequently I got a partial refund for my application but the interest hasnt been credited till today. On their website  they state it will take about 1-2 business days but it has already been more than that,btohqsg
about 250k and refund of 12k,btohqsg
yes I did non-comp. Is it usually given together in one transaction? Because previously did with OCBC they give it in 2 separate transactions  one refund one interest,btohqsg
guys if i link prvimiles to instarem and spend overseas it will give me 2.4 or 1.2 miles per dollar? because instarem charges the card in sgd right so is it true i won‚Äôt get foreign currency spend?,btohqsg
Instarem Amaze NERF for Card-linked payments  starting 1 Aug 2023: üí´üí¥ Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amaze- Amaze card-linked transactions in foreign currency will earn 0.5 InstaPoints (0.5% rebate) per S$1 spend- No change to InstaPoints earned on amaze transactions linked to amaze wallet (1% rebate)- E.g. Spending SGD 100 in foreign currency will earn 50 InstaPoints effective 1 Aug 2023  instead of 100 InstaPoints previouslyüëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
The real nerf is if CWMC don‚Äôt acknowledge Amaze as eligible transaction. That way Amaze is going to die like all the AMEX card.,btohqsg
Unit trust level has fees. Some fees are passed on to brokers,btohqsg
I see . so buying SG Fullerton fund   no fees all ?,btohqsg
For moneyowl Fullerton fund  how they credit the interest ? Daily or monthly?,btohqsg
No  only fund level fees. Value is based on fund NAV,btohqsg
Basically the fund manager will take some cash from the fund to pay for expenses. This will be reflected in the NAV,btohqsg
Brokers earn via trailer fees  sort of like a commission which the fund house/manager passes on to the brokers for helping to sell their products,btohqsg
Hi if I pair citi rewards cc with xnap and pay for hawker food do I get 4mpd?,btohqsg
It differs from fund to fund  not a fixed amount or percentage,btohqsg
No. Mobile wallets don‚Äôt get 4mpd,btohqsg
"You can search ""___ fund total expense ratio"" to see",btohqsg
Sharing my Syfe Reit+ performance after 1 year (actually I have it for 2 years already). DCA $100 every month cos low confidence in it since it's always been negative PnL even after dividends. Anyone in the same situation?,btohqsg
yes my Reits+ portfolio is also -ve,btohqsg
I checked mine too.. also credited. I tot it will reflect a credit balance but it's not. So I tot it is not credited until I tap into the card entry to see.,btohqsg
Loss: -$133 (inclusive of +$170 dividends)Invested: $3.1kAs you can see  orange line is always below blue line. I don't know if Im doing something wrong,btohqsg
0.5 instapt for $1 on instaram..whoever still use this card...a real douche,btohqsg
40k in reits on syfe... divident 4k+ but -2k+++,btohqsg
Yea I can't believe after factoring in dividend gains  Im still at a loss!,btohqsg
will FO the moment it tuen green even its 0.1cents.,btohqsg
and we r paying their mthly salary,btohqsg
üòÇ I waiting for that day to come since 1 year but still haven't come,btohqsg
You might have bought in at the high which explains why till now is still in the -ve,btohqsg
Why don't buy Fullerton fund ?,btohqsg
I DCA consistently for 2 years so  it must have been a bull run for the past 2 years‚Ä¶? :/,btohqsg
This is reits  cant be compared with stocks in USX. Lets take a look at the returns for C38U (which is the largest holding in reits+) for the past 2 years from today  its down 11.21% (exclude dividends) so yea not a bull run,btohqsg
I entered in around Sept 22 and including diviends i am in the +ve  so its all about time you enter,btohqsg
It depends on the hidden fees/spreadSyfe is getting.Also We are in an interest rate increasing period  putting downward pressure on reit prices. Thus so far minor lost is still understandable. Once interest rate reverse  the prices are more likely to go up as people demand a lower yield.,btohqsg
"a quick check shows that syfe charges 1.98 per trade. so when u DCA in  if im not wrong each fee equates to around 1.5% of your buy in. There might be additional ""For Syfe Wealth investment portfolios  our fees range from 0.35% to 0.65% per year "".I dont use Syfe so not exactly sure of their fee structure.",btohqsg
I think syfe reit+ only charge management fee  and not fee per trade,btohqsg
So I guess it's just 0.35-0.65% then.,btohqsg
no  unless u using Amaze+citi rewards mc via googlepay on Android phone,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. My strategy is the same as yours. üòâüëçüèª one question  for NTUC app to pay for Kopitiam food  you use HSBC revolution or DBS WWC?,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the best alternative now after amaze‚Äôs nerf? Youtrip/trust? Anyone pushing their future fx transactions before 1st aug haha,btohqsg
The best alternative is still Amaze. Unless their FX spread exceeds 3.25%  you still come off better using Amaze + CRMC vs using another 4 mpd card like UOB VS,btohqsg
Just got out of a financial rut a few months ago. If CBS got default record  really is die die need wait 3 years for it to clear before can apply CC with any other banks beside trust?,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Any idea which card including dbs live fresh allows us to earn rewards when renewing safra membership?,btohqsg
Is simply go transactions considered as online spend? Or is there any method to make simple go to become online transaction? Example Apple Watch? Target is for SC journey card to get the 3mile per dollar,btohqsg
1. Get CIMB CC in Malaysia (if freq) for the best exchange rate (way better than Amaze)2. Youtrip.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution or UOB one or standard chart smart is recommended?,btohqsg
Likely uob will never approve u. Uob known for being very conservative. Black mark = forever reject,btohqsg
Different use for all. Should get all if use UOB one deposit accountSCB smart for some fast food (Macs &BK) and public transport as high cashback for those 6%HSBC Revo for travel and other general spend (eg. Retail)UOB one for bills/everyday groceries etc and to pair w UOB one account,btohqsg
Forever as in after it gets removed from CBS? Or until there's no default records?,btohqsg
Can I check is there any cards that I can earn miles for paying M1 phone bill? Thank you.,btohqsg
Haha I cannot answer u on this but from what I know. Uob remembers forever. As long as it knew.Heard an incident about someone who was a guarantor for a corporate loan by uob and the company went bust  that person was not approved any credit facilities in his personal name by uob forever.,btohqsg
