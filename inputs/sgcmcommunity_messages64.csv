I dun like the halogen headlights,btohqsg
My beetle can that too!! add 30 secs more.,btohqsg
Ya. During inspection. Reverse light cannot be LED. High beam cannot. My headlight original is LED.When you turn your steering left or right. Additional light will shine at that turn direction. üëç,btohqsg
singapore all the top timings are all audis and bmws and teslas,btohqsg
no heavy rwd v8s and stuff,btohqsg
uh u compare such a light car to a grandtourer,btohqsg
weight is actually more impt that u think,btohqsg
power is really nth without traction bro haha,btohqsg
u can compare xdrive m4 vs the rwd ones,btohqsg
top speed yes 4.4 will definitely be bigger,btohqsg
once you go up to higher speed the 4.4T will easily pass the S3,btohqsg
guys i think pete is back,btohqsg
S3 will definitely have the upper hand of traction,btohqsg
U see when its wet lor,btohqsg
M6 can have all the power but cant put it down also no use,btohqsg
yes for sure no doubt 4.4l is faster then s3,btohqsg
but off the line and accel,btohqsg
i think a stage 3 s3 would smoke a stock m6,btohqsg
ppl that play dragy don‚Äôt care top speed one haha,btohqsg
want fast far just buy M3P,btohqsg
after all in real world only ppl that race top speed with street cars is the tokyo midnight club,btohqsg
Only 1 way to find out,btohqsg
my brother mr road hogger/caipeng is so good at it,btohqsg
Is F1 auto or manual ü•∞,btohqsg
F1 is not auto sequential meh according to Mr pete,btohqsg
i have learnt the art of ignoring stupid questions,btohqsg
i only know mk4 supra come from factory with 1000hp,btohqsg
wgt 2jz when u have HUD bro,btohqsg
singapore fastest s3 on dragy does 0-100 in 3.1s,btohqsg
no need vtec when u got volvo vvt,btohqsg
TIME TO BUY LIME GREEN SIENTA,btohqsg
Just kidding guys I'm not a Honda fanboi,btohqsg
The only regret I have is not buying a 7.5k depre stock condition euro R,btohqsg
stock cl7r and fd2 are one of the biggest flexes in the world,btohqsg

In the inaugural 2008 Singapore GP during a pit stop by Ferrari's Felipe Massa  the team's mechanics did not____  dashing the Brazilian drivers' hopes of winning the race.1. Remove the fuel hose from the car2. Secure one of the tyres properly3. Give him enough water to hydrate himself4. Move out in time and some of them got hit by the car and had to be sent to Glen Eagles5. Know what they were doing 70% of the time,btohqsg
Then i remember got one fd drift in the track,btohqsg
must say who was the only retirement of the 2018 gp,btohqsg
got one year some drunkard walk on the track,btohqsg
Yeah so had to make it easier so more people can join and participate,btohqsg
Yay we all get to dinner with you,btohqsg
The water issue is common with Raikkonen,btohqsg
5 is more of what Ferrari is doing now sadly,btohqsg
Also. Just to give a small bit of hype. If all goes well  we will have a car meet in November. - J,btohqsg
woah don't like that say eh. Back then I how old only-R,btohqsg
Still in talks with some people but we working hard behind the scenes to bring this car meet to reality - J,btohqsg

when the gearbox shaft comes out of the flooring,btohqsg
Would appreciate it if you don‚Äôt tell the whole world hehe,btohqsg
Eh don't giveaway the answer - J,btohqsg
Can hint but don't blatantly say the answer,btohqsg
Oh sorry. Thought it was already public knowledge üôè. Anyway very easily researchable,btohqsg
First Singapore GP was 2008... Ownself do the math,btohqsg
2008 was the first year. Source: I was flag marshal at turn 9,btohqsg
Liddat ppl chiong LCK 40 tiang or 99 turns also count?,btohqsg
It was an actual grand prix LOL,btohqsg
formula 2 and motorcycles raced there,btohqsg
Any parts of this old circuit still remaining / driveable?,btohqsg
but a few years ago got speed cam,btohqsg
Cool. Would love to drive through,btohqsg
just pulling ur leg la haha,btohqsg
Actually Singapore could really use a race track that can be used by the public for a fee. Like in prettyMuch every other developed country. land is too scarce and valuable here,btohqsg
Drive normally can. Drive like racing driver cannot. Confirm crash.,btohqsg
Just don't get caught by tp,btohqsg
actually a very very good layout if u ask me,btohqsg
the plaza sing bit  is so good,btohqsg
I think it would be a great revenue driver for Singapore and be a nice tourist activity as well. Can operate like Nurburgring and rent out cars so that tourists can run the track as well,btohqsg
it was supposed to be at changi,btohqsg
Hope STB restart the project somewhere else.,btohqsg
Maybe the area near lentor ave?,btohqsg
Does anyone know if the marina bay f1 track is ever open before the race for private car hire?  That would be the other alternative. Build the fencing a week early each year and open up public lap times in the middle of the night when it is cool and won‚Äôt disrupt normal traffic.,btohqsg
There was one at Tuas .gokart/motardBike die.Closed down.then Kranji KFThere was plan but to costly,btohqsg
Would just be nice to have somewhere people can run their cars to their potential legally and safely,btohqsg
aiya have places to do this kind of shenanigans. Just ensure there is really ntohing for you to crash into and nobody u will injure,btohqsg
like the japanese always say  1st rule is to always make sure everybody is safe,btohqsg
go round one around ur desired route first then decide to play,btohqsg
and dont play out of your confidence/limit,btohqsg
Of course. That‚Äôs why the only options are to go to sepang which is really far and not that convenient to get to from here,btohqsg
just stop traffic light every few minutes,btohqsg
there are some roads that are nice to play,btohqsg
faber too many humps liao la bruh,btohqsg
most dangerous road is the safest road. go lut outside LTA office,btohqsg
Some Cars still run the route now in the middle of the night?,btohqsg
0808 many cars.Nowadays weekend need to wait .Round n wait .Tiring,btohqsg
The only place in sg that need bbk is og lol,btohqsg
Some car no need bbk but people still put,btohqsg
who say bbk need to be more weight,btohqsg
u try carbon ceramics w good calip,btohqsg
its the rotor that matters because it contribute to spinning rotational mass which is much worse,btohqsg
all the material and construction man,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admintime to make new article abt rims man,btohqsg
oh shit pete is that you,btohqsg
He reminds me of your favorite person that was once in this group,btohqsg
okay learn about materials and rims okay!,btohqsg
no worries  u have google and youtube  alot alot of resources,btohqsg
Bigger wheels does not necessarily mean heavier,btohqsg
yeah if it isnt the same material?,btohqsg
u think stock wheels come forged?,btohqsg
when u buy new rims  u buy the same material?,btohqsg
EH THIS IS GETTING MORE CONVINCING,btohqsg
got go geylang alr and see my mother?,btohqsg
Bigger wheels harder and more surface for car to turn. Can expect performance impact.,btohqsg
i need a new hat because my old one broke when my mind is blown sia,btohqsg
that‚Äôs what pete said abt nissan,btohqsg
Yes but in this context we talking about weight,btohqsg
your independent variable were not stated to be the size of the rims. Your independent variable is new rims. Who tf makes a 21inch rim out of cast iron,btohqsg
Because I defo can feel the difference between 17‚Äù and 20‚Äù,btohqsg
just eat less fast food and exercise more can liao.,btohqsg
come here ask why ppl like benz etc,btohqsg
the speed of deleting message also same as pete sia,btohqsg
Bigger wheel = more steel used in the tyre üòÖ,btohqsg
he delete his old account and make new one to come back,btohqsg
Very free.Keep buying sim card  and create new telegram account üòÖThink ban Mac Address betterüòÖ,btohqsg
these has been the most wholesome month of the sgcm chat,btohqsg
heard it here before  directed at me too,btohqsg
everyone single person here can agree with that,btohqsg
people argue also will shake hand one,btohqsg
come fly with me let's fly let's fly away,btohqsg
idk how u are nissan also,btohqsg
but you seem to know him huh,btohqsg
if not how do you know how he is like,btohqsg
i cried for 3 days 2 nights when he got removed,btohqsg
i kept reflecting why he call me kum gong,btohqsg
ball shrink until must make 3 acc,btohqsg
Yeah man  was really very tough,btohqsg
I did! they say it was really one of the most devestating and tragic story they have ever heard,btohqsg
im so happy he is back,btohqsg
make me feel less stupid around him,btohqsg
Yes  hearsay  the car can go with stock tyres for 10 years without changing,btohqsg
funny enough  i have seen it overseas,btohqsg
his balls when give birth no wrinkles,btohqsg
idk  hearsay he missing 2 halves of a brain,btohqsg
oh damn i didnt see that hahaha thats insane,btohqsg

üö®LATEST PETROL PRICESüö®SPC confirm the next to increase petrol prices alreadyü•∫,btohqsg
Forged internals and closed deck engine,btohqsg
Depends on driver haha. Its not easy to match factory times  especially with rwd cars.,btohqsg
Ya but probably in excess of 180kph,btohqsg
ya rwd cars once the traction comes into play they will fly,btohqsg
Very likely  but technically his is considered stage 3  cos his turbo is hybrid-ed hahaha. But with a bigger turbo  for sure quicker,btohqsg
i say 80-100 the V8 will catch up quick,btohqsg
Can if u got enough money to be a driver in the carrera cup asia hahaha,btohqsg
The govt has slackened the rules recently but i think an official motorsports playground is not inear sight. Need more adhoc events and slowly change the public perception of motorsports.,btohqsg
Sentosa gudang. So many cameras and curves  it will be a slow race,btohqsg
Oh didn‚Äôt know those drivers are all self funded.,btohqsg
Totally Agree. Only awd cars easy to match factory 0-100,btohqsg
Or if the car has launch control then times should be close to advertised times,btohqsg
For the masses and across the board  cos not everu car can hit 200 LOL,btohqsg
If a car can‚Äôt even hit 200  surely dragy timing is at the bottom of the list of priority,btohqsg
Actually 100 to 200 is incredibly hard to master and measure perfect time. Your car must be in optimal gear and revs to make a clean run  and also people start mashing the pedal before hitting 100  very hard to time,btohqsg
Probably comparing FC and mileage LOL,btohqsg
You‚Äôre supposed to just mash it before 100,btohqsg
Ya  s65 is slow tbh hahaha. Too big engine  takes long to rev up,btohqsg
Around 70km/h is a good run up,btohqsg
You‚Äôre not supposed to get on the throttle at 100,btohqsg
Ya but on the street not so applicable. Awd is on permanent  or semi anyways.,btohqsg
yup  highway runs are when the sheer power of the v8s come in imo,btohqsg
The thing about being ‚Äúfast‚Äù is that it‚Äôs a battle against traction. Hence 100-200 takes most of the inconsistencies out,btohqsg
Carwow just did a video  v10 r8 vs tuned rs3 and tuned rsq8. Not exacrly the same conditions and outcome but just shows there is no clear winner in every case.,btohqsg
The og awd. Bmw and merc were slow to catch up. Xdrive didnt implement in m cars until recently.,btohqsg
Sponsored  but u can self fund also hahaha,btohqsg
4matic was more seen in the higher spec SUVs and Sedans  mostly in the north american market  cos AMGs were focused on rwd  the 35s and 45s the only ones with them,btohqsg
Ya but i feel launch control is a gimmick  some cars it takes longer to engage launch control then to actually hit 100kph.,btohqsg
and yes xdrive only used by bmw more recently,btohqsg
some rwd can match factory or even beat factory time,btohqsg
Hahaha or simply 0-200 : Yes,btohqsg
Yeah i've seen that  but to catch the optimal rev and gear is not so easy,btohqsg
There‚Äôs really not much to think about,btohqsg
Must be able to read your own torque graph  and turbo chart,btohqsg
Start at about 70kph with the rev right before the boost kicks in / peak torque,btohqsg
no point for NA cars alr,btohqsg
And you‚Äôll get the correct 100-200 with no more than 0.1 secs difference,btohqsg
ur I4 turbo make same power as ur NA V8,btohqsg
Bmw usually under declares  porsche idk  dont have opportunity to drive one haha,btohqsg
For me too. A 1.2mil gt2rs speaks more volume than someone with say a  huracan. Of cos the sto is a different league,btohqsg
I see. Now 40t a bit hot  next time hahaha,btohqsg
ok gonna deregister my car alr-R,btohqsg
NA has its charm la  but nowadays the turbo lag not so bad anymore,btohqsg
i would really like a 45 merc tbh even though it‚Äôs a 4cyl,btohqsg
it just doesnt have the competitive edge anymore,btohqsg
turbo so much more efficient too  governments would wanna phase it out one day,btohqsg
Anything below 2k is reasonable. For the amount of power,btohqsg
i hope not i love my vtec,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to go to 40t,btohqsg
or breakfast run into malaysia and kill two birds with one stone üôÇ,btohqsg
Im super amazed at the engineering. A factory 2L turbo with 420bhp,btohqsg
10-20 years ago  people use NA because turbo lag was bad. Thats why porsche came out with the 996 GT3 etc etc. Nowadays what is turbo lag? 911 turbo can easily smoke any of those V8 muscles already,btohqsg
ok la for me I prefer the sheer pleasure of driving. Fast cars doesn't necessarily mean fun carsüòè-R,btohqsg
back in 2015  their 2l turbos produced 360 stock,btohqsg
you think the 991 GT3RS will every be faster than a GT2RS? i doubt so,btohqsg
gt2rs gotta go 997 for me mann haha,btohqsg
the GT2RS will definitely be faster w high power rating. But the 4.0L NA will sing all the way to 9k rpm,btohqsg
Porsche NA engines especially the 4.0 tend to have this very high pitch scream after 8k rpm,btohqsg
All that boost it‚Äôs near the limit,btohqsg
abit contradictory since we‚Äôre on the topic of NA and turbo but i really love those old 80s hot hatches so light and nimble,btohqsg
sadly is true haha  with a tune that engine gna go very very quickly,btohqsg
forge the whole engine the car will still break,btohqsg
Yeah thats what im afraid off. I had a diesel car recently  sold it after a year. Didnt know what the govt will do. Road tax was already a kill joy  by 2025 idk if they would increase again.But then i bought a na LOL. I hope they dont raise the road tax cap to phase me out,btohqsg
but NGL  both NA and turbo cars got their own merits-R,btohqsg
but long run reliability aside  those 45s are mechanical beauties,btohqsg
Hahaha not my thing anymore. Just drive for fun,btohqsg
what was the diesel? share share,btohqsg
a few years back i had a family member looking at the 2.8 grand voyager üòê,btohqsg
i was just looking at the tech video on the new 992 GT3RS. U think it can last as long as previous generation porsches? I doubt the tech will even survive 10 years. But when you look at cars like the 964 930  this cars were made to last. Only time will tell how well the GT3RS was engineered to last,btohqsg
that drs might malfunction sooner then dsg gearboxes if u ask me,btohqsg
i just have a feeling those won‚Äôt last so long,btohqsg
interesting topic to ponder about now that you have mentioned itü§î-R,btohqsg
exactly. Its so techy. Electronic rebound control etc. If one gets into an accident  how much is it to replace a full set. How long will the suspension last before it requires changing?,btohqsg
good when they work and last,btohqsg
but such a pain when need to change,btohqsg
"Many things to consider when buying a new car. Personally everyday i find a new reason not to buy a new car  especially volvo.Adapted from Nikos Tan on VPCSI posted this in VPCS:-Volvos today will give a whole new meaning to ""all conti is like that"". Especially in certain regions where consumer laws are weak  you'll pretty much be at loss when issues get complicated. Even if they're straightforward  one will also have to set aside a sum for potential replacement of parts that are ""not suppose"" to fail so early (i.e. prop-shaft  coil  suspension).Problems aside  try finding a wiring diagram or schematics for a W213  C8 or G30. You'll easily find whatcha looking for pretty quickly. Now try for an S90. Despite being launched sometime back  you will still not be able to find a single one without paying a premium subscription. And even if one wants to pay  you need to be in US/Canada  or UK/Europe. Outside of these regions  you're pretty much out of luck. My V40's infotainment just failed 1 month back. $3.3k to replace and it can only be done at the dealer because outside workshops have no access to VIDA to program the new module.Volvos aren't what they were used to be anymore. When the VEA was introduced and they removed the dipstick (a simple fail proof oil level dipstick in favour of an electronic sensor)  it is proof that Volvo has gone way beyond the needs and requirements of the customer. It is focused fairly and squarely on removing many vehicle owners from checking their own cars basic signs and thereby driving owners into the hands of the dealer network when issues surface; essentially complicating and thereby effectively neutering many owners from a very simple yet essential check on the life blood of an engine. Wanna know how much exactly to fill? Those information are not easily accessible too.For future EVs  Volvo have also blocked access to check the SoH of the battery without special tools & permissions  again effectively driving owners to the dealer. It is 'fine' if the cars are reliable. But if it isn't  this is a real problem in financial and mental safety.If only things were more transparent and easily accessible like the past  owning a Volvo would have been such a joy. Oh wells  ""if only"". Can dream for now. haha. Want a complete peace of mind? Just lease a Volvo. Buying will be gamble.",btohqsg
Hardly actually. A remap i think brings it close to 550bhp,btohqsg
Never had a thing with merc  but its just an engineering feat,btohqsg
Depends on how hard u drive it la. If u drga race everyday  then yes wear rate is going to be atomical. But once in a while shld be fine,btohqsg
Last hurrah before electrification. I just hope they dont revise the tax structure to phase it out,btohqsg
Haha a very non conventional diesel.,btohqsg
Not just die to turbos  but also complexity of the engine  cheaper materials  amd arguably reduced lifspan of parts so that milk the owners for more money,btohqsg
Exactly. Car makers are finding different ways to milk the owners. Just like bmw subscription. Or gtr r35 locked ecu in the early stage,btohqsg
Hahah thats even more unconventional. I had a merc glb220d,btohqsg
oh wow now that is cool,btohqsg
Yeah 400nm. Quite light on its feet.,btohqsg
Chipped to almost 500nm  i think 480 or 490nm,btohqsg
But im a noob  never managed to get a good 0-100 reading,btohqsg
Time for an SGcarmart early morning yong peng / batu pahat run?,btohqsg
that would be cool tbh haha,btohqsg
Close to 200 stock. I think 190+. after chip i cant remember,btohqsg
Anyone keen one Sunday morning?  If we depart town 5:30-6am latest usually a smooth run up and back to SG before lunchtime.,btohqsg
Torque was all i cared about for the diesel haha,btohqsg
Has sgcm every organised a drive or meet?,btohqsg
Hopefully we will have one in November! We are currently planning smth right nowüòå-R,btohqsg
u guys are really freaking legends,btohqsg
Questioning my existence and the meaning of life,btohqsg
Exactly. It‚Äôs not about the 0-100 itself. Anyway it‚Äôs the sound  feel and experience in getting there that truly matters.,btohqsg
Guys  what‚Äôs the diff between R10 and R11 scheme?,btohqsg
When do u even use 100-200,btohqsg
u should try with ur tesla cfm very interesting,btohqsg
a lot of top dragy times are with m3p,btohqsg

Is it possible to turn on parking lights for Japanese cars.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs always on after you park,btohqsg
U mean turn on after u park for a while?,btohqsg
Or on permanently until u turn it off,btohqsg
No. Turn on when I park. The objective is to let others see well in the dark or in the haze.,btohqsg
You know European cars have this feature.,btohqsg
Usually when you park your car for a few hours you can turn on the parking lights. For safety,btohqsg
Homecoming is for what? But not for parking? Say oh want it on for as long as you park for a few hours until you come back to drive,btohqsg
Can do? Japanese cars have this?,btohqsg
Means after u park  u can leave the lights on for few secs,btohqsg
To let the person see in the dark,btohqsg
Why wants to leave lights on for hours,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminwas it J or R that never see i30 with pops and bangs,btohqsg
Because it‚Äôs safer. In the mist like in venting highlands it‚Äôs better to leave parking lights on. Safer for them and for your car. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs designed for,btohqsg
No. Not at all. It uses very little energy,btohqsg
It turns on small lights only to enable others to see. Can be left on for a few hours. No problem at all,btohqsg
I30 also can be very nice hor üòÜ,btohqsg
Turn off engine. Open door  turn the light knob to parking light & Tail light (3)  exit car  close and lock. That works for Korean cars and some euro cars.,btohqsg
