Extreme heat affects men’s fertility and birth outcomes  according to an NUS study.https://str.sg/jYGT,btohqsg
Btw  Are you from ITE West  Central or East?,btohqsg
so if the government wants us to have a higher birthrate they should install ac everywhere,btohqsg
I think I just jinxed myself lol,btohqsg
I was just telling my friend all interviews now are zoom,btohqsg
did you get an in person one,btohqsg
It is fun traveling to woodlands for 30min,btohqsg
Less than my traveling time lol,btohqsg
at least f2f they can't suddenly ask you come in last min,btohqsg
But I had pretty bad physical interview experiences  like in Jc I was interviewing for this scholarship  one of the interviewers literally told me ‘you looked really nervous’  but my cher liked me so close 2 eyes and I got it lmao,btohqsg
True this and I can take the train journey to perhaps calm myself down and meditate…but my stress symptoms (like GI / headache) is getting more prominent this days),btohqsg
But my nervous is very scary…like I will be shaking,btohqsg
And don’t let nervousness get to me,btohqsg
But it is visible in the eyes of the interviewers,btohqsg
And also somehow my legs will become jelly too,btohqsg
it's ok if they can tell you're nervous as long as you're able to still communicate your answers,btohqsg
But tbh most of the time  ok I think it need a skill to still talk properly when u are nervous,btohqsg
the skill is to not rush yourself to respond,btohqsg
it's ok to take a few moments to take deep breaths and clear your head,btohqsg
I think that is something I have not mastered,btohqsg
a well thought out answer after taking a bit of time is better than trying to respond within 2 seconds and being all over the place,btohqsg
U see now I hvnt set the date and I’m already having some GI stress symptoms,btohqsg
Like sometimes I try to calm myself down but it doesn’t work sia,btohqsg
And I feel I’m inconsistent  sometimes it goes ok  sometimes it goes like crap,btohqsg
when they ask smth  you gotta know what the point you're trying to make is,btohqsg
the more you just talk right  the more room you're giving yourself to fumble,btohqsg
How to cover a mind blank,btohqsg
It is farely common under nervousness the greatest enemy of all times,btohqsg
But I will try not to rush into response  maybe thinking that they are not devils,btohqsg
And I feel it is something I need to come out of the bubble,btohqsg
Else I wun survive entering the workforce,btohqsg
Start thinking of basic things like thinking how to read a ruler,btohqsg
The idea is to give your brain something to think about,btohqsg
Tbh idk if I should see a psychologist for my stress symptoms,btohqsg
Idk if it is normal and can’t be helped,btohqsg
"If let's say the interviewer ask ""What's your reason for joining"".... you think of a ruler  maths will come to mind and u have something to say",btohqsg
It's always about thinking of something small that leads to something bigger,btohqsg
