Wow  12 hours...How long has it been since I've slept for 12 hours. ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Aite imma go watch ton of sing china with subtitles in hopes of using those words for tmr chinese compre and compo,btohqsg
How bout just go to sleep,btohqsg
And remind yourself that Chinese is never gonna be in your emb3,btohqsg
I try my hardest for prelim still get grade 5,btohqsg
Ima try my hardest to try not to do work cause having 0 in your report book is amazing,btohqsg
Furthermore  I feel that gce chinese is less strict.I've been failing or scoring 50-51% for Chinese but I scored a 4 for N and O.,btohqsg
At least you got good English grade =_=,btohqsg
What happens when u did not write the composition qn number down for paper 1?,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t write number for my chinese P1 too,btohqsg
They will find the correct question,btohqsg
My Cher say they will mark the first question,btohqsg
Not sure if it is stated in the Cambridge report for past years....,btohqsg
Anyway  donâ€™t stress over this too much,btohqsg
AFAIK markers try their hardest to give you marks lol,btohqsg
They are probably not gonna penalise you for not writing question number,btohqsg
Hi guys sorry asking again haha does anyone remember their section C first qn answer,btohqsg
Like the one that u have to put in the letters,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t write anything for first question for section C,btohqsg
guys is it a must to not quote for evidence on the last qn for section b? for choosing either student a or b,btohqsg
It is best to put a custom quote,btohqsg
oh sry i meant paper 2,btohqsg
For last question in paper 2,btohqsg
If you say either a or b,btohqsg
You need to go to the text and check each sentences if it proves what a or b says,btohqsg
So itâ€™s easier if you understand the story better,btohqsg
Then you are more likely to find the evidence,btohqsg
oh yea same  but I quoted my evidence tho,btohqsg
If people ask how are you  you going to reply I ate chicken rice?,btohqsg
As for this  I'm not too sure about n level format.,btohqsg
Because if your paraphrasing let say is horrible,btohqsg
Then itâ€™s no choice for NA,btohqsg
It must make sense to the question,btohqsg
And if it change the meaning of you paraphrase,btohqsg
well hopefully it does becuz i messed up for paper 1,btohqsg
Then there would be chances that you would lose marks,btohqsg
So I recommend you to quote,btohqsg
No I paraphrase for paper 2,btohqsg
