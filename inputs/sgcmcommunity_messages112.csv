I thought nothing could be worse than 13.50 brakes with touradors,btohqsg
Go Carousell or tyre shop look for used ones.,btohqsg
Then you go to the factory itself to buy,btohqsg
You not able to get the rm5.50 tow fee kangtow like most of them can?? üòÖ,btohqsg

CUS LTA CHARGE PPL FOR BLOCKING THE ROAD,btohqsg
then they need time to patch the road back,btohqsg
suppose to get a roller to roll over to flatten it,btohqsg
they use just the excavator smack smack to flatten,btohqsg
so the overall road very bumpy,btohqsg
Sometimes expressways also got pot holes,btohqsg
Cus we all gng high speed,btohqsg
i nvr said high speed is 90,btohqsg
my car cannot lah. 18 inch max alr,btohqsg

not Hyundai? rencently got a Hyundai Kena stolen 4 wheels . car they dun wan üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Honda is the whole car steal,btohqsg
I heard BMW or Merc tougher to steal,btohqsg
true aso Merc n BM not as common there as in sg,btohqsg
Hyundai Kia aso safe . not popular there,btohqsg
i think they aim Jap cars  good quality and demand in secondary market,btohqsg
BuySafe means SGCM acts as middle man,btohqsg
warranty is just that  warranty by the dealer,btohqsg
then i think he ask about sgcm warranty also,btohqsg
Guessing it's not that  easy to get sgcm endorsement on the warranty  they'll be less likely to play punk,btohqsg
i rmb sgcm warranty is backed by toyota grp of  companies,btohqsg
heard some say claim procedure is long but if it covers it covers,btohqsg
So it depends on whether the victim wan to chase all the way or not,btohqsg
Parts on Koreans and JDMs also more in demand,btohqsg
So small  where will you run away,btohqsg

Remember kids  a condom is cheaper than baby products,btohqsg
wa speaking of the something that adds HP,btohqsg
SGCM really need filter their listing. alot dealers keep putting auto when its manual zz,btohqsg
Wah I think like one more 2.0 civic on the market,btohqsg
Not as ex as baby products,btohqsg
Try nego with owner if he can renew road tax if you confirm buy,btohqsg
But why the fella go put illegal tail lights on the posting,btohqsg
On the pricier side but I feel quite worth leh if you looking for a civic fd,btohqsg
Cause everything there already  no need wast time go ws put put things,btohqsg
12k depre for a coe car,btohqsg

Which was supposed to be affordable housing,btohqsg
i still trying to figure out why life so shit,btohqsg
i think that time i triggered over this,btohqsg
cus some foreigner he not local  comment  why need MOP as owner continue pay instalment? i dun see the problem,btohqsg
Okay but on a serious note  if I didn‚Äôt get my fd  I would get this fd,btohqsg
Now alot more people taking auto also,btohqsg
i wud get this if the depre not so high,btohqsg
eg like 9 to 10k ?,btohqsg
I got my fd for 7k depre,btohqsg
but we talking abt smth else,btohqsg
purpose of HDB is to provide affordable housing. By simply buying the house to make a profit means someone else who needs a house is deprived of it. Hence  we have minimum occupancy period. If someone who dont need a BTO is not staying in the house  it just means their intention was to make a profit. Plain and simple.,btohqsg
i think now the policy to fix BTO is gna be a whole new revamp.,btohqsg
You tio  you buy for me dc5r,btohqsg

a lot of cars claim to be low mileage also,btohqsg
but we know for sure that high loan is always available weeheee,btohqsg
Wow seems like a good buy for a decent price!,btohqsg
Hope someone gets it off the market soon,btohqsg
Viewing also very flexible I believe,btohqsg
Ya axlemotors closes at 9:30 IIRC,btohqsg
