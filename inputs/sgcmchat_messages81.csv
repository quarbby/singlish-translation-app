AIYO U THINK I SO DUMB AH,btohqsg
Need to check state and rust of the car  may have underlying mechanical errors?,btohqsg
Usually my experience with lancers is that they deteriorate w time so gotta look out for that.,btohqsg
Actually I was also considering an 86 after the E's COE expires next year,btohqsg
was looking at the 14' 15' models,btohqsg
But I'm a total noob when it comes down to modern jdm,btohqsg
Honestly I think unless the 86 has been used and abused badly it should be fine? Just don't buy a gymkhana car  or any sort of tracked ones.,btohqsg
Anything I shld look out for?,btohqsg
Uh like normal problems  I'd say power steering line?,btohqsg
Actually i wouldnt reccomend getting a GT86 if u can find a RX8 or a sports car with a bigger interior.,btohqsg
Just get a prepurchase inspection  should cover all of it mostly.,btohqsg
I heard the RX8's stupid unreliable tho,btohqsg
It depends how you maintain it  rotarys have a bad rep but if you take car of it it should be fine :),btohqsg
My main problem with the GT86 is the cramped interior,btohqsg
