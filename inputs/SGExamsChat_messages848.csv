oh yea anything writing related  the moment the tool switches from blue/black pens to color..it gets real,btohqsg
It is evidence for truth but you can also manipulate truth,btohqsg
There's a book that reconciles stats with math,btohqsg
It's pulling all the weight here u mean,btohqsg
Formal introduction to probability using Borel fields etc.,btohqsg
I've always thought that like  you have to give people the context for stats to make it interesting,btohqsg
what are the odds of pulling a 5*,btohqsg
the interesting part of stats is the applications,btohqsg
suddenly the class sits up straight,btohqsg
i appreciated it more when i started diving into deep learning,btohqsg
"""and therefore the expected value for pulling a 5* is X  but the standard deviation tells us that there is a large 95% confidence interval for when you'll pull one and you should all try to find a well-paying job""",btohqsg
Math says that we shld bealieve that god is real,btohqsg
i mean i use it daily,btohqsg
if i don't enter academia I will probably enter AI / quant,btohqsg
A lot of physics stuff requires some form of computer simulation and coding,btohqsg
yes but like i also look into the algorithms that hedge funds etc use,btohqsg
it's right there at the top of every jupyter notebook,btohqsg
For me  I'd rather join education sector,btohqsg
I definitely cannot handle a job with money,btohqsg
I thought about academia but the advice I got from a lot of profs and reddit is to go private a few years first,btohqsg
quant is looking more and more likely since i value the stability as opposed to academia,btohqsg
I'd love to do that  reallyBut I don't want to get paid like sh*t,btohqsg
it's still a type of research,btohqsg
learn the soft skills and taste the money before you decide to do a PhD,btohqsg
You also considered the profession of teaching / research?,btohqsg
probs depends on the course too,btohqsg
i was kinda encouraged to do some form of science communication. my prof said i'm good at it,btohqsg
I did! ended up in economics and almost did actuarial science,btohqsg
but then I remembered I'm not actually good at the math-y parts of math,btohqsg
I have thought on going to theatre studies before,btohqsg
it's the logic part that I'm better at,btohqsg
Like the nus one  double major in physics and theatre studies,btohqsg
man  if you tried an olympiadwho knows,btohqsg
We need more physicists doing cna documentaries,btohqsg
i'm just chilling until i graduate rn,btohqsg
Like i see myself in science comm more than physics hahaha,btohqsg
and actuary stuff is very competitive  because they prefer to hire pure math majors,btohqsg
Oh s**t it's in 4 days,btohqsg
i think i'm decent at teaching so that's always a backup,btohqsg
i taught my class before actually,btohqsg
like honestly it's not that uncommon to see pure math to quant fin/actuarial science pipeline,btohqsg
i was wyatt's TA in uni lol,btohqsg
Man was shocked he got a B3 and A2 for Pure phy and chem,btohqsg
do we get rich on quant,btohqsg
i'm hoping to nail a perfect raw 6,btohqsg
I did a practical lesson on O level titration for a private sch,btohqsg
the guys with multiple IMO gold medals,btohqsg
i'm talking about the work position like quant is very broad as an industry,btohqsg
slog it out a few years in nyc or london too,btohqsg
did you study local or abroad?,btohqsg
like i'm hoping to land my intern at citadel for quant researcher,btohqsg
that itself pays 20k a month,btohqsg
I wanna work in science centre one day,btohqsg
that's a phd level position so makes sense,btohqsg
Oh and then jcs also have that astar program also,btohqsg
I can buy 20000 / 5 = 4000 chicken rice per month,btohqsg
And then got those doing h3 sciences,btohqsg
oh yea i got one of my mentees an astar intern just by emailing my old supervisor,btohqsg
abroad! but not like immediately out of JC,btohqsg
do you need a PhD for citadel or smth,btohqsg
ooh  us or uk? or where?,btohqsg
they have bachelor level positions too,btohqsg
They hired me when i was yr 2,btohqsg
had like a year off working before going to the UK,btohqsg
my mentee is fresh out of jc,btohqsg
what is a 4.5 in year 1,btohqsg
Yea i deleted that realising he doesnt know about gpas yet,btohqsg
Rlly like poly gpa but uni gpa is on another level,btohqsg
Uni gpa is out of 5,btohqsg
Anyways what jc are u aiming for tho,btohqsg
My prelim got me a raw 7 so I'm aiming for a raw 6,btohqsg
I did a double degree in london! üòÅ,btohqsg
Did you go to Imperial or Oxbridge or KCL or someplace?,btohqsg
I'm considering London to study at,btohqsg
I was in UCL and in Paris for like both degrees,btohqsg
I was so scared of my results I actually thought abt sutd once,btohqsg
london is expensive but I liked it more than paris tbh,btohqsg
my friend really wants to enter sorbonne,btohqsg
Isn't the distance far or smth?,btohqsg
the first two years were in france so I needed like  some proficiency in french  but the last two years were in london,btohqsg
some of the courses required fluency in french (or whatever language they're taught in)  but that's fine it's mostly introductory modules and courses,btohqsg
so  it's a joint programme I suppose?,btohqsg
it's a pretty niche degree but that's always been the plan,btohqsg
Wait  there are self producing K-pop groups?,btohqsg
BOYNEXTDOOR KNOCK ON Vol.1 Tour In SGüé§‚ú®  Self-producing all-rounder Kpop group  BOYNEXTDOOR is set to captivate audiences in Singapore with their first solo concertüìÖ 15 Mar (Sat)‚è∞ 7PMüéü From $178üìç Arena @ EXPO Hall 7Get tickets here:tco.sg/mSCMeNWHx‚û°Ô∏è For more upcoming concerts  check out thispost!@sgnewmovies,btohqsg
self-producing refers to music groups that do their own music compositions  songwriting and creative writing,btohqsg
most of the time  it's one or two members mainly working on the behind-the-scenes work of single EP (song),btohqsg
but there are several instances where groups will have ALL their members doing something aside from the usual singing / rapping / dancing,btohqsg
this is also my first time hearing of them,btohqsg
i think there are q a lot,btohqsg
but cus they are under a company is technically not self producing anym,btohqsg
they produce their own music but they are under jyp entertainment,btohqsg
i just realised so many kpop groups had their agencies  companies or studios acquired by HYBE,btohqsg
the ppl who advertised their cheating services are so hopeless,btohqsg
just because it works for the exams in some other nation doesn't mean its supported in singapore ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
guys if someone ask for tuition services on xhs  is it a scam ?,btohqsg
i saw a post and i‚Äôm intrigued by the pay. $60 per hour to tutor chinese,btohqsg
that sounds too good to be true,btohqsg
international sch so yea it's reasonable,btohqsg
but if u go to uni econs u have to touch some stats,btohqsg
oh hey haven't spoken to you in a while,btohqsg
did you survive the past sem,btohqsg
It was the finals i thought was easiest,btohqsg
Im just glad i never have to see a bra or a ket again,btohqsg
Unless its a bra or a cat,btohqsg
ARE THEY GONNA COME OUT AGAIN?,btohqsg
I keep getting super sus at prof chew's bell curve i swear,btohqsg
altho i tio stunned from he2003 and ee2103 bell curves lol,btohqsg

international syllabus A Level results came out today,btohqsg
i still waiting on the toyota sienta comfort delgro to actually turn up on the street,btohqsg
yea then they debutting as a new online operator this yr,btohqsg
Hello so we can chat about school matters here?,btohqsg
its anything basically that is not nsfw or political,btohqsg
When do you think election will happen this year?,btohqsg
Do you think there is any actual possibility of the opposition becoming the main party in parliament?,btohqsg
i mean in the future anything is possible but this yr pap still gonna win,btohqsg
my prediction is that wp keeps aljunied hougang and sengkang,btohqsg
but idk if they will win anywhere else and im nt optimistic,btohqsg
and i thought she carried wp in east coast,btohqsg
wp doesn't need her to carry,btohqsg
one day  just dunno when.Lky also predicted it will come one day I think.,btohqsg
wait then who r the pap ppl in east coast now still hsk ah,btohqsg
And that's the reason for the 2nd key by the elected president,btohqsg
that time the voters want to be PM ward I guess,btohqsg
Depends on TCB running a not,btohqsg
do u guys think there is gerrymandering,btohqsg
there will always be.LHL said before  no political party wants the other to win.,btohqsg
which makes sense  but easily taken out of context,btohqsg
SG opposition election talks can be quite interesting.,btohqsg
there's 1 main thing I think they need to resolve. And really not easy to do soFast rising housing prices.I don't know how you guys can afford it next time,btohqsg
I tried volunteer for them but no events lol,btohqsg
one 4-rm or 5-rm BTO can hitch up to nearly 1mil,btohqsg
if u add in resale flats.. wah,btohqsg
BTO not yet  but upwards of 500k to 700k already i think.Unless choose the ulu ulu areas  where u need to spend more time and $$ on transport,btohqsg
some BTO projects with very good prospects (ideal location  good facilities neighbour  decent view) easily already hit up more than 800k,btohqsg
sound good hor. I stupid cuz EC same timing as my time  Esparina  going for 800 psf.Now resale at 1300 psf,btohqsg
that time we could afford up to 800k max max max. so actually could have bought.,btohqsg
800k would be same as 4 rm flat,btohqsg
On ST Wondering how to fund your post-secondary education this new year?Here's a Q&A guide to help you navigate the various options available.,btohqsg
but 800k could sell at 1.3 to 1.5m  earn 700kjust buy any resale hdb still have a lot left,btohqsg
hdb cant be sold more than a condo tho..so if hdb prices gonna rise..then private property prices gonna rise as well..recently HDB enbloc 333 units for 700million to a private condo developer..2nd largest sale in en bloc history,btohqsg
future hdb en bloc will be more unlikely,btohqsg
right now they are doing tanglin halt,btohqsg
A 12-year-old boy who allegedly hit his classmate‚Äôs head with a bottle is helping police with investigations.The victim suffered a cut on his head and was taken to hospital.,btohqsg
I never follow liaoChange strategy instead cuz need to stay with in laws to take care of them instead. Their place is big,btohqsg
so I rent out my flat,btohqsg
i thought enbloc estates are usually targeted to future land development  instead of buying a single flat?,btohqsg
but tanglin halt is sers not en bloc,btohqsg
i love the mandarin political debates most,btohqsg
in terms of yield %  hdb gives good yield,btohqsg
yea future land development but to private entities as well,btohqsg
we always have opposition candidates with poor command of the language speaking and becoming memes out of it,btohqsg
sers is a kind of enbloc  can la,btohqsg
I'm guessing most of us have even better command of our mother tongue than those opposition candidates lol,btohqsg
future land development is a general term which includes private entities,btohqsg
but they dare to take the stage and talk,btohqsg
"if not go on stage""we also have a plan""",btohqsg
Sure they dare to go up  just embarrass themselves only,btohqsg
Hahaha still rmb hsk's east coast plan,btohqsg
doesn't matter  it's still admirable in its own way,btohqsg
But PAP's representative is always Ong Ye Kung,btohqsg
seeing all the recent government politics in sg makes me wanna laugh and cry  almost like a madman,btohqsg
usually private entities gives the largest yield for properties under the en bloc scheme,btohqsg
im just stating smth casually tho  dun hv to go into all the details,btohqsg
its a agree or disagree thing (yes/no)  ntg in between,btohqsg
the prob is enbloc is not always a govt decision,btohqsg
??? why are you bringing in so many extra details to consolidate your talk,btohqsg
At the end of the day Singapore is ruled by demand and supply constraints. Can't be everything also blame government,btohqsg
when you mention future land development..not nessecary..a buyer can buy that plot of land and do nothing lol,btohqsg
HDB prices weren't always ruled by demand by supply. They changed the policy years ago to be so,btohqsg
it was based on cost to build eons ago,btohqsg
And I don't think land costs were included that time,btohqsg
do u think that will happen  with the current government in sg?,btohqsg
But if it was based on cost to build  everyone would be rushing to get a house right now,btohqsg
when HDB said it operates at a loss  it's because of the land cost,btohqsg
then that's where their planning failed,btohqsg
Like now  we have some youngsters who are living rent-free at home,btohqsg
supply is also controlled by HDB,btohqsg
But based on masterplan there's a limit to proportion of residential areas too,btohqsg
govt say enough land to house everyone,btohqsg
it's not a lie. They just build higher and smaller,btohqsg
there's no more executive or mansionette BTOs liao,btohqsg
Means future houses will get smaller?,btohqsg
everyone supposed to stay in smaller HDBs  but still encouraged to have more kidssqueeze pls üòÇ,btohqsg
Not everyone want to stay in a small apartment lol.,btohqsg
"""you only need a small space to ....""",btohqsg
"reminds me of the phrase ""you will have nothing  but you will be happy"" lol",btohqsg
there are empty hdb flats waiting to be enbloc dotted all over sg..the govt vacated those flats but they are still standing awaiting demolition..some of these flats have stayed vacant with no plans for them,btohqsg
Actly wat will happen when it ends,btohqsg
Idt gahmen will just throw u to the streets or smth,btohqsg
but we die before it happens usually,btohqsg
They take back your house  you get nothing,btohqsg
yea  when eunosville was vacated it still had 71 years..private buyer negotiated with the govt..and eunosville was cleared,btohqsg
I mean like pass down to ur kids or smth ofc,btohqsg
essentially you're paying rental to the govt,btohqsg
In sg no land is yours lol,btohqsg
Fair unless u too much money,btohqsg
flats standing for 50+ years are already a civil danger for residents,btohqsg
i suppose there're houses older than 200 years that have yet to collapse,btohqsg
they can buy their own new 99 yr lease flats,btohqsg
I'll leave mine for them to sell for their inheritance,btohqsg
Wat if they spend needlessly tho just curious,btohqsg
if I'm dead  it doesn't matter,btohqsg
I can only teach them how to manage.,btohqsg
i mean eitherway the govt will refurbished and renovate the older hdbs...if they were to be demolished even a decade on,btohqsg
just know the people that earn a lot now  many of them didn't do very well at O lvl,btohqsg
I only got 1 choice i rly want then its a steep fall off from thr lol,btohqsg
the govt will still tear down these 31 block of flats after spending money to renovate them for temporary use,btohqsg
Still recall my days collecting results for national papers,btohqsg
hi guys  do you know any video editing software that don‚Äôt require to pay fr watermarks. i hv always use capcut but my asst require one w/o it,btohqsg
I'm using a program that has a shark on it,btohqsg
Singapore needs a change of government,btohqsg
Anyways good luck for those collecting their o lvl results tmr!Remember that whatever result you get  take it in your stride  plan your next course of action; going to jc? Poly? Ite? What subjects are you going to study? What course do you want to take? Fully take advantage of the open houses that are running islandwide and find out where your interests lie.,btohqsg
Heh. Thought they got give students free subscription?,btohqsg

Still rmb how CJC used to be a mid tier jc,btohqsg
"some fella offering ghost writing services for assignments & ""tuition"" for fkin over $20 per consultation",btohqsg
Ghost writing for $20 is crazy,btohqsg
can't ghost write your way to uni,btohqsg
Bro better help me write a whole book that I could sell to kids as storybook,btohqsg
Oh. Most of us use chatgpt nowadays,btohqsg
Chatgpt 4.3 is the new trend,btohqsg
you can't ghost write in uni i think,btohqsg
as a mathematician i am impressed (sarcastic),btohqsg
It failed to do a Stanford 2025 problem,btohqsg
They are a good starting point,btohqsg
You have to specific to what you input,btohqsg
how do you change the sizes of key inputs?,btohqsg
We do not use * in actual mathematics,btohqsg
Unless you talk about stuff like Kleene closures etc. in theoretical computer science,btohqsg
idk chatgpt said that there are diff sizes,btohqsg
That's the only occurrence of * in typeset contexts,btohqsg
I think ChatGPT means that * is used when you can't type in √ó,btohqsg
Idk why they give you liddat,btohqsg
a * b need not denote multiplication,btohqsg
how are there so many diff asterisk,btohqsg
* is very common as some operation in group theory,btohqsg
I guess chatgpt is quite subjective,btohqsg
It alters depending on different people accounts I suppose,btohqsg
i asked that  this was my first result,btohqsg
chatgpt is still useful if you can break it down into specific concepts,btohqsg
it's obviously not going to solve a question from start to end,btohqsg
the most useful for me using chatgpt is coding a whole website from scratch,btohqsg
every single component 1 prompt at a time,btohqsg
also if he's legit a phd student  he's kinda stupid for putting it here when he's offering things like that,btohqsg
that same dude mentioned he was from ite/poly not too long as well so,btohqsg
Why wld u put that in ur bio,btohqsg
Bro thinks this is linkedin or sth,btohqsg
It's the day of O level results guysss,btohqsg
Lol guy tried too desperately to offer his academic services to me,btohqsg
Shot him down at every opportunity,btohqsg
My answer to him: there's nothing google and chatgpt can't do for me,btohqsg
have.making sure you know all the different ways and methods that examiners can test you in examsPure conceptual knowledge  while useful  doesn't mean can help you answer exam questions in the best possible way.,btohqsg
eg O level kinematics  I have 12 different ways in which calculation questions could test students. I also have a few compilation of the most common explanation questions.This one chatgpt can't do. Probably can hit a few  but who would be satisfied with just a few if the aim is to ace the exams?,btohqsg
then again  that guy is probably a scammer that would use chatgpt to do the job anyway.,btohqsg
You can just try not to be caught üòÇ,btohqsg
Good Luck And All The Best For The O Level Results Release Later!,btohqsg
The amount of Plagarism checkers and AI generated bot detectors,btohqsg
Good luck for O Level Results. Just remember O Level is just a checkpoint. You can always revisit and retake.  It‚Äôs not an end all judgement day.,btohqsg
anyone else been getting shit tons of scam callers lately,btohqsg
i got someone claiming to be from alipay calling me about some automatic payment deduction system and how my current balance would be charged a fee when i don‚Äôt even have an alipay account lmao,btohqsg
I think everyone‚Äôs been getting it. Almost got caught with it be careful everyone ‚òòÔ∏è,btohqsg
Yeah confirm  the other day just reported only,btohqsg
they are evolving sia  using local numbers now,btohqsg
i hang up they immediately call with another number,btohqsg
Heard they are not traceable I think,btohqsg
it's the same guy using the same few tactics LOLi got 10+ calls from different numbers and the same guy  asking me to help him with wechat verification??,btohqsg
yeah  once u check all these numbers with the ScamShield app-- it comes out unverified,btohqsg
Was wondering if telco can deactivate prepaid sim cards for misuse ...,btohqsg
oh is that why scamshield doesn‚Äôt seem to be blocking this few waves of scam callers,btohqsg
Speaking of scams be very careful about making friends online too... even video calls can be faked these days,btohqsg
all the e-telcos offering 5G contract plans,btohqsg
hard to say  a lot of solutions involving a company & government ends up being overcomplicated ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Anyone here going Poly or JC soon ?,btohqsg
Feels so weird to be in ach,btohqsg
Actually JC and Poly notes some are compatible with each other üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
The context was about my course lol,btohqsg
Wait ... kinematics? You mean like speed time graph and etc.,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall‚Äôs number on black market Ah,btohqsg
Why get called so often üòÇ,btohqsg
there's smth wrong with sg telcos,btohqsg
which i dare to say has affected at least 10% of ppl with a singapore contact number,btohqsg
Our education system is quite tolerant of failing üòÖüòÖ hear me out if you think otherwise.... ite is not designed to discriminate students as intended   it is more of a place for students with not so good grades to have a fresh start,btohqsg
Limit's more about the contrast with the common mindset with sg education  rather than the actual education system,btohqsg
Yeah it's true. Got some friends go ITE  then end up going to poly and smashing it. But mindset needs to change,btohqsg
what is commonly taught might not work the best for u,btohqsg
it's more of a trial and error process for every individual,btohqsg
Some ppl like me got lucky but not all are that lucky though  sure  studying is trial and error in a way but ppl like me got it right the first few tries while other people have to try more to discover how they should study and what path suits them,btohqsg
Besides   ite students are also important  they are responsible for fixing electrical supply lines and maintenance of equipment needed to empower communities  if somehow vocational education were to dissappear   many things will break down over time,btohqsg
my mum ask me to send her results,btohqsg
eh i wish i skip today leh,btohqsg
singpass takes like few months lol,btohqsg
i cant teleport to the school,btohqsg
u shld receive an email w ur resultd,btohqsg
SEAB website did not mention Singpass for School Candidates,btohqsg
please call your school or form teacher,btohqsg
i bloked all of them lol,btohqsg
anyway you need to call your school,btohqsg
2 minutes b4 my break ends,btohqsg
just saw. Both school and private candidates will receive a digital copy of Form A via their registered e-mail addresses from 3pm on Jan 10  which will show the candidates‚Äô O-level results and courses for which they are eligible to apply.,btohqsg
i wanna know how i did,btohqsg

uh how do they know my email,btohqsg
so in 1 minute ill know,btohqsg
bro i shouldve taken a later break,btohqsg

Congrats for getting A2 for English,btohqsg
chim english also get bullied in ite so idek,btohqsg
Which industry are you interested to go?,btohqsg
I have seen 2 of my friends doing ite after receiving o levels,btohqsg
1 did pretty well to enter poly  the other one didnt do so well and had to go a diff course,btohqsg
But both of them were pretty neutral in the end,btohqsg
atp u cant enter all poly courses,btohqsg
even nsg requires c6 sci and c6 maths,btohqsg
Have heard pretty mixed opinions abt the school,btohqsg
Some pros would be taking H2 POA or H2 MOB which is part of the commerce stream,btohqsg
Have met some people in uni from MI,btohqsg
guys if i D7 english but avg B3s for Os can appeal to rp biz ?,btohqsg
Downside is 3 years uh so it will be slightly longer than normal(plus have heard of people struggling to move up  but I wld say if you work hard enuf maybe can rise),btohqsg
broo this is so confusing sia,btohqsg
OH I MESSED UP SO BAD,btohqsg
okok I'll try sia I think,btohqsg
my compre was so badmy essay i did within 30 mins,btohqsg
For the eligible courses how am i offered C47 for nanyang when it has a cutoff point of 11?,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just courses that u meet the min subject reqs i think‚Ä¶doesnt mean u meet the cutoff,btohqsg
Idk how i am eligible for many courses that have low cutoff points when i have a high net score,btohqsg
Anyone else also the same last time or is it an error for me?,btohqsg
I think is like what he said,btohqsg
I wld say if you are pretty unsure abt what to do yet  MI is a good choice,btohqsg
But if your roughly roughly know what industry you want  can try considering poly (unless you want to try medicine or law those kinds),btohqsg
If you considering about uni  can consider mi first but also do look up at some poly open houses also,btohqsg
I would somewhat recommend MI uh,btohqsg
To be fair  a lot of the low tier schools the culture arent really that strong,btohqsg
But I would say if you mix with the right crowd and right support  might have chance uh,btohqsg
But just know that when you come MI,btohqsg
You are not only competiting with MI,btohqsg
You are competiting among the A level crowd,btohqsg
Mugging is an independent choice btw,btohqsg
As long as your own choice of mugging method don't break down coz of influences,btohqsg
I cant really advise because the teachers i knew back when i was in MI all transferred to other jcs,btohqsg
But my experience there was not terrible,btohqsg
Half a decade ago  but yes,btohqsg
irwen the milo who never reply my msg,btohqsg
oh yes u need a reset,btohqsg
ya why does the sge domain keep logging me out,btohqsg
Yup   projects ofc cannot mug uh üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Can. Is possible. But is team effort uh.,btohqsg
During Poly days I seen slackers,btohqsg
My math teacher used to say,btohqsg
Only difference between RI and MI,btohqsg
Needless to say i failed h2 math,btohqsg
My chinese teacher say other ppl aim for A  for us  we set bar lower and aim for S,btohqsg
Because i didnt take A math LOL,btohqsg
And my silly ass thought i could do h2 math,btohqsg
And now im just suffering in uni too because my math is ass,btohqsg
I dont think ive successfully solved an integral ever,btohqsg
I just write down the steps and pray to god,btohqsg
what is your objective of taking A level,btohqsg
the way that schools teach it  and how most students see it  is hard,btohqsg
vectors is the most hardest topic,btohqsg
You still gotta do it anyway,btohqsg
vectors was among easiest for me,btohqsg
But once you manage it youll be fine,btohqsg
No point mulling its hard yknow,btohqsg
hard part is 3D visualisation  that itself is hard for many,btohqsg
Oh you dont need to visualise,btohqsg
do u have any tips on how to visualise?,btohqsg
as what Wyatt mentioned  one way is draw out,btohqsg
Drawing is visualisation without using your imagination and going to the 4th dimension,btohqsg
difference is  if you graduate MI with A lvl cert but cannot qualify uni  A lvl cert is quite useless compared to poly cert,btohqsg
how many dimensions are in alvl vectors,btohqsg
The 4th one is time.But that's physics.,btohqsg
Draw 3d shapes using 2d paper,btohqsg
what's your O lvl score again?,btohqsg
And many MI students end up like that,btohqsg
If A Maths no min B3  then don't take H2 Math,btohqsg
in fact B3 will still struggle for H2 Math,btohqsg
If only someone told me this,btohqsg
But then i didnt even get F9,btohqsg
Feel like B3 is still possible.,btohqsg
Eng b3 rest A2  amth emath a1,btohqsg
But C5 is a hell no,btohqsg
Its my only choice  only step up for me really was nyjc but was far out,btohqsg
possible. cuz for some students is dunno what happened dropped to B3. Normal standards higher.So I cut off at B3,btohqsg
It is possible to do that in yi uh,btohqsg
possible. I have had students who did that. Have to work super hard,btohqsg
The jump from emath to h2 math is pretty far,btohqsg
Tho sometimes wasnt my hand but my brain lol so rly saved me,btohqsg
You need to actually know the CAST thing to under complex numbers quite well,btohqsg
im glad my school forced everyone to take amath,btohqsg
what's that ah? I never used it,btohqsg
Complex numbers was natural for me,btohqsg
But like you know the 4 quadrants thing,btohqsg
Using this score am i able to get into a course with 25 cut-off point using DAE? Anyone can share any past experience or knowledge?,btohqsg
ah last time my time was ASTC,btohqsg
For us  we use cast cus easiest to remember,btohqsg
Plus feel like h2 fm is becoming more suited for uni stuff,btohqsg
Now with conic and math induction gone,btohqsg
H2 math dont have vector calc,btohqsg
Ok tbh is more of multivariable calc than vector calc,btohqsg
Oh but tbh h2 math has stats and probability,btohqsg
That one may or may not wreck your brains a bit but is also onenof the easier ones,btohqsg
ok I need to do some work. Anyone needs any discussions / suggestions on what is possible  feel free to dm me anytime.Those who do well can also consider prepping your CCA portfolio in JC for potential scholarships application (something that I didn't do when I was in JC cuz I didn't know about it),btohqsg
Until they left an onion in the lecture theatre,btohqsg
got for it.Generally people take PCME because it opens more doors.My own combi was replace C with FM but that's like 24 years ago,btohqsg
Honestly h2 chem was a headache,btohqsg
From experience  poly engineering student study similar stats as h1 Math,btohqsg
J1 H2 Physics new syllabus for those going JC. Do take note,btohqsg
I think is similar to h2 math,btohqsg
specimen paper is at SEAB. Can just download and keep first,btohqsg
So if Poly engineering student want grind Stats,btohqsg
interesting  no more mega practical planning,btohqsg
My 120 pages compilation final year for use liao üò≠,btohqsg
hello question for poly mates here is there any restrictions for phone usage in poly?,btohqsg
My cher gave me a look i tot was bad,btohqsg
But she looked at me cus i was gonna go on stage lmfao,btohqsg
I really cannot find the planning qn eh,btohqsg
Something feels weird for the h2 physics practical lmao,btohqsg
ya lor. It was free marks,btohqsg
"Why am i seeing ""capacitence"" in h2 phy prac lmao",btohqsg
Poly allow use phone in class,btohqsg
Why the h2 phy learning rc circuits now uh,btohqsg
No  but phone usage is usually at the discretion of faci/lecturers,btohqsg
capacitance is in the new syllabus,btohqsg
I was sitting down she gave me a glance,btohqsg
Nvm found the planning qn hahaha,btohqsg
I tot was bad look but it meant i was gonna go on stage,btohqsg
that's the 6 marks mini planning?,btohqsg
my eng  math was terrible 6‚É£,btohqsg
Feel like i have seen something like this before,btohqsg
ya  current practicals have 1 mini and 1 mega planning,btohqsg
But hor i find it odd eh,btohqsg
the mega planning is practically free marks if follow my template.,btohqsg
Why they need use spreadsheet uh,btohqsg
H2 Phy is the first science sub to use it,btohqsg
I tot my hist wld get a1,btohqsg
Didnt expect e and a math since they r so competitive,btohqsg
Next iteration of physics syllabus  yall use python,btohqsg
Does Business courses in University requires knowledge of H2/H3 Math?,btohqsg
Actually I have seen them use an integral sign uh,btohqsg
At most h2 math stats side,btohqsg
If anyone wants h2 stats materials for preparation for poly/jc I think I have it uploaded somewhere,btohqsg
A pity since i had got A for the other 3 subjects,btohqsg
B3 el  everything a2 except humans c6,btohqsg
Rly sad his humans pull him down,btohqsg
is he good at humans previously (before o level)?,btohqsg
Oh damn h2 chemistry incrwased the organic chemistry portion,btohqsg
Now h2 chem need to learn about polymers...,btohqsg
my own O lvl years ago  only humanities C6,btohqsg
I quite wacked hist/ss tot i it wld be my A1,btohqsg
Ya humans rly u either got it or dh,btohqsg
I did not prepare for Geography,btohqsg
Shocking realised that h3 physics need to know special relativity also lmao,btohqsg
if now i would have did better for Geography because food resources was removed,btohqsg
Anyone here not on the r/sgexams subreddit?,btohqsg
That one is essentials of modern physics ?,btohqsg
Seab used to offer it as separate subject....oh I see,btohqsg
new moe h3 phy syllabus since 2017 that covers more topics,btohqsg
h3 moe phy drop the gravitational stuff and added special relativity,btohqsg
Special relativity the concept I can understand but not the math,btohqsg
If anyone here want to start mugging for Poly or JC/MI h1/h2 stats tell me   I can help a bit,btohqsg
I just found out from my working partners the materials link gt posted in r/sgexams üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Advise pls üò≠üò≠üò≠I got 22 for my l1r5 but I still have my combined science which I got  an A2 cause I retook so if I add that plus my Bio score which is B3 instead of my chem score which I got c6 because I did btr in it I wld get 19 can I mention that to appeal to yijc,btohqsg
think got 1 student did something like this before 2 years ago.Changed username  so I forgot who üò≠But the JAE system should have recorded your previous score  and give you the updated L1R5 or L1R4 or ELR2B2 automatically. Best to call MOE to check if not sure  than to ask here,btohqsg
Admin I want to ask sth,btohqsg
Is sharing of free math materials allowed here ?,btohqsg
As long as you don't promote anything or link it to some external site,btohqsg
I got eae but surprisingly I did better and I can go JC   anyway to cancel eae ?,btohqsg
Just make sure it's not SEAB stuff,btohqsg
I like promoting the A level study chat,btohqsg
Ei I made a website for my notes cuz holygrail Idk how to reupload my files,btohqsg
No  u committed when u eae,btohqsg
Can   but it depends on your luck.,btohqsg
Write into the JC and appeal .,btohqsg
No  it's a project I programmed,btohqsg
This is only I can upload,btohqsg
Btw if uw I can help u put the stuff here on grail,btohqsg
This seems to have SEAB stuff,btohqsg
That's copyrighted so I won't put into grail,btohqsg
I retain all copyright over it,btohqsg
