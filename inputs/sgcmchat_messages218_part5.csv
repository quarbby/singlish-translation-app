ours was an 06 Leggy so,btohqsg
plant one mentally deranged xdd to chase down the owners there with unlimited data and a shitty android phone and u have your 24h cam,btohqsg
he message a lot of people,btohqsg
he is just being nice man  if you dont like him just ignore? or block?,btohqsg
he even said sorry for bothering ...I dont get the issue?,btohqsg
tell us what we don't get,btohqsg
There is a lack of kindness in this world  and when people try to step out of their way to be nice and welcoming this is what they get in return,btohqsg
some idiot wants the admin to kick someone out just because the eprson wajted to welcome him and say hi??,btohqsg
we've got alot of reports about this user alr,btohqsg
basically every single person that joins he dms,btohqsg
but what did he do that's what im curious about,btohqsg
Welcoming someone with a DM is fine,btohqsg
how else do u welcome someone?,btohqsg
A bit creepy to me but fine,btohqsg
i think there was worse but he toned down la,btohqsg
Unless he tried to like harass someone,btohqsg
"bro probably said ""yoooo welcome in""ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£",btohqsg
u lot settle it amongst yourselves,btohqsg
How much for 3.2 litre VR6 from Volkswagen Golf R32,btohqsg
@Mxitlxndtry not to dm every single person that joins esp if you dk them,btohqsg
My bad  I'll try and refrain from this,btohqsg
Hi everyone! Check out this place for diecastLike and comment on the video ü´∂,btohqsg
The first one of these I've seen in SG. They should bring more in  beautiful cars imo.,btohqsg
they COULD have brought more in,btohqsg
but very little demand for these unfortunately,btohqsg
most of the Genesis we have here would've been management units.,btohqsg
komoco management uses ioniq 6 nowadays?,btohqsg
i know one of the 5Ns belongs to someone higher up,btohqsg
Those cars are also quite striking. Catches my eye more than the Taycans and other electric cars.,btohqsg
saw the demo runs at TAS this year. Taniguchi hooned the i5N around like it was just another hot hatch,btohqsg
Instant torque from the electric motors ah,btohqsg
was thrown around as if it was 1.7/1.8 tbh,btohqsg
Yeah  that's one thing a lot of reviewers agree on as well. Helps mask the weight of the car,btohqsg
my friends who were given the press cars at launch loved it,btohqsg
they were flown out to Hyundai to test it  glowing reviews,btohqsg
I haven't heard a bad thing about it from any reviews also  only some complain about the fake engine sound being pumped into the cabin,btohqsg
But iirc  can just turn off,btohqsg
the fake shifting seems fun tbh,btohqsg
but if given a choice between a normal EV or one with the option to fake shift i'd take the latter,btohqsg
Gives the car more character too,btohqsg
best 2 car solution is 2 genesis,btohqsg
i didn't say which genesis tho,btohqsg
Hi everyone! üëãI‚Äôm new to the automotive world and just started out as a sales consultant about a month ago!I wanted to share a quick video of one of the cars I‚Äôm currently selling.Would love for you to check out my first video:https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSMJhTjT3/If you enjoy it  feel free to drop a like and follow! No pressure  but your support would mean a lot to me as I‚Äôm getting started.Thank you so much in advance and I hope you like the video!üòä,btohqsg
oh i think i saw this on the road recently,btohqsg
but anyways admin team will clear this. please read our chat description or clear promotions with admins in advance,btohqsg
sweet. just a heads up to run through potential sales posts with us before you post next time!,btohqsg
Ohh okay i see! Sorry for missing this outüôè,btohqsg
People will rather buy an Mercedes E class with zero options  then buy a fully optioned Genesis,btohqsg
It's also the same reason you don't see too many Honda Accords on sg roads,btohqsg
For the price  people rather buy C180 with nothing inside,btohqsg
