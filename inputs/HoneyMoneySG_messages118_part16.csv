Yes lol -$5 service fee. Already asked for waiver.,btohqsg
You tell me if can. Cuz I also want to ask 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Wait a few days it will appear on your app 🤣Or call UOB to ask.,btohqsg
Need to wait and see. Subject to approval.,btohqsg
"Well  this signifies something else againWe been receiving bonus interests   without adhering to the 30 days ruleIf its ""always in place"" it means it's not enforced",btohqsg
Okay. UOB staff not confident  I asked if I withdraw on 1 Jun $150k  now 1st July I put in or 2nd July out in.Staff cannot confirm  said need 2-3 days to check with relevant department and get back to me.But staff also said the 1st July - 31 Sept (Promotion period) remains no matter which date I deposit my funds.Because 1 Jun also covered under the clause of 30 days before 1st July (Promotion period).WLWLWLBBQL,btohqsg
Yeah. But habc it’s hard to check.It’s not as simple as 30 days  but also MAB/DAB also considered in calculation. 🧮,btohqsg
Maybe HSBC manual using excel like what@mttelegrammtsaid,btohqsg

Why not transfer in $155k on 02 July to solve this problem if you withdrew on 01 June.,btohqsg
Because it said money 30 days before promo. Not 30 days before July’s money in,btohqsg
Did you withdraw your salary crediting in Mar?,btohqsg
Your data will not be accurate. We want to know 30 days before promotion.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can confirm if use amex pay qr at food merchants earn miles/cashback ? Because i notice it processes as enets,btohqsg
Yes. Im using amex kf card. Worked 90% of the time.,btohqsg
Hmm  assume I got deduction of giro of 10k on 2nd  5th  20th of eachmonth.. So if I want to fund 30k the next month  this is not counted as fresh fund?,btohqsg
hi all  have anyone appeal for the fall below bal fee for uob before? has anyone succeed? thanks,btohqsg
Hi Mt Would like to seek clarification based on your understanding on the promo.In my case  I only have Human A to work with.I left min balance in my HSBC EGA account for month of June.I just registered for July's promo. I understand the registration is valid for months of July and AugustFor month of August - the bonus interest will be based on June as reference month for AB  yes?,btohqsg
June has $2000. Registered on 1st July for EGA promo.You will earn 3.x% interest onJuly and August incremental balances on top of $2000Also  you will earn 1% interest onJuly incremental balances on top of $2000August incremental balances on top of July's ADB.,btohqsg
Thanks very much for your definitive response. Really very appreciated,btohqsg
1st of Jun is still within 30 days of the promo period.30 days before and including whole period of promotion period from 1 July to 31 Sept. you cannot touch. Which is ridiculous.But yeah  I’m just gonna do tomorrow. 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Dear Members  wanted to ask what’s the best card for daily usage to earn miles ( example transport  restaurant  online purchases),btohqsg
Ya. By definition of the new T&C.Funds going out & in again  no matter the origin or destination UOB account.It will not be “fresh fund”.You also will be calculated based on incremental MAB in the event you pass that 30 days criteria.Which is conflicting and ridiculous.So many facepalm moments at UOB.HSBC was very very straightforward on other hand.,btohqsg
Hi all  like to check with you guys.If you're going overseas and gonna purchase a large ticket item(eg watch)Which will be the best card to use?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Appeal already  waiting outcome.But $5  nvm la. 😬🫢,btohqsg
I can’t find this “Subscribe now”  can share a screenshot on this?@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
Gonna clear ocbc and transfer to mari bank temporary until reaching the 31th day only transfer to hsbc …,btohqsg
Shake butt liao we only can see if anyone report failed to earmark,btohqsg

Ya. Verify & verify again.Best to wait until 31 days.Even 30 days is not totally safe.Even though you transfer out on 1st Jun  and end of day ADB is $0. It’s still risky lol.RM said one. Lose 1 day interest but peace of mind.Next time just do like Mt  empty all out by last day of month.,btohqsg
Not for now  unless you are targetted in the app,btohqsg
The link is not available after I clicked the fund that I plan to subscribe. I proceed to subscribe directly using moomoo apps. Thanks.,btohqsg
My Top 5 Cashback Credit Cards for 2024https://youtu.be/JUnsrfi_OvY,btohqsg
Hi  can l check if l deposited $1800 via paynow under 'Sal' to the ocbc 360 account and no withdrawal for the whole mth  will that count as increase average daily balance of at least $500 ?,btohqsg
At the beginning of the month? If so yes.,btohqsg
When will the funds be earmarked usually? My first time participating... I have several intra day transfer in and out  but end of day balance is always at $1k. Hopefully can help to contribute positive dp!,btohqsg
Minimally the 1800 have to be in the account for 9 days. And Salary credit has to be from another name.,btohqsg
You can check the table on t&c.,btohqsg
Table only show when will it be released. But when will it be locked? That's not stated right?,btohqsg
No more +S$160 vouchee. Pls take note,btohqsg
The earmarked date is stated in the table,btohqsg
I thought 30 Aug refers to the date when they will credit the cash credit and funds will be earmarked in a few days time?! You mean we need to wait till 30 Aug earliest to know if our funds have been successfully earmarked?! 😱,btohqsg
Can I participate by moving my funds from my stash account to my one account?,btohqsg
Yes and if you break the criteria before end date  they will claw back rewards,btohqsg
So if we missed to start today means we waste an entire month?,btohqsg
by 30 Aug. Usually earmark earlier around 20+ of the month.,btohqsg
no  have till 31Jul to register and have sufficient funds,btohqsg
Can I participate with transferring my funds from stash account to one account?,btohqsg
Fresh funds cannot come from existing uob account,btohqsg
