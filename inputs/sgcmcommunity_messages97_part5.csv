if you put the price at 90k then it will exceed the quota?,btohqsg
in that case  wont get to play the system of buying at a low and when coe is high,btohqsg
No one wants to pay anything  everyone would like everything to be free but that's not how life works sir,btohqsg
I doubt lower lows as the government does decrease the total pqp as well,btohqsg
My point exactly. If you know that you can get COE cheaper  why would you want to spend more money?,btohqsg
It also appears that most people don't realise how the COE system works,btohqsg
Ok and you bid with emotions and want COE  say a guy who has 5 cars coming in the next month comes in and blindly bids up to a certain amount and there's a few of these people,btohqsg
They will drive the price up quite high,btohqsg
And I doubt a lot of benefit will come from self bidding because to a dealer as well getting COE at a lower price is beneficial because for their customer they give you a roughly fixed price for COE and the car,btohqsg
The price of COE you see every 2 weeks is actually the lowest successful bid. Everyone who bidded higher than that price  pays exactly the same price even if they bidded 10x,btohqsg
If they manager to secure the COE at a lower price  it's a higher margin for them,btohqsg
No worries! Hope you find someone to deliver your parcel!,btohqsg
I like how change battery from key fob suddenly became coe,btohqsg
2022 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Saloon 2.0 Plug-in Hybrid E300e Avantgarde ReviewThe Mercedes-Benz E300e takes advantage of its plug-in hybrid drivetrain to provide an all-rounded driving experience - powerful  comfortable  and efficient.But in a world headed for zero emissions  can it beat its stiff competition?Watch the review herehttp://bit.ly/3OfqXNK,btohqsg
E.g. this bidding exercise has say 100 cat A and 1000 people bidding. As the day progresses  the bid of the 100th person is shown as the COE price. Person 101 and below will up their bids to surpass person 101  eventually driving up the price. But because some people will give up because the price is beyond what they feel is reasonable or what they can afford  the COE prices will not be as high as it is now because there will be people who are willing to wait and not fight like the dealerships because they need to secure COEs to fulfill their customers car orders,btohqsg
Ok but those people that give up,btohqsg
Do they still not want cars?,btohqsg
And use it on cars they're selling......,btohqsg
You self bid also for the same number of cars being sold,btohqsg
demand increase at a lower price,btohqsg
Your demand is just shifting from people walking away from buying a car at a dealership to people walking away from COE bidding because too expensive,btohqsg
Those who want will still bid,btohqsg
The point is  because you can hold a COE for up to 6 months before registering a car  you have plenty of time to bid in advance and secure your COE before ordering a car from the dealership,btohqsg
so how does this lead to lower coe? you still have to bid for coe right?,btohqsg
Yes you still have to bid  but how many people are willing to bid 100k? Remember that now you don't have a loan to cover cost of the COE.,btohqsg
Okay  so if you dont bid  you just wait and wait and wait and wait until it dropsâ€¦ but what if it doesnt? cos there are many people still willing to bid at 100k,btohqsg
coe is a self stabilizing mechanism,btohqsg
"You find me one person willing to fork out 100k cash for a piece of ""paper"" that you never even see",btohqsg
Go to Leng kee on a Saturday,btohqsg
Stand outside Mercedes and bmw dealer,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ i know of people who pay 900k for a 911 with the car still in the UK. never even seen a photo of the car  just the spec sheet.,btohqsg
I know someone willing to buy 400k car in Australia only to go use it after 2 years,btohqsg
I'm saying that right now people think they have no choice but to eat the price of COE at whatever the bidding results are. But actually they can take back the power from the car dealerships by bidding for COE themselves and actually affect the price,btohqsg
Ok let's say I buy a car,btohqsg
Then I want to secure COE myself,btohqsg
so if we take out the dealershipâ€¦ doesnt change the fact that people are still willing to bid at 100k?,btohqsg
Then I have 6 months before the car arrives to go buy,btohqsg
Because people are willing to bid higher than me as supply limited  demand high,btohqsg
Now I have to pay for the car to the dealer and leave it unregged or let go of the unit and wait for a few months for another to arrive,btohqsg
Now a year has gone by,btohqsg
And I bite the bullet and pay for whatever price the market is paying for COE,btohqsg
Maybe save 5k to 10k based on monthly bidding fluctuations,btohqsg
But I have now waited an extra year for a car for no reason,btohqsg
Just say don't want to the dealership,btohqsg
If I bid for COE myself,btohqsg
Just that with the latter you are wasting more time with paperwork  sitting and bidding  understanding the auction,btohqsg
When I can just pay basically the same thing to a dealer to work for me,btohqsg
Whose COE price I can reject because most offer multiple bids for COE,btohqsg
What brands can I not do it with?,btohqsg
Interesting wheel choice on the taycan,btohqsg
