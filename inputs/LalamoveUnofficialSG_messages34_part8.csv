You better than me I 3 jobs. Camp 1-2 hrs engine keep on off on off cause too hot until tulan fuck it balik.,btohqsg
They will surely try to clamp down on it  it's every digital platform's biggest fear. Having bots take the jobs causes many problems for the companies  some of which infringes upon legalitiesIts the reason why they changed the app  and features such as slide button and shake to screenshot. All these are anti-hack strategies.... But obviously not working very well lol,btohqsg
Those 16km jobs are leftoversWhen nobody takes the job in the 5km range they will send out to riders/drivers further away,btohqsg

Received a prank cash order at 0305h. Until now no response. GG. confirm will be marked as LATE and have to debit the lalamove 16% too. Yet the customer hp is invalid and never reply the lala chat although status was READ. took video of the scene and everyone said never placed any PICKUP order.,btohqsg
"Be alert of this name ""SIEW WEN""",btohqsg
Nowadays if doing any midnight jobs do avoid CASH orders. Gives u lots of trouble because lalamove office is 8am to 10pm daily only,btohqsg
For now. I think i need to prepare to get the LATE warning sms from LALAMOVE system,btohqsg
Did u call to confirm order when swiped?,btohqsg
Yeap. No answer. So i messaged and no response. So i did what i had to do. Proceee to location to take evidence,btohqsg
No answer should not proceed some more midnightðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Wisma / taka where can park to take food???,btohqsg
Hi guys...why i dont have any incentive target like u guys have?,btohqsg
How long will it start for me?....,btohqsg
Dont worry  wont get warningThey will either call you or customer to check why job left thereOr u can also jus leave msg in live chat for cs to delete,btohqsg
Update:Informed CS team as of 10am. CS team cancelled the job for me. So far  never receive any sms for late warning or deduct any 16% of the fee. So all is normal for me for now,btohqsg
"However  do take note of cash orders during midnight. Name""Siew Wen""",btohqsg
