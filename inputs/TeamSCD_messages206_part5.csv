Hi  just a quick surveyWhat petrol brand do you normally pump when u drive to ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ and why? Is it due to price  performance or availability?Below are the few petrol company i knowShellCaltexPetronPetronasBHP,btohqsg
Petronas due to the accessibility the whole country and paywave uses,btohqsg
Any And pump the only top grade,btohqsg
Yeah. I don't know why there's still got cheapo kiah still pump subsidised petrol when any fuel grade is already so cheap,btohqsg
i only pump shell. only tried petronas once.no specific reason  maybe more used to the brand name ?,btohqsg
Actually the price all the same for all petrol stations,btohqsg
yah  malaysia all brand same price. every week update,btohqsg
For me  I have been a Caltex fan since I pump the first time. Although not easily avaliable in JB but not many cars go pump so fewer or no queue.,btohqsg
Msia caltex drink very fast. No point pump msia caltex,btohqsg
Accessibility yes. The fc for petronas OK.,btohqsg
I would say petron one better for fc,btohqsg
Petron ron 100 vs shell vpower racing. I prefer ron100,btohqsg
Smaller cc cars won't feel much,btohqsg
So Ron 97 should be good enough right?,btohqsg
Smoother drive lo if pump ron100,btohqsg
Just pump ron100 luh...wun cost more than sg,btohqsg
Btw Ron 100 not every petron have,btohqsg
Lol. Should experiment when I drive to JB next time. Today pumped at caltex in JB,btohqsg
Lolx...ron100 is good for small cc NA engine ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Saw why so few cars in caltex but more cars pump in SG caltex  that's why wana post this question in the group,btohqsg
Esso 95 good for me hahaha,btohqsg
Whole way back from KL TAS  empty bus!,btohqsg
All the way back to Kovan MRT,btohqsg
Ya we didnt stay for too long LOL,btohqsg
Ya but more I think abt it  why I need empty bus ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Unless I lie on the floor and sleep,btohqsg
Bus got 2 side. One for legs  one for body and head. Imagine you can stretch all the way flat to sleep,btohqsg
CTE towards SLE/TPE got TP station at amk Ave 3 exit.,btohqsg
Mine most probably 21 years old car alr. But surprisingly other brands the fc alot better than caltex msia.,btohqsg
Caltex sg I very OK with the fc. Only msia super different,btohqsg
From my experience  no difference in SG or MY caltex. But maybe its my first time pump so maybe try other brand to test their FC,btohqsg
i combed the forums they somehow agree honda they pump petron like lose fc,btohqsg
i ownself pump also lost 20% fc,btohqsg
I got bad fc no matter what I pump,btohqsg
I'm more towards 6.5 to 7.5,btohqsg
But it's just me  other friend's not so bad.,btohqsg
Have tried to find where my fc is going  change exhaust  sensors  many things  but never found it,btohqsg
