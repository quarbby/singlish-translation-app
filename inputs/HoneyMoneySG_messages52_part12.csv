CurrentlyCiti rewards + amaze - all my online expensesHSBC revo - daily expenses +1% CB with EGA accountSC smart - fast food and SimplyGoDBS altitude - Travel expenses like book air ticket and book hotel via ExpediaWaiting for HSBC T1 ( mainly for existing user sign up bonuses ),btohqsg
I am using 2 x EVOL cards +crypto.comcard for balance spend,btohqsg
I see. I just start working. I going to apply what you apply for,btohqsg
Hi all  I signed up for HSBC Revo card recently  looking into EGA now.I hit my 1k limit alr so am thinking of applying for a 2nd card that is quite all rounded in terms of eligible transactions (unlike UOB Lady with only 1 category). Any suggestions?,btohqsg
Can try AMEX TCB or Spree. Same app I do topup got cashback  not sure if pass use the same mcc,btohqsg
HSBC revo + EGA and Citi rewards + amaze cover 99% casesDBS is optional but I feel hsbc T1 might be a better deal since there is point pointing soon with hsbc revo and get T1 after HSBC revo,btohqsg
now I only got DBS and I found out dbs is really bad üôÑ,btohqsg
how about for travel? flight booking etc  should i just stick with using HSBC Revo / Citi Rewards + Amaze? or better to have a specialized travel one,btohqsg
New to credit members should spent some time to view Chris videos first. Don‚Äôt follow other ppl blindly. The spending habits are important relation to which card works.,btohqsg
Crypto.com? U still have stake in cro?,btohqsg
But why does their CEO have a pay raise?,btohqsg
If your flight is below $1000 hsbc revo is okay ~ but if more than DBS altitude could be a option,btohqsg
Must lost a lot in the coin value.,btohqsg
but do agreed on the point of that it based on your daily expenses and get the card that would suit your needs.,btohqsg
just to be clear... Amaze is just like another YouTrip right? If i just get Citi Rewards and not paired with Amaze  i just lose out on the foreign spending benefits right? trying to avoid having so many cards üòÖ,btohqsg
Amaze converts everything to online  so using Amaze+citi rewards mc earns 10x points on anything so long mcc not excluded. Without Amaze  using citi rewards overseas in-store only gets 10x points for fashion mccs and incur 3.25% fees.,btohqsg
i see  so i cannot use citi rewards in store when im overseas. thats all right??actually use youtrip card will incur fees? i always thought theres no additional fees if i convert to the respective currency,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there any place I can check my DBS points transactions?,btohqsg
Digitbot on their online banking chat,btohqsg
use youtrip no fx fees but no rewardsuse Amaze+citi rewards  no fx fees have 10x points  1% instarem points  but mark up about 1.8% in exchange rate,btohqsg
Honestly I don't know what's the draw with EGA 1% cashback for HSBC revo card. Given you'd definitely not spend beyond $1K on the revo card every month  you'll earn at most $10 cashback from the EGA every month. But the amount of work you'd have to do to earn the $10 is just not worth it IMO,btohqsg
transferring 2k and paynow/use credit card to make payment for 5 times only,btohqsg
the draw is 1% on giro bill payment,btohqsg
That is also not really worth it because it excluded a lot of categories of bills like utilities which would be the ones I'd normally pay on giro. Other bills I think you get more paying using the appropriate credit cards compared to giro. But I admit I could be wrong here as I didn't study the EGA T&Cs in details.,btohqsg
1% Cashback + 4mpd that is quite a good earn rate for 5 min of trouble monthlyTransfer $2k and immediately transfer out 5x,btohqsg
but paying the other banks credit card bill using HSBC giro itself already earn you 1% cash back. I might be wrong  but AFAIK giro on everything will earn u 1% cash back aside repaying HSBC credit card,btohqsg
yes when u tap on your profile in app  it shows premier,btohqsg
4mpd you get regardless of EGA. 1% max you'll get is $10. Not worth it in my view. But that's my view lah.,btohqsg
Thanks. I can see how this is worth it. But I don't like to put my credit card bills in giro. But once again that's me üòÜ I get paranoid with paying my credit bills like that.,btohqsg
On this topic  anybody has dp for the MCC of mandai bird paradise? Thanks,btohqsg
There u go#dpMCC for Mandai Wings of Paradise (btw i purchased the tickets online),btohqsg
Lovely  thanks Joseph! Ohh  I saw payment with Grab gets 50% off so was wondering what card to use haha,btohqsg
50% not available for Wings of Paradisehttps://www.mandai.com/content/dam/mandai/promotions/partners/grabpay-promo-tnc.pdf,btohqsg
But yeah  that aside  looks pretty good,btohqsg
Oh yes  looks like no promo to see the birdies,btohqsg
The best benefit is pay IRAS bill using GIRO. Esp if your tax bill is high. 1% cashback is substantial,btohqsg
Cashback easily few hundred$ a month,btohqsg
Adding on: Insurances should qualify too (I personally use it),btohqsg
I think they got this free membership online called Wildpass that let's you buy at a discounted rate  not 100% sure tho,btohqsg
I think my IRAS bill is considered high. I pay for it using citipayall. In exchange I get about 200K air miles  which can redeem a return flight to the US on business class costing $6K. If I had paid using EGA  1% cashback cannot even buy me a single trip ticket to the US on economy class.,btohqsg
Once again I want to stress the above opinion is my own only. Not forcing anyone to subscribe to it.,btohqsg
Why not both? Citipayall for payment then EGA giro to pay off the cc üòä,btohqsg
that his justification. Hence i stopped since then. =),btohqsg
Was about to suggest you can ‚Äúdouble dip‚Äù also. Pay all and EGA. ü§´,btohqsg
My CL is pretty low cause I usually set my own to much lower.. Lol,btohqsg
If your limit is low how do u payall your big tax‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Unfortunately can't get past my own paranoid of not paying cc bills by giro. But thanks  I see your point now.,btohqsg
Every month. Typically I set CL to about $20K  which is more than enough to offset my tax bill on a monthly basis. I don't earn that much that I have to pay more than $20K a month in income tax üòÖ,btohqsg
Wasted missed opportunity to earn another $200 cashback every mth.,btohqsg
Anyone know If pay for travel insurance is under clause J?  It‚Äôs a 1 time payment only though,btohqsg
