Just share my exp. I used uob one credit card to buy new phone  uob offer installment with interest charges depends on the months. Thus  just know that need to buy from store that have 0% installment arrangement,btohqsg
That's fair. I booked Thai airways and Eva.,btohqsg
Follow up on this. I called HSBC last wed to report. CSO told me they will cancel my card  send me a new one  add temporary credit to offset the fraudulent amount while investigating the fraud.I waited 1 week  no card  nothing and fraudulent charge was from pending to posted.I called again just now. The 2nd CSO said no record of my first call. Now I needed to submit a form on the website myself and they will investigate. May take up to 6 months and I have to pay for fraud charge first.Lost hope with HSBC.,btohqsg
Did you lock your card on the app bro ?,btohqsg
Locked immediately last week. Was waiting for replacement card. üòû,btohqsg
I always lock my DBS card . I applied for 2 new cards from UOB on Sunday. Yesterday it was approved but not showing on my app. Today I saw it on my app  and I immediately locked it already üòÇ.when I receive the physical card  I will unlock it to activate  and then lock it again.Very troublesome especially when paying at cashier but I'm happy to do it. üòÇ,btohqsg
I'm using my HSBC card often so don't want to do that. üòÅ,btohqsg
I found the Best Fixed Deposit Rates after Interest Rate Cuthttps://youtu.be/JxAKboV1gGM,btohqsg
Hi there  I‚Äôd like to get your thoughts on the UOB Lady's Card vs DBS Woman's World Mastercard. Which one do you prefer for travel rewards (miles)  assuming points expiry isn‚Äôt a concern? I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of travel-related transactions can be done online  so I‚Äôm a bit unsure. Thanks!,btohqsg
Im with uob lady solely cuz it contributes to uob one saving acct. Imo  dbs wwmc is more versatile as people dont travel every month and you can clock spends on other online purchases.,btohqsg
if you can get UOB Lady Solitaire  it has a higher cap (2k vs DBS WWMC's 1.5k) and also have two categories  so you can do Travel + another category like Dining (Restaurants  FastFood) or Fashion (Dept stores).But otherwise DBS WWMC is more flexible since its all online.,btohqsg
Does anyone have experience paying prudential insurance premiums monthly via credit card and moved to cardup instead? I trawled my pruaccess account and couldn‚Äôt find any function to terminate existing arrangement  called CSO and they gave a weird reason saying monthly premiums cannot change  only options are giro or credit cardUpdate: found my answer,btohqsg
From past suggestions  seems like can just move to giro  arrange with cardup per usual  then cancel giro arrangement from bank side,btohqsg
I currently hold both cards  but I felt this too that I might use the UOB Lady's Card less frequently in the future for travel purposes. Thanks for your insights. And i dont have a UOB One Savings Account üòÉ,btohqsg
The one i hold is just UOB Ladys. I thought to utilize the DBS Woman's World Mastercard for online purchases and use Amaze + CRMC for offline transactions.Thanks for your insights! üôåüèª,btohqsg
Does hsbc revo still works for kris+ istudio or challenger? 4mpd?,btohqsg

Just curious  is it easy to waive the annual fees for DBS woman world cc?,btohqsg
Did u try through the app already?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if apply HSBC travel T1 via SingSaver  am I still eligible for the HSBC welcome gift miles?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have the cc but considering to apply to use mainly for online purchases. But Im not sure how much I will end up spending in a year,btohqsg
Hence would like to know if it‚Äôs easy to waive dbs women card fees even if I don‚Äôt meet the min spend,btohqsg
Choose 1 only  refer to this posthttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/232067,btohqsg
Mine got waived but only after i call in and threaten to cancel.,btohqsg
The min spend is 25k i think which is pretty high especially if you have multiple cards,btohqsg
How much did u spend on that card,btohqsg
Hello  for the OCBC 90 deg N and the citi premier miles card  can i use it with instarem amaze to fullfill the foreign currency spend so i do not have to pay the exchange fee?,btohqsg
No cuz amaze converts it to local spend,btohqsg
So in order to qualify for the higher miles earning for both cards  i have to pay the foreign exchange fee for the credit card and the exchange rate of the credit card?,btohqsg

Hello  I came in this group to see the movement and important information about the honey coins  but it seems that this group is not all about that.Someone here has a link to a group that is focused on the Honey Coin?Thanks you!,btohqsg
Provided the category remained as Travel in Oct 2025 at the point of charging,btohqsg
Also beware of Agoda pay later  price will be very marked up,btohqsg

Hello guys  just checking if i were to sign up for multiple credit cards and end up cancelling it within the first year  will it affect my credit score?,btohqsg
only at the point of applications your credit score will dropwhich will eventually go back up as you continually pay your cc bills on time.cancellation won't affect afaik (maybe positive impact since your max credit available may drop),btohqsg

hello everyone  any advise for Wise Interest vs Revolut Savings for USD? Seems to me like a pretty good deal for either or,btohqsg
I doubt 1 credit card application will affect significantly enough for the rating to drop (in terms of grade)However the earlier question is asking about multiple credit cards and that I have experienced myself when my credit rating dropped under ATo the point OCBC rejected my new credit card application,btohqsg
