Ever since after christmas period over,btohqsg
Once you accept job  press call customer and there is option to call customer or press the arrow for GPS. There will be orange bar that says arrived but do that only when you pick up the items already and need pic as proof.After that  same thing  press call customer to get to GPS and once arrived  press the orange bar and it will prompt confirm drop off? Press yes and it will bring you to take pic for POD or customer sign,btohqsg
I see everyday price cannot man,btohqsg

What are you still doing here? With the current market I suggest you get a full time job. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Later want to buy house how  if got not much CPF?,btohqsg
True. If you 30 yo go take up full time job that you can learn a skill.,btohqsg
Even a tower crane operator at construction site can earn between 6 to 8k and it‚Äôs a skill that‚Äôs more useful than delivery,btohqsg
Llm is PartTime ok. Full you have to think of Car Maintain  Rental Etc. Unless You Golden Spoon For Life. Now Private Hire they may start CPF Deduction for Certain Age. Find Full-Time or take Up Skills MORE Better,btohqsg
Many Boost PHVs Daily $500K mahü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Can rent from hdb no down payment or instalment to worry,btohqsg
Renting means you don‚Äôt have an asset that appreciates. When retire or older will not be able to benefit,btohqsg
A hdb house is never an asset in the first place as it is on a leasehold and a liability,btohqsg
If you buy a house left 50 years. 20 years later you think it will appreciate in value?,btohqsg
Hdb market will crash when left 20-30 years nobody will buy,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it the same for older condos unless enbloc,btohqsg
If freehold or 999 then it‚Äôs a different story,btohqsg
yup. Those 80s condo is spacious and very valuable today,btohqsg
New condos are so pathetic in sq ft,btohqsg
The developers are laughing their way to the bank,btohqsg
99 years condo will also depreciate. Maybe after 30 years when closer to balance 60 years. Also the cost of maintaining it will go up.,btohqsg
Yes it doesn‚Äôt make sense spending 4-5 million on a 99 years condo like reflection harbourfront,btohqsg
Not with the current interest rate and downwards rental prices,btohqsg
Actually is about $800k daily. Not sure where u get the 500k from,btohqsg
Need to be on the road at least 4 hours just to cover rent and fuel,btohqsg
