Ok  so depends on the company if support via AMEX network. I thought it have some portal to link to pay to insurance and the rental as advertise under the 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
but they charge at least 1.8% or 2% fee  Christopher mentioned it Cardup & ipaymy video,btohqsg
Singlife AXA and AIA are the companies that accept amex i think.,btohqsg
Ok then that‚Äôs not natively pay  it is still pay via cardup or ipaymy. What I thought as advertise is  it support paying insurance  etc‚Ä¶ with 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
if not what you can do is to top up grab pay using AMEX  then use GPMC via Axs mobile to pay for your insurance,btohqsg
But it's not wrong  just that very little insurance accept it.,btohqsg
Understand. I am just exploring alternative to grab. As I already hit the 30K grab limit.,btohqsg

I was considering Amex platinum reserve.  But the fees is 1750,btohqsg
As points don't expire and rewards list is huge.,btohqsg
Any other card with a robust rewards list,btohqsg
For local dining amex platinum seemed good. The rest are more for travel overseas on the lounges.,btohqsg

Bro $6000 max CPF is around $2220 with employer CPF.u mean after FRS hit ur OA supercharge $2220 a month? I thought CPF contribution will still goes to SA?,btohqsg
31% income goes to OA.Btw I have full time (job) + self employment (youtube),btohqsg
About supercharging  I have a question. When MA is at BHS and SA is at BRS  interest from both MA and SA will flow to 1) OA or 2) SA?,btohqsg
So when will transfer of interest to SA stop and go to OA? When SA hit FRS?,btohqsg
Correct. The interest and contribution from MA will go to OA after FRS,btohqsg
I see now. Thanks Chris for clarifying!,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I came in the group after chancing upon your video on youtube.Would like to ask whether if we could use amaze card to pay for prudential insurance?,btohqsg

I have $40 nets flash pay balance in my expire boc credit card. Any idea how to withdraw it? I tried using uob atm   it doesn't work,btohqsg
oh  it wouldnt be considered as an online payment?,btohqsg
ATM only works for non expire cards. For expired cards need to visit Transitlink counter,btohqsg
oh  i thought that payment via maze would be known as internet payment on citi card,btohqsg
or does it work for only food... online shopping etc etc,btohqsg
work for non excluded categories only. Insurance is excluded from Citi Rewards,btohqsg
