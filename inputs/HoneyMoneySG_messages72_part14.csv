Hi Hi  I recently joined the workforce and tried to read up on the CPF top-up but could not find the answer that I wanted or just wanted to double-check some stuff.I just saw your video on the CPF top-up for SA or MA  and I have some questions.1. In the video  it mentions something like if topping up directly to SA is towards the RSTU  which cannot be CPF shielding  then there is also the VC way to three accounts. Is that top-up going into RSTU also  or is it just normal SA? So that I can do CPF shielding.2. If my BHS is max and I do any VC or direct top-up to the MA  does it flow to SA or continue stacking MA?3. OA transfer to SA is normal SA and not RSTU  right?,btohqsg
