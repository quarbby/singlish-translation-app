Pika World Update (14 May 2021)**Markets on the moveEquity markets had a remarkable recovery  although the Nasdaq rise starts to fizzle during the late trading hours as investors await the ultimate retail figures today. While many indexes had pared some losses  the downtrend appears intact given inflation fear is lingering among investors as the bond market reflects a higher inflationary environment.As Pika World had mentioned yesterday that most of the CPI increase is attributed to pandemic related events  the supply chain issueâ€™s stickiness will affect the momentum of a price increase. The PPI data further support the idea that CPI is likely to remain elevated in the months ahead.With that  Pika World will be looking out for an inflexion point for the peak of inflation  as expected to e in the 4Q2021  highly dependent on the recovery of supply chain disruption.AMC Entertainment HoldingsAMC shares rally as the company rode on the way of its Reddit rally as it completed a $428m cash raise through the sales of 43 million share. This means that the average selling price is about $9.95. With this new equity  it helps to bring AMC to a better fiscal position to overcome a challenging industry condition.Just a year ago  investors were concerned if AMC could survive the pandemic as theatres were closed and viewers shift to the streaming service providers.DoorDashThe shares pop higher given the better than expected financial results. Revenue was up 198% from a year ago  to an astonishing $1.1B in revenue. Outlook is positive as the company believes the vaccination rives and increase in many in-store dining rates. However  the outlook remains uncertain due to the dynamic development of the pandemic.XpengThe Chinese electric vehicle maker releases good news for their earnings  given the weary EV investors on the outlook for the industry. The reported 13 cents loss per ADR is much lower than the anticipated 20 cents. It is yet another record-breaking delivery figures even when there is widespread semiconductor shortage.The company is also making good progress in its autonomous driving effort. It has been releasing its PILOT software  where nearly a quarter of the new vehicle sold comes with such software. The demand for autonomous driving software remains at a healthy level.Whatâ€™s on the menu today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Core Retail Sales data  which will also shed light on possible inflationary pressure as economy re-opening continues.It is 14 May  Friday  8.50 am. Pika World wishes all a restful weekend ahead!,btohqsg
