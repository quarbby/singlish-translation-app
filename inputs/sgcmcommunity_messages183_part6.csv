the whole process done seamlessly  including insurance. such a breeze,btohqsg
I realise why they might do this. They dont want to put the coe money in your pocket and trust you to renew the coe. you might run off with the money or use it for something else. So you transfer the car to them  they renew it  then transfer the vehicle back to you? Still  i dont like this system at all  it screws with your car value to add owner count,btohqsg
But if you need a loan to renew then i guess you dont have a choice,btohqsg
actually they let me choose hong leong or toyota,btohqsg
Overhauling a battery is expensive i guess,btohqsg
hong leong loan add to your tdsr toyota did not. best part 100% financinf no q&A,btohqsg
Or they wan to wash away phv record,btohqsg
my case is handled by mary ann she is really good,btohqsg
I mean when PQP was 30k 40k makes sense to full cash,btohqsg
Transfer to dealer doesn't add count  unless something dubious,btohqsg
But now its 100k.. makes more sense to use loan imho,btohqsg
Within 1 cycle can change 3 times and became 6 owner? The past owners so cham meh?,btohqsg
This kind of listing raises so many red flags,btohqsg
bmw ex ma. I saw many bmw drove by big bosses mostly are bad paymasters,btohqsg

instalments are fully financed by dragging people payment to pay car instalment,btohqsg
Be prepare for 9% gst next year,btohqsg

Is this Yaris cross with lexus badge?,btohqsg
Please. U see Yaris Cross too up,btohqsg
Pls dont insult the majority of cars by using YC as a comparison,btohqsg
No la  not saying Yaris cross as up  but want to know if this lexus live up to its name or just a Yaris cross++,btohqsg
Given that lexus also under Toyota  won't be surprised if it is just a more premium Yaris cross,btohqsg

Center console is some low grade display,btohqsg
in the end i did not buy,btohqsg
my vezel is so much better,btohqsg
There's a reason why its a PHV,btohqsg
older but everything is in place,btohqsg
My HDB I saw got 3 new Yaris cross already,btohqsg
At first I thought look big  but when I see inside like smaller than my sedan,btohqsg
yaris cross is just like the vezel last time,btohqsg

nobody buy yaris cross  compare price and spec i rather go for X50 or x70,btohqsg
