Wonder why many investors dunno to set stop loss,btohqsg
We are not lucky we know what is the company doing and FA.We confident to hold,btohqsg
Ya good investors like u will know what to do,btohqsg
I feel that some stock long term  if you can tahan,btohqsg
If you asked me to hold high debts and loss making companies I never buy,btohqsg
True. That is why now I‚Äôm at -$30k but still holding,btohqsg
And also good companies can be bad investment if you buy them at wrong time  high price,btohqsg
Anyway for those who lose chor  or stuckist  or newbie kenna jialat from the market for the past 1 week....here is a very good advice from Master Furion......,btohqsg
Ya there‚Äôs only so much hypeAfter hype is hopeHope turn to diminished hopesThen despairThen lost what to doAsk for opinions. One hand hope someone say good things to justify holding on because taking the loss too painfulAnd also see if got fellow stuckist. Not sure why but it feels better to have comrades in this caseAt any price level nobody can advise what to do. If someone ask u cut and Monday u sold 20 centFor whatever reason it come up to 21 cent the ouch and pain and blame game...I have been victims of similar scenarios countless times. Can clearly understand the emotional rollercoaster. Not proud of it but part of learning experienceA fellow forummer many years ago once said it bestTreat your money as soldiers and those in stuck counters are POWs. Chiong to save them may lose some soldiers but at least u have army to fight next battleWhat‚Äôs the point of keeping them alive if they can‚Äôt fight for u. U have no idea what‚Äôs happening behind enemy lines. They may be massacred and all u got are bodies eventuallyFor whatever reason they might escape and bring some POWs back. Best case scenariosHow many rambos do u have,btohqsg
Sometimes I lure by tips also after I see some pennies shot up 100% but I stick to my discipline,btohqsg
My Dairy farm now big paper loss üòÇ,btohqsg
Oh man...Dairy farm shld be doing well right?,btohqsg
Sis  you shouldn‚Äôt buy Not very counterHigh debts their profit margin very tiny only .You should look at their PE ratio first,btohqsg
That's why I'm still holding. I hold before big paper loss to big profit at 4.9 didn't sell  now back to lost,btohqsg

Don't know  I never keep records,btohqsg
Only Jardine group I have too  collecting dividends and sitting on profits and currency gain,btohqsg
5% dividend...20years can recover back even if price nv move lol,btohqsg
It means over long time  the share price will back to the fundamentals,btohqsg

Why don‚Äôt you keep some ETF stock,btohqsg

Now I also move to ETF,btohqsg
Now etf not worth  dividends low at current prices,btohqsg
If long term.. should be alright.. I still monitor see which counter to go in.,btohqsg
I anyhow spread across many counters and buy üòú. All the shifu here going to scold me,btohqsg
No lah! Iove you guys sharing I learn a lot..,btohqsg
In fact overall 10% paper profit,btohqsg
High yields counters also got risk  must study carefully.For example sabana reit  first reit eagle reit.Those bought it earlier then jialat,btohqsg
Last time  I shared a lot of good reits counters in SGHuat before.Now I ignored that group,btohqsg
So far I did not invest in reit.. not sure the out come.Before covid I bought marple industrial n marple logistics.. not bad.. after hit to higher point I let go.,btohqsg
Got msw REIT coming out ..,btohqsg
