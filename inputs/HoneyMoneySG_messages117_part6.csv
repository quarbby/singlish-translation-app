Must have at least 1k fcy spend in the statement month,btohqsg
I already have uob preferred platinum  ladies solitaire  Evol and One. Was thinking too many uob cards. But seem like make sense to get visa signature for overseas car rental,btohqsg
Only thing is better to focus on either miles or cashback imo.,btohqsg
Yes  evol/ one is for uob one account  cos I might not be able to clock enough on ladies. Got evol to replace uob one card  but before I cancel uob one card  terms for evol changed. So I‚Äôm going to cancel evol soon‚Ä¶,btohqsg

Hey guys  just checking. With the Citibank PremierMiles card  if we choose to pay the annual fee instead of requesting for waiver  will there be any bonus miles credited/earned from it?,btohqsg
Hello gurus  for the Citi rewards card + Amaze card combo  for online transactions such grab rides  Shopee  FairPrice purchases via the FairPrice app etc. Does it matter whether I link the payment method in those apps to my Citi rewards or Amaze card? If yes  which card is recommended to be linked?,btohqsg
To satisfy uob one cc $500 spend  can i top up ntuc gift card? Or top up qoo10 gift card?,btohqsg
Both will work  but Amaze will charge a 1% fee after $1000 of local spending. So just link it to Citi Rewards since it is already an online transaction.,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check for money spent at JB  can I use amaze + crmc combo?,btohqsg
