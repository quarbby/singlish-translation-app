last I read it's considered as Dining 58xxbut best thing to do is to try it for yourselfDBS app - lock the cardMake payment and it gets declinedCheck MCC of declined transaction with DBS digibotIf MCC is what you want  unblock the card and do the transaction again,btohqsg

hi everybody may i ask with the recent Grab pay / AXS nerf what is the best way to pay for personal income tax?i know there is the option of cardup pairing with different credit card earning miles / cash back but what are the best CC which make sense if income tax is quite substantial. happy to hear everybody thoughts ! üôè,btohqsg

2 qns re GxS1. If you have 5k in a Savings Pocket do you earn 3.48% on the 5k  if yes  where does it go?2. Can you have multiple Savings Pockets of 5k?Cheers,btohqsg
can have up to 5k in GxS account  regardless of main account or savings pocket  total is 5k.only way to have more than 5k in GxS is let the interest continue compounding (it will compound the excess of 5k as well)cannot top up funds to GxS account if alr exceed 5k or funds transferring in will exceed 5k,btohqsg
"before you cancel  make sure you cleared out all your points/milesand usually to qualify for sign-up bonus  you need to be ""New-to-Bank"" (NTB) which means not having any of the said bank cards for the past 12 months.it can also be very disruptive for overall credit card strategy  especially if you're chasing the miles game",btohqsg
Actually in Singapore  no video on couple strategy which might work.,btohqsg
thanks for reminder. Usually I will set a 1 year+ few months reminder after I cancelled the card  to remind me to reapply again haha,btohqsg
I did it to American Express and standard chartered  no issue,btohqsg
nice! tho I think there's some merit or value to having a long term cardholder relationship with some banks  especially AMEX.they seem to value that too,btohqsg
hmm YouTube videos on couple strategy seems to be a gap but I vaguely remember there are blog articles referencing it at least.cashback would be simple but for miles  it would mean splitting your miles pool which may or may not complicate matters for some,btohqsg
annual fee waivers access to higher tier credit cards and even when you can't waive annual fee  the rewards they give  etc.but it's a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary) and there are also a bunch of unknown factors,btohqsg
