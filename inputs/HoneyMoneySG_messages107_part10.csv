Maybe expect some spoon fed. ðŸ¥„,btohqsg

Hi everyone  i was thinking of using the UOB trifecta strategy suggested in this channel. My only concern is the annual fees which i would like to avoid. May i know if UOB usually waives those specific 3 (lady's  PPV and prvi) cc annual fees?,btohqsg

T bills or SSB cannot go wrong.,btohqsg
If someone has totally no investments. Putting entirely into ssb t bill especially if young person would not be wise too.,btohqsg
Older folks do that. Put 100 to 200k into fd,btohqsg

I know alot of people who just buy insurance (LLP  endowment) since young and alot richer than most 'savvy investor'.,btohqsg
Can diy with dca. Why fatten agents,btohqsg
Do you try syfe or endovus.. cash management account,btohqsg
haven't looked at that option. Thank you,btohqsg
Don't ask me. Probably don't want to manage. leave the management to 'expert'. I see my bro ILP charges (bought from his agent fren) I also roll eyes.,btohqsg
Need to give us your risk tolerance level and estimated yield for us to reply you,btohqsg

Hey guysI am paying a life insurance oversea  will the mcc be the same as here 6300 or will it be different?,btohqsg
You can try. You can't select salary payment as purpose.,btohqsg
Steps- You need a banking app that lets you setSalary Paymentas the transaction purpose. DBS  StanChart  UOB and CIMB should have this feature. OCBC does not.- Set up a PayNow Transfer OR FAST transfer (yes this works as long as you haveSalary Paymentas the transaction purpose)- Set Transaction Purpose asSalary Payment- Transfer at least S$2000 to your UOB Account- The salary tracker within your UOB app should reflect the amount within 2-3 daysThis is the way it used to work. takes a few seconds :),btohqsg
nowadays give answer still need to give supporting documents. shag,btohqsg
No  think it has to be the standard purpose thing. Why don't you just set a reminder and do it? As I said  few seconds,btohqsg
Hi guys any gurus here have experience in overseas TT transfer via DBS remit to Malaysia bank? I'm transferring some amount over from Sg to My  DBS bank says sent successfully but thr recipient hasn't received the amount yet. May I know if there is a reason for the delay or something wrong with the TT transfer? I filled the address and everything ok  just that the Kuala Lumpur I wrote KL instead as there is not enough space in the app to write the full address,btohqsg
Have you checked with DBS how long it normally takes?,btohqsg
I had a similar experience. The transaction was eventually not successful but it takes awhile for Malaysian side to inform DBS. That was my experience. Not sure if similar.,btohqsg
Ah I see okok thanks guys. I transferred monday 13th night. Until now they say not yet received. I received email from DBS saying it was sent successfully on the 14th,btohqsg
did you send in myr? converted from sgd and send in myr,btohqsg
Yup converted from SGD and sent in MYR,btohqsg
It takes a few days even though DBS says it was sent successfully.,btohqsg
technically should be same day for such transfers. have you received any credit back of a lesser amount? could be rejected and returned,btohqsg
I see I see  nope no credit back received and no refunds yet,btohqsg
