Why not WWMC though? Revo also can but a lot of ppl are wary about HSBC rn especially with the T1 card conversion fee,btohqsg
1. I forget tbh2. WWMC u need to work out first if u can hit minimum block in time (their points have only 1 year expiry)To me conversion fee is more or less need to soak one (Update: *only if cash* )  unless you are fine with a co-branded card which credits points directly which means expiry ticker counts immediately[Also in the case of UOB  $5 blocks..],btohqsg
Conversion is one thing but when you need to pay 4k miles just to convert a bit too much,btohqsg
oh u mean the HSBC T1  ya i don't understand the logic either üòÇ,btohqsg
Gonna cash it out in Xmas lolol,btohqsg
Right now Revo still under the old system but people are wary if HSBC will suddenly spring the new system onto them,btohqsg
That... has never been something i thought of but now you mentioned it  it's a possibility (esp. since points pooling was highlighted before as part of the roadmap),btohqsg
Definitely will have ppl complain. especially if they have paid the annual conversion fee just before,btohqsg
T1 card currently waives conversion fee but from January onwards  HSBC will charge 10k HSBC points (= 4k KF miles) per conversion for T1 card. Other HSBC cards eg Revo are still under the regular fee structure ($43 for unlimited conversions per year) but some people are scared HSBC will change to the new system.,btohqsg
Even 43 per year unlimited conversion turn me away from the card. Who can spend so much to keep do conversion in a year,btohqsg
Some hardcore people transfer twice a year... Like that already $50 under other banks,btohqsg
There is one such call conversion bonus lol  waiting for that before i convert large amt  i only convert near expiry if not conversion bonus,btohqsg
Noted tomorrow 359pm last day to sign up for webull.,btohqsg
So this also mean  sg EZ-Link card is a complete failure to capture market as they have been in the wallet market for many years,btohqsg
Yes Revo is a good card,btohqsg
Hope will not impact the Revo üôè,btohqsg
I mean in the past Like 10 Years ago,btohqsg

Hi joseph  a few qns for nomada) how is the coverage for europeb) is the selection of the network automatic or i have to take note which network to choose for each countryc) which one you prefer or would recommend nomad or airalo?Thank you,btohqsg
I can only answer from airalo POV cuz I only use airalo.Coverage for Europe is working as expected. I had the region sim which will tell me which operator I should use for which country. You will need to manually thouWhy I prefer airalo over others ? Cuz got cash back/max miles when I purchase :),btohqsg
Do you mean Airalo will tell you which operator/telco you should use in which country?,btohqsg
Alright I‚Äôll pay with citi cashback + instead then üòπ thanks for replying :3,btohqsg
Citi cashback plus not eligible for insurance also,btohqsg
Any recommendations for elderly above 70 with pre existing conditions buy which travel insurance company?,btohqsg

Thanks. Then better to buy the SIM card when reaching there if you only visit one euro country and if the Airalo default telco is not the telco has largest n best coverage in that country.,btohqsg
yah usually convert every 1-2 years,btohqsg
Airalo usually more expensive than nomad also.,btohqsg
