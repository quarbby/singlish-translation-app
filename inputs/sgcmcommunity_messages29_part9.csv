Again not the most accurate comparison but a decent representation of ICE vs EV and charging networks. Keep in mind Teslas north American network is very vast as compared to others,btohqsg
Got 5 sc net work already for tesla,btohqsg
Not even counting those from sp and such,btohqsg
For Singapore don't need too many locations anyway,btohqsg
1 or 2 in every region with enough stations is decent for the current Tesla population,btohqsg
Slow chargers at office carparks and chargers at condos and HDBs are more important,btohqsg
For charging at night or during work day,btohqsg
It a strategy they are building the 6th 1 with big tesla logo   it like I am dominating ev hello heheh,btohqsg

Influencer marketing but the influencer is paying for it,btohqsg
"Getting a ""cool car"" at A-class prices",btohqsg
Ya Elon is the influential lol,btohqsg
Actually don't need own SC  because third party charging infrastructure is getting really good worldwide,btohqsg
Sc is for tesla only and the eye balls plus exclusiveness is a big advantage,btohqsg
Like me go wwp I can charge at charge plus but other ev can’t charge at tesla,btohqsg
Another good experience shared  requires lots of planning to be driving EV  infrastructure is available but not completely reliable. Also spoke about how the shift in mindset needs to be brought in and the costs of it all,btohqsg
I just notice Taycan is a2 not a1 haha,btohqsg
"BMW Dealerships inform that BMW plans to initiate an Agency Model that does not allow to give any discounts  initiates one fixed price and degrades them to pure delivery centersHe said its the ""end of entrepreneurship""",btohqsg
