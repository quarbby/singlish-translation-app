you are a poly student rightwhich course are you in,btohqsg
for me it's half online half paper eh,btohqsg
And my lecturers for two of them suck,btohqsg
honestly I think i am the one who sucksnot my lecturers,btohqsg
esp when u can learn by looking at the lab sheets,btohqsg
hi guys! if anyones from hope church i'd like to ask abt some stuff  pls pm me. thankyou sm :),btohqsg
anybody used SLS before? Is the account username the person's name or ic or what ah,btohqsg
first 5 letters of ur full name and last 5 characters of ur ic,btohqsg
Idk if they change to jus ic tho,btohqsg
I nv open for v long,btohqsg
"Jnsomeome send some ""/help"" then some bot",btohqsg
Start meto get the list of commands,btohqsg
not sure if im allowed to ask this here but can someone tell me what is the formula i need to use to find the resistance values ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
does that ping peopple or what,btohqsg
this one is principles of engineering ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
parallel voltage is constantseries voltage not constant,btohqsg
Current is inversely proportional to resistance for constant voltage,btohqsg
ie twice the current means half the resistance,btohqsg
1/x + 1/y + 1/z = aresistance = 1/a,btohqsg
but to find last value need volt what... no meh,btohqsg
Total current in = total current out,btohqsg
lucky i stil have my sec sch notes,btohqsg
ok i understand where you are coming from   but how do you find resistance with current only ?,btohqsg
you need voltage to use with current to find resistance,btohqsg
This is a parallel circuit  so the potential difference across each resistor is the same,btohqsg
You can calculate the potential difference if you want,btohqsg
ok i understand now... thanks lolz,btohqsg
It's faster to just calculate the current directly,btohqsg
is there anyone who never use paylah before,btohqsg
paylah q convient for poly tho,btohqsg
just scan qr and type in how much you want to pay,btohqsg
most shops outside mostly have SGQR  which I can use my bank app for,btohqsg
for PayNow  either bank app or Google Pay  which I've been using before they started their cashback/rewards thing,btohqsg
Me as an intellectual dealing exclusively in coins,btohqsg
Mus present to them your marvelous hoard of 10cent coins,btohqsg
Why do it with some pixels when u can show off your wealth in material,btohqsg
Why use it to pay money,btohqsg
Anyone here alr in NTU taking ph1012 ?,btohqsg
Eh tmr got no sch for sec kids ah,btohqsg
Till the pigs in my house complaining,btohqsg
Then work got ph in lieu anot,btohqsg
Well its cuz usually I hear ppl give worser names,btohqsg
Why sec got why poly/JC/IB/Ite dh de,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ I tot they also sch,btohqsg
But its ok  im alr on holidays,btohqsg
I got exam tomorrow 1 F for me,btohqsg
Bruh I miss secondary school so badly,btohqsg
Pleeze  back when pri sch students were doing models,btohqsg
May the Dean's list bless you,btohqsg
Wait omg jn did someone talk abt metal in a gaseous state,btohqsg
