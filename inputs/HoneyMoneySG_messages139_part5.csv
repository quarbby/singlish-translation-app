Can someone that uses EGA to GIRO CC bill help me understand if the deduction only happens on due date and probably takes a few days to post  is there a late fee always?,btohqsg
Depends in which bank.. some back deduct same day as due date (eg dbs)  some deduct the day before.Deduction normally is around 4pm,btohqsg
Hi  may I know if any DP of using ipaymy/cardup to pay OCBC mortgage loan?,btohqsg
So if DBS there‚Äôs surely going to be a late fee always right?,btohqsg
no. no late fee as long as ur ega has enough balance.,btohqsg
Oh so it deducts and posts immediately? Thats cool.,btohqsg
Doesn't post immediately  most of the time they trigger deduction early  and the CC you're paying for will assume that it is paid. If GIRO fails  then they charge you late fee AND GIRO return fee.,btohqsg
Oh wow okay. Then I need to always keep in enough inside the EGA. Thank you.,btohqsg
Has HSBC Everyday+ stopped giving cashback for GIRO of CC payment?,btohqsg
seems to be delayed for a few weeks. haven't received mine yet,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/243680Its bugged and being fixed. Just wait.,btohqsg
i guessed its pass 1 Nov and we all still haven't received?,btohqsg
ya give them some time. Eventually you will get it.,btohqsg
oh yes. u r right. 18 onwards not yet.,btohqsg
Ya don't be like me lol. Don't forget they won't retrigger deduction  so you will have to manually pay. Meaning no 1% cashback too. Big pain.,btohqsg
Ah okay. How early did they try to deduct it?,btohqsg
Do I need to do anything?,btohqsg
Check your statement. It will tell you the deduction date. To buffer at least a day early.,btohqsg
they dun really trigger deduction early  they just finding out the amount to deduct. Any payments after that will not reduce amount to be deducted.,btohqsg
Fyi.  My giro deduction on 7 & 11 Oct not yet given 1% by HSBC as of today. It was working for last one year on n before Sep 2024.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone scb cc due on 4th but giro still not deducted?,btohqsg
Strange... Scb always deduct 1-2 days before.,btohqsg
My was 10 oct given on 11 oct. So i dont think your 7 oct was affected. According to other 11 oct was the day that all hsbc ega giro cashback was affected,btohqsg
I think it was the two ‚Äúunusual‚Äùtransactions on 08 Oct that net off the 1%.,btohqsg

Is standard chartered smart cc great?,btohqsg
Great if:- you‚Äôre new to bank and get signup bonus via singsaver or money smart or SCB directly (can be $500 back for $800 spend)- cashback for specialised category like public transport  McDonald‚Äôs  Toast Box  Yakun  streaming service like Netflix v high (6.67% ish)- great cos no minimum spend for cashbackOtherwise  not good as general spend card for super limited categories only,btohqsg
Thnx! Will opt for ocbc rewards then,btohqsg
Okay  why not both lol  it complements each other just fine ^^ besides can get new to bank reward,btohqsg
üòÇ but ocbc now no promo üòø,btohqsg
Then don‚Äôt sign up OCBC Lor  wait for seasonal promo (if it even comes back). Unless u got OCBC 360 account. New year usually got new quota so maybe got some giftsSign SCB first then,btohqsg
For Citibank  best is 3 days before. If due date is 7th  by 4th money has to be in,btohqsg
