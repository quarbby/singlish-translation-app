as much as singapore has great education  does it address the aims of students these days? for example  some students want to pursue in law   then it wld mean that their humanities and english must be proficient. and their math could be mediocre. but if we look back  and the student is forced to do a sci/math subj in JC as their h1 subj  it cld ultimately eliminate their chances of going to law since it prolly requires you to get AAA/A which the student may not be able to achieve since their not strong in that area of study  hence not able to achieve their aim just because the education system does not allow us to only focus on our strengths,btohqsg
