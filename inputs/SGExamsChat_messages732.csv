text,group
but you are still a scholar since,btohqsg
didn't u get a lower raw than me,btohqsg
and i didnt take higher music,btohqsg
i dont get what‚Äôs the thought behind taking triple sci,btohqsg
tbh i just don't let myself eat after a certain time,btohqsg
bc i stay up late and supper is a curse,btohqsg
what's the point of taking additional subj if they don't contribute to your raw,btohqsg
bruh 80% of my y4 cohort takes triple science this literally doesnt make any sense,btohqsg
i can't even go to ejc,btohqsg
is it like for example if you prefer bio over physics then you can just drop physics or what,btohqsg
so you just go for triple sci and see which one fits you,btohqsg
okay in non ip schools its scholar material,btohqsg
i have friends who did that,btohqsg
Except they all dropped bio üíÄ,btohqsg
dude you were in an ip sch üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
and olvl maybe cannot but ip can count all 3 scis in the gpa so yea,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like you take triple sci but you also cannot use all your 3 sciences to compute into l1r5 what,btohqsg
can't go insane if alr insane,btohqsg
olvl cannot lah but ip can so maybe thats why ip alot takealso like maybe havent decided which they like more and dl humans so just take 3but if you decided early alr then yea taking double sci good alsolike felicia is the next oppenheimer then dont take bio also can,btohqsg
jae in ip sch means scholar material,btohqsg
"i like how guys immediately use the word ""wife material"" 0.00000000001 seconds after they see a random girl with an enormous gyatt",btohqsg
i dropped bio after sec 2 bc i knew i'd never pursue anything related to it,btohqsg
i dropped physics after sec 2 bc i knew i'd never pursue anything related to it,btohqsg
ip promo in y4 looks at ur overall right,btohqsg
u boys sch how many yrs sia,btohqsg
so if you take triple sci and you do better in sciences,btohqsg
it‚Äôs better than taking double sciences?,btohqsg
you have to count at least 1 humanity,btohqsg
but since you are using 6 subjs for gpa you can count like thisElHistoryBiochemPhysMath 1,btohqsg
yes i know yall did lol,btohqsg
So these 6 subjs counted in ur GPA,btohqsg
mine is 6 years of girls school 4 years + 1 coed,btohqsg
On paper is 2.8 but then the thing is they try not to retain anyone,btohqsg
how does ip grading system work,btohqsg
so ur overall need to be like 60 at least?,btohqsg
we also got the ocassional mind blowing qns,btohqsg
oh idt we use that system,btohqsg
i mean gpa 2.8 convert to grades is like,btohqsg
and then we got the justification for cherry on top,btohqsg
my fren went 10yrs girls sch went j1 and had a bf,btohqsg
but generally 2.8 should be minimally B for every subject with no As at all,btohqsg
mine is coed all the way,btohqsg
when you are lacking of something for a period of time..the moment something new comes your way..you will instantly want it,btohqsg
that was the response i wanted yall to zoom in on,btohqsg
I got raw 8 if you convert,btohqsg
weren't u 10 years all girls sch also,btohqsg

thoughts on guys called Yishun Innova Junior College,btohqsg
Bro he was reading on Transmission Electron Microscopy techniques,btohqsg
wait why do you need TEM for bio,btohqsg
It's for study intracellular structures usually,btohqsg
So we plate it in microscope gold for the surface to be conductive and then we view those structures through TEM,btohqsg
i get that but why at his level...,btohqsg
Bro as I said he went to pubmed to study basic bio,btohqsg
why does this look like a airline steward,btohqsg
might as well read up on the physics behind it as well then,btohqsg
That's me booking out from selarang camp,btohqsg
He gets a backup material engineering and science diploma on the way,btohqsg
wasted if he don't just go phd,btohqsg
do all the reading he wants until he's sick of it,btohqsg
Sick is an understatement. I scared of JSTOR liao,btohqsg
why are they dragging you to teach,btohqsg
bro...this kind of money also can ah,btohqsg

If you really want me right  u should chase after me,btohqsg

What are they gonna do? They are dead alr,btohqsg
Depends on when u are referring to,btohqsg
dude i remember kuro said that sp students have a higher uni admission rate than yijc students üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
imagine trying to teach JC people about the gpa system,btohqsg

Bro the intake of YI is smaller than the intake of schools of SP,btohqsg
you have to see the %,btohqsg
Yeah but u gotta look at absolute numbers too üíÄ,btohqsg
that means its unfair that RI has 33% of their cohort scoring 90rp considering they have a bigger intake than other jcs (except for hc),btohqsg
I mean at that number u probably have to compare the worse school in SP vs YI,btohqsg
Yala but still weight your options lor,btohqsg
nah i heard yijc has bad study influences,btohqsg
and the study environment there is atrocious,btohqsg
the reasons given for not going yijc or mi is because those schools are filled with people who could not care less,btohqsg
My friend from yijc got sexual assault case,btohqsg
I mean it's a place to study ig and that's all that matters. U go poly u are left alone too.. in fact u don't even get the hand holding of JCs,btohqsg
Bro down bad since secondary school,btohqsg
Like I got crush on this girl right,btohqsg
Then this boy tryna hit up on her,btohqsg
Yeah lmao thats all I am saying,btohqsg
Proposed to her during dmn sec choir concert,btohqsg
idk i heard that the negative influence gets to people easily,btohqsg
But he still get close to my crush,btohqsg
Yala I am saying in absolute numbers the intake for SP is massive and there's a weight by numbers.,btohqsg
everyone there are lax af and even if you are dead set on the a level path then you might get influenced to slack like your classmates,btohqsg
Engineering is pretty high for Poly compared to JC ngl,btohqsg
Sounds about rite for Engineering and STEM in general,btohqsg
tbf idk much about double digit pointer jcs,btohqsg
U get a lot of you shall not pass lecturers,btohqsg
but if they are THAT bad,btohqsg
you need to see height comparison,btohqsg
who the fuck pick first option LOL,btohqsg
so naturally tall people are heavier,btohqsg
Also why I cannot pick higher,btohqsg
if that's overweight i'm the planet earth,btohqsg
and then if you disagree they're like don't fat shame,btohqsg
must be proud of your body etc etc,btohqsg
i love it when i take two airplane seats,btohqsg
I don't look like my weight,btohqsg
Man ngl that voting shit kinda goofy,btohqsg
hey you are going to slowly kill yourself with coronary heart disease cancer and cardiovascular disease,btohqsg
who even started this whole body positivity thing,btohqsg
its different from discriminating people for skin colour or gender or height  since thats way beyond their control  and not like having that will bring any physical consequences  but obesity genuinely leads to health issues lol,btohqsg
Dude do u admit you kinda look deadly,btohqsg
ah yes  the same people who are fat themselves,btohqsg
I keep thinking rand is short asf,btohqsg
i heard nearly half of the american population is obese,btohqsg
thing is you can definitely discriminate someone based on them being fat but that's a separate matter from advising them to lose weight,btohqsg
and i shouldn't have to pay for the extra space,btohqsg
there's that one tiktoker that complained about the airline not having plus size friendly seats,btohqsg

As much as i wanted a non-merger jc  i dun think i can pull myself to retake Os coz my score was ok-ish,btohqsg
Ain't no way blud get U for PW,btohqsg
Ngl from personal exp  $$ you can just earn during festive season from Christmas till cny and it'll be more than enough to retake Os. So you'll only work for a few months till late Feb and that's it. Rest of the months you can just focus mainly on studies,btohqsg
It is becoz u wun get school resources and u need to be really way more disciplined and stuff,btohqsg
you are an yijc/mi student pov:,btohqsg
it matters but more than not it's the students imo,btohqsg
TM is actually not a bad school  it is just i wanted a non-merger school coz merger gave me bad vibes,btohqsg
Bro u haven't seen the incompetence of SEAB,btohqsg

true  but i know someone with a sim name,btohqsg
Ok for me is different i cant draw a line on my own family member,btohqsg
do you think cae or rae is better,btohqsg
yea but even for your family member you can't go and tell a victim to empathise,btohqsg
This i agree to some extent coz if parents work hard enough  they can see a difference but it takes years,btohqsg
