True. The pistons not sealed properly but no one will want to deal with operating the engine so early,btohqsg
Some enthusiasts will buy parts early before their cars arrived. These are the one prepared to mod cars üòÖ,btohqsg
That is something I‚Äôve been curious about. I have my thoughts but would love to hear honest feedback when things need replacement such as suspension  steering components  lamp clusters  battery  fluids  or even panel replacements from accidents etc.,btohqsg

High speed racing is just dumb and dangerous,btohqsg

I drove next to a DBX once. Sporty sounds and one blink of my eye  he was gone.,btohqsg
Quite nice to see something this size move in such a way.,btohqsg
If they want to push will be a bit louder  but very soothing sound,btohqsg
good to be low profile n quiet... not like some cheap Coe lancer noisy like fxxxüòÇ,btohqsg
EVs would be perfect to maintain low profile and be quiet  but sadly most EV drivers prefer flooring the car off traffic lights,btohqsg
