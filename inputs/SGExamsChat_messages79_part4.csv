In fact that's how I met my mentor  I was in the conference than he came up to me and ask if I want to do a project,btohqsg
Like if u go as an individual,btohqsg
U can still just walk up to a professor,btohqsg
Eh bruh fine i go look for ym bye,btohqsg
Skool introduces you to such conferences,btohqsg
Some prof not so friendly one,btohqsg
But would the professor still be willing to approach you if you weren’t from X JC,btohqsg
No one knows other than u and me,btohqsg
alot of lecturers in poly nice tho,btohqsg
Says the one who leaked et smh,btohqsg
Das for more sci based stuff,btohqsg
Some uni profs u email he also dont reply one,btohqsg

U use what mail to email,btohqsg
Not uni mail of course he wont reply,btohqsg

Maybe i should use my web mail,btohqsg
They dont reply to external mails,btohqsg
I share with y'all a story  the true story of how I met my mentor,btohqsg
U are not his student he reply you for what,btohqsg
I had a skin allergy  I needed help,btohqsg
must be nice having a mentor,btohqsg
Than he happen to be a doctor  than I ask him if he can give me an appointment at hospital,btohqsg
Than he gave me an appointment within a week,btohqsg
Instead of waiting at polyclinic for months,btohqsg
I called punggol climic for minor surgery in feb,btohqsg
Than to thank him  I do project with him,btohqsg
Some even struggle to navigate lol,btohqsg
And the first time I met him,btohqsg
Or some give 1 word reply only,btohqsg
Thats a sign of disinterest according to tinder,btohqsg
No luck ? What the fu*k,btohqsg
i got scolded by a lecturer who said that suggesting using videos to educate chemical stuff in products was out of my place & course of study bcos “ science students can’t do media ! u from media meh ? “ :”),btohqsg
rip my grades for that module tho,btohqsg
Is it luck? Or is it networks?,btohqsg
Very lucky no network  how lucky also at most help you win 4D nia,btohqsg
Discrete math mod in the past the prof forced the students to make a video on number theory,btohqsg
Is legit luck  I never had network before in my life until I entered JC,btohqsg
Are there any boomer groups ?,btohqsg
she was like u prove to me u can make it work ? it’s not feasible! what’s more feasible is u going to sec schs to conduct workshops !,btohqsg
Is it luck that your JC gave you networks? Or is networks institutionally entrenched in your JC?,btohqsg
I mean I would say my jc have more opportunities than some other jc,btohqsg
Does discrete maths not cover number theory or,btohqsg
It covers but to make a video on number theory as project is ridiculous,btohqsg
It seems pretty interesting to me,btohqsg
