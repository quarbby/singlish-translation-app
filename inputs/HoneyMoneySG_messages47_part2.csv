I need to act. Looking for a stock to all in and make it big! There are so many opportunities  we just need to wait for the right time. Working hard at a job  waiting to get promotion  clearing shit work and navigating toxic politics  it's just too much to bear when the odds are stacked against you. Seriously.,btohqsg
why does HSBC revo point expire within a year?,btohqsg
Just curious how do u come to the valuation on 4mpd? I personally value 4mpd similar to 5% due to how common Cashback cards work,btohqsg
no no... my valuation now is 1.5x for economy redemption  2.5x for business redemption (but danger cannot grab)ECONOMY2mpd = 3% cashback4mpd = 6% cashback6mpd = 9% cashbackBUSINESS2mpd = 5% cashback.4mpd = 10% cashback6 mpd = 15% cashback,btohqsg
that is why i am so naggy and keep showing my calculations so I can be corrected in case i am wrong.Based entirely on the figures of:SG Japan Economy revenue ticket at $900 and requires 54k milesSG Japan Business revenue ticket at $3200 and requires 102k miles,btohqsg
Hope my above makes sense to u,btohqsg
No worries@mttelegrammt  thanks so much for sharing üòÅ,btohqsg
Please help! I have the same question,btohqsg
anyone tried buying tickets at Singapore Airlines? How come I have a ‚Äúbooking‚Äù when I have not paid anything. What happens if I cancel?,btohqsg
So the 50 people who took the shortest time from card approval date to spending $800 will get the watch Loh,btohqsg
My advice for this kind of first xx promo please don‚Äôt participate. Sure make yourself angry one unless u can fulfil within first day of card approval.,btohqsg
I am not sure either miles or cashback makes such a big difference in FIRE goals,btohqsg
Miles = spending?Cashback = saving?Haha. Superficial logic.,btohqsg
I meant in the grand scheme of FIRE  its not that important i guess. Probably doesnt make a whole lot of difference,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being biased in this statement.But those who play miles tend to enjoy the finer things in life?Those who play cashback tend to be more stingy?True? Or false?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo bonus points for April are in üòâ,btohqsg
Haha hmmm interesting take but i dont think so as i use mostly my miles for econ flights ü§£,btohqsg
life is a gamble of calculated risks,btohqsg
yes of course  but not All In.,btohqsg
Crypto winter is coming. Ponzi imploding.,btohqsg
Throughout history  people worked till they died. There are no shortcuts in life,btohqsg
life is all or nothing. investments on other hand is diversification üíØ,btohqsg
like spread around few projects u have high conviction in,btohqsg
time to load up guys. I think most people here are pursuing FIRE or financial freedom,btohqsg
I feel all in is not a good idea. Future is uncertain and best of us go wrong. With hindsight one can try to rationalize. e.g. Famous investor from US bought into textile industry and later found things were shifting to China because of cost arbitrage. And this in hindsight might look easy to predict. If best of us go wrong sometimes  must weigh options carefully before pulling the trigger,btohqsg
yes definitely  but the biggest risk in life is taking no risk. inflation forces us to take more calculated risks to achieve financial freedom. but ofc always DYOR,btohqsg
Your SQ ticket has been issued & confirmed rite? Your card payment will be confirmed and appear on statement date. That what happened to me.,btohqsg
I think Financial Independence  Retire Early (FIRE) has absolutely nothing to do with choice of credit cards or even to use credit or debit cards.It is a matter of personal conviction  convenience and lifestyle choices we as individuals make as u progress in age and through the life stages.,btohqsg
My read is first 50 to meet all requirements.,btohqsg
Hi  u should be back from Royal Caribbean cruise üòä. Can share what card u use onboard and the typical  MCC codes of the merchants onboard?,btohqsg
Can I check whether I can sign up for Kris+ using Chris referral code  top up my Amaze Wallet with $100 and spend at NTUC Finest to get $15 (2250 miles) and the sure win instant rewards?,btohqsg
Hey! Yes I‚Äôm back :) hmmm but I used the 4% Cashback promo from using Amaze wallet! Is there a way to check the MCC for these transactions?If yes I‚Äôll gladly look through and share here!,btohqsg
Riding on this. The SC rebranded Journey card states 3mpd for Royal Carribean too. But not sure if it's only for booking of tickets or also expenses onboard. Anyone managed to confirm?,btohqsg
Thanks for replying =) I think you can go to your Amaze app to check the categories of your transactions.For me  I use Amaze linked to CRMC in Japan. I noticed a couple of my transactions were wrongly categorised.,btohqsg
Purchase of ntuc voucher on kris + can only use the miles inside to pay for it. U cant use card to pay for the voucher,btohqsg
Thanks for answering my question and also my next question. You seem to guess my next question before I write here haha,btohqsg
Hi gurus  are XNAP transactions considered retail by OCBC 365 credit card?,btohqsg
Anyone knows touch n go e wallet (mobile app) can use like contactless (tap) at tolls? Also assuming i wont have mobile data,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt even enter my payment details at all. it writes ‚Äúreserved‚Äù when i didn‚Äôt reserve anything,btohqsg
Is the DBS Taka card approval instant?,btohqsg
Up for discussion.With the recent change to Revolut topup fees  does Youtrip/Revolut still have a use case?I think think and I think after I clear my current Foreign Currency stash inside Youtrip I will stop using it.Main thoughts:1. no more rewards for topping up Youtrip or Revolut2. whatever is topped up into Youtrip or Revolut is losing value at 4% p.a. (bank savings rate)3. other competitors like Amaze and Trust are superior (yes their spreads are lousy but still have positive net benefit MOST of the time)The only time I will use Youtrip/Revolut is if Amaze fails (e.g. transaction fail and behind got long queue stare at you) or when the transaction is under SGD10 equivalent.,btohqsg
Hey folks For SQ booking through SIA portal  can Krisflyer miles be drawn from two KrisFlyer accounts for a single itinerary ?For example  A books a 2 Pax itinerary (Pax A + Pax B) for a return ticket to Tokyo. Pax A and Pax B EACH has their respective Krisflyer account. Can the Krisflyer miles be drawn from Pax A‚Äòs Krisflyer account and likewise for Pax B?Thanks! =),btohqsg
you log into your kf account and searched for tickets right? its just that they save the search in case you wanna go in and confirm book la. i had it also when i trying to find which flight to book,btohqsg
I believe it is cannot.The only 'sharing of miles' is you can use Person A's miles to book for Person B if Person B is an official nominee input.,btohqsg
Nice! Sorry but if possible  can you provide me w a SS so I can find where‚Äôs the MCC code?,btohqsg
I can cancel with no penalty? Yes  I logged onto my KF account,btohqsg
Japan is very famous for Monkey MCC. I usually prefer to use a General Spending card in Japan when tagging onto Amaze.Especially dining places  most of the time it has a nonsense MCC like railway company (owner of the building) or it has electronic services MCC.Supermarkets might be correct grocery MCC though.,btohqsg
If XNAP is eligible for EVOL  it should not be excluded from 365 as well,btohqsg
Still need the card. But you can try the Touch n go RFID tag  much better,btohqsg
I've seen a discussion on keeping Revolut MC for Japan cash withdrawals because there's a fee for visa withdrawal in japan atms,btohqsg
