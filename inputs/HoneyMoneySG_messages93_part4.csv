did this in my trip to Dubai last year  Agoda's price was $3.7k while the links provided me with a price of $3.3k,btohqsg
Yup. But it's case by case whether the hotel supports this or not. Most of the major ones should,btohqsg
I‚Äôll try the next time again  used to be that case for me thus I never used it,btohqsg
I already empty my UOB One Account today. Now is 0. Do I bank in tomorrow or day after in order to enjoy the Rising Dragon Promo?,btohqsg
Sorry to ask‚Ä¶I am an elderly lady & quite lost with the Rising Dragon Promo. My FA told me to withdraw everything this month but must put it back b4 month end to enjoy the Rising Dragon Promo. Is it correct?,btohqsg
I was told to put in $100K or $200K this 2 days as new to UOB One to get the cash credit by the nx quarter?,btohqsg
How much did you have on 30 Dec 1030pm?,btohqsg
On 30Dec I hv over $100K. I emptied my account today so if I bank in the nx 2 days do I consider new?,btohqsg
Has anyone tried adding same UOB card to 2 different Grab accounts before?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so. Any incremental must be on top of the original 109k,btohqsg
Then you have to wait for the next round,btohqsg
Trying to use same UOB one card for both my wife and my Grab accounts but can't seem to add it to the 2nd account,btohqsg
Thought I can withdraw everything & bank in $100K again to enjoy the additional 1.5% on top of the 5% I am getting?,btohqsg
You have to follow the time period on the t&c,btohqsg
Ahh for the experienced  who have taken part in this Promo before..Usually when is the time period  is it a Quarterly thing?,btohqsg
Sorry  i missed out the Dec 30 eligibility. Can i check for this Rising Dragon.Is it:1) If there is another round aybe end March 31. Have to wipe out UOB one acc to $0 and deposit back after end March.2) Hold the money period for 4mths before eligible for yhe extra 1.5%?,btohqsg
The UOB CS person was giving confusing signalsShe said can use the 29Feb end balance to earmark for 29March and take part for Apr-Jun Rising Dragon Promo,btohqsg
Yes exactly my question. Sorry! I am really confuse.,btohqsg
This is my FA helping me to ask u guys‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
No problem. Based on past patterns  these promo are quite frequent which is good  every 3 months i guess. But you will need to read the t&c not to miss the step required.,btohqsg
If you have cannot add to second account  then likely cannot lor.. likely for security purposes. You can try use same PayPal? But likely will be the same,btohqsg
I already withdraw everything today so in order to enjoy the 1.5% when can I bank in to the same account again? Or open a new account?,btohqsg
By withdrawing I already lost out my $400 plus interest.,btohqsg
If I don‚Äôt get the 1.5% then I lost my $400 plus for nothing‚Ä¶..üò¨,btohqsg
As stated by Chris in his latest video  if there is a similar promo for next quarter  the next date to empty account is on 28 Mar.,btohqsg
How would you lose $400 interest? Just transfer back the money now will be fine.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what my FA checked with the CS for me.,btohqsg
You only lose on the days when you empty the account.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn!May I know why to empty account on specifically 28Feb?,btohqsg
Half the time the CSO is wrong tbh..,btohqsg
So if I reinstate all my money will I get back my $400 plus interest?,btohqsg
So if I reinstate all my money this month will I get back my $400 plus interest?,btohqsg
can i ask if i use dbs vantage card to pay my credit card bills will my vantage get the miles?,btohqsg
Sorry typo  it's 28 Mar. Because 29 Mar is a PH  and you don't want to bet that the transfer on Sat (30 Mar) will actually be posted,btohqsg
I believe Jeremy means to say that.. if you are having $100k in the account for 20 out of 30days  you will have interest for the 20 daysJust not on the 10daysIs that what you mean@JeremyLee?,btohqsg
If you withdrew everything today  and put back everything today  your balance today will not have any changes. Besides  the bonus interest is based on MAB. Only the base interest of 0.5% p.a. is computed daily.,btohqsg
That is correct.  If everything happen within a day  that shouldn‚Äôt be any loss. But if it is past 1 day  then the loss will be around $14.5 per day for 100k in account.,btohqsg
Ahhh.. okok so is the idea meaning to empty the account anytime before April comes?(*because April could be the next likely Promo  per quarter?)And since 28Mar gives a little leeway and don‚Äôt compromise on Day‚Äôs Interest so therefore 28th,btohqsg
Correct  if there's a promo  it'll likely be in Apr.,btohqsg
Thanks! üôè Appreciate it very much! üòä,btohqsg
You can monitor this forum. I sure there will be a lot of helpful people who can help advise when it start and how to take advantage of these promos,btohqsg
Awww thank you v much everyone!! You‚Äôre so helpful bunch of humans üíïüíôüíõ,btohqsg
Oh No! I empty $100K 2 weeks ago & the balance interest today.,btohqsg
I would guess if you put back 100k now. Next month you will get around half of it for the interest.,btohqsg
Quickly put back & email the UOB CS officer üòÜü§£ü§£ to give the lost interest,btohqsg
Did u get the name of the CS so I can appeal?,btohqsg
Not 2 weeks  was 17FebSo today is the 10th day,btohqsg
üòÜüôÉ Im not sure they will entertain the idea  but I‚Äôll help you call and find out who served you the last call?,btohqsg
17 Feb before 1030pm or after 1030pm? If after 1030pm then it's considered from 19 Feb instead..,btohqsg
Oooo heng heng it was daytime,btohqsg
