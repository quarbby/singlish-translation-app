Every individual has their own needs  preferences and driving style. So  it is best to evaluate your own needs  preferences and driving style. Then only you will know what‚Äôs the most suitable car for yourselfüòäAfter all  what I like may not be what you like and vice versaüòâWe are just sharing some good deals with the SGCM community.

I have been summoned to help you,btohqsg
eh mr simple  why you change your nameüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
it really depends on your interest. If you are mostly interested in driving locally or US  of course auto transmission would be more than fine. i find manual transmission being quite popular still in europe and some small cities  when you want to go for rentals  you find more manual transmission than auto.,btohqsg
also depends on individuals.  i love manuals so...,btohqsg

congrats on your promotion! 60 on Lane 1?,btohqsg
I just now drive 60On lane 3 feel good,btohqsg
Firstly for license  cheaper to take auto as you may learn faster but due to slot availability it'll take longer. Manual may be more expensive as you'll take a few extra lessons to do but slots are easier to find due to slightly lower demand. If you're looking into school slots that is. For private I recommend just do manual because it's cheaper than school and the instructors skip a few things to finish faster so you won't end up paying too much  plus most private instructors have manual cars,btohqsg
good  no need full throttle hor,btohqsg
Mr@bbfasingapore  you're our Legendary Throttle Masher and Vehicle Smoker leh...,btohqsg
