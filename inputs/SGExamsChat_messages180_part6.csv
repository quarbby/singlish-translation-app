You basically write out questions abt the topic and test yourself. Then without reading the notes go answer all and check back the notes. See where u got it wrong. Repeat this everyday or every 2 days. Its scientifically proven that Memorising or Underlining notes does not help u memorise efficiently. So use active recall for better results.,btohqsg
l1r4 still need a humanities sub anot?,btohqsg
Hmm thereâ€™s a mcq.. on the trends of bonds in halogen molecules... and trends of number of isotopes of halogens,btohqsg
oo yeah i do this too,btohqsg

Except I cant do this everyday,btohqsg
No i thgt u alr finished tbh HAHA,btohqsg
I mean dont have to do All chapters each day. U can do maybe like 2-4 chapters? Just test urself,btohqsg
I'm honestly scared becus I'm too calm about this,btohqsg
