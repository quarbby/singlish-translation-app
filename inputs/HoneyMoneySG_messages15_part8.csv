I applied mine way back. I did not remember it took long.I think probably max 1 week?Personal experience though,btohqsg
hmmm I applied mine 2 weeks ago  not sure what the hold up is :\ maybe alot applications,btohqsg
I canâ€™t be sure  maybe somebody else can advise better,btohqsg
Got mine earlier this month. I think theyâ€™re seeing surge in applications. Takes about 2-3 weeks to open  then theyâ€™ll send you a KYC form to fill out. Processing that takes another 2-4 weeks. All in all  youâ€™re looking at about 1-1.5 months.,btohqsg
Application for Citi Credit Card still not approved. Most likely will not be accepted in time  31st October 2022.,btohqsg
Just have to be approved before 1 Dec 2022 to qualify,btohqsg
Ohh.. I thought is 31st October which is today.,btohqsg
Sorry if this qn was asked before  but for insurance  how do you all pay?,btohqsg
Are Instarem points only valid to offset future spendings? Or it can be transferred elsewhere to gain back as cash?,btohqsg
If we hold the trust card  are we still eligible for SCB sign-up gifts for new card holders?,btohqsg
SCB do not list trust card in their website hence unsure,btohqsg
How long does it take for HSBC rev cc to arrive? Does anyone know?,btohqsg
Damn ðŸ¤¡ heard stories about the timeframe of the approval and didn't think it was real,btohqsg
mine took like closer to 1.5 - 2 months,btohqsg
Thanks guys for answering my query. Guess the only thing I could do now is wait for it to be delivered,btohqsg
Trust card is under trust bank  standchart card is under standchart bank  even though standchart have a share on trust it is not standchart different entity,btohqsg
It is machiam like saying your parent give birth to 2 kids are the 2 kids same pax  obviously not,btohqsg
So is something like same mother different father ah? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Subsidary company also dont belong to parent company,btohqsg
Like how genting hk wind up does not affect genting group,btohqsg
Different entity -trust card is approaching 1st Quarter of their bonus points letâ€™s see how good or accurate are the points.,btohqsg
Hi all  for singsaver credit card promo. If i made a $500 purchase via shopee  it fulfills the requirement right?,btohqsg
Yes for normal shopee transaction payments  not shopee paylater or shopeepay top-up*,btohqsg
should be ok if not shopeepay topup,btohqsg
Just thinking why everyone only takes any amaze+crmc. How about ocbc titanium+amaze  good combo? Anyone does it this way,btohqsg
Has anyone tried using UOB absolute > GrabPay > Revolut Metal to get total 2.7% cashback? Seems might be a great way to get cashback on Cardup with no min spend,btohqsg
For a moment I thought instarem is providing bad conversion rates in JB since there are a lot of news that the rates are 1 SGD to 3.37MYR. turns out the rates decided to plunge on that day only when I was in JB ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Besides GPMC  is there other cards which i can top up with UOB Absolute to pay for insurances ?,btohqsg
It's actually still bad  Instarem's spreads have been getting worse in recent weeks and months. Would advise to avoid for MYR,btohqsg
No actually  as of this time the rate was 1sgd to 3.3MYR. so it's not bad,btohqsg
Sat  29 Oct 2022's interbank rate for SGD-MYR was 3.3469 (IDC)Mastercard's rate was 3.3337 (0.3944% difference). Also the rate you will get on Youtrip (this is reasonable)Instarem's rate was 3.2895 as per your screenshot (1.7150% difference  or 1.3259% spread on top of Mastercard),btohqsg
On XE's side is 3.33 something as well,btohqsg
This instarem vs youtrip debate is very simple.Do you want:1) Low FX spread close to spot OR2) Higher FX Spread  get 1% Cashback and also 4mpd/8% cashbackPick your poison,btohqsg
I clearly am in the former ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
And I clearly am the latter ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
OCBC 360 has increased interest rates :https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account,btohqsg
Which insurance companies accept Amex card that can cashback?,btohqsg
wow better than SSB even for 2 easy category (salary+save),btohqsg
aiyo like this i will keep redeem my SSB and put into higher interest place hahaba,btohqsg
Quick question. If I pair Citibank premiermiles to amaze instarem card  and I were to spend it overseas (to avoid the high fx spread by credit card charges). Do I still get the 2 miles/$ spend or is it considered 1.2mpd spent?,btohqsg
Guess I canâ€™t have my cake and eat it too ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If not paying for hotel why not use  Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Citi rewards miles will expire I think. I rather not have the hassle and just use Citi premiermiles to avoid the expiry date,btohqsg
This is a poison question again:1) 1.2 mpd with no expiry2) 4.0 mpd (3.33x faster) with up to 5 year expiry,btohqsg
"i need a ""pick your poison"" video idea",btohqsg
Depends on the pace u are clocking also .. too fast then go for Citi Rewards redeem within 5 years .. too slow I let the host explain in his own videos ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
I also used to think this way until I reviewed my average spending... 1.2 is really so low that  on hindsight it will take forever to earn any decent flights,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m fast or not but Iâ€™ve use 2 cards so far in 5 years accumulate around 600k+ miles with 1.2mpd spend. Problem is past 5 years I didnâ€™t really touch it until recently because of the borders opening ðŸ˜‚ so yeah Iâ€™d probably take a look into the 4mpd spend cards. Thanks all for the suggestions,btohqsg
Omg then that's even worst  u should really look at utilising 4 mpd cards  if u don't mind the homework haha.I was hoarding on citi PM... Then the devaluation hit this year and I got sad. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
haha yeah  but this kind of thing always changes. last month CIMB had excellent interest rates. this month itâ€™s terrible already and OCBC looking good. At this rate I think I will need to keep moving my liquid funds between banks every month ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
