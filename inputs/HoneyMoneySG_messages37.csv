Hey guys just want to clarify for HSBC Revo  non white list also get 1x reward points?,btohqsg
Non whitelist and non excluded then 1x,btohqsg
okay  so only whitelist is eligible for 10x for the $1000 spend. Non whitelist still get 1x points and does not affect the $1000 spend for 10x points?so to give an example if I spent $40 on transport (simplygo) I get 40 points. Then I spent $1000 on online retail and get 10000 points. Am I right? or would the $40 that I spent affect the $1000  and they only consider $960 for 10x points?,btohqsg
Makes sense. Just checking is there any disadvantage to this or anything to take note if I do this? Thanks,btohqsg

SMRT 5% rebate is higher than 3.25% exchange rate fee  and I heard that amaze rate is no longer good,btohqsg
Anyone can tell me which platform can I have a best rate to change my sing dollars to USD than transfer to DBS bank?,btohqsg
does this exchange rate is the same if we convert from sgd to myr and keep in insta wallet?,btohqsg
When you convert you use the exchange rate as of that moment you convert. Just like money changer.,btohqsg
can consider use Amaze+Maybank family and friends or Amaze+citi cashback,btohqsg
Got bad review on fb or Reddit I think say can't refund,btohqsg
Didnt you ask this question before?This rate is for remits only. The rates for wallet funds and card linkage are different and is real time.,btohqsg
I saw the news online. If the airline gives you a refund unlikely can claim from insurance  since you were reimbursed for the ticket,btohqsg
How can one apply credit card without annual 30k salary?,btohqsg

Anyone here has experience with applying for HSBC Platinum card? I recently opened HSBC EGA account and then applied for HSBC Platinum visa card as the cashback is quite good - 5% on dining etc.but 4 days i didn't hear from HSBC and today when I called  they said the application is rejected.,btohqsg
Can anyone confirm if this way earn 4 mpd?CRMC > Amaze > Google pay > Kris+,btohqsg
HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
hopefully will be a good experience with HSBC  😂,btohqsg
Replace damage nric on ica website can get cashback from Evo   revo or dbs live fresh ? 😂,btohqsg
This might be useful to some,btohqsg
Yes. I also opened an EGA account with HSBC and registered for the bonus interest promo. But whenever I ask customer care what interest I am getting on my deposit. They always say 0.05%,btohqsg
yup the hsbc customer service officer doesnt seem very knowledgeable on the promos when i called too. base interest is 0.05%  the bonus interest of 4.55% will only be paid out 6 months later,btohqsg
so there's a kind of component of a 6 months fixed deposit / tbill concept inside,btohqsg

Go to the payment source and change it to the amaze wallet,btohqsg
1. HSBC EGA acc1 transfer out to OCBC acc12. OCBC acc1 transfer into HSBC EGA acc2Anyone knows if HSBC would deem the above deposit into HSBC EGA acc2 as fresh funds because the origin of funds is the same as the destination of the outflow for another HSBC account  and don't give the EGA & Everyday+ bonus interest?,btohqsg

Don’t bother unless you are super careless,btohqsg
it never seems worth it until your phone is cracked beyond repair and needs replacement by some kind of freak accident,btohqsg
i think can try. maybe can change battery when close to the waranty expiry😂,btohqsg
Show that you care for your iPhone  by purchasing the Apple Care! ❤️,btohqsg
I bought AC+ about 2 weeks before the end of my 13PM warranty so as to extend the device warranty to almost 3 years (with last 2 including accidental coverage),btohqsg

Extend Waranty wasted money. The chance of breaking maybe only 5% or less. But pay close to 20% phone price 😂,btohqsg

Hey all  flight ticket purchases should be eligible for ocbc credit card promo right? Sorry noob here,btohqsg
If you are lazy to do it yourself  it is a good way to set and forget.Returns are based on when you start and market conditions. The returns will be the same as diy on brokers.,btohqsg
Agree. The fees are similar to buying a REITs ETF on your own too,btohqsg
Citi Rewards card is statement or calendar month?,btohqsg

Hi guys Any cards to recommend for points / miles for health screening purposes?,btohqsg
Hi guys  appreciate ur help in advance. I do have some big ticket items like electronics   bathroom items  mattress etc for my new place. Understand I can use Ocbc titanium card for selective MCC. What are the alternative cards for those retail spending that fall out of the MCC?,btohqsg
You can't link either HSBC Revolution or Revolut-issued cards to Amaze as they're both Visa cards,btohqsg
Thank you very much Trazora. Meaning link HSBC Revolut to favepay for payment also entitle for HSBC 10X points base on Whitelist.,btohqsg
Link to Fave payment is considered online payment? So technically can try linking citi smrt or DBS woman card to it?,btohqsg
It will work as long as FavePay isn't excluded transaction by the card (Women's world excludes FavePay transactions),btohqsg
Avoid dbs card except dbs live fresh.,btohqsg
Hi good day.I am buying item that the shop allows to pay using grabpay  or fave.Which combo of card to grabpay or fave is the best return?,btohqsg
and also is the shop for dining or something else?,btohqsg
Grabpay top Amex tcb by April will go,btohqsg
Insta.Citi rewardsCiti cash back.Uob abs (last time I use this for grabpay  but I heard that the cash back drop)Stand chart smart,btohqsg
If you're going Amex route  TCB/UOB Absolute topup GrabPay then link GrabPay to FavePay (1.5% or 0.3% + 1.2% GrabPoints),btohqsg
Or if you pay with Citi Rewards + FavePay you can get 4mpd or 2.27% cashback + Fave cashback on your next return,btohqsg
Next month onwards topup TCB to GrabPay will not earn any cashback,btohqsg
so link GrabPay to FavePay will get you 1.2% back in GrabPoints,btohqsg
+ Fave cashback on your next visit,btohqsg
Considering you don't have Amex TCB card  yes,btohqsg
Understand. So no point for me to get other cards now.,btohqsg
How about if we still need to use grabpay  the still only better only is uob abs?,btohqsg
Just make sure the FavePay merchant you're paying is not under transport or CRMC excluded category,btohqsg
Oh it's not. It's a tcm shop. Buying tonics,btohqsg
If you have to use GrabPay  the only card that gives cashback on topups is UOB Absolute (0.3%),btohqsg
So UOB Absolute (0.3%) + Pay GrabPay through FavePay (1.2%) = 1.5% back,btohqsg
If you're paying through FavePay though using CRMC is almost always better,btohqsg
Sometime still need to order  and get card 😅,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure Citi Rewards will give 4mpd on Grab rides,btohqsg
You mean pay using cc direct. Without top up?,btohqsg
So the best way is to use this?,btohqsg
Sorry I'm totally lost one haha. So payment for ride use direct cc charge.For food use grab top up credit?,btohqsg
You also get 4mpd on GrabFood,btohqsg
So please ignore my previous advise on using GrabPay,btohqsg
From what I understand now it looks like all your transactions are eligible for 4mpd on Citi Rewards,btohqsg
So I don't need top up  just everything direct charge to rewards cc using grab app,btohqsg
But my purchase from tcm shop still have to use rewards cc + fave,btohqsg
If u are using favepay  u can just charge through uob absolute cb directly. 1.7% cb directly. Less hassle  more cb than this way,btohqsg
I'm not 100% sure  but I believe so,btohqsg
use other 4mpd cards for grab ride/food,btohqsg
It does. I recently just use my amex via favepay,btohqsg
Oh they accept that now? Good to know,btohqsg
I still have dbs woman world Mastercard,btohqsg
This card works with grab and fave too?,btohqsg
Grab - yes  Fave - no,btohqsg
good for grabfood/ride but not fave,btohqsg
So this card also another 4mpd card that you all say that can work the same ways as Citi rewards to just charge the food order and car order direct to it?,btohqsg
If that's the case in summary.If I need fave:Rewards + fave for shop purchase.If need food and ride from grab:Charge direct to reward or women world master,btohqsg
Because top up give lesser return,btohqsg
One more help.Rewards card limit is how much,btohqsg
Citi Rewards 1k  Woman's world 2k,btohqsg
One more thing  let's say if you go overseas and book flights or hotels  don't use Citi Rewards card,btohqsg
Top up max before April end of Days,btohqsg
Thank you all for your kind teaching,btohqsg
KL doesn't have Amex TCB card  by this point it's likely too late to apply,btohqsg

Can I check for hsbc ega 4.55%  do we need to switch in and out on alternate months or simply top up and enjoy 4.55% for 3 months?,btohqsg
is 4.55% compared to reference month for the 4 month cycle. only the everyday+ promo 1% compared to previous month when u need do 2K in and 5 x FAST out every 2 months,btohqsg
Any idea if Amex can be used to pay great eastern insurance via AXS? 🤔,btohqsg
So if reference month is Apr and $0  subsequent next 3 months I deposit 1K each  I will earn 4.55% for 1K  2K  3K respectively?,btohqsg
If you reference month is April means u are doing May-August cycle  you will get 4.55% for the 4 months as long as u sms in on May,btohqsg

Hi guys Any cards to recommend for points / miles for health screening purposes?,btohqsg
If you do that  you have to pay 2 times transaction fee. Eventually  the allocations would probably combined into one. When you want to sell  you can specify any amount from the total allocation.,btohqsg
With Kris + even better I guess ?,btohqsg
If you can  of course better 😂,btohqsg
Hello! I recently used Citi rewards card to pay manually all my telco bills (singtel for phone  m1 for broadband) and noticed I didn’t get the bonus points. So I called in to check and they said bills are considered an exclusion.I used to think recurring bills are exclusion only  rather than manual bill payments. Anyone had the same experience recently?,btohqsg
Does Kris+ work with CRMC? Since it uses in app Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Foodpanda payment via Apple Pay is considered online spend or contactless spend? TIA!,btohqsg
yes  considers as online because of Amaze,btohqsg
Is the HSBC Premier Master Credit Card good?,btohqsg
It's meh. You can get 8% on the same categories with Maybank F&F and Citi Cash Back,btohqsg
Question regarding stash account:If I put in 100k in it now  will I get 3% for the month of march?Or will it be best for me to put in the funds on 1st April?,btohqsg
No  it's not eligible for 10X. Apple Pay doesn't support Amaze,btohqsg
Yes it does but you will not get 10x rewards points because it is paid from a mobile wallet,btohqsg
Even though the category that you spend on is not in the excluded ones,btohqsg
Ya that’s what I assumed. I think only dbs woman’s world will qualify due to the in app Apple Pay method required,btohqsg
Anyone happen to know the mcc for easybook?,btohqsg
For UOB ONE account 100k  when we will receive the interest? Would it be one or two transactions?,btohqsg
If I use HSBC rev with ShopBack  can I still earn 4miles?,btohqsg

confirm can bot get 10x reward,btohqsg
confirm CRMC can get 10x reward when pay singtel and starhub bill in app.,btohqsg
Ok. My M1 and My republic bill when I called it was shot back for broadband. Singtel is still pending in the app after I paid but the customer service person say also excluding. Will see if it’s true after it’s actually transacted. Thanks.,btohqsg
Telco App. Specifically for m1 broadband as an example. I still purposely remove card just to try it,btohqsg
so u got 1x point but no 9x point?,btohqsg
Hmm I didn’t ask so specific. But basically my balance now is say 850 dollars but my points is only about 7.6k clocked. So I called in to check which transaction didn’t yield the 10x point  and they said the two lines of telco bills  one being M1 made via app.M1 I also recalled if you do recurring the bill will reflect recurring so this one that I did don’t have that recurring word so I’m also sure it’s not due to recurring.Should I call back to ask this specifically? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
check the points awarded daily on citi rewards website.https://www.citirewards.com/cms/sites/globalrewards-sg-eng/index.pagebtw you got wait like 2 working days after transaction posted?,btohqsg
if really want to ask cso  ask them for the mcc and whether it is online/recurring,btohqsg
Actually maybe you’re right. And maybe the CSO is blur. Cause I recently used to also sign MyRepublic broadband. Then now you mention to track back. My m1 bill was 40  and I see a points that clocked +40 and 369 respectively. Which means likely it wen through. But maybe the MyRepublic was not counted because it was meant to be a deposit. So maybe that was not qualified despite being a telco mcc.If so then I hope MyRepublic will be considered as online telco spending then!So probably the CSO blur cause she tell me the m1 bill also never clock. I have a pending singtel bill to verify eventually.Thanks for the detailed tip. Appreciate it!,btohqsg

Hi all  I’m planning to buy TRAVEL INSURANCE ONLINE. Can I pair my Amaze card with Citibank Rewards or DBS WOMAN’s World CC? Ideally to get cashback and miles.,btohqsg
Noted and thanks. Hence HSBC EGA promo only from March to June 2023  at the moment 👍🏻,btohqsg
CRMC wont work as insurance js an exclusion under the card’s T&Cs,btohqsg
Any card that use for miles for MCC 5712,btohqsg
What’s the best mileage card to be paired with amaze for overseas accommodations? I think both CR and OCBC titanium both excludes travel  and I’m male so don’t really have access to UOB lady’s card.,btohqsg
What about Citibank cashback+ or DBS Woman’s World? For Insurance payment,btohqsg
Maybank Visa Infinite I think currently only this is available for insurance payment . Otherwise you have until April 4 to use Amex HF + grabpay,btohqsg
Oh only 1 day difference  much better than EGA many months waiting time,btohqsg
Anyone top up wrongly to CPF medisave instead of RA manage to get an appeal success?,btohqsg

Hi all  does HSBC Revo earns miles for hospital bills?,btohqsg
hi guys  just a quick check  there's too many numbers on HSBC websites.what is the maximum cashback cap on HSBC Advance? and what is the maximum amount i can spend on the advance?,btohqsg
Is Insurance part of the exclusion list for Grab Pay to receive Grab points?,btohqsg
SA shielding is not top up MA,btohqsg
Yes  I think they implemented the exclusion quite sometime back,btohqsg
U can go find Chris video to understand more about it,btohqsg
Of cos no grab points. Grab only awards points for1) Grabpay card 0.3% points on Food and beverages2) Grabpay online/paylater3) Lucky box from dedicated green Grab QR,btohqsg
at most 1x point or 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Any fees if transfer usd from tigr.futu to dbs?,btohqsg
Between HSBC Revolution and CRMC. Of course I choose hsbc 1mpd than CRMC 0.4mpd,btohqsg
So you can confirm HSBC Revo earn miles from hospital bills?,btohqsg
wrong. I mentioned hsbc revolution at most 0.4mpd only. Can use Amaze+CRMC for 4mpd for max $1k,btohqsg
Hi all  curious to know whether CPF life monthly payouts will increase if our total RA is above ERS? Or is ERS the maximum amount for RA?,btohqsg
ERS is maximum amount  excess will go to OA,btohqsg
if CRMC not exclude hospital is good to link Amaze to pay,btohqsg
Anyone has tried using cardup for car loan and mortgage loan? Can pair with UOB One card?,btohqsg
Seems like UOB one card now excludes cardup and ipaymy,btohqsg
But as hospital bills are usual more than 1K.  money spent over 1K earn 0.4 mpd.,btohqsg
Other cards I have other than CRMC are DBS Alti and HSBC revo but DBS exclude hospital bills to earn DBS points.,btohqsg
Hey anyone used StashAway Simple Plus? What are your reviews and thoughts about it?,btohqsg

hi  guys. how long it usually take for ocbc to process my credit card application?😄,btohqsg

New to bank or existing customer?,btohqsg
existing  but the CSO called me the next morning ask me to submit salary slip,btohqsg
i have 360 account  i think im an existing customer but not a cardholder😂,btohqsg
Existing is always almost immediate. New to the bank won't be that fast,btohqsg
Saving accounts won't count. You have new to the bank status,btohqsg
that makes sense. if it is so fast for entry level card with existing customer. i think ocbc works slow😂one time i sent them an email  they responded me after 2 weeks.,btohqsg
It could be that I'm one of the first to apply after they up the 360 interest on 31 Oct night,btohqsg
Hi may I know if amaze linked to Citirewards but cap at 1k  what other cards do y’all use aft that?,btohqsg

Sry one more qn  would u choose amaze or revolut? Haha,btohqsg
Tax season is here and here are some income tax facts!Singapore's personal income tax rates for resident taxpayers are progressive. This means higher income earners pay a proportionately higher tax. Starting from 2% and are currently capped at 22% for YA 2023.However  to achieve greater progressivity  the top marginal personal income tax rate will be increased with effect from YA 2024. Chargeable income in excess of $500 000 up to $1 million will be taxed at 23%  while that in excess of $1 million will be taxed at 24%; both up from the current rate of 22%.#taxes#singapore#incometax#IRAS,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask for revolut which cc to link up with?,btohqsg
UOB takes long. I received the outcome after 1.5 months. Upon checking the free cbs report I learnt that they requested a credit report 1 month later after I applied.,btohqsg
I am PR. Got rejected twice by CIMB also,btohqsg
do we only get this cbs report after our credit card has been approved?,btohqsg
It's alright  there are still several great banks in Singapore to apply ..,btohqsg
Approve/reject. Basically every time the bank makes a request and regardless of the outcome,btohqsg

If you are not chasing credit card rewards  you can just pay one shot via paynow on IRAS website (chop chop method). You can also pay via AXS.If you wish to earn some credit card rewards  you can pay vis cardup or ipaymy. Chris has done several you tube videos on this method.,btohqsg
Have cancellation fee. About 100%. Which means u cancel for nothing.,btohqsg
Yes  there’s a cancellation fee of 2 months subscription but not sure if I can keep the metal card for their standard plan,btohqsg

Good morning to all Si Fu..I just bought a Great Eastern insurance plan and it doesn't accept credit card payment for premium. Any recommendations on those ipaymy  cardup kind of services?,btohqsg
If I use CRMC to pay for a big ticket item on cardup then I opt to pay my Citi bill in instalment plan  will I still recd any Citi rewards? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Yes ipaymy or cardup are fine or you can also consider citi payall if you have a good rewards earning citi credit card,btohqsg
thanks ... but i thought city payall only gives the base rewards?eg: if i pair it with CRMC i will only get 1 pt for every single dollar spent instead of 10x pts?,btohqsg
Yes correct  so have to use citi cards with better base earn rates,btohqsg
May i ask  for those whom collect miles. Do you only transfer when you about to use the miles or you transfer and keep in the airlines miles?,btohqsg
I transfer when I need or when my credit card points are going to expire. Some cards have points that don't expire like dbs altitude so might as well just keep there until you need to use it.,btohqsg
usually i keep till i need to use the miles  as some cards charge you for the transfer of miles  but you have to be mindful fo the individual expiry dates for the miles on each card.,btohqsg
I have a question. Take HSBC revo for example. The points expire 3 years after card approval so the points of the 36th month will instantly expire after being credited ?,btohqsg
Hi  can i know which credit card best for clinic payments?,btohqsg
Hello all  I'm abit confused on the UOB PPV. Do I earn rewards points if I make payment via apple pay/atome on flight tickets (let say fromtrip.com),btohqsg
No. The card to use is Visa Signature. Spend 1K and up to 2K  you get 4 mpd for reasonable FCY spend,btohqsg
interested to know this as well,btohqsg
hi guys! can check if I pay travel insurance using my lady solitaire card  does that count into the min credit card spend of $500 for the uob one 7.85% interest promo? I tried asking uob chat assist but they don't know and but will arrange for a call back which never happen!,btohqsg

Hi all  would like to ask if ntuc membership fee is considered eligible spend for credit cards?,btohqsg
how do you even select RMB as payment currency on taobao? haha. I've been trying to but my only currency available are 'foreign currency' so i had to choose SGD and let taobao auto-convert from RMB.,btohqsg
If I use CRMC to pay for a big ticket item on cardup then I opt to pay my Citi bill in instalment plan  will I still recd any Citi rewards? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
have been using mobile all these while and couldn't get it to work in RMB. oh wells 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
but I'm just playing around with payment options  it seems like paying in SGD does not have a fee now,btohqsg
when you pay in SGD did you have processing fee previously?,btohqsg
yes  processing fee is levied to payment through overseas credit card actually rather than for currency conversion per se. Although the conversion rate is thrash as well. I'm sure they take a cut too.,btohqsg
Did u try paying via axs?,btohqsg
U check yr statement.some points expire later,btohqsg
Can be done but i wont earn any miles/cashback.,btohqsg
I think the processing fee is a 1 time waver only. boo boo...,btohqsg
Citi payall..which Citi card can get the max cashback?,btohqsg

Yeah for me the withdrawal I made yesterday morning was only reflected after midnight,btohqsg

all should offer  just that some more experience than others.. for citibank i last heard only can applied at parkway parade. hsbc took me 3months cause they never send in my application  have to head down again to applied  1 month for that.,btohqsg
most card excludes topup from rewards  hence method 1 dont give you any rewards. method 2 is paying straight to the merchant  thats why you dont get rewards on the app  but is eligible for card rewards,btohqsg
Couldn't find any info on Maybank  as I offered it for my sis who can't meet min income requirement  but would be very good to pay school fees,btohqsg
usually secured cc need go down branch to ask,btohqsg

Axs loopholes have largely been plugged. The only official one left is Maybank fnf with 0.3% cashback  and limited to only payments of up to $50.,btohqsg
Not that I know of   but if there is a way would eager to explore for more card rewards,btohqsg

Hi  Any one knows If I use CRMC to pay for a big ticket item on cardup then I opt to pay my Citi bill in instalment plan  will I still recd any Citi rewards? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
of cos not. in the first place why crmc for big ticket item  why use cardup?,btohqsg
Card up but pay with CRMC,btohqsg
But say the item is 20k so will be painful to pay off Citi in one month,btohqsg
think you can read on buy now pay later apps like Atome etc,btohqsg
So it’s like paying for a course that is not a merchant,btohqsg
No way to pay by other means except card up,btohqsg
So I think if wanna pay by instalments no rewards else cardup and get CRMC rewards but have to pay back Citi in one month,btohqsg

Hi all  just curious to ask what sort of USD or EUR shares or funds from Robo advisors you are investing into? Not asking for financial advise  looking for opinions and reference point only. Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Have you explored the Robo's websites yet? Some dont require you to choose the funds. You can just hope on their core portfolios. See if they suit you.There are quite a number of robos to choose from.EndowusSyfeMoneyOwlStashaway (don't go with them😂).There are also robos from banks if you are more comfortable with that.,btohqsg
For me submitted at the end of Dec and processed only in the middle of Feb.,btohqsg
can u pls tell us why u dont like stashwaay?,btohqsg
not just me. Its a general consensus.,btohqsg
i dun like them also  but i'm invested with them and been losing,btohqsg
Some Reasons- Higher fees as compared to other robos.- They have been making bad decisions which has led to lower or negative returns.- They sold kept adding on china stocks when it was dropping and sold it at the lowest point and moving the funds to other allocations (Tell me this is not active trading lol),btohqsg
I have tried playing around with Moomoo for the free kopi 60 dollars signup bonus and hold on to Fullerton cash fund.Have a friend working with Philips  so going to sign up with Poems and check them on.

Are you signing up with Philips just because if your friend?If income there are robos to serve you as well. There is syfe reits if not you can go to endowus using their income portfolioI think@ChrisHMSGshould have some referral codes for the robos you can use them for extra rewards,btohqsg
I’ve actually lost more with Syfe than StashAway surprisingly,btohqsg
DBS DIGIPOTFOLIO is interesting   because the Digi DBS Portfolio only calculates management fees (daily balance)  and not transactional fees. But question is do we DCA on our own or do we do lump sum?,btohqsg

Abit  thanks for the info. It’s good  will absorb and try to come out with a practical step by step execution plan for myself 🙏,btohqsg
yeap  historical data don't guarantee future gains.. only invest what you can lose! Even bank bonds are not entirely safe like Credit Suisse  but then again AT-1 class bond is slightly different hahaha,btohqsg
Most likely next t bills will be lower ?,btohqsg
Yeap. But the syfe one is the pur equities one not their core. So expected? I haven't checked in months cause I stopped all investment completely till I see some signs like the feds reversing their rates,btohqsg
I would agree to disagree here. That's not the point of robo. If you have the time to go look and find out about the underlying funds you should really be considering to do it yourself you already did like minimally  75% of the work liao.,btohqsg
what work? Am I suppose to invest into a robo without knowing the underlying funds?,btohqsg
His point is since you already went thru the trouble of finding out about the funds  might as well just diy into ETFs for much less fees,btohqsg
Sorry I thought you meant doing even more due diligence than a somewhat surface level knowledge of the funds.,btohqsg
Yeap. ESP if it’s anything more than really surface level stuff. That’s what the management  fee is for (at least that’s how I justified it to myself lah),btohqsg
I am refer to just the funds in the portfolio for comparison. If the other robo uses a totally different fund in the portfolio  it is not a apples to apples comparison for returns,btohqsg
Its a less then 5 mins job 🥲,btohqsg
While yes… the funds they invest in is their “algo” no… so… technically…..I would still say the comparison is valid in a way,btohqsg
But regardless I do feel most robo advisors are really samaSama,btohqsg
And it’s sure as hell better than Ilp or worse doing nothing,btohqsg
it is really sama sama. all their core portfolios are the same,btohqsg
only the satellite or rather themes portfolios are diff,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  anyone have been using the HSBC EGA for some time already? can i check is it must deposit at least $2k into the account each month + have 5 eligible transaction via giro/credit card then can get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg

Hi experts  If I want to do giro to iras  where can I download the business envelope to mail?,btohqsg
The miles strategy also makes sense because if pay for few k of airline flights another headache is using which card to pay. Dbs alt is 3mpd  amex kf is 2mpd for SIA. So in this consideration another reason to do miles game.,btohqsg
"You can set up a giro arrangement directly on the iras mytax portal by clicking on ""apply payment plan"" then selecting whether you want one time payment or monthly payment",btohqsg

Hi Chris  suggestion for next follow up video -1)comparison between straight redemption Vs miles upgrade.2)direct comparison to cashback. Convert CPM to cashback equivalent .,btohqsg
With direct CPM to cashback equivalent comaprison. Quite clear card miles card is better than cashback card provided earning at optimal rate of 4 mpd and efficient redemption,btohqsg
Oh for HSBC yes probably  because the mytax portal only can do online giro arrangement for dbs/posb  uob and ocbc,btohqsg
Time and monthly credit card limit is probably the main enemy for miles hunter.,btohqsg
with right redemption  the cashback equivalent is over 10%,btohqsg

Agreed. As much as I am a mile hunter but I also agree that it may not be suitable for everyone . Bcos there are intangible factors that are hard to be valued . Eg. Time value of money  instant gratification from cashback  option to use cashback accumulated  to grow more money etc.,btohqsg
Need earn at 4mpd rate and  redeem/upgrade for business class and up.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if I can get 4MPD if I book flights on Expedia with my DBS Woman's MC?The ongoing 8MPD (DBS Altitude) doesnt cover the flights I'm taking :(,btohqsg
Can we pay credit bills first b4 the statements generate out?,btohqsg
assuming a recurring spend of $3500.. is it better to go for 4mpd on DBS womens world  or simply a card with 3.3% cashback like maybank platinum? consideration that dbs 4mpd is for first 2k.. the rest is 0.4 mpd if I'm not wrong. advice?,btohqsg
Does anyone know SCB smart card if can get bonus reward if use mcdonald app order and pay,btohqsg
Yes. I normally pay (most) before  just to keep the credit utilization low.,btohqsg
hmm interesting.. just seeking opinions.. cos some time back i wanted to purchase a big ticket item say 20k  but credit limit is 10k.. offer to pay 10k in advance so that the 20k transaction can be successful.. CS says cannot :>,btohqsg
Wah I do wonder if the transaction will go through first... Cos standard limit set is below that figure? Hahaha,btohqsg
any credit card to suggest if i always order food on grab and food panda ?,btohqsg
Can you share how you pay first? Is it you just transfer money into the card?,btohqsg
XNAP pair with applepay UOB one card  still valid for cash back right?,btohqsg
Why don't split the 3.5k between multiple cards,btohqsg
Also alot to consider such as how would you redeem your miles. Optimal redemption method such as going for biz/first ? Do you value business/first experience as compared to the cashback you would have accumulated? Eg. Do you rather use the money you saved from all the cashback on other things as compared to using miles to redeem for luxurious travel experience.,btohqsg
Some ppl may feel that they rather use (eg. 4k accumulated from cashback (random number) for other personal stuff that gives them better utility) as compared to using miles for biz/first class experience which is just for that few hours and probably sleeping majority of the time.,btohqsg
If possible  redeem the flight at the savers rate,btohqsg
Anybody knows of strategies to optimizing their miles for business expenses?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I am looking thru the chats and noticed that UOB One/OCBC 365 is best for utility payment. But I am not able to meet the OCBC365 min spend of $800 per month (because I am collecting miles) and I dont have UOB One account.The next best alternative will be the the POSB Everyday Capped at $3 per month.Qn: Recurring bill payments meaning i need to set up in the app to auto charge to my POSB Everyday Card or I just need to go in SP App to make the payment every month ?Also if there are any other cards that I might have missed  please enlighten me.Thanks all in advance!,btohqsg
Thanks for replying. I do use miles for travel. I'm considering if only 2k out of 3400 is applicable for bonus 4mpd.. maybe it's better the full 3400 used in Cashback of 3.3%.. cashback may generate better returns to buy air tickets with cash,btohqsg

ya but not worth it  you kena 3.25% forex fee. General recommendation is to use Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Why don’t use HSBC revolution card directly instead of Amaza+CRMC? Both also offers 4 mpd,btohqsg
Guys I remembered seeing a promo for 4mpd extra for using Harvey Norman on Kris+ for the next week or so... But I can't seem to find the promo anywhere now. Did I dream of it? 😂,btohqsg
You mean HSBC also got 3.25% FX fee?,btohqsg
If I use CRMC stand alone  will I get 3.25% FX fee also?,btohqsg
So the big different between Amaze+CRMC and HSBC revolution is this 3.25% FX only?,btohqsg
there's subtle differences between the 4 mpd categories  but the savings of the 3.25% FX fee is quite big,btohqsg
No but good idea. Cos it's a one transaction spend .. monthly sub of aws,btohqsg
Can I check for uob one  is the base cashback fixed? E.g. If you spend 750$ on the card for 3 months  you'll still only get back $50 after 3rd quarter?,btohqsg
So it's not like an unlimited cashback thing  3.33 for 500 1000 and 2000 respectively huh,btohqsg
yes up to 3.33% quarterly rebate. Though can also get bonus rebate for specific merchants,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I will earn 4mpd from my telco like this?CRMC > Amaze > google pay > Giga app.,btohqsg
I think giga alr considered online?If mcc not allowed even if u do this loop don't make sense lol,btohqsg
yes  assuming can pay giga using googlepay.,btohqsg
Yes giga app allows google pay.,btohqsg
From what I know mcc will be different if setup recurring monthly payments,btohqsg
At least that's what I know. I might be wrong.,btohqsg
the issue is only online gets 4mpd  mcc should still be the same telco mcc which is not excluded,btohqsg
The category is under bills utilities & taxes when I bill it under my DBS Alti. I just changed it to Google pay with CRMC+Amaze. So I am not sure if I will earn 4mpd this way.,btohqsg
But on DBS Alti is monthly recurring payment.,btohqsg
that is not the mcc  for dbs can check mcc on ibanking chatbot,btohqsg

I would think it will be your Citi rewards/ uob ladycard + amaze will be the best combo   otherwise you can use your cashback + amaze .,btohqsg
You’re welcome   just to add even if you’re not into miles   you can convert Citi thankyou point to cash ( though not worth ) its roughly 4% cashback on top of the amaze rewards 1% . By paying the spread instarem 1.5%-2% you still get about 3% of cash back,btohqsg

Hi  mcc for simplygo is 4111 right? Seems like it is qualify for 10x reward,btohqsg
Simplygo is commonly excluded from eligibility for miles or cashback for all citibanks card other than citi SMRT sir,btohqsg
Actually the exclusion is on the merchant level (BUS/MRT*) right? So if you use Amaze to change the merchant to AMAZE*  won't it get 4 mpd?,btohqsg
Afaik  Citi SMRT requires the transaction to be BUS/MRT*ANDMCC 4111. So likely you try to add in AMAZE* BUS/MRT* won't work cos they might check MCC too.,btohqsg
I know. I'm saying trying to use AMAZE* to circumvent the BUS/MRT* check might not be applicable for CRMC and other Citi MCs,btohqsg
Amaze still retains the mcc right since it just acts as pass through? Which means as long as it’s SimplyGo  it wouldn’t be eligible even if you use amaze,btohqsg
