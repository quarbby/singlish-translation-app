what is the current good options to put SRS in? T-Bills?,btohqsg
Without a degree doesn't mean that you will fail in your career  just that it limits your career choice and its advancement path. For example  in corporate world  degree is almost a mandatory requirement to climp up the corporate ladder,btohqsg
I was looking at the uob evol credit card terms and conditions and it excludes nets. I'm wondering if that is referring to transactions that have NET at the front in my credit card statement? If not  what does the nets exclusion mean?,btohqsg
no worries  it is just standard clause to exclude using the card for NETS payment instead of VISA. Having NET in transaction description not under this exclusion.,btohqsg
I thought u can only use nets on debit cards  its possible to use nets on a credit card?,btohqsg
can  for credit cards that are linked to the bank and with NETS logo behind. Not sure if EVOL can be used for NETS transactions  this is just standard exclusion.,btohqsg
New learning for Evol: Do not use UOB Evol card for foreign currency transactions. It's not counted towards the 600 min spend. Missed my last month's cashback due to buying the rm30 ktm train ticket üòÇ,btohqsg
hm so strange  should be counted so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
I dunno... I called UOB  the agent scanned through my transactions (total 602sgd)  and said this foreign currency transaction is the only one not counted. Guess I am spending the 600 too close too... Another lesson learned. üòî,btohqsg
probably mcc excluded in this case,btohqsg
Icic. But he did mentioned foreign currency to me.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for uob one account Giro - hdb car park payment consider?Any other giro ideas?Sorry if this qns been ask before üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyone use Evol at overseas before to confirm?,btohqsg
Giro idea: Iras income tax  Iras property tax  UOB cc payment  other cc payment  starhub.,btohqsg
Maybe is bcos of railway/gov mcc? My Agoda online in USD counted for EVOL.,btohqsg
Good to know... Thanks for the info.,btohqsg
May i know buy capita voucher using app consider eligible spend or exclude?,btohqsg
It's consider top up. Not eligible for cashback  when I spend this via HSBC revol. Called to confirm.,btohqsg
My spending in japan also counted  maybe is your mcc excluded. Not due to foreign currency,btohqsg
Where did you buy n pay your KTM ticket?,btohqsg
It shall include. Mcc code shall be 4112. Can you try to use DBS digibot to check its mcc code.,btohqsg
Now still can buy ntuc voucher for minimum spend?,btohqsg
EVOL can. Most SG issued credit cards have NETS. Anyway the back of the card will have the NETS logo to indicate that,btohqsg
I spend 600+ rm and it was counted for evol,btohqsg
Ahh ok I was not aware that u could use nets on a credit card  have always assumed it's a debit card only thing.,btohqsg
I will always suggest against using NETS if visa/mc payment is available even for debit card with their cute little cashback,btohqsg
yea I've never used nets be it debit or credit card üòÇ,btohqsg
Hence my lack of awareness that it exists for credit cards,btohqsg
After the first 1k spend  a wallet option may be better if we track the fx and convert it,btohqsg
All transactions are my usual ones except 1 & 2. Uob agent thinks it was #1 - foreign currency not counted. #2 - payment for pilates class.,btohqsg
I have requested for appeal as I have few more transactions not counted in Jul 29-31 (initially planned for Aug üòÜ). Guess it should be okay. Was just curious abt this foreign currency thingie...,btohqsg
Wow you must be really lucky then. Assuming the rates are retrieved at the same exact timing (down to the minute)  you got the rare better rate with Amaze. üëçüèª Nonetheless  if you have CRMC  you should always pair it with Amaze for these spendings.,btohqsg
What is your statements date? 31 Jul?,btohqsg
@weionmywayShouldn‚Äôt your Jul cashback only will be credited by end of Aug?The amount you saw on 31 Jul is for your Jun cashback.Go n check your Jun transactions. Likely it is your Jun qualified transactions did not meet minimum $600.,btohqsg
Either one might have been processed offline or counted as computer services (excluded MCC).,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Ai... Guess I need to dig more about how to use the Evol card better. I missed it continously by 2 months (May and June) üòÖ will track better. I knew what I missed accidentally in June  but didn't aware abt May. Thanks all for the info! üòÑüòÑ,btohqsg
You can use your parents' cpf OA to pay for your education. Cpf will inform you when pay back starts. That would include interest as well Bank offer student loan too. Make sure you're comfortable before you sign. I'd take the offer and not look back. My best wishes!!,btohqsg
My view is while you are still young n have the passion n energy to study  go n get the degree if the degree can help to get higher pay after you graduate.Once you grow older  hard for you stay focus n have energy to continue to pursue the degree. This means even if you are financially capable to study a degree in the future  you may not have the energy to do it anymore.$13.5k + $2k is per year or all the tuition fee to get the degree? If it is for the whole degree  it is relatively cheap. You will understand this after you have graduated  start working n progress in your career.,btohqsg
Treat having a degree as a fallback in case you do not have the aptitude to earn a living thru entrepreneurship or trading. Ask yourself truly if you have what it takes to go through these two routes.,btohqsg
Ah I see. There‚Äôs a lot more people siding with getting it degree. Well my end goal is like you guys - financial freedom. The degree I‚Äôm pursuing is in engineering  which has a 4-5k starting salary. The tuition fee is 13.5k per year  so if I pay the monthly installment of 2k for a 45.5k loan W/O interest  it would take me 23 months to pay it all.I would be about 28 by then and I‚Äôm afraid it might be too late to invest due to the risks.But  you are right that a degree is a good thing to fall back on.Just wondering  do you guys think a degree is crucial in Singapore especially in 2023?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen people with portfolios of 100k already by 30 and I‚Äôm afraid I might fall behind,btohqsg
Almost everyone has gone through the phase whereby fresh into adult life they think they can get rich quick thru investing and lead an easy life. Until reality hits them hard. The fact is that most investors lose money  and it's not as easy as you think.,btohqsg
Dear community MCC 4812  have a large upcoming transaction of over 10k  can't seem to find a card on heymax that provide reasonable Cashback or miles for the entire amount.3%/3mpdand above for Cashback  milesMay I seek advice from the community here. Thank you!,btohqsg
What is your reasonable amt then? No one can answer that for u.haha,btohqsg
Oh don‚Äôt worry  I don‚Äôt believe in the get rich quick trading scheme. I believe in compounding and dollar cost averaging.,btohqsg
Hello Champs I am about to pay 10K for my son's 1H school fee; if I pay with City pay all  I get to earn 2.2 miles per dollar according to their advertisement. I believe the cost per mile is 1 cent but I have to pay $220 citi pay all fee.Do you think it's worth paying the tuition with Citi Pay all?,btohqsg
If you are planning to work as employee  then a degree is a must.. Each year thousands are graduating with degree. Then you need to ask yourself: Are you able to offer something that is more than those graduates that make you valued at least the same or even more than them? It doesn't mean you need to take the degree now. But it should be something that you aim for. Nowadays even a degree is not enough  you need to top it up with professional certifications that make you earn higher and faster  help you with your side jobs etc.,btohqsg
