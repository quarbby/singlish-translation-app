Everyday can see rich ppl take airplane,btohqsg
Sit at work for hours and dieding,btohqsg
Hmmmm.. Yea. Give them false imp,btohqsg
True. Make some of us darker too.,btohqsg
all your records should be online,btohqsg
unless you private clinic your whole life,btohqsg
this one is to check any priv clinic shit written like any specialist write stuff lor,btohqsg
There's smth you need to remember in NS. Always spend like on some luxuries,btohqsg
if not you will one shot overspend sometimes,btohqsg
i made the mistake of GOING too spartan in my spending and ended up being too freaking liberal with it at the end of NS,btohqsg
so i save like about 12k+,btohqsg
this one including gov subsidies ah j saying,btohqsg
NS act at the end of 2 years assuming u cpl ard earn at least 19k,btohqsg
so i prolly spent more than 6k in 2 years?,btohqsg
who the fuck ask you invest in non-stable shit,btohqsg
but generally any money u put in crypto u should be ready/ok to lose it,btohqsg
u shouldnt be putting money u cant afford to lose in crypto,btohqsg
if you do thats on you,btohqsg
if you cant afford to lose money go put in etf or ssb or smth safe,btohqsg
shldnt be crypto but any investment tbh,btohqsg
If assuming worst you @PTP/BTP recruit  Combat unit(Median pay) BMT 660   √ó   12=7 920 (PTE/REC)~8 400/8.6K(LCP midway) EOY. 700  √ó   12 = 8 400. 17k+- Earned  Without subsidies,btohqsg
fair ah but there are far safer investments if u want to put money u dont want to lose,btohqsg
i lost also but not as much,btohqsg
i pulled out of crypto almost completely,btohqsg
but thank god i didnt use ftx,btohqsg
i last draw is 880 as a cpl  support unit,btohqsg
i saw ssb rate good i just dump money there alr tbh,btohqsg
now economy abit risky to put money here and there or thats just me being risk adverse,btohqsg
I mean everybody calls compliance people stupid at some point of time,btohqsg
like tsmc nvidia qualcomm that kind ah,btohqsg
If you do website designing it's worth more for your effort than stickers,btohqsg
actually quite worth i think u right,btohqsg
cos global shortage for chips rn,btohqsg
has been since before covid hit,btohqsg
this current shortage going solve soon-ish in next 5-10 years,btohqsg
but the issue is that due to supply chain mgm issues  and bullwhip effect it will last longer  but unknowns like whether there's tech going to speed up will reduce it,btohqsg
what YOU are going to invest in are IOTs,btohqsg
which is what the chips are for,btohqsg
People prob assumed that it is backed by MAS. Sad that it is created by smu students thohttps://scis.smu.edu.sg/news/2021/may/11/how-spore-startup-hodlnaut-able-offer-10-interest-rates-your-cryptocurrencies,btohqsg
just a disclaimer for anyone else reading but not participating uh,btohqsg
nothing here is professional investment advice,btohqsg
do it at your own risk,btohqsg
therefore there's no real value to crypto,btohqsg
crypto is only for heavy betters,btohqsg
Crypto is prob good when there was easy money to prop it up,btohqsg
yea there's a seasonal pattern to crypto,btohqsg
like very easy to spot if you remember and spot trends,btohqsg
Hm there's a way to make money off crypto but it's very Boring and requires deep cash,btohqsg
Usually funds will put like 90% of their shit into safe things and put the remainding 10% into black swan shit that they bet will occur soon within 10 years or so,btohqsg
like if you read stats  every 10 years there's an epidemic,btohqsg
so it's pretty good to buy health companies aft they are quelled,btohqsg
problem only comes when these companies spend too much on R&d,btohqsg
I remember this year  that there was a brief mania about money pox,btohqsg
Imagine like lockdowns are more common,btohqsg
"Here's what i think how funds/Makes money is that they prolly short bet on a long time horizon basis of 10 years on black swan events like wars and trade sanctions and health crisis.If the thing comes within 10 years  boom  money comes cuz nobody expects it. Otherwise they prolly be wasting money  but the money wasted usually is minimal to the BS event's earning. The only reason this works is because they have enough bank to keep doing shorts due to being pooled by others.Funds make money from statistics and history and studies of new financial ""laws"" that arises due to situations  which changes roughly every 6 months. That's why they pay their workers alot. Anyone that breaks the new financial laws code first gets to reap the profit first before the rest of the market catches on and by then all the oil is siphoned by the time the early adopters take the money.",btohqsg

I just whack medicine immediately after test,btohqsg
u oso go to the digestive clinic uh?,btohqsg
But the test at nuclear med,btohqsg
Then no MC also think coz the guy doing the test is just a tech not doc,btohqsg
Ya. They dun give MC. Only the doctor does.,btohqsg
But he pull my timeout on time sheet to afternoon,btohqsg
The thing is u wait so long for the doctor to talk to u for jst 1 min or so.,btohqsg
Mine not so bad for the consult part. It's a consultant handling my case  max also wait 15 min only,btohqsg
At most ask me stand in,btohqsg
But COS morning call me do then night call come someone do,btohqsg
But lets see if they try it haha,btohqsg
Cos someome excuse night duties before so he siam all duty,btohqsg
Honestly   the duty is quite meaningless.,btohqsg
Cant believe they will sacrifice all the stay in C9 to do duty on the days they dont wanna do,btohqsg
Ya i got fucked by my sm because i went bunk sleep at night,btohqsg
But legit cant sleep because they 2am still in office talking,btohqsg
U can‚Äôt slp in the rm?,btohqsg
I need off light sleep liao man,btohqsg
Cuz I know ours have a attached bedroom.,btohqsg
Hate it when regulars do work after lights out,btohqsg
But even if close 1 light the light on the other side can still come in,btohqsg
Cuz ours is in another rm.,btohqsg
Broken down to combine into 1 big room,btohqsg
Other coy tell me they like the design on my office because no partition,btohqsg

ADHD pes range from B3 ro E1,btohqsg
i feel like im probably pes BP,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of voc uw.,btohqsg
its ok i want 2 extra months,btohqsg
BP go in and downpes for Adhd,btohqsg
If u are graded BP means you can only get B1 B2 B4 pes after u finish bmt,btohqsg
ADHD can downpes to E1 one,btohqsg
so if u pes C still must do BMT?,btohqsg
Ya but pes C bmt is resort leh,btohqsg
i just adhd all the way,btohqsg
cuz still need do some psych eval,btohqsg
Once u are graded then u can decide what to do,btohqsg
If u BP u can just declare adhd again first day,btohqsg
Then wait for posting to unit then go kranji,btohqsg
But complete BMT. Else u will be stuck as Rec > priv.,btohqsg
A guy i know ADHD E1 another guy adhd B3,btohqsg
aiya anyways i want to lose weight oso,btohqsg
Its a scam to pass BTP,btohqsg
Once u pass BTP its gonna be like combat trained,btohqsg
I reshot BTP like 4 times,btohqsg
But they all fucking nice only on the day,btohqsg
If u cant pass that your unit posting will always be nom combat,btohqsg
Ooo. ya. I forgot the term alr.,btohqsg
The trick is to not pass anything so they cant assign anything,btohqsg
U basically can farm GD till ORD,btohqsg
my side on average 4 GD a month,btohqsg
But now new batch came in and now like 2 times a month liao,btohqsg
ayo wtf why is my charger so fucking hot,btohqsg
boss it came from the box itself,btohqsg
i want to join the cyber department,btohqsg
Im worried they ask me do because C9 can still do GD haha,btohqsg
If u E1 yes u can,btohqsg
how the fuck did my phone charge from 8-29% in 5 mins,btohqsg
If u C9 yes u can or C2 u can have higher chance to be in cyber,btohqsg
True. But dh to carry weaponry.,btohqsg
my senior told me the cyber department people q eccentric,btohqsg
