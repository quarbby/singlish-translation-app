So basically Bio and maths yall hate lah ACJC students,btohqsg
honestly  my exp with tsd was quite bumpy considering its a coursework subj but if u have exp taking a coursework subj i think that should be no prob. the workload is a lot but tbh quite fun if ur passionate about drama and theatre. and also  our cher said its literally impossible to fail tsd and its honestly quite true üëä although we thought we would do atrociously for promos  we all scored Bs and Cs :D since its a small class (theres 10 of us) its also super chill and the environment is very safe for us to really just be ourselves without judgement. so generally tsd is very fun and to me personally it doesnt really feel like an actual subj sometimes (which tbf can pose some challenges as well) and honestly i would highly advice u to take it as well as it serves as a nice refresher in comparison to the other subjects ur gonna take üòùüòù if u have any other qns PLS ASK ME i will gladly provide my services,btohqsg
Wait have y'all seen chiobu's in rp,btohqsg
apparently acjc requires you to take H1 maths in an arts combi,btohqsg
TM allows H2 maths even for arts stream,btohqsg
O i going to go funorama and find u,btohqsg
so HELp isn't possible unless 4H2??? but prob need to appeal,btohqsg
I think Acjc most ppl get A for tsd,btohqsg
Go on insta look up the diff rp cca and u will find,btohqsg
so cannot take h2 math ?,btohqsg
so like HELP cannot but HELM is ok la,btohqsg
O did i tell u i banned lcw*,btohqsg

Hmm I thought it was quite common,btohqsg
Maybe it‚Äôs for tmjc that it‚Äôs rare,btohqsg
