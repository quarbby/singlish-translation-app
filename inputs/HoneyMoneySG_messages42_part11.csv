Strange. I applied last Fri. Still haven‚Äôt received it,btohqsg
Not sure if u r travelling soon. If u are  u might want to apply a card that allow you to add to your e-wallet before receiving the physical card. Wise and Revolut are examples.,btohqsg
I did a 'swap'. 'Swap' SBJul22 for SBMay23. Simple process. You need  funds on hand because you need funds to buy the SBMay23 first.If no fund  then got to spread across two SSB series.,btohqsg
say if got excess fund but already hit 200k limit... u mean still can redeem and apply at same timing? tot the apply may get rejected due to the 200k limit,btohqsg
Cashflo card avoid GE products you'll charge additional 1%,btohqsg
If a subscriber have hit the 200k ceiling  I think he needs to complete the redemption before subscribing.,btohqsg
yeah... i was thinking so too... so in this case can't really swap at the same instance,btohqsg
ALL giro from HSBC EGA acct earn 1% cashback except giro from HSBC credit card? Is the true or are there more conditions?,btohqsg
Since there is some time before the launch SBJun23  may be you want to give MAS a call? I think some of the folks are in a similar situation. Perhaps u can share here.. Haha,btohqsg
Need to do min $2k transfer in and 5 transactions minimally alternate monthly  then all giro bill payment funded by hsbc ega  except payment of hsbc cc earns 1% cashback.,btohqsg
Am new to Citi Payall. If u have an existing giro with another bank  can I still use Citi Payall to make a single payment every other month to met the 8K transaction? Do I need to terminate my existing giro with other bank? TIA,btohqsg
Hello all  does UOB credit card application take long to get approval ?,btohqsg
Thanks Trazora. Just to clarify I would not need to terminate existing giro with another bank  am I correct,btohqsg
After adding   how do I use the Instarem card? Since I don‚Äôt have the physical card?,btohqsg
You can't add to Google Pay if you have not received the Amaze physical card. You have to think of alternatives if u r travelling soon.,btohqsg
Cannot. It‚Äôs meant to be used physically,btohqsg
I have successfully added to Google pay and used it before the physical card arrived.,btohqsg
Is BigPay app down right now? Can't access it,btohqsg
You can see the card number etc in the Instarem app and add that to Gpay.,btohqsg
FWIW I got the account activated on 22nd April but the app says it will take up to 8th May to deliver my caed,btohqsg
Hi Which is better to accumulate miles when used in Singapore daily - Citi Premiermiles or Citi Prestige ?,btohqsg
of cos prestige 1.3 > 1.2,btohqsg

One its annual fee can be waived n the other annual fee cannot be waived? Will this make a difference to you?,btohqsg
But usually all can be waived unless those 120k cards,btohqsg

That‚Äôs the only card i pay AF for actually,btohqsg
Which benefit you make most out of it?,btohqsg
Priority pass lounge lor and 4NF,btohqsg

Anyone here paid for Marko & Friends classes or a student of him?,btohqsg
Never pay anyone for this kind of thing. You can figure out on your own. No snake oil needed.,btohqsg
