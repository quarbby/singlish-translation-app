the module list is found on the course webpage,btohqsg
btw your modules are a lil different frm mine so HAHAHA prepare for changes,btohqsg
Or the upcoming batch is different from your batch?,btohqsg
I'll start reading up about y1s1 modules first,btohqsg
How do i share contact with admin,btohqsg
Combined bio p4 ans 😭 I just saw it,btohqsg
depends but i think they modify parts of the syllabus every few years  cos my y2 seniors learnt the exact same things im learning now in their first year,btohqsg
HAHAHHSHSH dude dont start too early,btohqsg
you good sia idek what keynesian theory is,btohqsg
ya if u rly wanna start ahead  start in march 2022. i can try source notes for u,btohqsg
Hell yes if u could do that it would be a godsend,btohqsg
u js needa ask when u need them,btohqsg
i can help u with some stuff too provided i rmb well enough,btohqsg
but my this sem stuff legit cannot,btohqsg
the one called 'kickstart a business',btohqsg
There is no need to bust thru the modules,btohqsg
Cuz at the end of the day you will lose the motivation to study and forget everything,btohqsg
I started studying on the day when poly starts,btohqsg
Then just be consistent that's it,btohqsg
its not fully confirmed as they still need to check with further tests,btohqsg
never heard of photoshop before ah,btohqsg
1 ss like that isnt reliable,btohqsg
What do I do if I don’t have a bank account because I’m 15 and my employer needs to give me salary,btohqsg
And my employer say she cannot pay to my mothers account,btohqsg
Cannot cuz nid to give cpf,btohqsg
oh right not freelance work isit,btohqsg
just open bank acc under parent name ba,btohqsg
The gahmen can come for me,btohqsg
is not whether uw or not,btohqsg
and I just want to buy iPhone 11,btohqsg
Not like they take all Ur money away,btohqsg
Is actually quite a lot to me,btohqsg
Its like 20¢ for every $1 u earn,btohqsg
So now I have to create a bank account just to get my salary,btohqsg
And if I don’t the stupid government will come for me?,btohqsg
And what's the rush of buying rn ? When the price of iPhone  depreciating like very fast,btohqsg
If U see my phone rn u be questioning me why I nvr change,btohqsg
U so scared go buy 2nd hand cheaper aso,btohqsg
Dunno how to help u liao,btohqsg
Make a posb joint account with ur parents? U can ask ur parents,btohqsg
Only at age 16 ur able to have ur own bank account under 16 u can create a joint bank account with ur parents,btohqsg
Under urs and ur parent name,btohqsg
Can buy 2nd hand from carou v cheap,btohqsg
can always ask meet-up check quality before paying. if it isn't up to what they advertised as then u can tell them lor,btohqsg
I tell u smth  one mth u earn less than $500 u dunnit contribute cpf,btohqsg
if u rlly that despo then u count careful $501 or less lor,btohqsg
plus u Cnt look at short term.. just bcuz ur iPhone crack doesn't mean u need a new one..cpf is more impt in ur future even though you're 15. having some money in cpf is better than none :),btohqsg
at most if u rlly want then work more lor..,btohqsg
u cn ask one of ur parents to create a account with u.. so it's under both ur name and ur parents one btw :)),btohqsg
You will appreciate it next time,btohqsg
What is there not to trust about when the phone is literally factory reset when sold to you?,btohqsg
The cpf is counted from 500 onwards,btohqsg
if you're earning $501 u dunnit to contribute also,btohqsg
u can use the calculator from the cpf website,btohqsg
only at $502 u need to start contributing,btohqsg
isnt cpf like employer contribute in on top of ur salary?,btohqsg
employer n employee both contribute.. depending on how much you're getting paid,btohqsg
employer has to contribute no matter how much u earn  u only need to contribute after $500(but from cpf calculator it's after $501 onwards),btohqsg
and ofc employer contributes lesser compared to u,btohqsg
do correct me if I'm wrong btw,btohqsg
Step 1: Close eyeStep 2: Close other eyeStep 3: Zzzzzzz,btohqsg
Just imagine your playing with cats while closing your eyes  you'll smile to sleep (:,btohqsg
Why the topic on CPF again,btohqsg
CPF is not your worst enemy....IRAS is next,btohqsg
Last time me and another 'uncle' got chided by admin say what we dun understand poor kids and how cpf is impt for their daily lives etc....In the end is about buying iPhone...,btohqsg
Come@IcedMilohelp our poor girl who still wants her 20% back for iPhone.,btohqsg
There's a reason why that time you got chided,btohqsg
it's a friday  go back to work,btohqsg
but if people wanna bring it up again i dont see why they cant,btohqsg
it's like saying you don't like Macdonalds so other people cannot like Macdonalds lol,btohqsg
Agree. Or repair screen. Save up for now...It will grow to substantial amt in future.When I was getting only $300 + a mth in army  it grew to a substantial amt and then use it for a saving plan say start with 30+ a mth.Or contribute to family expenses,btohqsg
I was also talking about some ppl 15 year old who are forced to work,btohqsg
So ur being forced to work to buy a new phone-?,btohqsg
Those I think the way forward apart from working is to find social help,btohqsg
But some 15 year old are forced to work to support their family,btohqsg
U might think it isn't important now,btohqsg
But you see later you will understand,btohqsg
IM TALKING ABOUT 15 YEAR OLD WHO NEED TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY NOT ME,btohqsg
Do u need that 20% that was sent to cpf?,btohqsg
Some 15 year old need it,btohqsg
I am not a walking google,btohqsg
I think booking appt is faster,btohqsg

You don't need iphone 11 to scroll through instagram  use for whatsapp or listen to spotify,btohqsg
There is no need for fancy specs for the phone,btohqsg
I am currently using xiao mi 10t pro,btohqsg
Specs are like near the newest samsung phone,btohqsg
But i got it for 600 new,btohqsg
Meanwhile there is me using a $200 phone,btohqsg
Cpf is compulsory no matter what ...,btohqsg
I don't really like mainstream phones,btohqsg
If u don't like sg just fk off ig BRUH,btohqsg
CPF is not a bad policy,btohqsg
Of coz u can suggest to them,btohqsg
Cpf is a way for the govt to get money to invest,btohqsg
The government is literally helping you to save money,btohqsg
But if u need to spend it currently  whats the use of savimg,btohqsg
That girl is gonna make a fool of herself,btohqsg
It honestly depends on what situation it is,btohqsg
Then vote the PAP out and change the political party to a party that doesn't support cpf,btohqsg
However cpf is not a bad thing,btohqsg
The problem is not abt cpf,btohqsg
The problem is witj its inflexibility,btohqsg
Ye i have seen some of the policy before,btohqsg
My hand small but got huawei 💀,btohqsg
Abt the latest iPhone  can I ask if its battery life expectancy is btr than android?,btohqsg
I still use xiaomi a1 (worth $90) and second hand samsung note 5 ($100?),btohqsg
Long time nvr had an iPhone alr,btohqsg
Cpf is a topic that could still be too early for some...But generally just be prudent  save and spend within means,btohqsg
Imagine next year ss topic cpf,btohqsg
I mean it's gonna be super easy to do,btohqsg
Next time if anyone is working as freelance or own business  u also need to do yearly top up to medisave too.,btohqsg
Medisave is an acct u wish u have $$ in it yet at the same time you wish you can dun touch it.,btohqsg
Is the camera good? Thinking of finding a used one to replace my outdated A1,btohqsg
Do all part time jobs need individuals to be fully vaccinated..?,btohqsg
Nope. But if I am not wrong need to do regular ART testing,btohqsg
Guys I got qn on vaccine,btohqsg
For sinovac vaccine 3rd vaccine dose can take only after 2nd dose and after 29days right?,btohqsg
Cuz apparently if you don't take by end of this year cannot go mall again.,btohqsg
When my brother call up the clinic  the clinic told him it is only after 90 days after his 2nd  vaccine and government said 29days. Which means he can't go to the mall,btohqsg
So shud he insist on taking the 3rd aft 90 days or ?,btohqsg
Insist ah  show the clinic the govt's advisory? :O,btohqsg
They aren't open till...next week Monday,btohqsg
All my phones are second hand it's fine wan just make sure u don't buy from sketchy places/people,btohqsg
Poco f3 good   450 can get on Carou 8/256 new. 120HZ amoled with snapdragon 870,btohqsg
Saw 350 no box brand new also,btohqsg
Why does she wanna buy iPhone 11,btohqsg
@Neonpotassiumoxideactually the 28 days is applicable to: 1st dose mRNA  2nd dose sinopharm/vac [if first two shots were sinopharm  then is 90days] & some other combinations.,btohqsg
A1 uses google one right instead of miui right ?,btohqsg
Yes and it ‘s bad. Mine lasted few months.,btohqsg
Good camera and Stock Android = Pixel Series,btohqsg
Ya. The Pixel 4A is not bad,btohqsg
Ask her go get that instead.,btohqsg
Idt she would be willing to switch to android so suddenly,btohqsg
I'm the most picky person when it comes to phone.,btohqsg
Or wait for the 6A  huhu,btohqsg
Haha mine lasted for dunno how many years but the buttons are all faulty,btohqsg
@tenersuertewait does that means he can't go eat out aft 31st?,btohqsg

337A doesn’t exist. 377A does. And it should not,btohqsg
A law that doesn’t make sense,btohqsg
Section 377A of the Penal Code states that any male person who  in public or private  commits  aids or enables a male to commit any act of gross indecency with another male could face a two-year jail term.,btohqsg
To repeal or to not repeal,btohqsg
2007  theSingapore Democratic Party(SDP) called for the repeal of Section 377A.[22,btohqsg
interesting....from a topic of hp to this,btohqsg
SDP sounds like a good opposition party,btohqsg
I boomer wan to use FB,btohqsg
I mean yea but they don’t exist in parliament 🤡,btohqsg
Baey yam keng once said if there is a vote to repeal 377A with the party whip lifted he would vote to support it but he says that he thinks the majority of his parliamentary colleagues won’t,btohqsg

Woah even idk we had a sticker pack,btohqsg
Why stickerpack not updated with the ones on the pic,btohqsg
The best sticker pack is obviously my fish stickerpack,btohqsg
Nah it wasnt just saying out to help,btohqsg
Really only got time for one person.,btohqsg
Will look at ur essay and mark and give some comments thats all,btohqsg
Doing cuz why not for the winter break. And i need a break from coding stuff.,btohqsg
Really if u r struggling with GP just hit me up. I can share what is the typical difference between an A/B and a fail essay,btohqsg
Tbh for GP is you ATQ you will get C. Except for some schools that are more demanding,btohqsg
Cuz i used to get C when i was in JC and got A at the end,btohqsg
Uncle think Unsupported User is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Hi guyss anyone know of any jc tuition that costs max $45 per hr?,btohqsg
Group tuition or get those undergrads for 1 to 1,btohqsg
If I go poly  can I wear super childish dress like white blouse white skirt everyday?,btohqsg
tbh no one rly cares abt what u wear hor HAHAHAHHA,btohqsg
most of us lazy to dress up also  unless we gg out aft class or sth,btohqsg
There's no dress code policy like sec right,btohqsg
but as much as poss try to look decent,btohqsg
Yeah  except if you have to go to science laboratory room then need to wear long pants and covered shoes,btohqsg
Can wear anything you want. You can also attend lecture theatre classes in slippers. Just don’t come in swim wear can alr.,btohqsg
Technically can  but not really recommended if you have to go to science laboratory room as it might not be able to cover up your entire legs (even if can cover up your entire legs  what happens if you fall down in the laboratory while you're holding very concentrated chemicals?)Ignore this message if you're planning to take non-science courses,btohqsg
But generally just wear any outfit that makes you comfortable,btohqsg
Not sure what's the hype behind white socks and crocs,btohqsg
I think crocs has *sports mode*,btohqsg
i wore uniqlo grey shirt gray pants everyday for half a year straight,btohqsg
Billionaires also dress the same daily,btohqsg
Oh I seeSo  you have to wear long pants if you're going to science laboratory roomJust now I mentioned what if you fall down  this one I meant like if you accidentally step on your skirt and trip  you might hurt others too  especially if you're carrying very highly concentrated chemicals,btohqsg
So  yeahExcept for going to science laboratory room  nobody will care if you want to wear shirt  shorts and slippers in general,btohqsg
Can look for undergrads though for majority of the cases  I won't recommend. I have taken enough students to see the effectiveness  or lack thereof.You probably will get better quality help in the A level telegram chat group  though it's subjected to time and energy availability of the qualified people that volunteered their time there.Word of advice. Don't forget last two years of A level grads graduated without common last topic tested.,btohqsg
Yo guys can yall reccomend some good assessment books ?,btohqsg
The best assessment books there is,btohqsg

Hii does anyone know any jobs that hire 13 yr olds,btohqsg
But my friend could work at 13 last yr,btohqsg
does anyone know how to convert a pdf file to word,btohqsg
they either converted only a few pages or,btohqsg
only allowed me to convert one doc,btohqsg
I'm not too sure which would work :( sorry,btohqsg
good things dont come for free 🤌🏻,btohqsg
everything in life is technically a scam,btohqsg
This is what u should reply,btohqsg
Forward me one of their messages,btohqsg
I deleted the chat. Photo above provides the evidence,btohqsg
Sadly I can't ban them until I have their contact,btohqsg
https://www.sodapdf.com/pdf-to-word/This is actually quite goodActually  I only used to convert Word to PDF but not the other way round  but you can tryThat time my FYP report maximum size allowed was 10 MB  but my Word document was 32 MB and by using PDF printer  it only managed to get reduced until 22 MBHowever  when I converted it to PDF using this link  it could help me to reduce until 8 MB and the format was not affected,btohqsg
Hope converting PDF to Word does work very well for you,btohqsg
i also got sugar daddy sia,btohqsg
i manage to convert but it aas like 100 pages+++ long then the whole file collapsed,btohqsg
AhSo  that link cannot allow you to convert the file properly?,btohqsg
That $5000 per month sounds tempting but I'm not a fan of cougars,btohqsg
i havent try that link yett,btohqsg
but alot of the links i trued,btohqsg
the ones that worked rlly messed my docs up LOL,btohqsg
Troublesome way is to convert and manually adjust the formatting,btohqsg
issue is i dONT HAVE MICROSOFT WORD,btohqsg
pdf to word is hard because word has more metadata than pdf so you have to add in all the info and it is not very effective,btohqsg
word to pdf is easy because all the data in the word doc is already there for pdf,btohqsg
Hi ppl  is tjc/ acjc/ njc/ ejc/ vjc good? (jae-friendly?) 😬😅,btohqsg
If u scare kena whack here 😬😅,btohqsg

vj has the most random affiliations omg,btohqsg

But there is so unspoken dress code generally,btohqsg
For example if you go mass communication most of them dress quite crazyBusiness school will have a certain vibe also,btohqsg
once i was doing a math paper,btohqsg
i asked my cher for help and he was like,btohqsg
ykw this is too hard lets skip this qn,btohqsg
Thought they all alr the easiest,btohqsg
Well the easier method is gg to the place directly and apply,btohqsg

PES F is not the best thing in the world.,btohqsg
Well u dun have to serve the army for 2 years so.,btohqsg
the qn is in the future will your time in ns acquire skills to acquire an extra 200k after accounting for inflation throughout your lifetime,btohqsg
Some dont even get sufficient free time to acquire skills,btohqsg
then gg it's a huge waste,btohqsg
u give up ur 2 highest earning yesrs,btohqsg
if you think of it that way,btohqsg
Ngl this is not meant to be a race or anything,btohqsg
is like u draw 2 y=x+c graphs but shift 1 2cm to the left,btohqsg
But its still objectively like spending time in ns costs you unless you can make up for it lor,btohqsg
Thats a rly big condition  given how much time u spent in ns,btohqsg

Yes. You need to set up an account with them on site.,btohqsg
Meaning I have to go down physically to the center itself and I can’t do it online ?,btohqsg
I don’t think so you can do it online. Last time I had to head there to open an account.,btohqsg
do private instructors give a checklist of skills you need to learn?,btohqsg
I took mine in BBDC last time and found that it was quite systematic with a checklist.,btohqsg
You can register online  but you need to go down to finish the registration and basic eye test,btohqsg
One of them drew diagrams to show you how to park etc.,btohqsg
I have a NS friend who took 4 lessons under private instructor then went for the driving test,btohqsg
My instructor was good. He accepted PayNow for his lesson.,btohqsg

Got new compulsory simulation lessons also,btohqsg
Getting license is not too hard...Owning a car is...,btohqsg
Er about the ECG pathfinding survey,btohqsg
You have only 1 option. So no need to know what is the option,btohqsg

owning a car isn't hard. Owning and actively using a car comfortably is hard.,btohqsg
