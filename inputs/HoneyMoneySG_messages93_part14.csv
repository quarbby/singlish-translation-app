Hi. I have no experience with booking flight ticket and hotel before. Is it better to book flight directly with the airline? Then lets say i book via scoot website. Then for hotel accomodation  how can i make my booking? Using agoda andtrip.comand etc? But then wont be booking both the flight ticket and hotel from agoda be better? But then i previously read the chat to book directly from airline will be better.,btohqsg
U never book flight or hotel before in your life?,btohqsg
No experience in booking both together,btohqsg
U dont hv to book both together  just do whatever is the cheapest for you,btohqsg
That's the UOB krisflyer card right?,btohqsg
Yeah but i think booking through 3rd party website will be cheaper right? But then i want to find out what will the chances where there are issues with the bookings,btohqsg
It depends  i just do whatever is cheapest and i flew 30+ flights last year  1/2 OTA’s  1/2 direct  no problems either way,btohqsg
I wouldnt worry too much abt it,btohqsg
Does anyone know if can withdraw usd from syfe trade without paying extra fees?,btohqsg
Read the t&c. I believe you must use giro,btohqsg
Like you mention you are dealing with third party. If there’s any issue with the flight like delay or cancellation  you can’t deal with the airline but have to go through the third party. Does the saving outweigh the potential inconvenience?,btohqsg
"Hey everyone i have a question regarding tax IRAS i am not working for a company but i do have a e commerce business do i just leave the ""total employment income shown on IDRS"" alone? Thanks",btohqsg
If I transfer out an amount before 10pm from 360 account  will that affect my mab for the save bonus?,btohqsg
Even on the same day it was deposited? Like 12 pm my salary went in  then 6pm I withdraw out to another bank,btohqsg
But this card got a downside where you need to spend $800 in singaporeair yeah?,btohqsg
Oh ok  coz right now I check it’s 0 as of 29th Feb. But when I open account I did put it > 500,btohqsg
and u took out the $500 same day?,btohqsg
Nope it was inside since the start till now. Only took out my salary same day it was deposited,btohqsg
yes you can. just use the in-app chat to request for transfer back to bank,btohqsg
I'm trying to get 6mpd card and with higher cap  any good recommendation,btohqsg
I was looking at uob priv miles but it's till 30 Apr 2024 for 6mpd for bookings from expedia/agoda,btohqsg
UNI$ for Feb has just been credited. You can check your account now.,btohqsg
Max can get if maintain 100k bal is abt $420 monthly right?,btohqsg
Feb is shorter so interest is less  bonus is 397 plus the base of 3 plus for this leap year,btohqsg
Anyone participated in webull promotion for deposit. It supposed to end by 29-2  But I did not see any bonus Cash apart from daily yield.,btohqsg
Noob question please:Point 3 - maintain min. depositDoes it matter if the closing balance of some days drop below 50k but I can still maintain average daily of 50k for the month?  (Some days will be much higher than 50k to make the average work).,btohqsg
Hi..I opened last month UOB one acct- is there a cut off date of monthly average balance- To be able to get the bonus interest? As I transfer my money slowly and not one time transfer,btohqsg
Interest earned is based on MAB. The earlier you transfer the more you earned. Cut off day is last business day of the month.,btohqsg
my lady card bonus UNI$i sum total 9X and 5X point earned then divide 14 and * 5look amount not same as my statement amount,btohqsg
If you're looking to extend past 65 for term plan  better to look into personal term instead,btohqsg
5x UNI$ = Total amount (round dwn  $59x UNI$ = Total amount (round dwn $5) x (5/9)Any transaction is not in your selected category?,btohqsg
Or do a local transfer with the code SALA for salary payment from DBS? Or it's the same ie will not be accepted to qualify as salary payment unless direct from employer?,btohqsg
seems they simply reply like that,btohqsg
My understanding based on tnc  it matters. They say hold until end of calendar month  not your MAB must be above fresh funds amount.,btohqsg

Thank youIt is fresh fund as my balance with SC is 0 for more than 6 months.  And I am new to Bonus$aver account (had e$aver and Trading account with SC before),btohqsg
I also want to qualify for the 3 Bill PaymentsSo when I do that  the balance may drop before 50k for that day.If I top it up back from another bank by the same day  I can maintain the balance but it will be lower than 50k at some point that day.This is what I am not sure if the TnC explains very well,btohqsg
If you pay with GIRO then the safest way is to put in more than 50k so it doesn't go below the minimum.If you pay on using the bank internet banking then just top-up what you need to pay first.,btohqsg
Read the t&c and you know what is required.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if this card worth it? Isit possible to waive the annual fees every year? It cost around $343 annual fees,btohqsg

Can I ask  is there any exclusion on the type of spends for this card?,btohqsg
Have you tried looking for the exclusions in the TNC?,btohqsg
