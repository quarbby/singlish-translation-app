Can someone answer my qn.  If I take BCME and I have not done pure phy in sec sch  am i still eligible for engineering courses in nus/ntu?,btohqsg
Isn't there like some bridging modules to teach a bit of phy?,btohqsg
This is why PCME is better,btohqsg
No pure bio and pure chem,btohqsg
If u intended to take engineering  why did u not take Phy??,btohqsg
No i am asking for my friend. He took bcme as he wants to study medicine. But he is scared he might not be able to get in so he is thinking of any possible backup plans.,btohqsg
Taking PCME would have allowed him to enter both medicine and engineering,btohqsg
True  but his sec school did not offer triple sci and he really wanted to study bio.,btohqsg
Coz he said he was kinda interested in that as well,btohqsg
Ask him to check the uni websites they do show whats required for each courseE.g.http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/singapore-cambridge-gce-a-level/subject-pre-requisites,btohqsg
Since our establishment in 2017  the SGExams team has continuously striven to support a better student community  and this journey would not have been possible without all of you. With the arrival of 2021  we are thrilled to share that SGExams have been officially registered as the “Society of Student Affairs (Singapore)”  under the Societies Act!What does this mean? We will still be known as SGExams; but now  we can carry out bigger  better projects this new year! In addition  we can recognise hours that are put in by our volunteers  and much more! Sounds exciting? Keep an eye out!Check outour Reddit poston this!Rules and guidelines,btohqsg
