Hello  by any chance are there any Toyota C-HR owners in here?Just wanted to check if anyone knows of a workshop where I can get my daylight running lamps + rear taillights resolved for inspection.Context:Went for inspection previously and failed because:1. DLR of wrong light hue (abit yellow (?))2. LED rear taillights instead of actual reflectors- looking to get them back to stock covers (unless someone knows of another solution)Thankssss!,btohqsg
See if C-HR community got any helpful owners?,btohqsg
DLR: can just switch off? shouldn't be a cause of failure but I don't know lah. Rickshaw rules I know better,btohqsg
Dont know of any C-HR communities hahaha,btohqsg

outta curiousity  anyone here ever bought a car through a in-house loan at a second hand dealer instead of a bank loan   how was it like ?,btohqsg
You wanna take in house loan ah,btohqsg
Nah im just asking cause i want know all these so in future i wont be get scammed into shit when i actually want buy car lol,btohqsg
For starters  read the terms if you're getting an in house loan,btohqsg
And take bank loan if you can,btohqsg
Easiest ways to not get scammed,btohqsg
to me most important is interest rate and early repayment,btohqsg
Normally those interest   is there a max they can go up to or they can just increase to any amount they want,btohqsg
sometimes they dont follow rule of 78,btohqsg
In house loans is upto them usually,btohqsg
Like banks  they also judge your profile,btohqsg
Oh so its never ever fixed   but they will give a rate based of your profile ?,btohqsg
