Guys need be careful of Getz platform order. Today I accepted 1 order $26 but they cancelled it. After 2-3mins they give me the order again under a new llm job ID. But the price become $19. I checked the price info and saw price adjustment by CS -$7. I tell them to cancel they don‚Äôt want to cancel. Super shady Getz and llm,btohqsg
Last time they will put out a job with +$,btohqsg
Then even after u take it,btohqsg
As long as haven't pick up  they will put out the same job again at lower price. If pple bid the job then ur job will n cancelled üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
1 job after a couple of minutes maybe no more high demand surcharge then they will quickly cancel n change,btohqsg
I think GETZ & LLM under the same umbrella.,btohqsg
Getz just another delivery platform that use llm,btohqsg

But the problem is after they cancelled the order I took  I didn‚Äôt accept their new order. They auto assigned to me,btohqsg

Most of them already on holiday Bro. This month and next month is going to be quite quiet.,btohqsg
Not wrong. But if staffs go on holidays  what is there to deliver right? Unless workshops. They‚Äôll still function Monday-Friday at least. üòÖ,btohqsg
This yr 1st yr u do llm? If so u will experience yr end quiet for 1st time,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why your driver ratings also play an important factor such as too many cancellations or too many low ratings. Even if you have the sticker pasted on your vehicle.,btohqsg

All the scammers start aiming on lalamove drivers‚Ä¶ why? Because lala drivers earn more than a decent driver out there.,btohqsg
