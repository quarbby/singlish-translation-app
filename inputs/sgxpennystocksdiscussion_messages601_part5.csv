📮Pika World Markets Insight🎙🤼Split the social spending🥊Biden's administration's social and climate change spending is likely to take shape in a different form. Instead of the large bill  President Biden is expected to break them up into segments to pass through Congress.In his anniversary speech as a President  he shared the progress America has made thus far  climbing out of the pandemic and the work needed in the future. With the lack of monetary support in the future  Pika World will be keenly looking into the prospect of the new format when it reaches Congress for vote.💸China: Finally  the easing is here🪜Investors have been yearning with a long neck for the Chinese central banks to take more proactive action towards stimulating the economy. Finally  they got that on Thursday as the central bank took two bold steps.First  the 1-year loan prime rate is reduced from 3.8% to 3.7%. This is a follow up from a December cut. Then we have the 5-year prime loan rate cut from 4.65% to 4.6%  which is a significant step. It is the first time since April 2020  when Covid-19 impact was at its peak.The rate cut has a massive impact as prime loan rates tend to affect companies' lending rates and household loan packages. Ultimately  it will lower borrowing costs and make mortgages more affordable.⏰Markets turbulent continues⛽️While bond yield stabilize  markets had a massive sell off  evaporating gains in the early session. Pika World favourite Russell 2000 continued to slide. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 is in technical correction and we are expecting more downside risk unless there is greater clarity on the interest rate hike and balance sheet prospect ahead.It is 21 Jan  Friday  7.00 am in Singapore and 7.00 pm in New York. Finally  it is the last trading day of the week.Pika World wishes all friends a splendid weekend rest.,btohqsg
