I mostly order the meditarinian stall,btohqsg
that one good but when i come no more liao,btohqsg
I thought Singapore sentences were bad but,btohqsg
Nah Japan is next level  almost all these punishments are tragically bad,btohqsg
Lack of reporting does that to you,btohqsg
The shinzo Abe shooter has not even seen trial yet,btohqsg
Someone that handmade a shotgun to assassinate a former leader is still awaiting trial to be sentenced 💀,btohqsg
Idk but the Japanese and Korean and Singapore legal system pertaining to sexual and driving crimes are all straight dogshit,btohqsg
I don’t think they’re gonna win the euros tho,btohqsg
I can be as professional as you want ;),btohqsg
Because he was sentenced in japan,btohqsg
Oh yea i read abt it,btohqsg
But amazing that japan is still a relatively safe country despite all these,btohqsg
I got a Glock 17 and 19,btohqsg
I would like to shoot them,btohqsg
Damn reminds me of when i went to Korea and got to shoot the desert eagle at some myeongdong shooting range,btohqsg
Oh i shoot in thailand w a real bullet,btohqsg
I wonder if I can taste the barrel of a gun,btohqsg
And it was really loud and powerful,btohqsg
The gun instantly reflex up after i shoot,btohqsg
But i did not bad tho,btohqsg
Did u at least check which gun u shot?,btohqsg
Actually Japan has a lot of siaolang,btohqsg
Not to mention how the effects will be to your family members,btohqsg
Looks like either a 9mm or 45ACP,btohqsg
Like your parents hor probably will be hentak taki forever,btohqsg
Btw mayushii  u moved to japan or u were born in japan?,btohqsg
Ps i cannot tell fr ur name,btohqsg
Oh if you got kids or siblings,btohqsg
Ngl prob cause of police presence,btohqsg
Then confirmed get bullied in schools,btohqsg
The only thing that they have is the very high conviction rates,btohqsg
Yeah i shot mine with an actual bullet too,btohqsg
Coz they busy dealing with traffic accidents that dun even need them but japan need report police to claim insurance,btohqsg
The dopamine and adrelaine rush when i did it,btohqsg
How can u tell fr the card?,btohqsg
The size of the hole lor,btohqsg
I think 50k won for 10 bullets,btohqsg
iirc it was $46 / 10 shots in Thailand,btohqsg
There are some places that are pretty shady,btohqsg
But my dad lemme try coz i was fr shooting club,btohqsg
Also somehow Yakuza are part of the system as well,btohqsg
I did not expect phuket to be actually an expensive destination,btohqsg
It looks more of a 9mm than 45ACP,btohqsg
Coz i cant remember which i picked💀,btohqsg
45ACP only slightly larger so I included that just in case lor,btohqsg
Hard to tell with just the hole definitively,btohqsg
Actually it was our driver who fetch us to Changi Airport  apparently he has a company in bangkok then told us there is live shooting in thailand,btohqsg
But actually it is a bit dangerous,btohqsg
This is my rifle. There are many like it  but this one is mine.My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.Without me  my rifle is useless. Without my rifle  I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me.,btohqsg
Like what if a murderer goes in and buys 10 shot  point gun and shoot the staff,btohqsg
Definitely  i cant even remember the gun i chose💀💀,btohqsg
No just a nerd like Lestin says,btohqsg
Tbh pistol more fun  i was picked to rifle previously and it got mundane v easily coz i got lazy to wear the suit,btohqsg
Wait till u learn about the history of Firearms,btohqsg
But it is harder to aim w pistol,btohqsg
Ah ic  but u will need to learn japanese before moving right? Or is there assimilation programme,btohqsg
Remember - switching to pistol is always faster than reloading.It is always meant for close range targets,btohqsg
After holding that pistol in Thailand  i feel the sch pistols are masak,btohqsg
I am assuming it is magazine fed like a Glock? Or was it a Revolver style?,btohqsg
I think it could be a glock,btohqsg
But i feel the weight can help u aim better,btohqsg
Just that u need the strength to hold it up in the first place,btohqsg
The lighter it is  the harder to stabilise the gun,btohqsg
Was it boxy and didn't feel like metal?,btohqsg
How are u so informative about guns,btohqsg
History of Firearms is an unrelated tangent I researched on for fun,btohqsg
Hey I can confidentially say that it is related to my full time study major ok,btohqsg
Mom : no stem degree no count,btohqsg
Learnt a bit before I went there,btohqsg
Then in my first company there is some assimilation program in Japan,btohqsg
Did u move w ur whole family?,btohqsg
I think i wun be able to convince my fam to move (other than Australia),btohqsg
Im feeling sick every day in sg for god reasons,btohqsg
What has God gotta do with this,btohqsg
It is no longer confidential if u post it here,btohqsg
Yes i agree auto correct sucks,btohqsg
Especially for ppl like me who likes to type short forms,btohqsg
I type archaic words it fucking changes my text to some nonsense,btohqsg
hi orpheus can you help me with h2 historythe qn is: How important was the Cold War in the rise of authoritarian governments in Southeast Asian states?requirement: come up with 4 arguments + 2 case study per argument.Argument 1: The Cold War was significant in the rise of authoritarian government  as it legitimised use of authoritarian measures by Southeast Asian leaders to maintain internal stability.Case studies: indonesia  thailandArgument 2:  (tbh idk how to phrase this but I think I should bring in Vietnam as Vietnam is the main country that became communist in SEA?)Argument 3: The Cold War had limited significance in the rise of authoritarian government as the communist insurgencies were unable to pose a persistent threat to the government.Case studies: Burma  SGArgument 4:idk what to write for this one 💀,btohqsg
Counter 2: Vietnam war as a example of an intervention of the US for the South and for the idea of Domino theory for it was a bulwark against communism,btohqsg
Counter 4: The bipolarism itself is multifaceted. Use Cambodia either before or after the Khmer Rouge  China Supported Khmer while Vietnam actually invaded em later,btohqsg
"Even if all of them were under the ""Communist umbrella""",btohqsg
Usually is an argument and counter for that argument,btohqsg
Wouldn't use Burma imo just use SG or Malaysia.. even Indonesia is fine too,btohqsg
You mean for argument 3 ?,btohqsg
Yes for the referenced Case Studies for Argument 3,btohqsg
I want to drive to buy lunch but my parents dun trust me in the car alone,btohqsg
My dad be like ‘ask mummy’,btohqsg
But i know my mum surely say no,btohqsg
And also my mum is in a meeting so i cant even go near her,btohqsg
She reads the message but purposely dun reply,btohqsg
Yea but my parents dun treat me like one,btohqsg
Problem is the nearest eatery fr my house is a 10-15min walk and i would rather drive the car there,btohqsg
Like i get a driving license not for no reason,btohqsg
Do you have a brother—I have a friend who has a brother  she herself isn't trusted to drive the car but the brother is. It's a bit of that entrenched Asian family sexism.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to defer ns,btohqsg
I private candidate but my sch cannot give letter since not full time,btohqsg
I believe you can still apply for a deferment as long as youre studying before uni,btohqsg
I think its this  go figure out how yourself,btohqsg
Yes but musician brother is still in JC,btohqsg
TIL apple park was constructed in 3 years,btohqsg
Actually i think guys are generally more trusted than females  my cousins are allowed to drive the car alone as soon as they obtain their license,btohqsg
Less trusted it's more not giving a shit,btohqsg
They are just told to tough it out lor also the reason why they are allowed is more of masculine projections of a dominative phallocentric culture.,btohqsg
Ill wreck the car not on purpose,btohqsg
I'll do you better  I'll wreck it on purpose,btohqsg
Psh you do it on purpose,btohqsg
My skill level allow me to not do it on purpose,btohqsg
Register at a private school  go ITE or any IHLs as a full time student.,btohqsg
Isn't that morally more permissible? As u can argue u didn't meant for it to be wreck,btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/share/p/FRZpWNoZVpcn7af4/?mibextid=qi2OmgTo all Pasir Ris people haha,btohqsg
Did they just post all the staffs namenvm it's just random names apparently,btohqsg
Any IHL except uni unless you are PSC,btohqsg
I don't think an olevel private candidate is qualified or focused on Uni at that moment,btohqsg
Basically enroll in a FT Hnitec course and do the bare minimum,btohqsg
Wait o lvl priv candidate shld be still below enlistment age right?,btohqsg
Or is it op received the ns registration letter,btohqsg
No it is Enlistment age. 16 to register Enlistment can occur anytime after if u don't have a deferment,btohqsg
Can I order a drink with it,btohqsg
Aye carlos sainz might not be jobless,btohqsg
Once registered after that if you aren't in any form of full time study MINDEF will come find u,btohqsg
That's why I did Poly and ITE concurrent because I needed it for the deferment back then,btohqsg
Ur bro sounds like a psycho,btohqsg
Cuz I wanted to poly after Os,btohqsg
I thought this is not a valid excuse to defer  you need to be enrolled in an educational institution,btohqsg
Just register u need the deferment,btohqsg
but they cannot give letter cuz I part time oni,btohqsg
I js waiting for their reply since idt they wan give letter,btohqsg
Yes like take the course at ITE,btohqsg
Then give up on this O level?,btohqsg
I stg yt shoving more and more ads in my face,btohqsg
No it's private candidate u are allowed to do both concurrently,btohqsg
Can I msg you regarding more about it,btohqsg
Even better they have a 5 second clip telling you they are about to play an ad,btohqsg
does it work if say he retake Os this year as priv and then register in an educational institution next year then get the deferment?,btohqsg
or after ns registration  cannot defer liao,btohqsg
not sure if it is possible to request for deferment if private candidate but it will be auto if u enrol in an educational institution,btohqsg
so can he actually like register the NS thing now  and then a year later (hopefully) he gets into poly / jc then from there auto defer liao,btohqsg
then what u mean by can req for deferment up to 3y,btohqsg
coz fr my bro's letter  the ns registration only 1m window,btohqsg
But anyway my problem isIm kinda considering dropping to h1 hist because my sea is dogwaterBut my friends say i should wait until after promos to seeSo i wanna askPpl who dropped from 4h2 to 3h2 1h1 1. When did you drop and whats the latest time to drop a subject2. Why did you drop,btohqsg
oh that is what u mean,btohqsg
then how do private candidate request for deferment,btohqsg
i know if u retain in sch / switch fr jc to poly  it is auto deferment,btohqsg
i take 3h2 1h1 all the way but i can tell u my take on this,btohqsg
how many tests have u gone through and are they full assessments or wa sort of thing,btohqsg
"""This is to certify that musician is still a student of tmjc in the year 2024.....""",btohqsg
i believe if u are still in an institution  they will know,btohqsg
But u need apply deferment ONLINE,btohqsg
if exceed 3 years need sch letter,btohqsg
Takes a while for them to update in their system,btohqsg
The school will send but it will take 3 months for it to reflect.,btohqsg
Being in an educational institution approved by CMPB full time.,btohqsg
so in a sense does it work if say u register for NS registration  then next year enrol in somewhere  then the school update it to mindef,btohqsg
No because you need to attend the medical appointment and other PES evaluations,btohqsg
coz it is also the same situation where say a j1 register for ns in june - july  then after promos then retain??,btohqsg
U can in theory push em back about 6 months but I won't risk it,btohqsg
But in that case u would still be in a CMPB approved educational institution while that happen,btohqsg
Ik I had to do medical check up again,btohqsg
Cause ur pes grade valid for 2 years,btohqsg
No it doesn't u waiting for your Olevel results while DPPing rite,btohqsg
That one is called an Immersion,btohqsg
nah I was waiting for pfp,btohqsg
No like u dpp in while waiting for olevel result/pfp result,btohqsg
somehow one of the express people in my old Sch went to ite with a 14 L1R4,btohqsg
I know of a few too,btohqsg
Usually cuz their L1R4 cmi to the course they want,btohqsg
o level result where got pfp ?,btohqsg
my ite class got like 30 people went to pfp after the “immersion”,btohqsg
Most Nlevel candidates if they smart enough they take a few olevel subjects,btohqsg
yes need 70 marks and above in Sec 3,btohqsg
I think I can qualify as Subject Matter expert for all Poly and ITE dropout and transfer matters liao kns,btohqsg
Ya got damn a lot did that lol,btohqsg
There was someone with 10 that went ite,btohqsg
About 15-20 in my class alone,btohqsg
good thing about ite now is that they are making the courses shorter,btohqsg
Climbing is hard from Nlevels it's legit a wipe ass cert,btohqsg
N Level students taking O Level subjects is just a class here,btohqsg
Olevels u get more ways out,btohqsg
n level you can’t even go to private dip,btohqsg
actually O Level you cannot too,btohqsg
KaplanDIPLOMA IN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT (FINANCE AND BANKING),btohqsg
Academic RequirementsKaplan Foundation Diploma; ORMinimum 1 GCE A-Level pass; OROther private or foreign qualifications will be assessed on a case-by-case basis (based on the equivalence to the GCE A-Level); ORMature candidates (30 years old and above  with a minimum of 8 years of work experience),btohqsg
Their foundational diploma qualifies for entry into their degree programs.,btohqsg
Diploma in Management StudiesEntry RequirementsApplicants must be of age 16 and above and possess ONE of the following entrance requirements:2 GCE 'A' LevelsORMDIS International Foundation Diploma in Science  Technology  Engineering  Mathematics and ArtORMDIS International Foundation Diploma in Management StudiesORInternational applicants must have completed 12 years of formal educationORRelevant Foundation Diplomas from other recognised local/overseas polytechnics or other PEIs (with an entry requirement of 10 years of formal education)ORMature candidates (≥30 years old with 8 years relevant work experience),btohqsg
Then u go search the foundational diploma then u come back,btohqsg
dont need to search I know O Level can go foundation diploma anywhere,btohqsg
So what is the point of your answer,btohqsg
foundational diploma --> diploma --> bachelor,btohqsg
We have alr qualified this by saying depends on private institutions either ways u end up with more toliet paper for your anus,btohqsg
Just this time in more debt,btohqsg
But most people in my school join sec 5 first 😁 before going to pfp,btohqsg
U mean those that are unable to secure a place in PFP on their first attempt join Sec 5. Yes,btohqsg
no those wait for their O level subject results join sec 5 first,btohqsg
then withdraw when they receive they results,btohqsg
That's for those who wanna gamble la,btohqsg
Cedric did the safe play with DPP which is even more common cuz 1 more extra year u guaranteed a spot vs the gamble of Olevels.,btohqsg
Then those that cannot stay in Sec 5 end up results damn cui then end up in ITE again. Eh that one also quite common,btohqsg
Why go ite when can go private international school,btohqsg
Called no marni or parents dw pay,btohqsg
N Level students after receiving results for their O Level subjects in January they withdraw from sec 5 and apply for pfp,btohqsg
Ah boy u need to brush up on your comprehension,btohqsg
U have to qualify by saying IF their results good enough,btohqsg
people get 10 points + English Grade 4 --> Sec 5,btohqsg
Everything is an IF even a conditional offer from EAE,btohqsg
three sec 5 classes become two when pfp students left,btohqsg
Below that ppl can also stay if their PFP choices are dumb and all kena rejected,btohqsg
PFP for Nlevel students now like a fucking lottery liao,btohqsg
English Grade 4 cant go to PFP,btohqsg
Idk choosing all SP and NP for your choices,btohqsg
if they pick all science and their score above 8,btohqsg
science is for the 3-7 pointers,btohqsg
Yeah which is why I also said the 14 pt makes sense from my POV as I was from applied science,btohqsg
I heard new system g3 (exp) can also go pfp,btohqsg
actually got people get 8 points and did not qualify for PFP,btohqsg
I didn’t take any o level subs,btohqsg
thank god I didn’t take Sec 5,btohqsg
Id struggle with English and science,btohqsg
In this case u just waiting for the PFP deadline.. set that way for those who did.,btohqsg
for people who struggle with English only they have no choice but to go Sec 5,btohqsg
Because if they fuck up beyond 19 it's in their EMB3,btohqsg
They don't qualify for Sec 5,btohqsg
i mean struggle with english only,btohqsg
some people English Grade 4 Math Grade 1 Science Grade 1 MT Grade 1 Humanities 1 still go Sec 5,btohqsg
also kinda weird but n level can go to Australian International School,btohqsg
There's always a way out with money its just Nlevels there's lesser ways out even with money,btohqsg
U know it's bad when even the PEIs won't take it,btohqsg
even with money there’s no path,btohqsg
its bad but some teachers will still say go higher nitec or even nitec better than sec 5,btohqsg
Wonder when will Look Back premiere in sg,btohqsg
ITE cert is higher slightly than your O or N level grad,btohqsg
Lanpa even SBS dw u as bus driver,btohqsg
What jobs can one get with a psle cert,btohqsg
Lets assume this person finish psle and never continue with any formal schooling,btohqsg
Well from 12-16 the person technically cannot work yet,btohqsg
Isnt macdonald age 14 can alr,btohqsg
With parental approval and strict limits on working hours,btohqsg
Ik ppl who worked in fnb after IP exams (which idt has the same value as O level),btohqsg
I worked in fnb before my n levels came out,btohqsg
If they complete the first 4 years it's the same value,btohqsg
Why is my mum so easily angry,btohqsg
Ig you just need to be above 16 to work at fnb,btohqsg
She not talking to me coz that day i was like ‘i need to always give in to u’ when she demand to watch her kdrama on the tv i was watching chn 5,btohqsg
I liked telling ppl my highest education is psle to screw w them,btohqsg
That's the MOM requirement for it to actually be a livable income,btohqsg
Understanding why someone becomes easily angry can involve multiple factors  including emotional  psychological  and situational aspects. Here are a few common reasons:1.Stress and Overwhelm:High levels of stress from work  family responsibilities  or personal issues can make someone more prone to anger.2.Mental Health:Conditions like anxiety  depression  or other mental health issues can influence mood and increase irritability.3.Physical Health:Lack of sleep  chronic pain  or other health problems can reduce patience and increase frustration.4.Life Changes:Significant life events such as financial difficulties  relationship issues  or other major changes can contribute to heightened emotions.5.Personality:Some individuals have a naturally shorter temper or less tolerance for frustration due to their personality.6.Communication Style:Difficulty expressing feelings and needs effectively can lead to anger as a way to release pent-up emotions.7.Past Experiences:Past traumas or unresolved conflicts can affect current emotional responses.If you're concerned about your mum's anger  it might help to gently communicate your observations and encourage her to talk about what might be bothering her. If the issue is significant  suggesting professional help like therapy could be beneficial.,btohqsg
U think that's funny I like to tell ppl I am an ITE dropout to those I hate when they ask my educational Background,btohqsg
I hate ppl like my aunt who use my mum’s mental health as an excuse for her being angry and shit to me,btohqsg
Like if she hears what she dw to hear  she just shuts us off for a good 1 week to 1 month,btohqsg
Ok I fulfil my promise to musicianOn behalf of your mother I sayI am sorry Musician.,btohqsg
She told me ‘i never admit wrong coz im always right’,btohqsg
But i realised it is btr to just give in to her coz afterall i need her more than she needs me,btohqsg
She can function if i shut her off but not true the other way,btohqsg
That is also what my dad told me n my bro,btohqsg
Why isit that every sentence u type I get more depressed,btohqsg
Please dun be depressed w my family issues,btohqsg
Still can u add a few jokes,btohqsg
Minh what u think u are doing,btohqsg
See that's a more fun experience,btohqsg
It is so like a gpt response,btohqsg
U can just self depreciate yourself or me,btohqsg
Idk cause last year dec a govt worker called my mom and ask her why we filled in my highest education level as PSLE on the govt form,btohqsg
My mum scolded a govt worker for a different reason and the person replied ‘why are u being so difficult’,btohqsg
Bruh don't ask the poor executive why the Director makes those decisions,btohqsg
But it is not under the statistics act right? Dun these surveys require participation consent?,btohqsg
How can u be forced to do a survey,btohqsg
If they could they would have mandated it,btohqsg
Neh it was just a letter that came first  my mum just did not bother abt it,btohqsg
My mum said she dk where she put the letter,btohqsg
Ya that person said it is under the statistics act that she needs to fill that up,btohqsg
That is why she got pissed,btohqsg
Don't worry u will experience it soon,btohqsg
When the GES letter comes in,btohqsg
Someone called us and told us we had to fill a govt form in so we did,btohqsg
Then like a few days later my mom got the call,btohqsg
Then how did ur mum respond,btohqsg
Cause the thing is i put my  highest education level as psleThen the person tell my mother that we put wrongly and  it should be o level  already so she call to checkSo my mother got angry,btohqsg
Bro is my mom not me,btohqsg
I dont decide how my mom reacts,btohqsg
That's not the most intrusive imo I had once I went to see a specialist and he said oh I just have a survey to send to you via SMS for my study,btohqsg
I dumb and said yes to be polite,btohqsg
Lanpa the survey is 126 pages with detailed questions I do like 10 questions my eyes pain liao so I quit the fucking thing ping me non stop via sms for 2 months,btohqsg
"Then my mother scolded her and went to tell her friend ""why the person working in govt also dont know""",btohqsg
By right they should have put Olevel or Equivalent,btohqsg
"I dont think there was an ""equivalent"" though",btohqsg
I mean a side tangent but this is why knowing how to properly frame and construct a survey for study is an important skill,btohqsg
And something just STEM alone will not teach u,btohqsg
I just realise my father has no o level cert but has a a level cert,btohqsg
yea we learnt this in y2,btohqsg
like we had this entire lesson of how to make proper survey qns,btohqsg
ITE students go there fk arnd not to study,btohqsg
engineering I heard is mostly the “typical” ite students,btohqsg
Not for Applied and Health Sciences,btohqsg
Green school is just accoustic and regarded,btohqsg
the people there are okay i guess,btohqsg
I see you went to CC,btohqsg
yup it’s only 30+ mins from my house,btohqsg
The classic experience is going outside and finding the rokok corner of the ITE u are visiting,btohqsg
Haha there are entire mods and disciplines just studying on how to properly do that.,btohqsg
He lower the brightness level when taking the shot lor,btohqsg
If i dun feel like im suited for corporate but there is no other choice for me,btohqsg
Should i just go for it,btohqsg
And try to secure a job,btohqsg
No u Pivot and find a more suitable position,btohqsg
Actually this is not in my consideration atm coz of my nus trauma,btohqsg
And also research is not my thing,btohqsg
Speaking of which my dad did acknowledge my social anxiety issue,btohqsg
At least that is one half,btohqsg
Social anxiety can be slowly trained away,btohqsg
Sometimes u answer your own question and it's gawd damn hilarious,btohqsg
I think you are emulating her to some degree like it or not unintentionally,btohqsg
Musician u know someone is reading what u write rite? Well maybe a small number but I am lmao,btohqsg
If you would prefer confidentiality u can pm me and I will read it but reciprocate it I get to make fun of what u say,btohqsg
Is like u are typing and documenting your thinking process fully unfiltered... in a public chat,btohqsg
isn’t that like those telegram announcement channels,btohqsg
Yes which is why it's fucking hilarious don't ruin the fun it might have just dawned on her,btohqsg
U can just create a Google keep or notes folder and just type it out,btohqsg
<FBMxSGExams>Four Blind Mice has created a portfolio guide for everyone who needs a little bit of help to create or jazz up their own portfolio. A portfolio will showcase you in the best light possible to prospective schools and employers  and give you control over how they see all the achievements you’ve earned!Link hereto read. 🖇️,btohqsg
Blud's chats are places to rant,btohqsg
tbh it is btr than letting u fly in a faulty plane,btohqsg
Huh what job you planning to do?,btohqsg
right now im just looking for opportunities,btohqsg
Like corporate is pretty a wide range of jobs though,btohqsg
yea...previously i was trying to avoid it coz i think im not suited there,btohqsg
but now i think i dun really hv any choice,btohqsg
Huh how come you think you are not suited there?,btohqsg
Well got to be honest with you,btohqsg
The job market isn't that good now,btohqsg
more of my personality  i feel i wun be able to thrive in corporate especially with corporate politics as well,btohqsg
I feel that everywhere has its own politics one way or another,btohqsg
The thing is whether you want to be actively involved in it or not,btohqsg
Some people love to be toxic because of personality,btohqsg
yea indeed...so i am prepared if i hv to diverge from my degree tbh,btohqsg
Others are like want to get promoted,btohqsg
But you don't really have to do all these if you don't want to,btohqsg
yea i feel i will lose out in such situations coz i dun hv balls,btohqsg
Then again  I feel that no matter which place you go to in the workplace,btohqsg
You need to really learn how to safeguard your own personal interest,btohqsg

There's no need for you to be toxic. But at the very least you need to learn to protect yourself,btohqsg
Either way no harm trying to apply for a corporate job and go for the interview,btohqsg
You can always see it as a chance to find out more about the department,btohqsg

we left early to avoid jam,btohqsg
Oh:-(Maybe more and more people are doing this trick,btohqsg

So it resulted in jamming instead,btohqsg
The ultimate strategy is just flying,btohqsg
But im surprised tho  that time i went in dec which is a more peak travel period,btohqsg

Why yall have exclusive relationships? I have an open relationship with History and I am having a fling with Philosophy,btohqsg
But philosophy will make you self doubt sometimes,btohqsg
I think philosophy is gaslighting you,btohqsg
That's why it's a fling for now... philo is gaslighting me to make it official as a second major or even an equal,btohqsg
Meanwhile I am having a fling with math,btohqsg
Sadly it doesnt want me to be a second major,btohqsg
Is the relationship a good one?,btohqsg
Why love something that doesn't love you back,btohqsg
See that's the issue with the STEM field,btohqsg
Cus like math said I am too explosive with Physics,btohqsg
History just keeps saying that whenever I do History it feels like I have philosophy in my mind,btohqsg
That's one of Philosophys many split personalities I have only seen 2 for now and have yet to see the chinese side,btohqsg

I'll check the URECA list but based on past list most likely the situating of knowledge in Traditional Chinese Medical Texts focusing primarily on either the teachings of Laozi or Simiao,btohqsg
how is FYP for your course usually structured,btohqsg
As long as you got Y4 standing they will auto assign for you based on a list of projects,btohqsg
But I trying to get a FYP-URECA project if possible so I can start in Y2,btohqsg
Also why I tryna transfer course if possible to a double major cuz rn I basically need to have a history prof as my FYP supervisor whereas double major just need 1 prof from either faculty,btohqsg
wait but i dun get how u have already y4 standing at y2,btohqsg
so udw to a history related fyp,btohqsg
i wish i can turn back the clock,btohqsg
I just dw to be confined to just the history department cuz our humanities in NTU is legit a damn small faculty,btohqsg
So the projects is also limited as there is lesser Profs,btohqsg
I can call you di di if you want musician or Gege,btohqsg
