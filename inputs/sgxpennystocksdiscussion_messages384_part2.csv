i thinking of putting a pile of company cash into AEM. thoughts?,btohqsg
If you talking about inheritance  by the time you inherit the flat maybe only got 30  40 years left on lease  assuming you BBFA don't move out. Sell lease back to HDB also not much money  dont think can offset 2rm BTO. So need draw on CPF and savings.,btohqsg
By then if starting family  4rm BTO 400k-500k I also not surprised.,btohqsg
thats current price whats there so surprise lol,btohqsg
Okay idk. So add 100k for 10 years down the road lor,btohqsg
Plus if keep build BTO eventually run out of space. So buy resale lor. Even more ex,btohqsg

I quote Prof Tay Kheng Soon.. I watched his webcast the other day...... If most of your money tied up to HDB  how you even have spare $$ to embark on other ventures. That's why SG economy stagnating. The young dare not take risks. In SG its the old that ate the revolutionaries (because they alr have everything they need and also the $$) and the younger ones the conservatives.,btohqsg
U see everyday got so many go casino... U know their wealth liao.. Somemore they nv work de,btohqsg
