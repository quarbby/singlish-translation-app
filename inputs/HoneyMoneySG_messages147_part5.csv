If you don't intend to fully pay off your credit card bill when it is due  going for personal loan should be cheaper. Credit cards charge like 24%pa... Pls don't use that as a loan.But it's useful to hold credit cards as banks will offer from time to time balance transfer promo which can be as low as 2.x% for up to 6 months  or usually 5+% for up to 12mths. Hopefully you have the intention to repay all outstanding amt withing these time frames and if so  you can consider balance transfer.,btohqsg
Which means there is a monthly cap limit? Or in a month I can spend 15K with the credit card?,btohqsg
Did you see the rates UOB gave when you withdraw? Yesterday evening I used Trust card  the rate was 3.2759.,btohqsg
Nope. It doesn't show on the screen. But it's the best rates compared to all the money changers in city sq.,btohqsg
It'll show on your app  how much SGD was withdrawn. Then just calculate.,btohqsg
Like the best money changer rate was 3.271 nearest to the uob bank. And uob atm gave 3.275.. I tried using other banks.,btohqsg
And it shows the amount of fees that will be charged. One of the atm  displayed a fee of 15rm,btohqsg
It means that if you are staying with the parent you want to claim relief on  it's 9k tax relief. If not staying together then it's 5.5k. As long as living together means 9k lor,btohqsg
Musthit min spend or the category will earn 0% cashback.,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
You can try to do a top-up and see what are the options available. Most likely is PayNow only. But mandatory medisave payable can use GIRO.,btohqsg
For your case  as you are new to credit cards (so unlikely to have good credit score)  the banks may not give you the full 4 times of monthly income credit limit (assuming your annual income is above 30k). It's likely that you'll get between 2 to 2.5 times of monthly income instead  and if it's lower than the total cost of your appliances  you might need to either pay off early (so no HSBC EGA cashback) or get a second human to pay the rest (same rules above apply if the human is new to credit cards also).Do remember to pay off your credit card inFULLwhen the bill comes. If you can't do it  then you're better off splitting to smaller purchases over the year  or split the purchases with 0% instalment plans (which negates any rewards as they are typically excluded).Sign up for a card that has (1) sign up promo rewards (remember to check t&cs) and (2) able to reward you with the high spending (calculate between the choice of cards on the amount they'll reward you  e.g. unlimited vs capped).Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Thank you Melvyn. Yeah could only find PayNow option. And giro for RA. Not sure about Pay as you earn but seems to be for MA only,btohqsg
Not Financial/Lifestyle Advice:Neither. Buy a pre-owned minibar fridge  a microwave oven and an oven toaster for <$200 to get by initially.If you have the capacity to pay monthly installments for that credit card/loan  you have the capacity to save up monthly to pay in full for each appliance as you hit each saving milestone.,btohqsg
hi guys  may i ask how do yall decide which category to use for UOB lady? what's your strategy?the new quarter is coming  i'll be traveling in end jan (will be a tour so food is pretty much covered  i think it's more of retail shopping if ever. not sure what ill be buying too). i'll be utilising CRMC + Amaze  UOB lady and trust cashback. these are the only cards that are applicable (i do have UOBKF but its base 1.2mpd). also  understand that theres the FCY of 3.25%if applying new cards  it's best to not have the minimum spend as i pretty much spend less than 500 on cards each month 😅,btohqsg
I use lady card for travel cos crmc doesn’t cover for travel. Going for rewards like miles,btohqsg
To  be more precise  CRMC does not cover airline/hotel/car rental/transport/Tour agency. It covers shopping and other expenses during travel.,btohqsg
Why do you need to see on the screen when the Visa website will tell you even before you put the card into the ATM Machine?,btohqsg
You realised the numbers are different right (see OP's rates below)? There are still slight difference when you withdraw the money from the bank itself.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/256886,btohqsg
The exchange rate will be around there-about. It is more to give you a sensing of the rate Visa is giving. The other work-around is to do a balance enquiry before withdrawal (then divide by the SGD you have in the account) to derive the exchange rate.,btohqsg
I think we all know that. We are just comparing data points. I don't get what's the fuss about. OP is asking about withdrawing with Trust card as he used his UOB card to withdraw  without fees but slightly lower rate.,btohqsg
Hi besides amaze link to citi bank  what other card can earn miles from atome?,btohqsg
Amaze or atome? You just pulled out 2 different services in your message.,btohqsg
I am currently linking amaze to atome that triggers my Citi card. But realised that my Amaze will hit max cap 1k before it refresh. Saw mile lion say DBS WWMC can,btohqsg
Why not Atome directly? It's already online. EDIT: Seems like sometimes Atome do not get recognised by CRMC as online.Cards that rewards miles for online spend or Atome's MCC 5999.,btohqsg
Can check that means DBS wwmc can right?,btohqsg
Hi folks - new Moomoo user here. Upon fulfilment of the mechanics  would you know when the rewards would appear in the activity page? Is it instant or do i have to wait after the campaign period or after the funds holding period? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
If it does not exclude Atome's MCC,btohqsg

Ocbc 360 has been holding on its interest for dear life.,btohqsg
Yeah can see the threads being snipped bit by bit now,btohqsg
If I book hotel in Malaysia via AgodaShould I pay in local or FCY?,btohqsg
For salary credit and savings only  ocbc 360 has the highest interest right? As of now…,btohqsg
which card do you use to pay?,btohqsg
as far as i know  yes,btohqsg
ok 8% seems not bad. you would get around 4ish% net benefits.,btohqsg
Ok but for future reference... Is paying in local currency or FCY better? Sorry this topic is super confusing even after I read through,btohqsg
depends on what rewards you are getting  i.e. card dependent,btohqsg
fcy spend will incur 3.25% plus card processor fee. SGD spend on agoda may incur 1% DCC fee. the compare the rewards earn and see which one is more worth.,btohqsg

Hi  need some help. I recently applied Maybank platinum Visa card and I am paying insurance with AIA monthly $400. Tried to check if I can pay insurance with Maybank platinum Visa card. It seems AIA doesn’t accept Visa card from second year onwards. Is it true ? Can anybody help to shed some light on this? Thx,btohqsg
Use CardUp for subsequent premiums for AIA insurance policies.,btohqsg
