Wait a while  when you do H2 Maths and FMaths paper you will see the difference,btohqsg
Im asking my teachers fot h2 maths mye papers j1 but they say they cant give,btohqsg
Like past years or other sch,btohqsg
Usually you ask teachers for extra they’ll be happy to give,btohqsg
Ill ask them again when sch reopens then,btohqsg
If you do your homework  you won’t have any more homework,btohqsg
Oh shit man youve changed my life,btohqsg
Oh do you do math with or without music,btohqsg
But that’s cause my music has lyrics,btohqsg
And is one better than tge other or is it preference,btohqsg
I don’t like lyrics interfering with my thought process,btohqsg
If u do maths without thinking that’s just rote memory,btohqsg
Its like for me music only helps if ive seen the qns before,btohqsg
Yeah that’s cause you’re invoking your muscle memory,btohqsg
Feels like  e maths in sec sch,btohqsg
Where you just let youe mind wander,btohqsg
I remember when I was mindlessly expanding binomials,btohqsg
Yeah i find that a maths the ttpes of qns are often the same,btohqsg
Is that ttue for h2 and fm?,btohqsg
Oh sorry for the typos theres water in between my sceeen and protector,btohqsg
But you need to think a bit about the question to figure out how this question is similar to x question from tys,btohqsg
Polar coordinates seems like its just sketch so far,btohqsg
Just a bit  not that much,btohqsg
You need to think a bit more,btohqsg
But indeed they can be much more creative with FMaths,btohqsg
But its nothing that practice cant solve right,btohqsg
To be clear  it’s not just practice,btohqsg
I was worried when i took f maths cause they said 2019 a levels they had 1 A out of 7 students,btohqsg
You also need to reflect on every question you do,btohqsg
Why did this trick work? Why did this other approach not work?,btohqsg
Under what conditions should I think about applying this concept?,btohqsg
In f maths is there often only 1 correct method,btohqsg
I’d say it depends on the question  but largely yes,btohqsg
Learning maths is just picking up all the tricks you meet along the way and learning how to use them,btohqsg
So if there’s a question u dunno  find out how to do  and make sure you never get something like it wrong again,btohqsg
but fmath help lighten ur workload,btohqsg
Oh this is somewhat important  to what extent can you skip working,btohqsg
Applies to olympiad too if u want to go for those,btohqsg
Can tou skip the 'filler' workinhs and onlt write the important things,btohqsg
This is really something you get as you become comfortable with the work,btohqsg
You don’t exactly know what’s considered filler or not so maybe better to write all down,btohqsg
But if you are experienced enough  then I think just writing down the key steps is enough,btohqsg
Does f maths benefit you in uni in anyway,btohqsg
but if u want to major in math or engineering,btohqsg
it helps build a stronger foundation,btohqsg
If you do FMaths  you have half your level 1 maths modules done already,btohqsg
Either double deg with maths ot business oe minor in one of those,btohqsg
the other half is just the proofs,btohqsg
People wracking brain over linear algebra you just chill in a corner,btohqsg
no unless u pass aptitude test,btohqsg
