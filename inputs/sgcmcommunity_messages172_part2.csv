If u are slow let other faster drivers go,btohqsg
Some drivers believe at 90kph they are not road hogging lane 1,btohqsg
These ppl deserve the high beam,btohqsg
I was on cte at 2am and a taxi was on the first lane doing 90,btohqsg
I can be driving at 120kph on lane 1 and another car comes behind me at 150kph. I will still be road hogging,btohqsg
I flash him he still dare to on his rear fog lights,btohqsg
So moral of the story: go and install those HID lights and make sure u beam those road hoggers at lane 1! Hahaha...just joking,btohqsg
Yes. Must make sure they know got ppl behind them,btohqsg
They can try this on the north south highway and see what happens when a msia car tailgates u for road hogging,btohqsg
I smell more money for me ah hehehe,btohqsg
“Oops sorry got car jam brake infront of me so I no choice oso have to brake”,btohqsg
Sometimes those lane 4 or 5 are of much better cleared lanes,btohqsg
Problem is not with how fast or slow u are occupying lane 1. Is whether u giveway to cars coming from behind at a higher speed,btohqsg
Cause some car better at faster speeds. Usually faster lanes smoother less speed changing which consumes more petrol to keep let go gas and step again,btohqsg
Many drivers are too self entitled to think this way,btohqsg
I will sometimes cruise on lane 1 at speed limit but when i see another car behind almost tailgating. I will filter left to allow him to pass,btohqsg
If want to overtake so much ....then use road shoulder .....hahahahaha,btohqsg
Many assume that since it is not breaking any traffic rules. They continue to hog lane 1 at 90kph,btohqsg
In e eyes of law  no wrong. But its damn wrong in the eyes of a human being,btohqsg
Cannot la unless u ambulance or TP. Lane 1 is supposedly overtaking lane,btohqsg
Ya la legally no wrong that is why many still hog mah,btohqsg
Thta y i dont bother signal right,btohqsg
Why bother to beam  signal n tail,btohqsg
Same as when come to merging lanes,btohqsg
Sometimes dont even need to wait till behind,btohqsg
Aiyoh dont anyhow teach wrong thing leh,btohqsg
Frm far U aga aga knw tht lane 1 fella is slow,btohqsg
Undertaking by right cannot but by left no choice at times,btohqsg
But it's the fact....u still want to tailgate at lane 1 mehh??????,btohqsg
So frm far just go lane 2 3 or even 4 to overtake lor,btohqsg
I wont. But many do as can be seen in multiple online videos,btohqsg
No one say u cannot drive 90 on lane 2 3 4,btohqsg
U drive 90 on lane 4 u cry,btohqsg
Cos lane 4 most only max 50,btohqsg
U knw on CTE lane 4 is the fastest lane during peak hour?,btohqsg
I mean those cars traveling on lane 4 going v slow la,btohqsg
That's why I said earlier....sometimes lane 4 or 5 us much of better clearance ...hahaha,btohqsg
Lane 4 on CTE towrds town after the PIE exit is the fastest,btohqsg
U can easily gain 400-800m ahead of Lane 1 n 2,btohqsg
Haha ya fast until u reach balestier,btohqsg
By then u alrdy miles ahead of cars in Lane 1,btohqsg
By then u shld cut into lane 2 n 3 alrdy,btohqsg
I remembered i saw one fella emailed lta or what,btohqsg
U want many many Mike's ahead  u use road shoulder....hahaha,btohqsg
Go lane 1 on peak is suicide,btohqsg
Ya la LTA say not breaking traffic rules even if u going 90kph on lane 1. Unless u going 60 and below,btohqsg
Ya and high chance of chain collision also,btohqsg
Cannot imagine 60km and below...wah piang!,btohqsg
Entire PIE n CTE is 80 n 90,btohqsg
Thats why its called road hogging mah,btohqsg
