don't project your own inability onto the world,btohqsg
I'm not surprised if you have not realised it by now  because too many people mistake opportunities to improve as chores or added work.,btohqsg
maybe that's just the ppl around you?,btohqsg
But yeah she in office tdy,btohqsg
the world is bigger than yourself or the ppl around you and the school you're in,btohqsg
So you are saying I got a unlucky spawn,btohqsg
"no don't use ""luck"" as an excuse",btohqsg
you're saying no sane person would miss out on opportunities,btohqsg
but if you're not even open to the opinions of others and open to improving yourself and listening to others,btohqsg
how are you even supposed to see these opportunities,btohqsg
Who says I'm not  where did that assumption come from,btohqsg
how come my buddy in hall  whom parents never got more than PSLE  and are living in a rented 2 room flat  is still able to get to university and do well,btohqsg

"stop giving us excuses like you're ""unlucky""",btohqsg

werent you complaining about RP denying you of opportunity yet your grades are plastered with Cs,btohqsg
"You honestly think I actually think it's cause I'm ""unlucky""  no way I will ever think that.I own my mistakes and have made efforts to correct it. You don't see me repeating questions and it's always a new form of questions everytime. Can't I be inquisitive  is there a problem?",btohqsg
ppl complaining that life is unfair,btohqsg

ya life is unfair  life can be unfair,btohqsg
Yea I know I said it become you can't tell it's not meant to be taken seriously,btohqsg
but if you wallow your fucking life away,btohqsg
"your life will always be ""unfair"" and ""unlucky""",btohqsg
Idk why whenever I bring a point across people keep thinking I have a fixed mind and won't ever change  it baffles me. Maybe is just how I phrase the questions,btohqsg
okay then tell us seriously  what are you doing to improve your life and your outlook in life,btohqsg
i dont think talking on sge telegram is a way to pick up skills,btohqsg
bluffed into quads  jammed qq into kk  raised top top into a set etc,btohqsg
I love how we turned this into a personal attack on Ryan,btohqsg
start 5 wars lose all of them,btohqsg
i understand nothing but just pretend i said something related,btohqsg
because I don't intend to want to flame u or anything but I'm genuinely curious that you say you're open  you say all these big things  but what have you done for yourself to help yourself to get out of the situation you deem yourself to be in,btohqsg
if you don't want to share in a group of 2585 members,btohqsg

"but whatever we've been saying is not based on ""assumptions""  but inferences from what you've said",btohqsg
