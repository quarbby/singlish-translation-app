Guys  wanna check besides EBC redstuff  any similar affordable ceramic brake pads you guys using?,btohqsg
Sian of stock.. Worn out time to change,btohqsg
this kind of mod is the type that you can do without.,btohqsg
The only reason I see myself going with ceramic pads is lesser brake dust,btohqsg
For a daily driver that is,btohqsg
Pete will tell you don't even need brakes,btohqsg
Pete will tell you to go Bluetooth brakes and wifi wheels,btohqsg
You’ll wear your rotors faster  is that worth it? Haha,btohqsg
Lol.. So no need atas ceramic,btohqsg
You also won’t heat up your brakes,btohqsg
You bored of stock  have extra cash  go change CC BBK,btohqsg

Unless your callipers and rotors upgraded,btohqsg
Cool guys! Thanks for the tips! Very useful,btohqsg
Also  TIL Yellowstuff is no longer suitable for track use unless you bed it like a maniac,btohqsg
I notice some cars mileage states as NA. Why is that?,btohqsg
Cus mileage too high. Turns potential buyers off,btohqsg
Honestly I hate it cus need to PM dealer just to see mileage,btohqsg
Some dealers don’t want to be liable for fake mileage  so that’s a red flag  must inspect the car carefully,btohqsg

last year government raise the petrol duties by 15 cents  petrol company raised their prices by a substantial amount.How much increase do you all think will happen to petrol prices after 8% gst?,btohqsg
Tat y spc also not giving 23 percent discount for new year 😅,btohqsg
It’s not just about duties  it’s about the supply of oil that is available too..,btohqsg
opec is holding off production i believe,btohqsg
Blame OPEC  not the petrol cos or government.,btohqsg
With the energy crisis  OPEC has a great opportunity to make more money 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Politics involved lah. They cutting down production of diesel,btohqsg
Thats why diesel suddenly same price as 95,btohqsg
SPC: Merry Christmas & Happy New Year! Enjoy 23% off fuel plus bank card rebates at all SPC stations from 23 to 26 Dec '22. T&Cs apply. UN 'SPC' to82410111,btohqsg

Very hard to get. I've tried contacting them a few times to get vouchers to giveaway to the members here but they ghost me - J,btohqsg
They LIKE SHELL. FIRST TO UP LAST TO DOWN,btohqsg
All thanks to Biden administration who drummed up war on Ukraine  knowing that Russia will definitely strike when Ukraine applied for NATO membership which it’s against treaty that were signed decades ago.U.S is selling expensive oil and gas to Europe due to Russia cutting of oil supply to Europe. Of course who was behind Nord Stream pipeline sabotage is still unknown. OPEC is not cooperating with USA request because of Biden.Politics always at play and because politicians in the States wanna make America Great Again  at the expense of the World. That is why  we are all suffering from higher price hike and inflation. Maybe amongst us  economic analysts can fill us in as well. 2023 will be an expensive year ahead. Godspeed everyone 🙏,btohqsg
Shell will always give vouchers one though,btohqsg
I never say they dun give vouchers 👀,btohqsg

Nothing much to it  you just spend about 3 times as much on repairs if you're lucky,btohqsg
Its perpetually every month im entering,btohqsg
If unlucky you spend more time in workshop than VW,btohqsg
My prev owner was a lady,btohqsg
At least your problems can anticipate with the WRX. Engine piang only,btohqsg
But all the beamer owners I know never complain before,btohqsg

Nobody brags about the money they spend repairing,btohqsg
i am proud to say that this year subie shitbox hasn’t been to ws yet hehe,btohqsg
The only time I hear people complain about bmw is in this group leh,btohqsg
As in if never spend any money to repair then good la,btohqsg
My 116d I sold it after warranty ended  the 1year+ I owned it I send to PML 3 times to repair,btohqsg

Sensors and door seals and some other random stuff,btohqsg

Exactly why I sold it after warranty finish.,btohqsg
It’s good leh. What’s wrong with it?,btohqsg

You bring back agent do right?,btohqsg
Hanor!!!! WAIT! Are you only in this one group!!????,btohqsg
Eh those workshops who know what they’re doing won’t be like that lah!,btohqsg
Coz more basic. BASIC IS GOOD!!!,btohqsg
The worst thing to do is to buy a car and then zeng it and drive it like something it is not. Then after that complain why things break 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
I need to find more different groups,btohqsg
Bruh  all Beemers i know just told me: save up on maintenance lmao,btohqsg
Shouldn’t you always keep some cash aside for maintenance,btohqsg
Don’t want Nasi Padang. Too obvious,btohqsg

Because you're getting way more car as well,btohqsg
it’s possible ur f20 just wasn’t well maintained before hand gahaha,btohqsg
i know someone w a maserati who only goes in once a year for svc,btohqsg
really all abt prev maint and stuff,btohqsg
Because they don't do repairs? More of preventative maintenance which most contis require as they're more complex,btohqsg
Not just contis  higher displacement/higher power japs and Koreans too,btohqsg
Yah thats why I damn triggered w posts that says WELL MAINTAINED BY EX LADY OWNER,btohqsg
This one is really rare Pokemon,btohqsg
Or maintaining car properly is important,btohqsg
As rare as a stock rocco?,btohqsg
Not like Mr X  never change gearbox fluids because why not,btohqsg
Bro this one if u can find  means ur luck damn good. Better than striking 4d,btohqsg
Stock Rocco can find now  virgin Rocco cannot,btohqsg
Yah stock. Finding an 08 pipe on a 09 car LMAO,btohqsg
Idk if virgin or not ah,btohqsg
But it's scrapped parts from here and there that they put back before putting on sale,btohqsg
But driver started the car moved off without any sound,btohqsg
The sound of the driver closing the door was the loudest sound coming from that car,btohqsg
A lot of urban legends one leh I feel,btohqsg
JUST TODAY I SAW A RED ROCCO BEING PULLED TO THE SIDE OF HIGHWAY BY LTA OFFICER AND TALKING AT THE BACK OF THE CAR 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹,btohqsg

Tesla owners blast Christmas car charging chaos with dozens of electric vehicles forced to wait in THREE HOUR queues at charge stations across the UKhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11579649/Tesla-owners-blast-Christmas-car-charging-chaos-dozens-forced-wait-THREE-HOUR-queues.html,btohqsg
Funny how the other day everyone was queueing for fuel cause of a shortage..,btohqsg
1st tip. It’s bimmer haha but who cares  bmw sounds better,btohqsg
how much shld i expect to spend yearly on maintenance for a conti car like merc or bmw? looking for a basic car to drive but at the same time got some want to try out smth else other than jap cars,btohqsg
If you choose the right one,btohqsg
You’ll be spending less than a honda 🤭,btohqsg
either> one month of $3.50 chicken rice everyday> one month of 98 petrol everyday,btohqsg
Sometimes it’s better to trust a car sold by an enthusiast cos he/she probably take better care of the car than the normal people.,btohqsg
If u are looking at coe cars  I think merc will be a safer bet,btohqsg
@arnavgulianimight be able to help better,btohqsg
Does this rare Pokémon frequent Simpang Bedok? Cos I’ve seen one there,btohqsg
ohhh the one i knw is a white GT,btohqsg
Some people tell me the in-line 6 is apparently such a creamy sounding engine. Don’t know if true or not,btohqsg
A lot of people zeng until the whole car is just.. exhaust,btohqsg
A stock M3 sounds nice. A stock 335i is just.... Anemic,btohqsg
A stock M3 with an exhaust upgrade will be heavenly though,btohqsg
The e9x m3 exhaust is actually a bit raspy and leaky sounding,btohqsg
You might be interested in a trumpet 370z then,btohqsg
I like loud cars but I also like having money in my bank account,btohqsg
I have heard an e9x before,btohqsg
Too loud means burn too much petrol,btohqsg
Not if you're in a chopped pipe vios/cs3,btohqsg
I also like to stay on the safe side of the law,btohqsg
Can teach me your secret sir?,btohqsg
Not bad leh. I heard NA IL6 before especially from the previous series before they switched to mainly turbocharged 4cyl,btohqsg
Kor kor next time bring me go listen also leh.,btohqsg
espc when they got eventuri bits,btohqsg
Interesting question.. what do the merc boys do for intake etc ah?,btohqsg
the secret is to not have a loud car,btohqsg
I KNOW I KNOW!!!! Some people go Nasi Padang bo jio,btohqsg
that’s the only one i knw,btohqsg
Oh the na ones yes  creamy sounding. The turbos not great  or maybe cos mine was modded,btohqsg
I think I need go Nasi Padang stall and camp,btohqsg
Leave only the right ones to stay and come,btohqsg
Kor kor there got many many chairs 🪑,btohqsg
Wah bojio I want to camp to see also!,btohqsg
She put all the chair on table,btohqsg
Problem is outside sound nicer than inside,btohqsg
I don’t get to enjoy my own sound,btohqsg
Self record doesn’t do it justice,btohqsg
And I don’t have a camera with a mount,btohqsg
The coffeeshop now empty  who want to record for me? Haha,btohqsg
U no reply my pm leh lol,btohqsg
Is it?  my tele is odd one.. filters out quite a lot of people PM. Maybe too many,btohqsg
But anyway I don’t need a reply already haha.,btohqsg
how many chats u have 🤨🤨,btohqsg
Those are the last 2 folders,btohqsg
Which are the nsfw folders? Haha,btohqsg
No leh those are like filters out unread chats or some groups.,btohqsg
Anyone here have lobang for cloning key? Drop me a dm  thanks,btohqsg
Just error messages coming out  need fix. If can ownself fix good  if not need send workshop,btohqsg
Ask@awj_moodhe having diarrhoea today. Got to enjoy lots of own sound (and smell),btohqsg
Some say adding a solid plenum and intake system adds to the fun with both windows up and down 🤪 don’t know whether true or not or is it some urban legend,btohqsg
Set time and place. WE at SGCM line up the street outside the coffee shop. WE BRING MILLENIA WALK TO THE HEARTLANDS!!!!!,btohqsg
My inbox has been quiet forever. Why we don’t get PM… SAD!!!!!!,btohqsg
What key are you looking to clone sir? House key easy. Car key might not 😂,btohqsg
Few schools of thought. Some uncles tell me those who like preventive maintenance will be happy. Those who prefer to not hear about it and just use until things break down will not. There is no magic about this whatever make of car. All things mechanical and plastic will degrade and break down especially in our climate plus high cycle short distance city state driving pattern (multiple high heat and cool down cycles). Having more sensors in cars might actually help with better diagnostics and troubleshooting rather than a car without?,btohqsg
Wah this is good...but for grab partners only,btohqsg
Rickshaw can put PHV or not huh? Sometimes I wonder if I can do Grab delivery in between tourists,btohqsg

Not complete in terms of trims and powertrains,btohqsg
Missing the jimny hahaha  cheapest suv/off-roader,btohqsg
Then SLK is under which category,btohqsg
They replace with SLC last time,btohqsg
Also isn’t range rover under land rover?,btohqsg
But they differentiate the brand series,btohqsg
Land Rover more rugged and meant for off roading,btohqsg
How would you explain in mercedes context,btohqsg
The difference between range Rover and land Rover?,btohqsg
but the gap not so big la,btohqsg
Ranger rover VOGUE =GLS 600 MAYBACH,btohqsg
So land rover and range rover is like mercs and brabus?,btohqsg

once you had written it here  make it as your new year resolution,btohqsg
Do they sell 97 at shell 2nd link.  Have you been there?,btohqsg
Some pumps don't have 97  only 95 and vpower 100  so must see which one of the spots has 97 there,btohqsg
if don't have only need to go around to a pump which has,btohqsg
But they have signs on top showing which one has what,btohqsg
So just pull in after looking at them,btohqsg
ya but when have people queueing up to pump  whichever empty one you see just go,btohqsg
even the 100 also cheaper than our 95,btohqsg
I prefer the 100 so must look out for pumps that have it,btohqsg
The first one on the corner is 100 only and usually empty,btohqsg
No choice bah  min. grade 98,btohqsg
This season running until where first is the impt qn😂😂,btohqsg
Go back to where it all started,btohqsg
I think high chance unless we take stronger steps,btohqsg
