Speculators push and pass bag.Same as AGV  mercurius Metech,btohqsg
Why buy MT loss so big  operating cash so jialatNo other better counters to buy?Speculators may push high next week,btohqsg
AGV push so high before counter suspension,btohqsg
I maybe wrong follow price actionMT damn bullish,btohqsg
MT🧤 Medtecs TA daily📈 4ref.IMO  forget about the past starting pandemic🦠 prior speculating to ATH $2.. we're looking at range bound10c - 20c..Of course I hope speculating continue since I'm still holding small 40% position to fight higher next wk.. right hor  earn a bit more and wrong is okay  TP lesser lor🤣,btohqsg
Can’t share things s Mystic said,btohqsg
Still got bank loan 20mI thought no bank loan,btohqsg
He is already take profits all liao lah.. ya.. micro penny 10 out of 9 r big loss lah.. just avoid holding lor.. only selective trade,btohqsg
Those recent say sudden wu profits also depends wu speculating bo.. if not  won't move ones,btohqsg
just trade with cares.. best strategy sit sideline and watch.. unless itchy hand then gamble some to feel mkt sentiment,btohqsg
Warren buffet said you assume no market for 3 to 5 years if you buy good counters but sti difficult let,btohqsg
rubbish 🗑️.. I see surroundings so many investors suffering > -50% loss in US mkt.. some kena strucked -80 to -90%,btohqsg
If you buy AGV  Tiong Aik  mercurius in sgx you got zero,btohqsg
Yongnam also I don’t believe Yongnam will be suspended,btohqsg
agreed👍.. those r recently suspended micro penny... too many suspended stks in SG.. but these is nothing to do with investing,btohqsg
don confused it lor..micro-penny vs. Penny  how about mid-cap.. and 🇸🇬 30 components,btohqsg
and trading vs. investing.. all r different,btohqsg
MAS keeps Singapore dollars strong still can’t be strong?Maybe after seizing 1b money laundry,btohqsg
Aiyo so is can hoot or not,btohqsg
FA vs. TA also different..PA vol. not easy to understand too😝,btohqsg
IMO  瑞鹤仙swing tradepattern suitable for me..They're many experience champion gurustraderlikes popular 美国 杰西利佛莫尔 和 华尔街 幽灵  炒股养家  中国 退学炒股 和赵老哥  日本股神CIS 或 日本期货实盘冠军 菲阿里 except what you mentioned FA Investor Warren Buffett.. that we can learn from..What I wish to share is avoid going to the wrong paths.. learned fr. all this fr. loss to nothing and nvr give up to become billionaire gurus.. 不要走 冤枉路,btohqsg
I give it a miss  FA damn jialatLoss big operating cash flow jialat soon cash dries up,btohqsg
If can ask this q ...better dun hoot .. sleep better,btohqsg
FA is fake ❌ lah.. as it only know the past TA is real ✔️ as it show what market  thinking of this stock hor..,btohqsg
just liked Dyna-Mac🛥 u keep sharing value less than <10c and the fact PA keep pump⛽ up the price a few rounds.. that might miss out the short term holding or swing trade opportunity,btohqsg
Yes  Dyna-Mac 🛥 wu BB funds flow in is the fact.. but recently looks like funds flowing out  so it's gd to be cautious,btohqsg
I don’t have  can I tag on you for it,btohqsg
I no longer using homily chart almost two years liao.. but past experience can tell.. still struggling learning PA,btohqsg
I want to have but too expensive,btohqsg
My neighbour Homily masterShe keeps asking me to subscribe but I don’t have money,btohqsg
u must ask yourself  which path suitable for u.. trading - short or long trade.. investing - mid or long term and capital gains or dividend etc..There's a mkt pattern that will suit your character..Example  I prefer swing trade and position trading,btohqsg
To me  all types of TA chart in mkt r gd.. not necessary homily.. example I know a broker  homily not suitable for him,btohqsg
And so.. if he get elected  we get free flow yam?😂,btohqsg
Important  u hv to be familiar with the TA chart which indicators u r comfortable with and what type of candlestick patterns can give a higher probability etc..,btohqsg
except emotional control nobody can teach us.. except ourself,btohqsg
I tried before for one week HomilyChart free quite accurate but no money to subscribe,btohqsg
Obviously MT no big fund only speculators my friend shared HomilyChart,btohqsg
I asked my neighbour to share,btohqsg
then don't subscrib lor.. just like my friend (in the past is a broker  he recom. me homily) homily chart not suitable for him.. so he bk to his familiarity drawing lines & candlestick patterns,btohqsg
I don’t want to subscribe I don’t have money,btohqsg
Trust me.. micro penny stks is not homily chart can help you.. it's just a guide.. intraday trade really needs skills🎣 to find opportunity.. unless you r speculators 🦊  tOhish 🐆 or B🦈B,btohqsg
Then don't subscrib lor.. I also stop two years liao.. after used their promotion price phone subscription one year,btohqsg
Samuderai from penny 0.1 to 1.5,btohqsg
Wait for next crisis.. many such Samuderashipping stks opportunity,btohqsg
What so good about HomilyChart?I never use beforeMy neighbour told me very powerful,btohqsg
These is é past.. we shall looks out any new opportunity for future lah🤣,btohqsg
I am also not sure.. I only subscribe to the phone for a few hundred instead of the full package of a few thousand.. your neighbor is not a trader  probably an investor and important he's comfortable with it,btohqsg
Surprised.. Bro 旺旺 free to looks at SgX penny stk discussion at karaokes busy 左拥右抱😬😜,btohqsg
Happen to pass by only. Mon toh alset go fill gap.,btohqsg
