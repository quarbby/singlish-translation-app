Guys  moomoo guaranteed 5.8% is auto?,btohqsg
Or they give a coupon and need redeem? Will it expire?,btohqsg
Gg liao lo. Expired. Money gone. Fuck moomoo,btohqsg
Just check your statements to see,btohqsg
Not just click the deposit now then the interest is guaranteed?,btohqsg
Once the moomoo count down becomes zero  we can withdraw our money(eg. $80kÔºâ before the remaining 5.8% interest credited into our account n we still can get the remaining interest amount later . Correct?,btohqsg
Not so easy alot of fine print. Not worth the hassle,btohqsg
Not really a hassle  just deposit and claim can liao,btohqsg
The statement password not the same as login password?,btohqsg
I think there is a subscription button for you to click before you deposit your money. After depositing your money  few days later then the count down counter will be displayed.,btohqsg
Last 4 digits of what? Phone? Nric?,btohqsg
Hello  I've a question regarding UOB One acc and UOB Evolve credit card.Requirement for UOB one account is to have min spend of $500 using paywave while UOB Evolve card rewards mostly for online spend and mobile pay.Does that mean that for me to hit both requirements and enjoy full $40 cashback from evolve i essentially need to spend $500 using paywave + $250 online spend + $250 mobile pay?Senpais please halp ü§£,btohqsg
How u know sia. Its not mentioned anywhere,btohqsg
"UOB one account $500 spend requirement does not say it can only be paywaveIf EVOL is your only UOB card and you want to get all the benefits with minimal spend  then you would need to* Spend $250 mobile contactless on EVOL* Spend $250 online with EVOL* Spend $100 others with EVOL (to hit minimum spend of $600 to activate EVOL cashback)This would automatically also fulfil the $500 minimum for UOB One accountAlso take note how UOB defines mobile contactless  it's not necessarily the same as the usual definition of ""paywave"" (importance is whether you're tapping the card or phone to the payment terminal)",btohqsg
Thank you so much Mattheus for fully clarifying this!I have a follow up question as UOB Evolve cashback is capped at $40 essentially. I want to pair it with another credit card that is also generic with all spend categories and no minimum spend (for gym membership  occasional expenses for overseas holidays  and miscellaneous)Do you have any recommendations for me? ü§£UOB Lady's is not ideal bcoz can only select one category and has another $600 min spendCiti rewards card cashback % is low..,btohqsg
UOB Lady's has a minimum spend? since when though,btohqsg
It‚Äôs for any recurring payment to Visa card. I just tried and got 1.79%. No need enter promo code,btohqsg
Set up your payment as 'recurring' for a minimum of three payments in a series using a Singapore-issued Visa or UnionPay and enjoy a discounted fee of only 1.79%,btohqsg
Hmm just a couple of points:1. UOB Lady's doesn't have min spend. You might have misread some of the T&C2. UOB Lady's is primarily a miles card  so if you are chasing cashback it's not necessarily the best option (just did a rough calculation and if you earn 4mpd but  redeem the points to statement cash rebate  it comes up to around 2.3% cashback)Point 2 also applies to most other miles-focused cards  if your priority is cashback you should seek those cashback-specific cards. But unfortunately I can't advise much further on the cashback card scene as I'm a miles guy üòä,btohqsg
Thinking worst case here  is it possible that Citi will determine that the Citi Plus Top-Up Promotion cannot stack with the SingSaver promotion and refuse to give the cash reward  which means we will only end up receiving the cash from SingSaver and 1.5% base interest from Citi? And we won't know if this is the case until 31 May 2024...From a risk-reward standpoint you're looking at either 1.5% or 3.99% which is a big difference (or 3.0% vs 5.6% if you factor in the SingSaver cash),btohqsg
Does spending on ShopBack via Apple Pay consider as mobile contactless or online pay?,btohqsg
Have a read  for your own education üôÇhttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/cards/credit-cards/rewards-cards/uob-preferred-platinum-visa-card/terms-and-conditions-for-preferred-plat-visa.pdf,btohqsg
Online cos its through shopback platform,btohqsg
Same goes when u pay at the restaurant using shopback.. will still be online spend,btohqsg
The tc classifies any Apple Pay as mobile contactless tho,btohqsg
"Extract from first page 1. (a) (vi) ""that is effected at any Visa payWave Readers by waving the mobile device against the Visa payWave Readers.""",btohqsg
Contactless means the credit card has to ‚Äúkiss‚Äù üíãthe terminal n the terminal responses with beep sound.Mobile contactless means the device/watch/phone has to ‚Äúkiss‚Äù üíãthe terminal n the terminal responses with beep sound.,btohqsg
Also may I ask  (for new customer with 30K in uob one account) how long do we have to wait before getting our first interest upon spending $500?Do we get it on the very first month upon opening and fulfilling all criteria? I was told I had to wait a while but could not find it on the web,btohqsg
About second working day of each monthAssuming previous month you already fulfilled criteriaBesides $500  can also credit salary or have 3 giro payments,btohqsg
2nd workday on the following calendar month,btohqsg
Remember the interest is calculated based on MAB  not last day of the calendar month.,btohqsg
So technically I can put in 100k on the 29th of the months and spend 500 + credit salary via pay now and still get the interest immediately the next month?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure what is MAB. PspsI assume its how much you have left at the end of that month,btohqsg
MAB: MonthlyAverageBalanceKey word being average  means you can't just put all the money in only on the last day to count for the whole monthMore specifically  how I understand the process is UOB will take a reading of your account balance at 10pm each day  and then your MAB is the average of all these readings through the whole month  which is then the balance used to compute the amount of interest you'll get for that month.,btohqsg
Which is the same as inputting cash on the 29th if my card approval is on the 25th,btohqsg
cash in or out after 10.30pm will be dated next business day,btohqsg
Interest is calculated daily based on average end day balance. If you only credited the money on last day of the month  you only earn one day of interest.Eg. $100k/31 = $3225.80. Your MAB is $3225.80You can base on $3225.80 of account balance to calculate your interest earned.,btohqsg
Account opening is usually immediate. How do you know if your card approval is on the 25th? And if you're on Android  you can use the digital card once the card is approved to clock the $500 spending.But if you don't mind only getting ~$32 (assuming you are depositing 100k on the 29th) instead of ~$107 (assuming you are depositing 100k on 22nd)  then sure.Deposit 100k on 29th$0.41 base interest$31.64 bonus interest$32.05 total interestDeposit 100k on 22nd$1.37 base interest$105.48 bonus interest$106.85 total interestThis is assuming you will hit both $1.6k salary credit AND $500 card spend.,btohqsg
Only base interest (0.05%) is calculated end of day  daily.Bonus interest is calculated end of month  but based on total daily end of day balance divided by days in the month. üëçüèª,btohqsg
Anyone knows what types of funds Moneybull invests into  to be able to produce 5.4% yield?,btohqsg
Do i need to link lady‚Äôs card to amaze to book staycation in singapore? Seems like not necessary am i right?,btohqsg

Hi guys  Can I ask if its possible to upgrade UOB Ladies to the ladies solitaire card without meeting the eligible income bracket? Thank!,btohqsg
Isn't it just Fullerton USD Cash Fund A?,btohqsg
Anyone can share CIMB Elevate4 terms and conditions?,btohqsg
Yes by placing 30k fixed deposit as secured card  note all ur other uob cards will also become secured  meaning to get ur 30k back  u need to cancel all ur cards / convert back to unsecured subjected to approval.,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt get the full interest,btohqsg
ooooo..daily closing is 10pm timing! thanks...didnt know..haha,btohqsg
What I know DBS Live Fresh card consider shopback as eligible online transaction. Can always call or email them,btohqsg
I think same as OCBC MAB calculation. Long story short it depends on the calendar days and it determines averagely how much money you have over how many days.Imo  once you have money  quickly deposit it into your good interest account before end of the month (don't wait). If you hold that increased balance amount for more days  it will increase your MAB.,btohqsg
