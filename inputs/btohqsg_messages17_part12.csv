Guys... i was looking tru sbf ... then i saw 688e woodlands... wen google how come looks like resale flat instead of bto?,btohqsg
Can anyone advise does sbf flats all izit new bto or some gt look like old flat?,btohqsg
no SBF can also include units that are not taken up by people / taken back by HDB from past projects that is already completed long ago too,btohqsg
‚ÄúSBF HDB scheme is essentially an exercise that pools unsold flats from past BTO launches  surplus flats fromSelective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS)projects  and any flats repurchased by HDB.‚Äù,btohqsg
Ya thats y i was looking tru woodlands area...then google i saw mostly is old type of flat... very weird..the lease is still ard 71years... 65years.. very confuse now,btohqsg
is anybody doing balloting now? i have done the preliminary hfe check but after i've been queueing for my turn to ballot  it keeps saying i have not done my preliminary check and to come back after doing even though it has already been completed. Anybody facing the same issue?,btohqsg
Isit better to take those olds ones? Will the lease be affected? So confusing üòï,btohqsg
up to your preference + if you‚Äôre okay with the flat‚Äôs location too,btohqsg
Ok talk abt the 688e...lease 99years..build 2002...now 2023...left 21years more... but it state there like 67 or 71years i forgot,btohqsg
Mayb too stress up frm noon till now looking until i get confuse already,btohqsg
The lease same mah.Prev sbf I went down to see the neighbours and promptly decided to skip the units lol,btohqsg
anyone got apppoinment email for feb launch already?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if you can see which priority scheme you have successfully applied for under the bto application?,btohqsg
Any one no aft apply HFE Precheck and payment  how do u knw which BTO project is selected? Cos it show not tag to any project is blank under sales launch,btohqsg
I am unable to click no on this section,btohqsg
Is it HFE docu need to be submitted before can select the project? Kind of confuse with the new application.Step 1 & 2 completed  went step 3 it will come to this payment completed page‚Ä¶So the Apply Now button is only to start with HFE? Only when docu submitted and final HFE confirmed then chose BTO Project?,btohqsg
What the front of the yes n no?,btohqsg
For this one i am not able to click on no,btohqsg

I buay tahan le since last night,btohqsg
Just dont do it today if possible,btohqsg
HDB website cannot tahan the load,btohqsg
LOL i buy season parking also got problem -.-!,btohqsg
Money go to them alr but never reflect in their system.,btohqsg
Then what‚Äôs the point of queue system if the point is to not make the website jam,btohqsg
Im just telling u dont waste ur time,btohqsg
U call them  they cant do anything,btohqsg
The staff on the phone are not equipped to answer this question lol,btohqsg
Their IT will take time to resolve on their end,btohqsg
I wouldnt call it resolve la,btohqsg
U just happen to be out of the queue only,btohqsg
How it works is ..Simple explanation on why some people works and some will hang.Their system allow maybe 1 000 people to use it at 1 time.1 001th person to maybe 5 000th is the so called queue.5 001th onwards u probably just get the message that the website is currently unavailable.Then u just gotta wait lo wait at a later time to go in and try again :)No matter how u complain  they will not improve it.Cos probably thats how they set it.They control the traffic of users coming in. Thats all.,btohqsg
Any one no aft apply HFE Precheck and payment  how do u knw which BTO project is selected?
