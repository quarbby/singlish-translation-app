the punggol 2007 murder case i think havent fully reslove yet,btohqsg
Isn't there a rule in driver Ed where the moment a person enters the crosswalk  they have the right of way and the moment they do anything you do that fails to stop their safe passage through is your fault as a driver,btohqsg
I think she just assumed the moment the traffic warden said can cross means can start crossing,btohqsg
But ya she shouldn‚Äôt have ran,btohqsg
I feel the girl is like abit stupid for running,btohqsg
Theres also the woodlands Mrt rape and murder of a Indonesian student,btohqsg
The car driver probably had less than 3 seconds to react,btohqsg
The driver idk can't rly 100% blame him,btohqsg
Idk if the car driver was going too fast tho if it‚Äôs a sch zone,btohqsg
Yesh but in this practical scenario the girl was still dumb for deciding to just RUN ACROSS THE ROAD,btohqsg
I mean many laws around the world not just in Singapore always pin more blame on drivers irregardless of what the pedestrian does,btohqsg
Some of them police also can‚Äôt resolve despite their efforts,btohqsg
Can verify that@doobyis a real human,btohqsg
In fact the Onions Amicus Brief says it best: The second reason‚Äîperhaps mildly more important‚Äîis that the phrase ‚Äúyou are dumb‚Äù capturesthe very heart of parody: tricking readers into believing that they‚Äôre seeing a serious rendering of some specific form‚Äîa pop song lyric  a newspaper article  apolice beat‚Äîand then allowing them to laugh at theirown gullibility when they realize that they‚Äôve fallenvictim to one of the oldest tricks in the history of rhetoric.,btohqsg
Not like the driver could react on time in this case. It seems like the moment the traffic warden decide to raise his stick she ran across the road,btohqsg
Warden could‚Äôve also just waited for cars to pass too,btohqsg

Maybe she just thinks passenger always right of way,btohqsg
I rmbr us saying sth like we have more faith in you than yourself,btohqsg
but I worried about the wrong subject,btohqsg
Oh yea I know was referencing to other cases  but I think this woodlands one close alr tho hmn,btohqsg
