May I ask what platform do u use to buy ?,btohqsg
usually binance or FTX. i have accounts in more than 5 exchanges ba  but mostly buying bsc coins in binance  and mainnet coins in FTXi use kucoins for KCC chain coins.anyway if u want referral that makes it cheaper to buy at exchange just pm me for the referral links,btohqsg
Thanks for your prompt reply. I shall check it out.,btohqsg
do u guys know what is DEFI? (decentralised finance) its a proper use of blockchain now and is why coins are now practical and valuable.,btohqsg
summarybinance is for BSC chain (BNB token) ecosystem of defiFTX is for mainnet chain (ETH token)Kucoin is for KCC chain (KCS token)AscendEX is for polygon (matic token),btohqsg
Onboarding is easiest if u have USD (use dbs multicurrency account) to send to global exchangesFor sgd  can use binance P2P to exchange SGD for crypto in Binance marketplace@Ericngws,btohqsg
P2P means binance act as a carousell platformpple park their USDT (crypto token that is marked to $1 USD) or BUSD (same) etc and set to a SGD pricethen u go in and promise to buy (or sell) so u message that person  and binance note it and the seller release the crypto in escrow  and once seller confirm receive your SGD via Paynow or bank transfer  he will notify binance and binance will release money to you,btohqsg
a little bit riskier as it is not direct buying but via marketplaces like that....,btohqsg
binance act as escrow to provide securityPlus u get to see past reviews for sellers who sold crypto beforeSimiliarly u can sell your crypto to take SGD out as profit,btohqsg
Any idea why PropNex share soaring?,btohqsg
Bcos it been surging since last year,btohqsg
Any Angel investors here keen to hear a business plan from me?,btohqsg

What we are doing here is to create a monthly premium of say a range of $30-$60 It is based on the premiums you‚Äôre getting. We cover all sorts of repairs and transportation of the damaged Ebike. For example  client A has a basic insurance plan which costs $30  he has a tyre punctured  he can bring to us at any point of time to get it repair. Another example will be client B has a premium insurance package which costs $60  and he has a spoilt motor (higher cost price)  we will go to him at any part of Singapore to get it done for him. We have specialised repair man. The complication in the repair depends how sever is the damaged done. We could also come out with VIP premium that costs $80 a month? Which means if the Ebike is lost or totally out of repair  we will replace a new Ebike for them.,btohqsg
I have 1 more plan open to look for investors. Typically my plans are usually low costs as to try to minimise the risk. Am looking for a mentor to help me with the opportunities around. üôè,btohqsg
Haha ya I know  but this company is not only into cryptos  there‚Äôs others like indexes and stocks too,btohqsg
Sounds like a good plan actually,btohqsg
Oh icic okay thanks for sharing.üòÑ,btohqsg
Haha yes it is. No one is actually doing this,btohqsg
I came up with this as a rider myself. A lot of issue w Ebike. It can get frustrating especially when you‚Äôre sending orders halfway and something happens to your Ebike,btohqsg
Yup! If you guys want  I can arrange a platform where you guys can ask Mr Jeremy Ng any queries.,btohqsg
Crypto 15% a year is very minimalLeh. Even if guaranteed,btohqsg
Does it come with personal guarantees of the director?,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt only invest in cryptos but others as well such as indexes etc.,btohqsg
If you want  you can pm me haha. You can clear your doubts with him.,btohqsg
