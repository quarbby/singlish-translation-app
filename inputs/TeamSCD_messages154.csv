He close when he feel like it,btohqsg
You want him close 4 also can,btohqsg
Hi what time do u want?,btohqsg
Hi guys. Anyone with a Mazda 3 3rd gen experienced doing tuning before? I need some advice,btohqsg
What do you all think about plug and play types like gan ga+,btohqsg
from reviews... you can consider hex performance,btohqsg
I'd say dont waste time tuning because it's NA,btohqsg
The amount of money spent wont get much in return,btohqsg
I was attracted to the 15% fuel economy. Lol,btohqsg
That’s was what the ad on the gan ga+ said. Very optimistic,btohqsg
downside rims  change tyres width to 185,btohqsg
but dun show us the car,btohqsg
But with fuel economy  you will loose power,btohqsg
+ doing this u will feel more power,btohqsg
But thinner then width looks so easy to bully,btohqsg
ya cannot have best of both worlds,btohqsg
Drive slowly. Look sporty can alr,btohqsg
hex performance tuner's name similar to yours.. Ronny. u ask similar name gt discount bo ahahaha,btohqsg
put ur coilovers first leh haha,btohqsg
Oh ya. Look good first haha,btohqsg
na no need tune haha  but den again  he charge simple jdm like $350,btohqsg
If tune my pick up faster then I’ll haha,btohqsg
no la cfm coming from hardware de,btohqsg
@Bungalaixyou need to drive up to here... Then have some burgers,btohqsg
Bro just tune 😂 no 15% ask them for refund,btohqsg
If not u can tune ur torque higher,btohqsg
Sorry. Ronnie says price fixed no similar name discount 😂,btohqsg
Not to show off but tuning won't increase your horsepower but can increase your torque and throttle responses.,btohqsg
As the saying goes  your car head infront of your opponent  you win abit liao. 😂,btohqsg
Btw  this is a wheel dyno chart for Honda shuttle hybrid,btohqsg
May I know the TCF figure for this Dyno chart?😊,btohqsg
Hmm tbh  I also donno how to see. I just see the number at the peak and how the tuner explain to me that's all,btohqsg
especially if you're looking at power figures,btohqsg
if not the entire chart you can don't look  just the shape of the graph  because the numbers don't matter,btohqsg
Yeah..from the chart..can't see much details,btohqsg
that's why people say go tune NA car with nothing suddenly +50hp,btohqsg
To go up 70kg plus nm torque..abit..erm...haha,btohqsg
Bhp number not that important to me..torque figure does😁,btohqsg
198 to 272? Super good return😁,btohqsg
any simple theory on how they increase the torque for NA?,btohqsg
Tht is engine + battery at full charge. If battery flat  the torque not so high,btohqsg
Most tuner will play with your AFR. When you have more fuel combusting  it will affect the torque slightly. But don't hope for very high increase in figures if the engine is stock.,btohqsg
Of course if your car is pumping more fuel to combust  your FC will cui. So if want fuel efficiency  you won't high much power. It's like a balancing beam.,btohqsg
From 198 to 272 in terms of nm ...is extremely nice 😁,btohqsg
Usually AFR  throttle response  ignition timing and lamda,btohqsg
The chat 198nm is pure engine power  battery at flat. 270nm is engine + battery with full charge.,btohqsg
Erm..abit cheem..how the batt from flat to full charge in that short period sir,btohqsg
So after power run at full charge  battery will flat. The tuner will just let the car rest and charge up the battery before doing another power run,btohqsg
ah icic ok thanks! air coming in is the limit liao,btohqsg
Power....the batt discharge so fast? One run and flat liao on Dyno?,btohqsg
Different intake set up also affect a car performance. That why you always see ppl comparing between open pod and closed pod intake.,btohqsg
Hybrid is like tht de. The full power to wheels will drain the battery fast.,btohqsg
maybe like F1 can change ah. change to HotLap settings drain the batt,btohqsg
Sadly we don't have the technology like F1 cars. If not charging will be damn fast.,btohqsg
Will trickle down one day to consumer cars😁,btohqsg
Ok  time for me to get back to work. Chat again soon :),btohqsg
