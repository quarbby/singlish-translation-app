Yup heâ€™s the right guy for me.Penny Lao Jiao,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why Acrometa have to watch list.,btohqsg
Ride with him or ganna ride....either way. At current price is ok,btohqsg
He choose the correct company this time. High chance  we will be rewarded for those who buy 32-34 very safe if can hold,btohqsg
For easy read and understanding on Acrometa 3 core business. Pretty niche and good potential especially since these 3 segments grew in FY22 too where they turnaround from losses in past years to profit finally.https://acrometa.com/companies/#acro-harvest-engineering#whodoesnotlikeabusinessturnaround?,btohqsg
Earlier post  but easy reference now that Acrometa volume is in.Expecting plentiful of catalyst in this year judging from their very focused Investor relations suddenly with Levin Lee coming into the fold,btohqsg
His cost only 2 cts....got a head up,btohqsg
1 thing i dun understand  acromec before right issue not active counter. even 1:1 right also not suppose to have so much shares now. how come volume so big now,btohqsg
Who buy the rights ?And why.,btohqsg
He could have sold all his rights ? And take free money but he intend to go big for this and thus come out the $1100 000 investment to acrometa,btohqsg
his cost not 2 cnts. i remember sgx ask qestion why give him rights to execise. bcos got loan w him..,btohqsg
This surprised me totally . Today last day trading.So they plan to convert in,btohqsg
The rights trading time  who collected the chips and converted in . Thatâ€™s key.Can see how strong the players hands was .I sold almost of my rights 2.7k+ lots,btohqsg
And close last day at high,btohqsg
based on his previous pattern.. dun think 1-2 cents gain will enough feed his stocmach,btohqsg
initially i plan to sell remaining 100k shares. after see announcement. i decide to hold,btohqsg
Levin could have easily sold off all his rights then cash out easily $600k to $1m if he wanted to and earn.Instead  he put in $1.1 mil .That means heâ€™s going in for the killing.Acrometa still very low float now. And is cheap considering $0.225 placement price in 2015,btohqsg
The picture is clearer now actually.This one high chance will be pumped .Will get more popular only,btohqsg
This I heads up first. Because hope all huat,btohqsg
