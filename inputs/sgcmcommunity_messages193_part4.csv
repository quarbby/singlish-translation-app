Hello. Just wondering how does mercedes aircon fair with toyota?,btohqsg
I observe that my vios aircon cools the cabin faster and much more powerful compared to my GLB which takes v long to cool,btohqsg
Plus maybe the thermostat is different… European vs Japanese…,btohqsg
I was told by my workshop,btohqsg
Asked him how come last time I only turn to 27degree for my mz3  and it was cool enough… but now when I turn on 27 for my current car  it’s as if I’m in a sauna room,btohqsg
He told me cuz mazda 3 thermostat is different… the lowest it can go to is 18  while my current one is based on European style… lowest is 15,btohqsg
So I need to minus 3 to get the same effect,btohqsg
Japanese car usually have more powerful AC  maybe they designed it to work for the climate in asia,btohqsg
Toyota and mazda I set to 25 the cabin damn cool alr  while for BMW and skoda I have to set to like 22 to feel anything,btohqsg
If new already not cold  then 10 years how,btohqsg
No la its still cold if i put the fan speed to 6/7,btohqsg
But for my vios i usually put 1 and its cold already,btohqsg
Btw why does merc air circulation keep turning off ah,btohqsg
After 10-15mins it auto turns off lol,btohqsg
But i got enable auto start stop if that matters,btohqsg
I thought aircon affects start stop,btohqsg
Low temp… start stop won’t work,btohqsg
Hi all  my blackvue dashcam sometimes doesn’t turn on automatically after car is started up. I’m not sure what’s the underlying issue  all I can do is to plug in and out the DC cable. Sometimes it works sometimes it still remains off. Anybody can advise/face same thing? 🙏🏼,btohqsg
