This one is from a reliable source if it answers your question. I saved this info since I also wanted to know.“Only cpf life premium interest will go to the pool. The interest earned from 55 to payout age anytime from 65 to 70 is part of your ra savings  thereafter it depends on your cpf life plan chosen”,btohqsg
I don't recall any Kopitiam that supports XNAP but I might be wrong. But if you're at Kopitiam you should use Fairprice Group app since they give 10% discount by default on most purchases.Maybe check the SGQR again if it has XNAP or LiquidPay QR.,btohqsg
I don't think they see MAB for earmarking  but just the participating amounts.,btohqsg
Does the daily average matter? The qualifying criteria should be incremental fresh funds of $100k?,btohqsg
This shop don’t have that fair price app payment.But I think maybe this shop don’t support Xnap payment. Coz it’s had only like about 8 payments types on that QR..Maybe that was my issue.,btohqsg
let me try to find the fineprints. I recall got something like this.,btohqsg
It all depends on your needs... Don't be too focused on the nitty gritty like interest rates. Ask yourself if you need the payouts from 65. If you still have a stable income  you can choose to defer until later. Some people may want to take out at 65 so they can change to a less demanding job with a lower pay at that age. Others may choose to defer if they want to hit ERS before their payouts start so they can stop working altogether.,btohqsg
I can confirm no need MAB because I have 2 humans that opened their account in mid Jan and got their 100k earmarked. They only deposited 100k then.,btohqsg
Mab is for uob one interest  uob promo just need to 100k in and dont fall under it before amt been earmark,btohqsg
strange. my personal experience it doesn't get earmarked until I try to register again the next month.,btohqsg
The tnc states aggregate of end day balance of 31 Dec and participating deposit only haha.,btohqsg
Anyone can send me souper Loong please 🙏🏻,btohqsg
mine was Xmas promo. it didn't get earmarked and I have to register again the next month.,btohqsg
probably due to other reasons  nothing to do with MAB,btohqsg
Login to UOB apps n check thePDF statement. See what is the closing balance as of 31 Dec 2023?I believe you maybe out by few dollars.,btohqsg
greatest mind here. I am not able to change my salary credit away from UOB. Is there any high interest rate saving account I can put money in without company salary crediting if I have maxed 100k at UOB one .,btohqsg
Can consider holding in money market funds either directly (buy into the fund yourself) or indirectly (e.g. syfe cash  stashaway simple  endowus cash smart),btohqsg
if you want low risk + liquid  Trust+ 3%,btohqsg
as long as you have 100k,btohqsg
Yo guys if my credit card got 12k limitCC>Crypto.com/Prepaidwallet > BankCan I earn miles and interest on the additional cash,btohqsg
Check your credit card TnC. It shall have clause related this.,btohqsg
Just to be sure I transferred  more than was required for the earmarked. So I don’t think this is the issue.. I hope.. 🤞,btohqsg
Hmm just that sometimes their merchant code nvr categorise properly Thn cn loophole,btohqsg
You can try and find out,btohqsg
Under current system  if you have not reached FRS at age55   salary will still flow to SA/OA/MA. You will not be permitted to take out money from SA/OA (other than the 5K) as you have not hit FRS. Then at age 65  there will be another round of transfer to RA to try to hit FRS.,btohqsg
The new system will immediately transfer salary CPF to RA(previously earmarked for SA),btohqsg
Unless you can get more than 2.5% interest else where  there is no need to withdraw from CPF OA . Note withdraw is easy  put back is difficult,btohqsg
Provided that u are a union member,btohqsg
