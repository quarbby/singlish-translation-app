Edited. RA/SA rule is the same when it comes to MA excess flow. Only way to contribute to RA is by OA to RA transfer (below ERS)  mandatory CPF contributions (below FRS) and RA interest.,btohqsg
Yes if not a trader  then the $5 stock voucher is useless as not enough to cover moomoo fees.I asked moomoo staff and their reply'Fees for Singapore Stocks  ETFs  REITs1. Commission: 0.03% * Transaction amount  min 0.99 SGD/ Order;2. Platform Fee: 0.03% * Transaction amount  min 0.99 SGD/ Order;In addition  SGX will also charge Trading Fees and Clearing fees for orders. There's also a 9% GST (consumption tax) to pay.,btohqsg
So in short are u trying to say we will never exceed ERS thru mandatory cpf contribution (via salary) for RA? Even though we may exceed FRS thru mandatory cpf contribution (via salary) for SA? Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
I think once you reach RA frs limit  all monthly contributions from your salary will go towards OA only.(provided your MA also reaches BHS).You can voluntarily transfer your OA to RA till ERS,btohqsg
I applied my CRMC on end of October and spend total $800 by middle of November and the bonus come in early December last year,btohqsg
Who can confirm my question ah? Chris able to confirm? Or can do a video on this haha,btohqsg
Only those with ERS + 55 & above + Employed will confirm  we should see more datapoints in next few weeks,btohqsg
Moomoo fees are much better than alot of local brokerages who charge $25++ exclu the SGX fees and GST.For a $10k trade on Moomoo  buy/sell usually incur approx $10 total in fees. Compared to maybe $30+ for brokerages,btohqsg
Also if you're not near 55 yet  no point to speculate what will happen since it is beyond control. Focus on gaining more income/income sources is more important than allocation of CPF,btohqsg
