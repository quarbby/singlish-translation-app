My invigilator forgot to cut me at 5 minutes,btohqsg
I ended up speaking for 7 minutes,btohqsg
Is there like a saving grace if u were to fk up one of the PW components,btohqsg
Wait idg why PW was such a big stressor,btohqsg
I think mine does that too,btohqsg
It's only stressful IF U WANT 90RP,btohqsg
But u don't need 90RP to go to every course,btohqsg
Then ur time management just sucks,btohqsg
Which has a high standard for PW,btohqsg
In the sense that the projects are actuslly implementable,btohqsg
Every other sch u can anyhow write smth it doesn't matter,btohqsg
Is the extra 2 min counted,btohqsg
U literally cannot get less than a B for PW unless the system fucks u over,btohqsg
Yeah she basically gave up on a levels,btohqsg
Okay but anyways if u remove PW why not just make it a 80RP system,btohqsg
Instead of REMOVING THE OTHER CONTRASTING,btohqsg
Oh ya they also didn't wan students to be overly obsessed and focused on securing an A for PW too,btohqsg
Then make the 90RP less necessary or less indicative of someone's success as a person,btohqsg
Bruh bedok   violinist's fingers are strong asf  they definitely hit the finger gym every day  I thought pipa was hard enough ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
U just trying to solve the symptoms of the problem without solving the actual reason,btohqsg
They think they did by making it pass/fail,btohqsg
Maybe it's one of those in the long term kinda shit,btohqsg
I have multiple students JAE in and didn't kena anything as well,btohqsg
Honestly it really depend on the individual and the ppl you meet,btohqsg
As i have said in the discord there is this thing where your reality is influenced by ur perceptions - if you think ppl are gonna ostracise you and think ur an outcast  chances are you will subconsciously dont mix with them which leads to them not talking to you  then in this case its a no brainer they wont be friends with you,btohqsg
Also Ik this is very unfair and sounds harsh but then sometimes in life you have to go and take the first move. Ppl like familar things so during ori its expected that the IP kids will stick to their friends who they have known for years  but this is not that they dislike you. Even in the primary school I am doing my work attachment at  I see kids from the same kindergarten sticking together. People naturally gravitate towards familiar people. If you want to befriend someone  make the first move. You have nothing to lose even if they dont want to befriend you,btohqsg
And if you have a good personality  chances are there will be people who are willing to include you. You may not be as close as the others but this is really something we cannot control- it is just a matter of your own luck,btohqsg
"Good personality is subjective imo  and ppl can be kinda overly selective sometimes( I'm not one of them {real} ) and  uk to those who initiate first and step out of their comfort zone  at least you've tried associating/communicating with them and lest things don't t always go the way we want/desire to  at least you've let them know that social cue that you wanna friend them  and alsooo if things doesn't work out   it doesn't mean its time to cast self-doubt  esp if you really have a genuine ""good personality"" .. self reflection maybe   to work on self-improvement and social etiquettes",btohqsg
most of my friends now are people whom i made the first move to talk to ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I managed to befriend some boys during sec 1 ori cause of clash royale,btohqsg
