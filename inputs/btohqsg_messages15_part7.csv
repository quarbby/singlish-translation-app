Hi  can I ask if BTO 15% downpayment is calculated after offsetting the grants from the original price?,btohqsg
i think the EHG is just credited into your OA  so the 15% should be the 15% of the original price (CORRECT ME IF I‚ÄôM WRONG),btohqsg
I came across some articles that talked about BTO downpayment  some says 15% and some says 10% so which one is the correct one though,btohqsg
Or it depends on how much HDB loan you can get then the downpayment percentage will be determine from that?,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-hdbWhen in doubt good to go back to HDB website instead of gas gas gas.,btohqsg
Remember what you get in the EHG will be compound 2.6% until you return the money to your CPF Account,btohqsg
Much earlier years it was 10%  then recent years was 15%  Sep 2022 is 20%.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt down payment 10%  based on hbd website?,btohqsg
Downpayment at signing lease 10%Downpayment at key collection another 10%Total 20%,btohqsg
This is from 30th Sept 2022 onward,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt we pay remainder amount during key collection  after including the loans?,btohqsg
20% is minimum amount required‚Ä¶The rest will either be required to be covered by HDB or Bank Loan  any amount not covered will need to be paid in cash,btohqsg
