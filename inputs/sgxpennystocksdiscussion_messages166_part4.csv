I think they won't push up so fast..Want to flush out contra and weak holder..Many buy at 002 and immediately q to sell at 003 for 50% profit..That is why the sell q for 003 is piling high,btohqsg
It was..Hope it turn better now,btohqsg
Bb won't let u earn 50% so easily,btohqsg
Must hold for weeks or months like oceanus,btohqsg
Oceanus also hang at low for quite a while,btohqsg
Anyway  play small OK..Don't all in,btohqsg
Weak holder or contra bot at 0.002 get flush out at 0.001 (50% loss),btohqsg

Hi. For Aspen present and future investors  in order for Aspen to graduate to mainboard  it has to maintain a capitalisation of $300m for at least one monthunless exempted.$300m market cap would mean min. share price 0.300.$330m market cap would mean min. share price 0.340.Aspen has already announced intentions to move to mainboard one day ago. It is currently backed by Tan Sri Dato‚Äô Chua Ma Yu and Datuk Chua Sai Men  including Alan Wang at $0.238.For myself  I am quite certain that these influential individuals and vested interests would not allow the plan to get into mainboard fail.That said  I cannot foretell the future. Just sharing for people who are looking to enter or vested alr. Think carefully before you make any decisons with Aspen alright. üëç,btohqsg

If you had 7k to spend on a penny stock. Which one would you guys pick?,btohqsg
Frankly  your such comment is unnecessary. It's ppls like you that stop ppls from sharing. If I'm admin here I'll remove ppls like you.,btohqsg
That isn't a penny stock.. No better suggestions someone?  Something that's able to go to the moon soon..,btohqsg

I was thinking about RLF..relief therapeutics. Seems like they have the best covid19 therapeutics at the moment. Soon EUA probably ans hopefully FDA approvement.,btohqsg
Swiss and US   check it out!  Looks definitely promising I think. They are in phase 3 of the trial. FDA fasttrack,btohqsg
That's a scam company which is under investigation of the government dude..,btohqsg
Anyways thanks for the suggestions so far. I've done my research already on relief (Rlftf) so just wanted to share it with you guys since they will come with some great trial data soon.,btohqsg
More people bullish on the just mentioned Tigr and RIOT stocks?  Why do they have potential according to you?,btohqsg
Am I in the right grp,btohqsg
Of course not. But If I can spend 7k on it now why not. I just read that next week earnings probably will be positive. So good chance it will take off at least,btohqsg
I'm in tigr whats your tp? Riot my wl,btohqsg
Not in yet but could double after ER when I'm looking at the figures. Good luck! I might hop on if there s a little dump,btohqsg
