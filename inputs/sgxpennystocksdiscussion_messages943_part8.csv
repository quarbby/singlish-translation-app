New full shares start trading on Tuesday,btohqsg
Let’s see will push up tml onwards anot,btohqsg
Usually mother share higher than new full shares?,btohqsg
New share same value as existing mother share bcos they are the same converted from rights,btohqsg
How come new share same value,btohqsg
To raise money they offered rights shares if anyone had existing mother shares with warrants given,btohqsg
Maybe but the thing is the exercise price of warrant is $0.045. If mother share below this then logically the warrants are worth nothing,btohqsg
Is good or bad for mother share,btohqsg
More mother shares bad for share price but warrant exercise price so high logically shd support mother share value n push it higher,btohqsg
Hopefully they can push to pre Covid lvl,btohqsg
If can 31 above best haha,btohqsg
Not asking people buy or sell,btohqsg
