I don't get your question. The 1% p.a. is capped at $300 per month. Doesn't matter premier or personal banking.,btohqsg
Have you tried scrolling to HSBC?,btohqsg
If you cannot see  just use Search@sgpromocode,btohqsg
For OCBC 360 account  in order to get the extra 1.2% from OCBC Invest  I need to invest 20k to unit trust. Is this 20k referring to the initial investment or the market value?,btohqsg
Ya market value float of course count by what u put in initially ah,btohqsg
Hi All Anyone play the Mari Saving and Mari Invest everyday with 10k to earn the double interest?,btohqsg
Double interest? Can elaborate more on the steps?,btohqsg
For your reference  it took 4 hours for SCB to reply me via email (rejection) after applying through Singsaver. Reapplied 2 weeks later directly via the SCB App and got instant approval.,btohqsg
Apply at bank apps is better,btohqsg
Interesting but when do Mari invest credit their returns?,btohqsg
U got exisiting acct or new acct ? I applied through their web,btohqsg
Later kena flag once bank catch up to it  not worth it for 10k haha,btohqsg
Nah it‚Äôs a digital bank and it‚Äôs moving internally lol,btohqsg
I encourage all brave warrior go try for extend period of time and then give data point,btohqsg
Same eh. I waited for 2 working days alr üòÇ,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your definition of extend period of time? Seems like the same logic as you buy and sell stocks in a day,btohqsg
The salary crediting doesn‚Äôt count as monthly increase? I mean i can put in 1800 and take out 1300 to achieve the criteria right? Assuming i have 100k in it  the only time i loses the 4% is whenever i take out the excess MAB  i.e. maybe once a year for 6k or 12k (assuming i put in 500 per month just to hit),btohqsg
Did you recently apply for any other credit cards? If yes  should re-try after all your credit card statements are generated.,btohqsg
No eh. I'm new to Standchart,btohqsg
If salary credit 1st of month. AVG bal increase $500,btohqsg
Technically it should work since you only need the ‚Äúaction‚Äù of crediting your salary and it doesn‚Äôt have to stay in your account for a working day to take into account as a salary credit.,btohqsg
UOB One does not require you to increase your MAB $500. You just need to do salary credit $1600 and spend $500 credit card transactions.,btohqsg
I meant  did you apply for any other credit cards from DBS/Citi/UOB recently?If yes  your credit report might look weird (e.g. citi queried but no citi credit card. It will appear as though citi rejected you),btohqsg
That is the good thing of UOB One over OCBC 360. I don‚Äôt need to ensure increase of MAB,btohqsg
Not worth the time and effort lol,btohqsg
Precisely  i just earmark 150k with uob one will do haha,btohqsg
I read the post saying that invest will usually credit around 6pm so the hack is1) maribank interest credit at 12:10am2) transfer 10k to Mari invest and it will be bought on the same day since it before 730am3)once Mari invest credit the returns  transfer back to Mari saving4) rinse and repeat,btohqsg
Not everyone as rich as you ma,btohqsg
I not rich lol. U can barely claim to be rich with 150k,btohqsg
Some don‚Äôt even have 100k much less 150k,btohqsg
Coz other is either young or have asset like cpf  flat. I have none but cash niah,btohqsg
To be safe  $500 self transfer in on the 1st day ideally (more if 1st day is non-business day - adjust accordingly if 2nd day as well...). Then when salary credits  pull out the whole salary amount.,btohqsg
He don't intend to hit $500 spend if you see his OP.,btohqsg
Or just sleep at night soundly,btohqsg
But technically i can just do a recurring transfer of $500 by 28 every month  to make sure MAB increase by 500 right? Then i can transfer out all my salary regardless of when it comes in?,btohqsg
Not like y‚Äôall sleep early also haha,btohqsg
Then your MAB does not increase by $500.,btohqsg
Please teach me how to get started with miles games! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
Why 28th? Your MAB is not going to increase by 500 with just 500 on 28thIf you want to be lazy  then you set a recurring on the 1st for 500  but if you meet with a public holiday or non working day  then the next time you check  you will need to adjust accordingly and possibly putting more,btohqsg
I agreed 150k can be quite a big amount. So 300k for a couple I see it is overkill. So I just pool the money together in a joint account. This is the family emergency fund.,btohqsg
Depend on what stage a pax is at. 150k actually not alot,btohqsg
So if my salary crediting is on 28th for example  i have 100k base  say salary of 3k  i must to transfer out 2500 by end of the month  so my balance show 100 500 on 1st of the following month to qualify?If i forgot to transfer out then my MAB = 103 000? And following month must have 103 500 and above to achieve the interest?,btohqsg
It can be one of the first goal post to aim for. Then with spare cash  they can look into investing for other sources of income. The important is you have a back door if anything happens,btohqsg
So basically if its a non business day (PH  saturday and sunday) it doesn‚Äôt count is it? Then following business day must add $500 more? Is that what you mean?,btohqsg
Maybe first you need to understand what is MAB?,btohqsg
Other than UOB one account  I use trust account as they don‚Äôt have tier interest rate. This will be my account where i can move funds in and out and yet it still earn decent returns. With up to 3% cover up to 500k. You have that flexibility.,btohqsg
If 1st is a public holiday  you need to add more than 500 since technically you have lesser days for the MAB to be 500,btohqsg
Depends on your time horizon on when you want to hit the milestone. For many  it‚Äôs hard to hit with purely employment income so investment is gonna come in place even before hitting 100K or more,btohqsg
Yap. We can use t-bills and FD to help to accelerate the saving process. The important is start early. My regret is I only learn all these  close to 50.,btohqsg
Called them  they say need wait 14 working days for new customer,btohqsg
