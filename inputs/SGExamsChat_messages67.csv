Even tho i alr exceeded my cal intake by 300,btohqsg
No matter what I eat I can't get fat rip,btohqsg
They hinder my ability to max out ippt,btohqsg
I eat like 3 plates of rice,btohqsg
And I still have semi abs,btohqsg
A) ice pack ur stomach. Idk if it's healthy but it worksB) dietC) if nothing works then it's ur genetics,btohqsg
John smith actually looks hella skinny,btohqsg
Cold burns fats faster than heat. Bio 101,btohqsg
U wanna join ur buddy tmr for zoom,btohqsg
No thank you I have rsaf homework,btohqsg
I do that I lost part of my fats,btohqsg
did you know ice has negative calories,btohqsg
Now my 6 pac gone  but can still see pac outline,btohqsg
Was wondering how you know him,btohqsg
I wont go into the mechanics of fatloss,btohqsg
My family would judge me fkr putting ice on my stomach LOL,btohqsg
U have a higher chance of,btohqsg
But I one meal can easily eat 3 plates of rice plus meat and veg then why am I still skinny rip,btohqsg
I tried calculating calories intake for awhile to facilitate weight loss but ugh gave up when prelims came,btohqsg
Plus my genetics fucked  all either obese or have health problems,btohqsg
Binge eating became way of life,btohqsg
Yes you‚Äôre a fkr if you do that,btohqsg
Looks like u hit the lottery then,btohqsg
Considering ure skinny as u say,btohqsg
Skinny doesn‚Äôt mean no health prob From overeating hor,btohqsg
I highkey scared I gonna get heart attack tmr with all the chips I've been eating lol,btohqsg
Muscle cells were a topic i avoided all my life,btohqsg
Look at those abominations for a cell,btohqsg
What in the fk am i looking,btohqsg
Net calories burned is higher than u exercise in non thermoregulation inducing cold,btohqsg
For the same period of time,btohqsg
It doesnr have to be scorching,btohqsg
So it's better to exercise in heat la,btohqsg
Unless u in sub zero climate for a prolong period,btohqsg
U work in heat burns more calories,btohqsg
Coz thermoregulation to make u sweat burns far more calories than being in non freezing cold,btohqsg
Today is a good day to learn,btohqsg
Also any h2 phy peeps can help me in the alevel grp,btohqsg
sorry :') I'm from arts stream,btohqsg
Can see his question over at@SGExamsStudiesAs,btohqsg
and the first lesson is lit,btohqsg
then like the weather is damn good for slping,btohqsg
it was hell to drag myself out of bed,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a great weather to be a blanket sushi,btohqsg
"An NUS student who molested a woman and got probation due to his ""potential to excel in life"" has had his sentence overturned. He will go to jail.https://cna.asia/2zyFgLk",btohqsg
he got his desserts I guess,btohqsg
how bout my man nicholas lim tho,btohqsg
chanric is in eusoff hall dafk,btohqsg
my man‚Äôs fight for monica baey has paid off,btohqsg
he‚Äôs in eusoff hall for the past year i think,btohqsg
iirc those who are on the higher end of autism are exempted from NS,btohqsg
but he just took his As last year,btohqsg
so ya he went nus after jc,btohqsg
so fast get uni spot alr,btohqsg
Wasn't it obvious he'd be exempted,btohqsg
maybe he‚Äôs just posing like he‚Äôs in eusoff idk,btohqsg
but he's a smart lad tbh,btohqsg
who knows maybe one of you go eusoff hall this year orientation can see chanric as a clan head,btohqsg
That's the thing with people with autism,btohqsg
their iq damn high but eq low,btohqsg
The IQ/EQ divide is pushed to a maximum degree,btohqsg
more like how in the world,btohqsg
eusoff is a hall i think,btohqsg
maybe he start up his own pro-jc club in the hall,btohqsg
Meh he'll be two years my senior,btohqsg
I probably won't interact much with him,btohqsg
later we see chanric in NUS,btohqsg
imagine being chanric‚Äôs roommate and you are from poly,btohqsg
it will be hell for chan,btohqsg
is that like 35 posts of monica baey,btohqsg
Well john  someone's fighting with you for senior wrangler,btohqsg

There is no cause for worry.,btohqsg
I'm more focused on the super human interview 2,btohqsg
üôÑ Singaporean guys very tiko not surprised,btohqsg
Do yall actually wanna do exercise tgt,btohqsg
We at SGExams promote healthy living for students,btohqsg
Skali those people in sgeducators see this msg,btohqsg
Unfortunately someone else has already done so,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure that won‚Äôt stop them from making another rip off though,btohqsg
"""To clarify  this is a ground-up initiative started by teachers and students and is not affiliated to or endorsed by the Ministry of Education!1!1!111!""",btohqsg
lmao they just added me in there,btohqsg
hAHAHA IF THEY DID IT I'LL BE WHEEZING,btohqsg
that's what i saida about sgnsfw,btohqsg
"Hahaha then the ""gerlyn"" man will send those explicit stickers",btohqsg
Oh wow I thought they‚Äôll never let go of misleading Moe endorsement,btohqsg
"totally a ""safe space to get psychological or emotional support for exams or other student issues""",btohqsg
Actually if they post NSFW stickers in there  by right can report to the police right?,btohqsg
Guess we‚Äôre filing another police report then,btohqsg
Telegram itself doesn't allow pornography in group chats  so mass report and they can block the group for pornographic distribution,btohqsg
this one is report group to telegram or report to admin,btohqsg
I got perm muted for reporting the group for pornography and saying it using my alt account,btohqsg
That‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs watching this group,btohqsg
Just like how one watches the dressing room with a spycam,btohqsg
I thought this was a metaphor,btohqsg
If I phrased it as a metaphor I could be sued for defamation,btohqsg
No one knows the identity of John Smith,btohqsg
Can't sue a person if you don't know who he is,btohqsg
I swear this would‚Äôve been useful material for a module that just concluded,btohqsg
It‚Äôs titled: Living and Dying in the Internet Age,btohqsg
Now I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs doing this for profit or because it‚Äôs fun,btohqsg
What in the world did I just see,btohqsg
The true colours of a busy student,btohqsg
so basically satire is an excuse to smear shit all over my face  spit on all your shoes and push people into marina bay for literally no reason whatsoever,btohqsg
last time i heard that line some blond guy walked into a japanese suicide forest,btohqsg
Honestly  no point trying to engage him,btohqsg
we alr do but sure idm,btohqsg
He means he does zoom pt with his section,btohqsg
Maybe you should change your privacy settings so that others can't add you to groups randomly,btohqsg
He's got a lot of time,btohqsg
Yup probably sad and unemployed and earning -10k,btohqsg
so busy he's spending his time in the best way possible,btohqsg
i feel attacked by this statement,btohqsg
and running dozens of telegram groups,btohqsg
Found the man behind busy student,btohqsg
alright i'll fess up it's me,btohqsg
cause i don't have finals to study for,btohqsg
guys any alevel private candidates here who gonna retake h2 phy,btohqsg
Gd pm day 56 of CB plz take care of urself n femily. Oni go out when needed  dun be ccb who no wear mask later kenna fine. Gobless pls dun go keesiao,btohqsg
Then good luck when u get a level results,btohqsg
They aren't testing every migrant worker,btohqsg
Cause if one person is from a dorm with like a 90% infection rate you that same person has symptoms,btohqsg
They won't bother testing him but just throw them into the isolation facility,btohqsg
And they don't count it in the numbers,btohqsg
thats actually the strategy in sweden,btohqsg
they are banking on the herd immunity strategy,btohqsg
scientists there actually calculate the estimated amount of people to get infected before it stops spreading,btohqsg
Basically get everyone immune to it asap right,btohqsg
so life is still per normal there,btohqsg
i think it‚Äôs good tho  cause reduce the chances of re-infection especially if you want to open up the economy asap,btohqsg
its like one of those kill 1 person to save the rest dilemmas,btohqsg
https://www.npr.org/2020/04/26/845211085/stockholm-expected-to-reach-herd-immunity-in-may-swedish-ambassador-sayshttps://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-sweden-defends-plan-not-to-lock-down-immunity-2020-4for anyone interested to read on this controversial strategy,btohqsg
That‚Äôs assuming ppl get immunity though,btohqsg
Wasn‚Äôt there cases where ppl got reinfected,btohqsg
yeap herd immunity for covid-19 is still a theory because there is no evidence for it. people do in fact get re-infected  but i think there is definitely higher resistance against it. sweden is at the forefront of this strategy so we will know whether it works or not in the coming few months,btohqsg
if it doesnt then everyone there gets a participation medal  if it does then they may be on a path to economic recovery much faster than other nations,btohqsg
Lmao PW result over email and phone call.Phone rings: HalloTeacher: Your PW result is ...You can‚Äôt tell your teacher ‚ÄúWait 5min! I need mental preparation‚ÄùEmail: Project Work ResultsEmail Provider: That‚Äôs spam.,btohqsg
