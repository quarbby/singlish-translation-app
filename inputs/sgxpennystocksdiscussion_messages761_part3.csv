🎉Pika World Daily Review – 14 Feb 2023🎉🥃A green day ahead of CPI data💰The equity market rose on Monday as it tried to put away the past week's losses and start the week with a firm footing. However  the optimism before CPI data is dangerous as it built a lot of expectations ahead of the data release.As we have seen  the strong showing in Nasdaq this week is built on the foundation that inflation is moderating consistently. This helps to alleviate the worry of the aggressive rate hike that had to dominate traders' minds in 2022.Nonetheless  we are mindful of being cautious ahead of the data.🧸Increasing number of news signalling worsening inflation🎯While the CPI data can be anyone's guess  more news reports are portraying that the inflation reading could be ugly; indeed  if there is a U-turn in the reading  showing any form of an uptick in inflation  the animal spirit of short-selling could scale up  unleashing massive downward dive of major index.We are still seeing stubborn stickiness in food prices. Likewise  gasoline prices have gone up in January. All these point to some worries. We could not escape from our long position and will be riding through this volatile period 📮What are our dishes today?📖At 9.30 pm  the long waited for CPI data for (MoM) is expected to accelerate from 0.1% to 0.5%.On a YoY basis  we expect it to fall from 6.4% to 6.2%.After which  12.30 am will see  FOMC Member Harker will speak  and at 3.05 am  FOMC member William will also deliver a speech.Given the CPI release and FOMC members' speeches  expect a constant swing in the market.It is 14 Feb  Tuesday  8.45 am in Singapore and 7.45 pm in New York. We shall catch up upon the data release.From your lovely newsdesk friend Pika Nat,btohqsg

SATs🚚🍱 $2.93 -2.333% ($3 break shall zhao) chart show that its current strong support is at 2.65.. but sellers are in control for past week.  Rights issue price has not been disclosed  but should hoover around the support area.Buy zone is between 2.49 and 2.65  if it ever break down toward that zone. Don't expect FY2023 to be profitable as its nine months loss had exceeded $33 million. Don't expect any dividend either.,btohqsg
