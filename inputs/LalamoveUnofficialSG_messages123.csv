I think best is to share their profiles and trips here so that other driver‚Äôs are aware too.,btohqsg
Actually just by trips would suffice. üòÖ,btohqsg
Why not just call Grab? ü§î,btohqsg
Grab might be more expensive and maybe need our help to helo him load up n unload his place,btohqsg
I took because it would be a waste of the trip if i go empty handed...but i rate him 2 stars,btohqsg
LLM pay ≈úhit money la guys lol,btohqsg
Take more in fees  and then cutting down without base fares. I wonder what they‚Äôll do next. ü§î,btohqsg
What's other alternative to LLM then if I'm using car?,btohqsg
By doing this  you are encouraging customers to abuse us,btohqsg
Agree lol. That‚Äôs why alternative just do grab,btohqsg
Cannot fit just message lala tell cannot fit cancel order ask them order van deliver. Take photo of the product.,btohqsg

They have been taking advantage on us day by day especially those drvng van. Can Lala do smeting bout it? Or can we suggest to penalise de cust whom trying to 'cheat'.....,btohqsg
Llm will not give you any chance if customers complain ...once i was late  for 30 minutes and they deduct the full amount so its delivery for free...,btohqsg
I doubt that they will take actions on the customers for its a customer base service,btohqsg
Even other courier service companies are using llm so you can imagine how cheap that is...,btohqsg
No need to boycott all...just give those with timings like food a miss..,btohqsg

Free labour + free petrol burnt = üí∏,btohqsg
Those doing llm with big cars are for different reasons ..Some to learn driving and routes at the same time get paid for the fuel ...some to teach their kids that earning a living is hard work...,btohqsg
That Mazda 2 is just an illustration of size for 20 kgs and nothing else. It happened to be in front of me..certainly not trying to insult anyone here...sorry if have have offened anyone...,btohqsg

@thoseyao gui who accept those multi-drop offs with no base price...wait the F up until the sender gives priority fees la! So kan chiong for?!,btohqsg
People wan do also ur problem aiyo...,btohqsg
That's why LLM can get away with lowering prices because people still choose to do those low paying orders spoil market lor,btohqsg
Bobian ma.. every platform is like that now..,btohqsg
Either fight to survive or sink,btohqsg
I do lala also do during free time. Got fare is more then enough alr.,btohqsg
Sometimes we cannot fault those who take it. But I agree with your opinion. That‚Äôs why they are called scavengers. Gives the other drivers opportunity to take those better trips after. I have even resulted to stacking orders. Coz if they don‚Äôt care  why should I? ü§£,btohqsg
That's what I said... fight it or die only..,btohqsg
I totally understand Bro. I never detest your opinion. üòá,btohqsg

Hello all... Wanted to ask for some opinions esp the full timers.I did Lalamove last year and could manage ~20-30/hr. Heard now it's been on a downtrend? Wanted to ask whether it's still worth to do dispatch for llm,btohqsg
Cause there was always high demand surcharge during lunch and dinner,btohqsg
During peak surcharge... Go town and wait to stack. Maximize the waiting time of 30mins.,btohqsg
Non peak u can take multistop. Then stack along the way,btohqsg
What's the hourly rate now? On average ?,btohqsg
I heard lala lwoered the base fare lol,btohqsg
net meaning like minus the estimated maintenance parking petrol etc,btohqsg
Gross.. but still depends on individual or how chiong,btohqsg
ahh ok thanks so much for sharing :),btohqsg
Guys if round trip they should add in the return address also right?,btohqsg
thats if they don't add round trip and it becomes a multi stop,btohqsg
round trip is $4 and ur return address is the pickup location,btohqsg
Already stated round trip. So $8 is included in Ur fare bk to pu,btohqsg
I‚Äôve done round trip before and this i guess makes more sense and worth the trip üòÖ,btohqsg
This one more worth it then the other one u sent. Cos the customer didn't put the pickup point as drop-off.,btohqsg
Yes I guess that should be the way for round trip. If it‚Äôs just 2 stops then when you arrive and pick up at 2nd stop the app when tell you to complete your trip instead of telling you to proceed to return to your 1st stop,btohqsg
Guess this is some of the loopholes that benefit the client and not us,btohqsg
ü§∑ it's lalamove with stupid customers,btohqsg
Hi all I‚Äôm really new to this what does it mean click and collect ?,btohqsg
Click and collect counter at the drop off point store.,btohqsg

Guess many have encountered this situation  anyone can advise the best way to handle.,btohqsg
What is door to door service? Moving whole van of loads from one house to another like house movers for $26? Must be something I am missing.,btohqsg
All I can advise is just move on  the fare drop like siao.,btohqsg
I understand the fare dropped. The moving service guide is very unclear or blurr  dr 2 dr service for driver is free? Moving whole van of load for free is ridiculous.,btohqsg
Just cancel order if you think is ridiculous. Don't take it even if you are already there.,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion  any other ways of handling bros and sis?,btohqsg
"I encouter before. Wat i learned here is i will ask them to show me all de items they wanna shif. Frm where to where. If i tink its too much (like urs) i will ask for help. TRUST ME.....most cust will say this ""last time driver can do this"".....then u need to learn to counter bck wat theh said.

Is it a must to call every customer once accept order?My order kena cancelled when I already reached there. From acceptance order until arrive less than 20min. Live chat with LLM agent say no compensation because I didn't call customer. Even I show photo of my pickup point and time,btohqsg
Nth u can do. Llm expect us call every single customer,btohqsg
If u do 20 orders 1 day  1 month u need call 600 times,btohqsg
They expect our phone bill free,btohqsg
Even if they compensate u money  its only a bit only,btohqsg
If I call and customer never pick up or confirm on phone but still can rl. Then how,btohqsg
Send screenshot of the call u made to llm,btohqsg
Who say no use? I try before and it works,btohqsg
Not like they would care about walkers LOL,btohqsg
Honestly it depends on Cs also. If the lanjiao one u no chance alr,btohqsg

But $1? Don't think so $1 la maybe after completion they give full sum. Hope to know more about that too,btohqsg
"As much said there are still many drivers who took crazy orders...if its more than 30% extra of the listed weight i won't take...its not fair to other drivers ...the guy who ordered the delivery said that ""why others can take and you can't"" my reply was i dont like cheating or to be cheated of what that is due to me ...same as to other lalamove drivers",btohqsg
You should reply to that guy why so many people die but not you. HAHAHA ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg

Guy  beside the size there is something you need to take care of. Queen size need to dismantle before it can fit in your 2.4m van. Whether need to assemble the bed at drop off? Drivers with tools can do it but need to settle the cost before doing. Dismantle n assembling take out sometime depends on experience n model. Not all beds the same  example storage bed...,btohqsg
Llm hoping forever you dun received and cash outü§£üòÇ,btohqsg

Hi what is the best timing to start work for llm,btohqsg
If u are asking about specific timing of a day  I would say the best timing is around 11am-1pm and also around 5-7pm at areas like little India  jalan sultan or central areas etc,btohqsg
Basically the lunch and dinner delivery times,btohqsg
Tend to have more priority fee and if lucky high demand surcharge,btohqsg
Y'all tell me isn't this overloading and overweight? And if I'm right to charge additional for this delivery? And yet not my responsibility for the safety since they booked motorcycle. And it's heavy af,btohqsg
5-7pm erp timing also if weekdaysSo better choose job properly if not lugi,btohqsg
Weekdays 10am to 5pm at cbd is goodWeekends 12 noon to 7pm is goodAfter 7pm very little orders and hard to snatch,btohqsg

"Its no wise to ride with those stuff ...these kind of user are out to cheat...we are the loosers if anything happens to us we are LL...if anything happens to the things they are sending they will claim and llm is on their side not us as ""partner """,btohqsg
Yes certainly but its a real sad world now...people are so inconsiderate ...they are so selfish ..for a small amount of money they want others to take risks...,btohqsg
I have mentioned before  if it oversize and overweight  don't take the job even if you are there. Don't encourage them to abuse. Carry a small measuring tape and weigher if you can. Show llm it's overlimit and ask to cancel job. Ask customer to upsize,btohqsg
These days people just play with the app....Toa Payoh but send you to the forest...Bukit Batok ...but its actually 25 km away ....never say Sorry just said i will cancel it...like doing me a favour ....,btohqsg
