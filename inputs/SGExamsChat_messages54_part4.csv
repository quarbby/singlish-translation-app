Students this is called reparations in action,btohqsg

U can specialise in that under chem tho,btohqsg
physical chem doesn't appeal to me at all,btohqsg
These 2 majors dont complement each other,btohqsg

Cs and math makes more sense,btohqsg

Gonna see a philosophical math prof soon,btohqsg
Lots of hard core prof in math,btohqsg
Maths is just another face of philosophy,btohqsg

Just like how people choose to agree that govt has power over them,btohqsg
I cannot see my maths paper coz it doesnt exist,btohqsg
Maths and philosophy are both constructs,btohqsg
I cannot write on my maths paper coz my electrons and pens electrons repel,btohqsg
