I assume you are referring to the CRMC rewards point. I took a quick look at one of the tour. It seems to be operated by a travel agency. Personally  I would not use CRMC because of the likelihood to be excluded from the 10X rewards. For me  I would use Amaze  pair with OCBC 90n to pay for this tour. For info  there are better pairings mentioned in this channel.https://www.taomiala.com/,btohqsg

Anyone knows if we can use amaze card linked to citi rewards for gym membership recurring bull? Still can earn 10x rewards/ 4mpd? 🫢,btohqsg
Will it be beneficial to use this promo in 1 transaction online (ard S$3K) by using CRMC if max you can earn rewards is capped at S$1K per stmt month? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi all  is there a way to earn miles for car repair payments?,btohqsg
This promo is transactions charged to the card in foreign currency only would gain 3.25% until 30 Jun. So transactions in SGD is excluded.The short ans to your question is yes if your foreign currency spendings are one of the 10X categories.The Citi 10X rewards applies to qualifying types of spendings (note well that travel related spendings are excluded) regardless of currency of the spendings.E.g. If u spend ~USD 750 (foreign currency) in Apple USA online store and self-collect while u r there. The 3.25% cash rebate might not leave  you much benefits after factoring FX spread and admin fees. But u still can get 10X rewards point. The 10X rewards points to S$ ratio is about 2.27%.,btohqsg
its only worth to use dbs points from WWMC cards on miles for 4mpd right?,btohqsg
Depends if u got any other cardI only got one credit card so might as well,btohqsg
Ok. Yes the spending will be in foreign currency and not-travel related. If let’s say it’s shopping for a shoe and bag store so by right shd qualify for 10x rewards.My issue is if the spend is >$1K (in SGD equivalent). If the store allows  will it be better to charge the other amt to DBS altitude or DBS WWMC (linked to Amaze)? Thanks,btohqsg
Thank you so much for this By the way 👌,btohqsg
