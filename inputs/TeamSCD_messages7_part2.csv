try my luck here  anyone having high engine oil consumption and if i shld consider overhaul or have a look at replacing valve stem seal. no power loss currently  thats the weird thing.,btohqsg
By how much u service  u found that your engine need engine oil top up?,btohqsg
1 mth can top up 1L,btohqsg
My experience is. Change head gasket first  still need top  then means need overhaul,btohqsg
pcv valve replaced. 11yo ba haha,btohqsg
haha i guess overhaul is in range of 2-3k la,btohqsg
Jap car still ok. When u need overhaul for a conti then cry,btohqsg
thks thks. will see hw  cuz coolant never burn off also  head gasket might be ok. suspect either worn piston rings or valve stem seal lo,btohqsg
