Now I have truly seen it all. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Can i see for lalamove van 1.7m 8hrs job can get how much?,btohqsg
Pre Covid - $350 easilyPost Covid - $250 longer hours,btohqsg
PHV 8hrs from a fren of mine said $25012hrs is $300,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I say longer hours mahh? ü§£,btohqsg
Depends on the number of hours you commit lor?,btohqsg
Sure tired if want make decent amt,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA! Plus the jam and what not. Haven‚Äôt include passengers who have different kinda patterns. ü§£,btohqsg
If you got PHV  can always give it a try. But if you‚Äôre young ( less than 40 years old )  I suggest don‚Äôt do. Better build your CPF. Agreed money you don‚Äôt see  but in the long run. It‚Äôs for a roof over your head.,btohqsg
Only if your bike is fast...,btohqsg
Yes must be at least 50km so that it make sense can do more delivery within the time frame,btohqsg
Bike do llm can make decent money as costs from petrol n parking is way lower than car. But is tougher cos ride bike exposed to the weather conditions. But it's give and take lor. Car more comfortable but prices bad n costs high,btohqsg
Anyone got mission today and tmr,btohqsg
We can only take 2 order a time how to earn money like that. lol.,btohqsg
Sorry I‚Äôm new here hope to learn more.,btohqsg
Quit early before u face further disappointment,btohqsg
So lucky. Must be only to new drivers ba.,btohqsg
Best advice to u  if u drive car  just quit lalamove if u planning to do full time,btohqsg
last time when i new to lalamove i rent car and work lalamove at the end not even earn single cent plus loss money somemore.,btohqsg
now even difficult and tough because cannot take more than one job hahaha,btohqsg
Then only can do it part time lo.,btohqsg
Sad case. I tot lala move can make money. Haha.,btohqsg
Grab confirm better. No need load and unload. Find parking. Drive car summore need risk illegal parking sometimes,btohqsg
Ya lo. Cb lala think erp n parking free,btohqsg
Wah rent car even more jialat,btohqsg
No ah  they already write say the fees r included in the price liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
You driving car to do huh,btohqsg
Fare low still needs to pay parking. Stupid one never think for driver,btohqsg
Hi senior  can i know how long will it take to credit into my bank if I cash out today? Thanks bosses,btohqsg
Hi all just   just wanna check have anyone experience  customer claimreceiver received parcel but inside open empty item missing  assume rider open and wish to make a report,btohqsg
They claim against lalamove  have insurance up to few hundred$ only.U don‚Äôt need to interact with the customer directlyWait get scammedU just wait for lalamove deduct ur wallet only‚Ä¶ lolThen appeal if they even let uSadly this is the SOP  no other way,btohqsg
Understand‚Ä¶ thank you so much. Cuz they say want make police report   I say ok cuz I never take nothing to worry.. thanks for sharing the info ya,btohqsg
Tell them to email lalamove.Offical black and whiteThe way they put it feels like they are out to scam your money. Either the sender or receiver deceive sender pushing blame to u.,btohqsg
Is it just me or lately (this few days) the jobs and prices are getting more and more shitty,btohqsg
I do lalamove for 1 week using car and i quit hahaha price only cover petrol and cashcard but not rental üòÅ,btohqsg
Rent car do llm is worst thing to do,btohqsg
Nowadays only can do if you‚Äôre on the way or really need money,btohqsg
Planing to do PHV part time,btohqsg
I have full time job just that want to try  lalamove part time i did i rent out car weekly 455$ than do LLM weekly earning is $510 so to me is not worth it,btohqsg
I thought like can get $1k for weekly at least i can earn abit üòÇ,btohqsg
For LLM like 10pm the job slow already,btohqsg
Maybe ill try out Van see how soon,btohqsg
Just testing out which side hustle is can earn one,btohqsg
This is part time after full time job btw for those want to know roughly,btohqsg
And i did stack 2 at times,btohqsg
It doesnt make sense u rent a ‚Äúfull‚Äù time vehicle to work part time job  no side hustle can double the revenue and let u take home profitU were basically looking for min. $20 per drop which is not possible,btohqsg
37 X $20 = $740And even then after petrol u only take back $100 for all that effort  around 15 hours,btohqsg
My motive was try not to touch on my main income that‚Äôs all since i have to use my main income for petrol i find it cannot la,btohqsg
Tough lahh Bro. Maybe can do LLM when raining or peak. Other than that. Do full time  confirm not worth it.,btohqsg
Yea maybe LLM i will do on peak timing like what the other guys share me i will take note on that,btohqsg
