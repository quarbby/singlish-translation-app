Nth personal in whatever i said jn,btohqsg
Except the pan frying JH part@junghon3709,btohqsg
Imo i also dont support contact wearing devices also,btohqsg
Imagine if technological warfare was a thing today  whole sg would be dead wearing that.,btohqsg
How is it not a thing,btohqsg
By technological warfare  i mean that tech can kill ppl literally,btohqsg
The device takes over the wrg,btohqsg
Dynkin Diagram  I feel like you're extremely pro-PAP. Not saying if that's a good or bad thing but let's not accuse people of all sorts of things alright? A sovereign  really? Based on the description for that I could have you for slander.,btohqsg
Yes  yes  I am extremely pro-PAP  because I have been in this group for about 2 years and have been spreading pro-PAP propaganda,btohqsg
Aiyo how can u deduce that based on this opinion only,btohqsg
Also I fail to see what you 'can have me for slander',btohqsg
Theres bound to be ppl who agree/disagree to new government initiatives,btohqsg
Understood. Go ahead and continue  alright?,btohqsg
Aiyo dun drama la... now 11pm,btohqsg
I've literally never been so approved in my life,btohqsg
Calling me a sovereign  where someone just got shamed for being a sovereign after that one video went viral,btohqsg
I've not called you a sovereign but ok,btohqsg
I can see that you have associated magical acts,btohqsg
When you submit your evidence to the Courts,btohqsg
Im sorry i used that word  i nvr meant it srsly and im sorry if i have upset you.,btohqsg
I'm not out here to fight with people but yeah pls respect my opinions thanks,btohqsg
Sorry about that  I realised... its alright,btohqsg
It depends on how defensible opinions are,btohqsg
Nothing big I'm just ruffled by the whole wearing device thing also,btohqsg
You realised that I slandered you!?,btohqsg
Eh dun fan the flame alrd la,btohqsg
This kind of small things dunnid argue one,btohqsg
Like I said... im not here to fight,btohqsg
Party all day and party all night,btohqsg
Just go with the flow i guess,btohqsg
But its sad it all came down to this,btohqsg
Will they make it a law to force us to wear it?,btohqsg
Which other country affected by covid has done the same?,btohqsg
Tbh if the tracker has a step tracker and a heartbeat sensor  I would wear it ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Which other country's ruling party can afford heavy political prices and eventually not need to pay it at all?,btohqsg
Maybe it's already within current law,btohqsg
Honestly I'd put my bets on it being current law and they just need to decide to use it or not,btohqsg
Or maybe in our pockets instead?,btohqsg
It can be anything  but I doubt it'd involve injection into the fingers,btohqsg
I have literally no idea what making people in US wear shit the government dictates actually buys,btohqsg
by 'buy' I mean  what additional help would it be to public health?,btohqsg
What can US do additionally with that kind of information?,btohqsg
Do the senators give a shit?,btohqsg
CN  they are already using a traffic light system for all citizens,btohqsg
It being wearable or not probably makes little difference,btohqsg
I don't even know if you can exist without a traffic light,btohqsg
Maybe you'll just disappear if you're not on the traffic light system,btohqsg
I actually dont get what it means,btohqsg
I don't understand what I need to explain,btohqsg
If you dont mind could u paraphrase,btohqsg
