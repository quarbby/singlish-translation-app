o levels really said copy paste yo,btohqsg
Ya lol some more is same question number,btohqsg
i dont rmb this in tys but for some reason still got it correct,btohqsg
That one is one of the easier qns in the paper tho,btohqsg
in the end i lost 7 marks,btohqsg
quite impressed with that id say,btohqsg
So I guess it isnâ€™t rly helpful as to whether I did past year tys papers cos the answer is quite obvious,btohqsg
an improvement frm the 15 marks i lost in prelims,btohqsg
i also did all the 10 years,btohqsg
The similar qn was from 2018,btohqsg
oh i didnt do 2009 lol too lazy,btohqsg
So maybe if you did the newer ones first then thatâ€™s why u forgot,btohqsg
Wanted to do even more years but didnâ€™t have the papers,btohqsg
Meanwhile chem Tys I only did like 2 years,btohqsg
i finished chem way faster than physics,btohqsg
maybe bc chem is my better science,btohqsg
Oh well I managed to get soft copy of2014-2019,btohqsg
I did 2017 and 18 only so I guess Iâ€™ll just do those 3 remaining as practice,btohqsg
i think even touch my chem tys lmao,btohqsg
ok person that flexed their biology on someone,btohqsg
cos i forgot whr i placed it lmao ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Is that what youâ€™re implying? Hahaha,btohqsg
nope :_ im implying i lost it ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Cfm get karma 2 yrs ltr for A lvl chem,btohqsg
I'm gonna assume it was sent accidently and delete the pic@jianjun21,btohqsg
Just sharing the trending MBS Pics,btohqsg
Oh okay rip cos I couldn't see any context to it,btohqsg
Plus it revealed people's faces so...,btohqsg
telegram is here for a reason,btohqsg
im talking with friends elsewhere rn,btohqsg
this kind of shit nudging me to make tele group with the ppl i talk with sia,btohqsg
if the server just dies in the middle of a convo,btohqsg
meh  i guess i shall wait till it comes back,btohqsg
Does this lady look like sheâ€™s about to get a stroke?,btohqsg
Why is her face so asymmetrical,btohqsg
Why the hell u tag me,btohqsg
He didnt know u date sec sch girls mah,btohqsg
U wish to date sec sch girls uh,btohqsg
U know i was being sarcastic...,btohqsg
Who is this girl called physics,btohqsg
Like i said before only Fuzzy is the true chem god,btohqsg
U can contact me using telegram,btohqsg
01001001 00100000 01101100 01101111 01110110 01100101 00100000 0111001,btohqsg
Or ur message to ur crush,btohqsg
How is it similar to mine,btohqsg
He set a big brain binary number,btohqsg
For us to find out his true love,btohqsg
You are neurotic  you have a problem with your mind  and your IQ is lower than the temperature here,btohqsg
His IQ is lower than 298?,btohqsg
The binary code is the iq number,btohqsg
"The binary just says ""I love science""",btohqsg
I have always had it lol,btohqsg
Mine has been scinece since two years ago,btohqsg
Was kumar top for everything in sec sch,btohqsg
So where is shu fei now,btohqsg
No wonder kumar does H3 physics,btohqsg
Eh kumar  take a look at a level chat  see if it's correct,btohqsg
I am not a chem god,btohqsg
How dare u push everything to fuzzy,btohqsg
Running away because itâ€™s too bright on him,btohqsg
Haiz paper 3 literature yesterday was pure cancer,btohqsg
Any arts stream J2 here wants to talk? Feel like discussing life in general,btohqsg
I ate a sour mango and got headache,btohqsg
Owh and panadol is not working well,btohqsg
I somehow find the panadol in Singapore not very effective...I usually take Panadol sold in HK or the UK,btohqsg
I bought malaysia panadol from hospital,btohqsg
My grandmother would buy like 7 packets of panadol for 30 rm,btohqsg
Never try sg panadol before. Is there any difference?,btohqsg
The panadol from Singapore should be made in Australia. The panadol in the UK and HK is made in Ireland/UK. I feel that there is a difference  perhaps the formula is different,btohqsg
If thereâ€™s an econs mcq question saying: which component is not included in current account balance of payment?If thereâ€™s an option: rent paid to owners of land in another country,btohqsg
I thot it was quite tricky,btohqsg
Nah not really. I was just too stupid to get the answers correct,btohqsg
I meant compared to the others taking it,btohqsg
apparently someone pulled a nessa barrett in the midst of the exam,btohqsg
The first line of the post,btohqsg
i saw the comment on reddit,btohqsg
The paper was so easy to them that they just relaxed and shitted,btohqsg
Nothing is easy for me in olvl econs,btohqsg
To both shitting and it being easy,btohqsg
Shitting in exam is politically incorrect tho,btohqsg
does anyone know which is more useful  KI or h2 geog,btohqsg
econs is just common sense made tough,btohqsg
my geog is O lvl Geog,btohqsg
that'll be me next year !!,btohqsg
but who knows what's gonna happen,btohqsg
pessimistic thinking means no crushed dreams,btohqsg
if it float your boat then i guess,btohqsg
I doubt that one is more useful than the other lol.,btohqsg
either u like it and are bad at it,btohqsg
or ur good but find it boring asf,btohqsg
u dont have to copy if u can appreciate econs in real life,btohqsg
i barely touched my econs notes until before a lvls,btohqsg
yeah it wasnt that bad for me,btohqsg
but i mostly did external stuff,btohqsg
the school stuff... v dry hor,btohqsg
yep same  but i hated econs,btohqsg
like uh in future or gg uni and like,btohqsg
no offence but u seem way smarter,btohqsg
bcs i am stuck on what to take,btohqsg
ki seems super interesting but i rly love geog,btohqsg
If u might want to go UK  note that some UK unis do not accept KI as a legit subject,btohqsg
i thought KI replaces ur humans if ur sci stream,btohqsg
okay okay but i wanna study sg so it shld be okkk,btohqsg
for hybrid stream do they use sci stream cutoff or art stream cutoff?,btohqsg
i thought KI always replaces contrasting- i'm not sure though,btohqsg
scary idk what other arts to take apart from geog,btohqsg
KI is a valid contrasting for both arts and science combinations  but if you take hybrid then there is no need for a contrasting,btohqsg
KI would count as an arts subject,btohqsg
So you could take Geog  KI and 2 sciences,btohqsg
Should check what combinations the school offers though,btohqsg
omg tysm i actl didn't know that wtf,btohqsg
oh i get what u mean now okays,btohqsg
Depends I think  my school allows all students from either stream to take hybrid,btohqsg
i think i was abit confused ill look into that then under hybrid stream !,btohqsg
NY allows arts stream to take science combination,btohqsg
wait may i ask what sch are you hahrifjeifn,btohqsg
NYJC has free subject choice  so you can just go arts stream and pick 3 sciences,btohqsg
ohh ya i always heard ac has alot of weird combis,btohqsg
ACJC also has free subject choice  but you canâ€™t do that,btohqsg
ill look thr for hybrid thenðŸ¤©,btohqsg
We have like 10 hybrid classes every batch,btohqsg
but if i was to take ki and geog  wld it be better to take math over phy? if i was doing chem,btohqsg
Do you have a uni course in mind?,btohqsg
i was considering vet in melbourne/nusbut there's rlynot much info in it that i can find,btohqsg
That makes it risky to not take 2H2 sciences  cause many courses are gated by 2H2 science,btohqsg
If you are confident you wonâ€™t want to go to such courses  then feel free to consider KI and geog  but if not then try not to take such a combination,btohqsg
U need to be the top 5% in nus life science to even qualify  which is tough tbh,btohqsg
So amongst 300 students in life science  u need to be top 15 on the bell curve,btohqsg
only go into vet if u are passionate,btohqsg
being a vet is career ending for most,btohqsg
i guess i'll go for geog bcs it seems easier to score,btohqsg
ya i know that part & not much career progression,btohqsg
i heard KI there aren't much resources?,btohqsg
If u got passion just go for vet manz,btohqsg
whereas doctors say being doctor cannot earn much smh,btohqsg
lfucking 6 essays in 3h and,btohqsg
i find lorms essays in o's v fun hahsha,btohqsg
if its anyth like that it sounds fun,btohqsg
u take core geog or elect,btohqsg
memorized like 50+ examples for only 3 plate tech qns,btohqsg
elect zz but i read abt core for fun !!,btohqsg
as bad as h2 bio yes,btohqsg
if u all take pure geog,btohqsg
elect ppr harder than core ppr????},btohqsg
WC IS THE MOST BORING OF ALL,btohqsg
h2 geog is basically 10x the content in pure geog,btohqsg
my p2 plate tech q easy,btohqsg
ok maybe my estimate a bit off  but is ard there,btohqsg
bcs i scared one of my factors not correct,btohqsg
i can only think 2 points related to that ah,btohqsg
like land use reg & tsunami monitoring,btohqsg
i wrote land use regulation  infrastructure  preparedness  then warning system ,btohqsg
tbh i cant think of any preparedness & infrastructure example,btohqsg
land use got the seawall oso,btohqsg
mb not accepted thats why i wrote it,btohqsg
i rmb the seawalls stuff can be built to deal w tsunamis,btohqsg
i put land use to build in low risk area and also areas higher than sea level,btohqsg
reduce potential ppl impacted by tsunami,btohqsg
like japan 2011 right they use seawalls,btohqsg
iirc i only rmb it being related to earthquake,btohqsg
so geog if u can memorize then shld be fine for h2 right,btohqsg
is just a test of memorisation,btohqsg
the tsunami lorms q restrictive oso,btohqsg
oh ya la thats a given tbh,btohqsg
i think this is easier than the elect geog tho,btohqsg
igeog is all logic (at least for o's),btohqsg
i took core and my yr was mangroves,btohqsg
NOO I MEMORISE MT PINATUBO GIVING OFF OVER 17MILLION TONNES,btohqsg
but i got to take back the coloured insert home,btohqsg
oh i did e lorms before,btohqsg
bcs like if solar radiation isn't on the sun whr else wld it be,btohqsg
but people thought the long term planning and infrastructure improvement is prep measures,btohqsg
i didnt understand the qn at all,btohqsg
isit long term or prep measures ah,btohqsg
didn't they say that the times w most solar activity corresponded to the highest annual temps,btohqsg
i was so sad they say its prep measures,btohqsg
coz i saw long term then i was like ok lemme write long term,btohqsg
iirc sunspots cause more solar radiation to be produced,btohqsg
so it compensates the loss of heat,btohqsg
tbh i learnt the hard way during prelim that,btohqsg
provision of healthcare oso bout planning mah,btohqsg
u mean orbit eccentricity of the sun ??,btohqsg
like u plan what to give,btohqsg
i dont want no e girl i wanna be e nough,btohqsg
what to do to help them deal w the trauma,btohqsg
they gave the word long term,btohqsg
if u see the q2 of my ppr,btohqsg
when i open my eyes... I SEE,btohqsg
Ur name reminds me of å¤œå¸‚äººç”Ÿ,btohqsg
i wished u did lit more,btohqsg
i see the comment q i was like fuck it,btohqsg
part e is obviously a strongly agree lmao,btohqsg
the landslide trend q hard oso,btohqsg
so i was like ok fuck q2,btohqsg
like what the fuck is there a relation between the magnitude & no of landslide,btohqsg
hello  may I know when the poly opens for o level students?,btohqsg
tbh im j happy i studied stalin for hist,btohqsg
and describe in detail 2 marks,btohqsg
the trend so weird sia HAHA so i was just like,btohqsg
the picture of the volcano w the caldera and the crater lake was so cute,btohqsg
i prob flunked my stats quiz,btohqsg
calculating probability of binomial distribution WITHOUT a GC!!,btohqsg
i hv like heard tales that nyjc & vjcâ€™s econs dept is q meh,btohqsg
tbh is quite unrealistic to expect all depts in a sch to be good,btohqsg
i forgot all my w&c stuff,btohqsg
like i heard ah  q a number of the teacher thr are like,btohqsg
ok im just gonna fixate content into ur head,btohqsg
and not teach u how to approach qns,btohqsg
got people say the essay involved prep measures,btohqsg
jc syllabus is just too hectic,btohqsg
if they spend time teachin approach  they risk students not knowin content well,btohqsg
but my jc focused more on approach towards the end,btohqsg
but i heard content ez for econs  but the qns are q hard to approach,btohqsg
i prefer to forget abt it,btohqsg
sure they are  until u stand at the very top of the volcano when it erupts,btohqsg
i can only do tropical cyclones,btohqsg
i was like eh u did q2 of the pure geog p2 ah,btohqsg
i will jus suicide @ my amath results lor,btohqsg
i practised sm yet my grades for amath went down the drain just like that <\3,btohqsg
Poly year 1 starts in April,btohqsg
Theres not going to be any more open houses rite,btohqsg
Can guys defer ns to retake As as a j3,btohqsg
sp gonna hv online open hse next yr,btohqsg
Probably cant make it in anyway no need think about it now,btohqsg
sp isnt that hard to get in as long as u arent doing as badly as i will do,btohqsg
Lmao why are u the baseline,btohqsg
So next year I need to ask u ur results to see if I can make it in?,btohqsg
oh then whr are u aiming for,btohqsg
i'll j go wherever i can,btohqsg
Next year u shd post to the sp website to help people decide if they can go in,btohqsg
i'm sure u will do btr than u think,btohqsg
So how many cockroaches were hiding below,btohqsg
There must be at least 4!!,btohqsg
do a few mcqs then just chill,btohqsg
i know q some of my content so its ok,btohqsg
chem mcq not content heavy more of trick questions like physics,btohqsg
the best way to prepare is to look back at the careless mistakes you made or do mcq and find the careless mistakes then go and jote down on one foolscap.,btohqsg
Well good luck  last paper tmr (other than combined science),btohqsg
I still have like 600 MCQ questions to do,btohqsg
Ye Idk if Iâ€™ll even finish,btohqsg
I dunno why I prepared so many questions then procrastinated all the way until now,btohqsg
Only metal conduct electricity via positive ions and free electrons,btohqsg
I thought there's positive ions in metals,btohqsg
There is cation at the cathode,btohqsg
And also electron reducing the cation at the cathode,btohqsg
Graphite only has mobile electrons.It cant have ions since it is a giant covalent compound.Copper has a giant metallic structure  thus fulfilling what the qn wants.,btohqsg
That's what I thought too. Only metals have both positive ions and mobile electrons,btohqsg
But in the electroysis graphite have positive ions and electrons too isn't it?,btohqsg
Although graphite has delocalised electrons the C atom electron orbitals are hybridised and the C atoms are not ions,btohqsg
Otherwise how is the cations being reduced,btohqsg
Shouldnt this be in the study grp btw,btohqsg
But i thot the electron come from the anion at the anode then down to the cathode?,btohqsg
But ya the electron flows thru the copper wire  enters the graphite cathode thru delocalisation and then gets transferred to the cations at the cathode,btohqsg
So it does have electrons during the process,btohqsg
Or is it my understanding abit weird,btohqsg
Bruh any more papers aft tmr??,btohqsg
Like maybe art paper 2 or smth like that,btohqsg
eh hi got anyone looking for discord nitro,btohqsg
In njc  whats the min requirement to qualify for H2 chem? Is it C6 or B3 in pure chem?,btohqsg
U be my secret buddy lor. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So u tell me in secret,btohqsg
lol now is not the period to be playin,btohqsg
nvm u hv 39 more hours,btohqsg
You wanted to go to some jv right i think,btohqsg
cant relate to ppl who found it easy,btohqsg
rotting in a large local institution,btohqsg
Bedok where do you wanna go btw,btohqsg
IMH is not institution of mental health,btohqsg
Farrer Park not same as farrer road,btohqsg
I ran from farrer road to farrer Park,btohqsg
lookin at ur guessin skills  may end up there at this rate,btohqsg
ya i was saying ME LOL,btohqsg
Is copper carbonate turquoise or green,btohqsg
Hahah i guess for such qns look out for more obvious wrong answers (:,btohqsg
Which is why donâ€™t skip options,btohqsg
I guess the publisher want us to think that CuCO3 is blue,btohqsg
I put the circle when i was doing it,btohqsg
U left mcq right? Then shouldnâ€™t be a concern but somehow therr write its blue LOL,btohqsg
I guess this is out of ur syllabus but apparantly many sources say that ull form basic copper(ii) carbonate,btohqsg
Nvm i shld choose the more correct answer,btohqsg
Basic copper carbonate is prepared by combining aqueous solutions ofcopper(II) sulfateandsodium carbonateatambient temperature and pressure. Basic copper carbonate precipitates from the solution  with release ofcarbon dioxide2 CuSO4 + 2 Na2CO3 + H2O â†’ Cu2(OH)2CO3 + 2 Na2SO4 + CO2,btohqsg
But some info in wiki might not be reliable or biased. Just take note.,btohqsg
Ok  all the best to you!,btohqsg
if u all tried my p3,btohqsg
solubility the ksp basic basic one,btohqsg
got mole calculation v tedious but only like 2 or 3 marks,btohqsg
had to make another equation but not sure if correct,btohqsg
i dont expect cambridge to test Ksp qns on mass of ppt produced,btohqsg
then got basic equation formation based on number of electrons (combine 2 eqn),btohqsg
then got combustion of smtg just form eqn they tell u pdts also,btohqsg
then got find the percentage of Ar thing,btohqsg
then CLT cancelled out 13marks so yay,btohqsg
idk i thought they say 67,btohqsg
is it normal for first qn to have 25m,btohqsg
i spent so much time on first qsn i panick and chiong second to stay within the 1hr for qsn range,btohqsg
wait I forgot wat they asked but which part took the longest,btohqsg
i was at qn 2 still at 9.10,btohqsg
then made up for lost time,btohqsg
that one i took extra paper to do,btohqsg
is it the one gotta construct extra eqn,btohqsg
o i finish q2 by 9 ddabb,btohqsg
eh the G and H one some ppl say its a symmetrical molecule,btohqsg
oh ya that one was q time consuming,btohqsg
i got G and H q easily but like,btohqsg
i js went w gut feeling,btohqsg
that's pretty much how the whole paper went for me,btohqsg
gut feeling to decide whether need check or not,btohqsg
I chose 5 cos I dk how to define,btohqsg
And idk how to define buffer also,btohqsg
How do u think u will do,btohqsg
time to run away from sciences in uni,btohqsg
Anyone who has the paper pls send :),btohqsg
