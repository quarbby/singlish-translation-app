Sapphire  price wise have flushed down for 15 days since the volume spike day where it hit a high of $0.062 on the 22nd Oct 2024.Do note that- it hit a strong support region and looks to be in consolidation at support- bull flag still intact- last several rounds of contra trading prior to the 22nd Spike  it was quite easy to sell at $0.06 region seems to suggest that BBs merely playing it dead to kill retailers with the liquidity removal flush game.- current at the edge of the more recent Dotted downtrend pressure line- MACD seems to be picking up strengthIMO  matter of time  it might come to life. Hopefully 🤞 sooner than later.DYODD/ OSOD. Not suitable for contra yet unless the volume comes suddenly.If unable to pick up  best not to buy as still illiquid too.
