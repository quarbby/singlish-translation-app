Anyway daily harness is not a good idea also la. You cannot lean in take cashcard  or check blindspot,btohqsg

macham asking what is rotary and piston engine,btohqsg
That time i do your intake,btohqsg
i think i saw is SOHC,btohqsg
but i dont dare to confirm cos i don't believe why a new car still have SOHC,btohqsg
The civic 1.8l is also sohc,btohqsg
your valve cover knn small and skinny,btohqsg
but i dont dare say it out,btohqsg
Cos SOHC is really fking old,btohqsg
but i guess it's a honda thing,btohqsg
SOHC is a 70s or 80s thing,btohqsg
in 90s ppl start to put in DOHC cos it makes more power and efficiency,btohqsg
Should i do 169 for decarboning?,btohqsg
I am a vintage car then,btohqsg
Need to ask honda pros why,btohqsg
Because I was pretty sure the FD were running sohc,btohqsg
Issit cos of Vtec or what,btohqsg
Basically vtec means at 5 500 rpm or whichever for your model or map  your engine switches cam profiles,btohqsg
Turns out it's the same engine,btohqsg
Vtec got for performance and for economy,btohqsg
So your air and fuel more can go in and u get higher compression,btohqsg
Ohh like Gerard one is 5+,btohqsg
Why is a rotary driver teaching u vtec u paiseh or not,btohqsg
Because they put k20s into rx7 overseas ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
What in the war is going on,btohqsg
Vtec is like having 2 displacements in one engine  1 for groceries and 1 for poking,btohqsg
Nah bro  who waste time with vtec for engine swap. Straight to 2jz for 1k bhp,btohqsg
So when your engine goes into vtec  it's not the same as a k20 going into vtec,btohqsg
Those no money one use k20,btohqsg
But put into rx7? From twin turbo to NA ah,btohqsg
But i also believe it's largely due to space too,btohqsg
6 cyl and 4 cyl's block very big diff in space,btohqsg
That time the hoonigan build and battle they took the vq out from the 370 and put a k24 into it,btohqsg
