i think theres some promising people,btohqsg
I bully my friend abt it,btohqsg
Like she don't actually take ah,btohqsg
people do not score for geog,btohqsg
I say she could have done it,btohqsg
do u know any of my classmates,btohqsg
our class chair geog top student last year,btohqsg
I've never heard of it in my life  wot kind of combi is that even,btohqsg
i wonder if there's any place that offers calculus/A math classes without needing to dedicate yourself to take the actual examI didn't take A math  now I regret it and want to learn some of it,btohqsg
I googled and there's no answer 💀,btohqsg
this year is the geog professor son,btohqsg

hes the other promising gp a student in A6,btohqsg
Ite gep programme but ehh hmm the Cher I got wasn't Moe certified so he missed out on abit of stuff but other than that   the basic fundamentals being covered is not bad but ofc you'll still have to do self-directed learning,btohqsg
bro was playing roblox a week before As,btohqsg
i didnt mean any negative connotation la,btohqsg
Oh didn’t know that was a thing  so you just translate from one language to another lmao??,btohqsg

I have my h3 on Monday and h2 on Wednesday,btohqsg
Yeah but thats just how ej works,btohqsg
But I don't wish to get cancelled xd,btohqsg
But yeah the problem with ite gep is that I don't like how they did math  it was like 16 classes where the teacher barely covered the topics then it was just slamming the TYS,btohqsg
people CANNOT be this fucking shit even at this age bro,btohqsg
not her la just in general,btohqsg
Now that's intriguing  lol all the more to spit it out amirite or amirite,btohqsg

Hmm- they can go to watch alot of like theatre productions FR- coursework subj- small class size -> more indiv attention ig?,btohqsg
and she told someone that she didnt rly wanna be president  she just needed it for portfolio,btohqsg
Er maybe it's a sign to deactivate,btohqsg
but she got it bc she spoke well at the rally,btohqsg
i doubt imran was like that,btohqsg
Thats cuz imran has a clear sense of identity and who he is as a person alr,btohqsg
i think the j2 batch didnt like her,btohqsg
WOT coursework subj? No way so it can replace PW?,btohqsg
but not by that time yet,btohqsg

But I think q chill also,btohqsg
everyone is in party mood for 1.5 years,btohqsg
then only when j2 mye comes people start studying,btohqsg
facilitated by the fact that ej has too many events,btohqsg
they recently had a haunted house in the sch,btohqsg
Believe it or not  I actually wanted to be a Secondary School Malay Teacher,btohqsg
tbh if ej people are partying  theyre damn lowkey ab it,btohqsg
i only hear people play damn hard,btohqsg
i mean if you dont really have much going on in your school youd probably die from boredom,btohqsg
these are all things that every sch has,btohqsg
get hit by a cloud of vape,btohqsg
east side schools competing to be the worst schools be like,btohqsg

I was his classmate for 4 years,btohqsg
i think i startled him last year then even niles came to me saying i had a rep among some j2s for having the biggest balls,btohqsg
i walked up to him right after ori asking about house captain and council,btohqsg
he was still tearing up too,btohqsg

you could probably make an entire shoujo anime out of it,btohqsg
All I do is study sia atp,btohqsg
and also cuz I had very bad rep at the start of J1,btohqsg
cuz people spread alot of shit abt me,btohqsg
I got so much shit to do,btohqsg

tbf i was q surprised by the performance of some people,btohqsg
I think geog could have been better,btohqsg
cuz alot of those that i predicted will get A didnt get A,btohqsg
i remember the geog cheer was sharing with me who he estimated can get A for geog,btohqsg
this is true for all the humans,btohqsg
then he ask me to confirm his predictions,btohqsg
but alot of people drop grade,btohqsg

C for As from A in prelims??,btohqsg
"for her gp paper 1 the examiner wrote on her script""Consider the view that your handwriting confuses more than informs"" cuz her gp qn was ""Consider the view that the media confuses more than informs""Then i think she barely passed cuz the examiner couldnt read her handwriting",btohqsg
