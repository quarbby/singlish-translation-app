wah shit sia ltr im the bottom in class when im in the btr sch,btohqsg
As long you have a good teacher you're in safe hands,btohqsg
At the end of the day everyone gonna take A lvl,btohqsg
wait so vj econs good rite,btohqsg
Big fish in a small pond  or small fish in a big pond,btohqsg
Unless you transfer to poly or drop out,btohqsg
Don't go to prestigious sch for fame,btohqsg
As if after doing two years of it it is so easy to do so...,btohqsg
Small fish in big pond might sometimes still be bigger than big fish in small pond,btohqsg
U just need to think straight for the next month,btohqsg
I'm so tired of hearing the pond analogy,btohqsg
On whether jc is right for u,btohqsg
i mean highlighting makes it easier,btohqsg
Why use the pond analogy when u can be the pond that swallows all?,btohqsg
i wanna be swallowed in the water in the sea,btohqsg
Wait if Iâ€™m more so focused on taking H3 chem I shld not do f math right,btohqsg
So in olvl you chose sea?,btohqsg
F math will take up a lot of time,btohqsg
Not any more than bio or physics,btohqsg
Like coz I only started liking math in sec sch,btohqsg
2 sub but honestly 1.5 sub workload,btohqsg
It's just a subject  I think chemistry will take up a lot more time,btohqsg
Not if u are actually bad in math,btohqsg
Alot of topics are just extensions of h2 math,btohqsg
You aren't doing f maths in addition  it is IN LIEU,btohqsg
Why ppl like to say chem spend so much time,btohqsg
Lmao i just see it as a normal subject,btohqsg
And just go in rekt paper only,btohqsg
i heard geog in jc p cancer tho,btohqsg
Thats why i took econs instead,btohqsg
like i heard the human geog is like,btohqsg
Geog content in a lvl is very heavy,btohqsg
Like honestly taking pure geog now ah,btohqsg
H1 geog is almost equal to h2 bio,btohqsg
And like the content is alr quite heavy,btohqsg
and i heard h2 geog is like,btohqsg
u need to make links or smth,btohqsg
If u cant memorise stuff well just do econs,btohqsg
Every subject needs u to do that,btohqsg
U can literally bring the book into the exam  with highlighting,btohqsg
i can memo but dk the content load i can cope anot,btohqsg
I felt jc was easier than sec sch,btohqsg
but a disadv is the q should be tougher,btohqsg
its either i take econs which i may not like,btohqsg
or i take geog which i end up dying in,btohqsg
Yes cause A levels is about applying knowledge,btohqsg
Ah i see a prelude into uni exam life,btohqsg
Economics is the way to go!,btohqsg
YOU CAN BRING THE WHOLE BOOK,btohqsg
Just that uni exam context even if can bring in the book  also WONT HELP HAHAHA,btohqsg
