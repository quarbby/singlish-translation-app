Usually if one use the OA for housing  it will be quite difficult to build SA to FRS? Unless one always VC every year and salary range is at the max cap I presume?,btohqsg
Hello  has anyone tried to wire USD into FTX recently? Given the recent change in beneficiary details for FTX  does anyone have any dp on whether the previous North Dimension related details still work?,btohqsg
Can you still useBinance.comfor their earn/staking feature?,btohqsg
last week dbs remit to north dimension  ftx acc received,btohqsg
All the stock prices fall down,btohqsg
How long does syfe trade welcome bonus take to come in?,btohqsg
Anyone here uses the SMART credit card? On the qualifying merchants like fast food and coffee   when will the additional points be awarded?,btohqsg
i stop using the OA to pay for my housing loan......and build up and doing top up for my SA,btohqsg
I have a co brand Amex card with Dbs ‚Ä¶ now I apply this Amex card   do I still get the welcome gift if I spent more than 500 $ ?,btohqsg
Buy some value growth stocks using DCA if can..,btohqsg
Yes. Cobrand cards with dbs or uob are not considered amex customer,btohqsg
Likewise  you are paying to dbs/uob during bill payment for these cobrand cards,btohqsg
If able to have extra cash  can do a cash refund to HDB to clear or bring down the OA amount used. Thereafter can transfer fr OA to SA. This is another way to build up SA.However you have to weigh whether you have enough emergency funds or need short term funds along the way.,btohqsg
"Coming back to your qn. In the event you have reached FRS and still has AI from HDB.1) the AI will still snowball until the day you refund all to OA back (capital + AI)2) upon reaching FRS amount and RA created  whatever in OA or SA can be retrieved. However most people use it as some form of ""FD"" by not taking out.",btohqsg
Can i ask whether it is true that you do not need to repay back the AI when you reach FRS at age 55? Only time you need to repay back is when you sell your HDB?,btohqsg
What's wrong? It works fine for me.,btohqsg
Instarem Amaze cashback is in  you all should receive a notification from the app,btohqsg
I can't seem to log in,btohqsg
Same here. Instarem seem to be down,btohqsg
Everyone wants the cashback now lol,btohqsg
It's ok now. Their trade platform last night hang and unable to connect. All my trades stuck  buying at market price all show pending  cancelling also say pending cancellation. The online CSO unable to do anything. Scary.,btohqsg
"No rules for paying back AI at all times.It's only a matter of whether u want to accumulate it till u sell off the HDB or whether u prefer to clear it and let the gov pay u the 2.5% instead of ""taking it from the profit sales of the flat""Scenario 1) new BTO should still be able to cover the capital + AI when u decide to sell off as there will be a long period of time before it decays.Scenario 2) if u buy resale  price of HDB when u bought ultimately may or may not be lesser then what u bought for when u decide to sell. So in this sense  if u sell off  the so called profit will ""bite"" into the sales  as compared if u clear off the capital + AI.",btohqsg
For insta amaze card  when is the cadhback reflected? how many days after purchased? got my card a week back have use about 2k++ on groceries dinings etc but yet to reflect in my cashback... still 0,btohqsg
Cashback will be paid out on the 25th of the month after each quarter. For example  you got your Amaze card a week back (i.e. during Jan)  your cashback will be reflected/paid out only after the first quarter of Jan-Mar (i.e. on 25 April),btohqsg
Take note max cashback / quarter is $100 (or 1% of $10000)  unless Amaze runs some additional promo,btohqsg
there are additional caveats like:- each transaction must be at least $5 to qualify as an eligible cashback transaction; and- min spend of at least $500 / quarter to qualify for any cashback payout,btohqsg

This is not the right place to shill your own referral codes [deleted],btohqsg
not sure if i can ask this herebut if i want to host my own NFTs (some paintings i did last year)  which is the best NFT website to do so,btohqsg
Bros respect the telegram owner la,btohqsg
This group is for sharing among members  not a place to promote your referral codes,btohqsg
but i presume this one more popular for now?,btohqsg
Let me just explain why I don't allow you to shill your referral codes.1) I build this community for information sharing  and through my content creation gain some affiliate referral because I have already provided the value. What value have you provided before you threw your referral code here?2) If I allow you to share your code here  other people will ask why they cannot share as well. Soon  this will turn to a promo code sharing channel. And people will start leaving  let's not go that way.For official referral codes from me  please refer to my referral channelt.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
