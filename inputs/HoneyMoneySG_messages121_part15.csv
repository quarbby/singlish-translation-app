So it is largely unlikely that the interest in SA will go to the OA due to the yearly limit increase,btohqsg
Wrong. Like I said earlier  SA interests and contributions will stay in SA. Unlikely you can do RSTU once you hit FRS.,btohqsg
Hi there! Anyone know which are the best places to park USD Funds without lock in right now? TqSo far‚Ä¶MooMoo/WeBull: 5.18%IBRK: 4.347% (100K USD),btohqsg
I think the current situation is unclear so people don‚Äôt get the full picture.Maybe u can describe the whole situation again clearly so we get the full picture. So far people here are generally neutral and do not side or hate with banks. We side with reason.1. What kind of transaction is it? In person at merchant pay wave? Submitting credit information online?2. Was there any authorisation by you involved? Authorising OTP? In app notification?3. Any agreement between u and merchant on the correct amount to be paid in the first place?,btohqsg
why is the bank responsible for you making wrong transactions?you should have confirmed the details of the transaction before authorising it.,btohqsg
if you confirmed the details and the bank misprocessed it  then sure  the bank should be support you in this,btohqsg
To claim back the amount  you need:1a). SMS that send to you showing the amount you pay after you authorised the transaction n it is different from the amount deducted from your account.Or1b). Receipt that given to you showing the amount you paid is different from the amount deducted from your account.If you don‚Äôt have the two evidences above  go back n talk to the merchant and agree what should be correct amount. Only the merchant can reverse out the amount. The whole transaction is between you and the merchant.Do you have any receipt or photo showing what product/service you bought n how much it should cost. If you don‚Äôt have  very hard to prove because a merchant can serve hundreds to thousands of customers in a day  likely they can‚Äôt remember everything.It is customer responsibility to check the pre-bill ( draft) amount before merchant entered the amount on the payment terminal. Check the receipt  n make sure everything is correct before leaving the counter.In your case  the receipt issued by the merchant will be the document showing what is the truth.,btohqsg
What is the main consideration behind this xfer?For the moomoo promo? Or ibkr cause its better?,btohqsg
If my memory doesn't fail me  on the bank's auth process it does quote the amount and merchant name,btohqsg
In other words  there most likely was a 2FA before the transaction was approved  and he failed to cross-check before authorising,btohqsg
Yes  even for priority customers  they are useless,btohqsg
Who want to take additional headache when own job already more than enough (probably),btohqsg
That‚Äôs how UoB know what people talk in market and strategy to pursue  ocbc have a best cso at a point of time  and they heard that UoB is worse  so they cut cost to make it bad,btohqsg
I know i wouldn‚Äôt side with mine üòÇ. Why a lowly employee needs to protect big corporate anyway. They are rich enough. And i am too small fry. You can complain to me and i have no power to change anything. üò¨,btohqsg
While there may indeed be bank employee / spies here it is quite obvious who are the unbiased responders here.lol. Especially not admins.,btohqsg
Imagine if the spies just help to use the conversations here to correct most of the CSO's errors.,btohqsg
A good reminder for this video to surface again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKP_lFgjBmw,btohqsg
But next month uob evol nerf I am considering to just use uob one debit card instead and clock 500sgd spending,btohqsg
Why not using UOB one cc to clock?,btohqsg
Will you xfer back to ibkr after the promo?,btohqsg
What is a good cashback card for simplygo? What is a good cashback card for sp bill?,btohqsg
Because need to accumulate per quarter?,btohqsg
If you already hitting $600 min spend for UOB EVOL and $500 spending for UOB One account  what's the difference?,btohqsg
OK I will apply the uob one Cc then thanks,btohqsg
you can also search through past chats for your query  been answered before,btohqsg
Simplygo can use SC Smart card,btohqsg
Don't forget UOB One debit card has annual fee.,btohqsg
Does anyone know whether mcc 5999 accepted by amaze x citi rewards for the 4mpd? Overseas online transaction. Thanks!,btohqsg
Debit card got annual fee? Then can cancel or not,btohqsg
Just to confirm for the uob lady solitaire bonus miles under the selected category i.e. dining  contactless payment via gpay does count right,btohqsg
Yes Uob lady only cares about mcc. As long as it's eligible  payment method doesn't matter.,btohqsg
yes so long mcc is eligible  the payment mode dun matter,btohqsg
Hi all  with the recent nerf to hsbc rev  i was wondering if i purchase something online and the payment mmethod is via apple pay  is it consider online transaction?,btohqsg
That's still considered online. HSBC Revo list of eligible mcc is much worse now. I feel it's best to use other cards instead.,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask if anyone ever encounter signing up for similar credit card promo (eg UOB KrisFlyer giving up to 31k miles for new signups + $2k spend)  end up they tell you you're not within the first 100? Do you then get nothing at all  or would they give you something else? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Thanks. Im currently still trying to optimise  but becos its the only 4mpd card that i can use at the moment  had no other choice haha. appreciate it üôè,btohqsg
Have you been introduced to crmc and amaze combo? üôÇ,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg

If you want to play the lottery game with UOB KF signup  go ahead :),btohqsg
or looking at cards not from amex/uob/citi/hsbc so i could get welcome benefits,btohqsg
sry but what do you mean by lottery?,btohqsg
Cancelled my Amex plat. Best decision ever ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Current promo is first 100 applicants. No way to tell if the quota is met. essentially playing lottery.,btohqsg
Worst as in sign up Or cancelled?,btohqsg
Wah debit card also have annual fee. 1st time hear it. Thanks admin for sharing.,btohqsg
Bro. You just sign up last month . Or a few months back.Do share reasons for cancelling.. hope the members can benefit here too.,btohqsg
Maybe you should start reading t&cs more often.,btohqsg
After 3 years sure forget. Don't use just cancel.,btohqsg
Hi  just bought specs from lenskart today‚Ä¶ checked on heymax to optimized and saw EVOL(before nerf) is one of the better cards to use‚Ä¶ but i noted here it says that transactions need to be online to be eligible? I thought mobile contactless should be fine? Have been using EVOL for a while now so not sure if missing anything‚Ä¶,btohqsg
