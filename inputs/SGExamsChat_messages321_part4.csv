Hey all  wanna know what are my chances of getting my 1st choice for JPAE.  I graduated from Higher Nitec with 2.461 GPA. I applied to Common Sports and Health Programme in RP. The Min GPA was 2.0  and there isnâ€™t a JPAE Band as itâ€™s a new course.,btohqsg
i think can be decent  cos new course  but dont hold any high hopes ah,btohqsg
If I applied to JPAE Shld I apply DAE too?,btohqsg

tp just opened the order for the laptops and i'm back to square one bc i can't decide,btohqsg
or should I buy from courts or smth,btohqsg
What kind of laptop are you ðŸ‘€ for?,btohqsg
that's why... idk I need it for common biz,btohqsg
I guess you can use Mac right?,btohqsg
does it support Microsoft 365? ig it does right bc biz needs Microsoft all the time,btohqsg
365 is applicable on Office for Mac,btohqsg
I'm not sure if i need to do coding later on in the course though,btohqsg
Mac is a good choice for coding tho. My friend uses it for Uni.,btohqsg
my course doesn't require a mac or specialised stuff,btohqsg
I found this on the tp website,btohqsg
they didn't link it to apple idk why,btohqsg
Cuz most Apple laptops no longer use Intel.,btohqsg
You need graphics card but Apple doesnâ€™t have it on the latest models. That explains why not recommended.,btohqsg
should I just stick to windows/microsoft?,btohqsg
I never have good experience with either Lenovo   Asus or Dell for their laptops so far. So it â€˜s hard to say for me.,btohqsg
same  i sent the lappy back to repair they never even close the bezel properly,btohqsg
I thought Asus was good with the sleek design but guess what the trackpad stopped working less than one year and they didnâ€™t repair it.,btohqsg
They only want to get the job done.,btohqsg
slanted in power button  things all never close properly,btohqsg
The ThinkPad I used got issues with Bluetooth    screen hang etc.,btohqsg
That laptop costs $2K+. More like a ðŸ—‘ in my opinion.,btohqsg
After these experiences   not sure if I will trust Windows laptop.,btohqsg
I was told that ThinkPad is fantastic. The best of the best.,btohqsg
I also had Acer. The wifi card broke but at least it â€˜s still functioning.,btohqsg
I think in terms of reliability   it fares better than Asus   Dell.,btohqsg
Dell > SSD broke   computer was unable to start up.Asus > SSD broke   touchpad stopped working.Acer > Sound card   wifi card broke but otherwise still functioning.,btohqsg
U sound like u have so many problems with laptops,btohqsg
Yeah. Even LG Gram was bad.,btohqsg
dont rmb alr haha  old one de,btohqsg
U can buy faster ssd card if u wan,btohqsg
Whats the average lifespan of a laptop,btohqsg
I have a lot of issues with Window laptops. Dunno why. I find Apple still fares better.,btohqsg
my sis use asus 3 years she no problem eh,btohqsg
Idk i feel 3 years a bit too short,btohqsg
But yeah. Asus is your next best alternative for price and quality.,btohqsg
my windows laptop cannot use spotify and Discord at the same time,btohqsg
If u buy longer lasting laptop,btohqsg
