White collar always OT also no OT pay,btohqsg
My brother house same blk as u. daughter one further down.,btohqsg
But all other costs and services not cheap,btohqsg
You think hawker is cheap but is actually empty carbs with little protein. Only economy rice and chicken rice is decent most of the time,btohqsg

Lai .. maybe I know your brother ..,btohqsg
Bo ko leng his unit now rental out,btohqsg

That day . My customer told me now graduate people come out find work can fetch at least 8 to 10k .. I was wondering what job is that,btohqsg
My kids gonna have a tough time too,btohqsg
Hard to say leh .. maybe is same level . ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
8-10k got la but not all ma,btohqsg
What job ? Newly come out just start have this pay ?,btohqsg
Sell your condo now . Go buy bto,btohqsg
Some specialized jobs can get 7-8k but could be after a year or two ba. Maybe not immediately. I'm not 100% sure but I've heard of mentions. Financial engineering etc some of these pay better.,btohqsg
Not bad ar ..  starting pay come out got 7 to 8k ..,btohqsg
What's the avg grad pay now?,btohqsg
Donno wor . I never Grad before ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Honestly with the current inflation of SG prices  salaries need to ramp up,btohqsg
The company profit must up too . Lolzz,btohqsg
If company profit not up .. how to ramp up salary ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Pls leh they can hire so many with good pay from overseas  they can't give SGrean better pay meh,btohqsg
My friend daughter fresh grad.Work in Goldman sach  starting pay more than 10k,btohqsg
Finance sector good. No doubt about it if good investment bank,btohqsg
But also lose job more easily hehe,btohqsg
But local co do seem to pay low,btohqsg
If top scholar high potential type yes 10k should be no problem.,btohqsg
But there is no doubt the avg needs to be higher,btohqsg
Economy rice also not economical already,btohqsg
Furthermore these are fresh grads. There are so many who already in work force where the salary is crawling,btohqsg
Like I said probably one of the exceptional outliers,btohqsg
This family from China second daughter also got good scare in A level,btohqsg
Wah Lau why you show ppl stuff here,btohqsg
First daughter works in Goldman Sach.Second daughter scored Super good in A level,btohqsg
These jobs probably rely on connection,btohqsg
They come to SG get vip treatment. They have packages and tie ins to come over,btohqsg
I know it all too well lol,btohqsg
There was a Chinese vvip come to SG with his fat accounts as part of his package wanted accces to an elite school for his kid that has a super long wait list,btohqsg
He got what he wanted and is in SG today,btohqsg
Lots of Chinese with connections will ask for Singapore internships at good co in SG. Very normal,btohqsg
Then they stay on or have easy access to other premium employers. Got $ anything easy,btohqsg
