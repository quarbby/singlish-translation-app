Every ah mao ah kow will go in and buy now,btohqsg
It's the practice all along...only deregister then pour back..doesn't matter 5yr or those who decided to scrap at 10 etc,btohqsg
My concern is the pqp lol,btohqsg
But the concern here is why wasnt 5 year coe poured back in imemdiately the next month when it is confirmed to be deregistered?,btohqsg
So the supply could have been higher,btohqsg
Eg June 1st bidding has 500,btohqsg
So which quarter is the may 31st coming back into?,btohqsg
So early already talk so atas,btohqsg
then bertha hanson also talk about it,btohqsg
We sit down and relax also,btohqsg
High or low still will buy car 🤣,btohqsg
Physical car still around ma 🤭 the congestion would only get worse  carparks not enough  etc,btohqsg
That's why this round is a one time,btohqsg
Just now I saw a red plate Audi A6 SNJ xxx,btohqsg
Red plate is additional discount ?,btohqsg
@SkyAudiRS6Avantlong time never hear from you,btohqsg
Road tax lesser  coe also lesser,btohqsg
If I rich  I buy lambo red plate,btohqsg
Then spray the car red also,btohqsg

i think 4 or 5 only,btohqsg
cus my friend recently got married,btohqsg
I think I buy 20 today,btohqsg
i ask him draw numbers for me,btohqsg
Clever.  Remove cow volatility when record high… clock more high COE units… as ppl still need to buy.. grab will grab the chance… come 2-3 yrs time when supply suppose to increase n bring prices down? There won’t be anymore surplus due to zero growth and all used up,btohqsg
No point asking from ChatGPT if you want to ask for random number  is equivalent to quick pick.You can be more direct and ask for probability instead such that they actually calculate what’s the most likely to come out.Chances of winning will be closer if it’s 4D than ToTo.In the case of 4D you can ask what’s the highest probability of 10 number from 0000 to 9999 appearing in a random list of 23 numbers when rolled 23 times  removing the numbers when appeared.If you wanna factor in 4D Machine etc  can make your own AI do the calculations with the past 4D results,btohqsg
I think just buy . The price won’t comes down so much . Currently the 2 most tax the gov can depend on is car & housing .,btohqsg
i heard in US one lottery went bankrupt cus a grp of uni students did this,btohqsg
what u want is buy iToto,btohqsg
but prize pool divided by 28,btohqsg
i think what u should do is buy multiple qp  the odds r higher,btohqsg
If win 1mil then you keep reinvesting the winnings,btohqsg
reinvest into other stocks or investment plans yes,btohqsg
i always reinvest but nvr win HAHAH,btohqsg
Technically you don’t lose any money what,btohqsg
u lose ur initial deposit lo,btohqsg
i net loss $42 so far,btohqsg
i think 50 or 60 dollars,btohqsg
You see my lost confirm you crt,btohqsg
wahhh..so everybody now talking about the premiums and the coe quota?,btohqsg
Just buy   if the bank loan you the $$$,btohqsg
