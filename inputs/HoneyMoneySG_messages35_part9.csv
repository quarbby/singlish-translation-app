Is there any card that can earn point when I top up my youtrip trip?,btohqsg
Ya plus if you use as savings account  you still get 1.5%+ pa interest. Imagine you go overseas allocating substantial amount of money to spend  each day still getting some interest compared to zero. Not that bad aye.,btohqsg
Wait long long most of non cc let u earned point from top up the era of double triple tip is gone,btohqsg
but the savings can get higher interest in other banks. Think the main reasom for using Trust card for overseas spend is to clock minimum spend for higher rebate at fairprice group merchants,btohqsg
I mean since there's no minimum and fall below fees  you can just park certain amount in Trust Account while you're in holidays. During that period when you're overseas  you won't lose out as much on interest compared to YouTrip.Also  after the trip  if you really want more interest elsewhere  just transfer the money back to your preferred account.,btohqsg
"I don't think during holidays you really want to still think about how much to topup to YouTrip just to minimize the ""leftover"" balance that can't be cashed out ba.You're there to enjoy  not to think about these dollars and cents lol I hope",btohqsg

is there any lock-in period for RHB before moving funds out to deploy to another HYSA as per your video? say must keep for X months with RHB then can get the interest from RHB.,btohqsg
RE: HSBC EGA Mar-June PromoHSBC CSO told me if I were to top up once  eg 10k in March (0 balance in Feb)  for the promo  I will only get the 4.55%pa for March ONLY if I don‚Äôt top up again in Apr. The bonus interest is calculated on the incremental top up Amt month on month. So not possible to Top up once in March and hope to get 4.55%pa for the four months straight.It‚Äôs different from what I understood from the video so asking here. Any others called and got the same understanding?,btohqsg
$88 to learn about credit card LOL,btohqsg
The CSO told me account open in MAR  Mar is reference month. Worst,btohqsg
He was saying if I were to top up $5k more in Apr  I will get bonus interest 4.55%pa on the $5k only and not on the $10k deposited in March coz the increase in deposit ADB is $5k  compared to Feb which is zero.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just asking coz don‚Äôt wanna only find out the truth only in Aug when the bonus int is paid lol,btohqsg
"""increase in deposit ADB for the reference month of Feb'23"". means if Feb is $0  any amount deposited after Feb will be entitled to 4.55%. this is also confirmed with the HSBC CSO when i called",btohqsg
Every HSBC cso is saying different things üòÇ,btohqsg
Increase in deposits for the relevant month. Means the amt u top up in that month vs Feb. If u don‚Äôt top up in that month  the increase is 0.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know for the citibank premier miles card promo  how they count the first two months? If i get the card on 24 Feb  does it count till 24 Apr or end Mar? TIA!,btohqsg
hmm  more like the top up amount against Feb. so if Feb is $0  any amount above that is considered the 'top up amount'. maybe you can ask the CSO to confirm internally  which is what i did,btohqsg
Cool  if got updates kindly share. Thanks!,btohqsg
what updates are you looking for?,btohqsg
if the CSO gets back after checking internally. No update is fine too. I will call another one to check as well.,btohqsg
yeah the CSO confirmed this haha,btohqsg
Dear all  may I ask why do people choose SG Fixed Deposit rather USD Fixed Deposit?The USD Fixed Deposit is much higher  isnt it?,btohqsg
Should be this is the case.. there are some people here who had HSBC EGA for a very long time since2020/2021and have done a few cycles of this - they can clarify this,btohqsg
Exchange rate risk. For eg if u buy USD now @1.35 and after a year it drops to 1.30,btohqsg
What is The USD FD rate is 5% for 12mths? Still not worth?,btohqsg
Worth or not depends on where u see USD is when u want to change back to SGD.,btohqsg
Well noted. Thank you for the valuable advice üôÇ,btohqsg
Thanks. Appreciate it  will just call in again to check once more.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  can I check the accuracy of my understanding on HSBC EGA.If I sign up in March and deposit x amount  and in the month of Apr to June I deposit $2000/mth and do 5 paynow transactions to remove the $2000 (maintaining balance of initial x amount in the account)  I can qualify for the 4.55% + bonus 1%? Did I understand it correctly?Also  after the promotion period if I withdraw the x amt leaving the minimum sum in the account  what will the interest rate be like?,btohqsg
Hi  just checked my Singsaver reward status  it just indicated not eligible  anyway I can check on the reason ? Tks,btohqsg
1% is on the incremental balance wrt to previous month's  so if May's balance is same as Apr's  incremental balance $0  May only get 4.55% (1%√ó$0  = $0)  likewise for Jun.After promotion base interest 0.05%,btohqsg
Ohh okay  I understand better now! Thank you!,btohqsg
More interest hikes coming soon to SG banks?,btohqsg
