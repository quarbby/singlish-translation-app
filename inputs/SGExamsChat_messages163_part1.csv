I always have this impression that you are female,btohqsg
Oh  den he shld just go for pure bio haha  why consider physics ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
It and med both sound like bandwagon,btohqsg
Don't know.... But because you talk about the need to do NS so I know you are male,btohqsg
Nah  I need to next year üòÇ,btohqsg
Hahaha yea. He just got peer pressured ig coz everyone was telling him phy is easier to study and bio is more content heavy.,btohqsg
Unless I go med and can det r,btohqsg
peer pressure - the bane of modern students,btohqsg
But really  it's not about how easy it is for distinction or how less content there is,btohqsg
It's about what he truly enjoy bah,btohqsg
Don't regret and waste two year studying things he dl,btohqsg
now i have a slight recollection,btohqsg
but i forgot ur old username,btohqsg
Bedok  look at my chem pract,btohqsg
In sec sch that titration table is 4 marks,btohqsg
Cos there's two titration table in total haha,btohqsg
And I make the mistake twice ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Cuz erm i spilled some indicator,btohqsg
Yall isit e math damn unpredictable,btohqsg
I have a teacher who spill EtBr on his hand,btohqsg
Tys got like a fixed format,btohqsg
Like i can predict which qn will cfm come out,btohqsg
As you do you will start to observe,btohqsg
U mean other question almost same?,btohqsg
But like paper 2Qn 1 algebraQn 2 either pattern(use calculator) or money exchange rate or simple interestQn 3 quadratic eqnQn 4 graphQn 5 trigo thingysQn 6 circle properties cfm got proving similarity and congruencyQn 7 vectors haha SIKE DN TO DOQn 8 maybe sectors and stuffQn 9 statistics range all thoseQn 10 the gayest shit ever,btohqsg
Paper 1 a lot will come out,btohqsg
I rmb for Emath and Amath,btohqsg
U can tell what topic coming for paper 2,btohqsg
Like quadratic eqn trigo and graph cfm come out,btohqsg
My teacher say the reason why amaath got two paper,btohqsg
Is cos they teach too much,btohqsg
And not enough paper to test at one shot,btohqsg
@chemcerme too! Teach me how did you get 59/65 for chemistry!,btohqsg
I can imagine bedok doing that,btohqsg
Why is it always Einstein? Why not mathematicians such as Galois?,btohqsg
My chem paper 2 like 50/80,btohqsg
Idk  when I search genius on gif it was top result,btohqsg
Bedok can open bedok tuition agency after a level,btohqsg
I died liao bro one paper,btohqsg
Imagine doing a math for 4.5hour,btohqsg
So he's gonna get banned from this grp 2 yrs ltr?,btohqsg
Later eat then food coma wasted effort,btohqsg
He helped me in chem HAHA,btohqsg
Then if starve cant do well also,btohqsg
My combi is phy maths maths for uni,btohqsg
Im like phy chem bio maths,btohqsg
Eh bdont forget the meet up during dec,btohqsg
