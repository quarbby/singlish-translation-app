Net Pacific Finance daily and weekly above the red dotted pressure line.Today opened $0.020 and then went to $0.027 before close back at $0.020.

Bought back some $0.020 in the afternoon as it felt quite maintained with hidden buyers absorbing the chips $0.020/$0.021zAnyways DYODD . Just my view. Hope got it right.,btohqsg

Oxley holdings.Looks like reversal set up. Today can tell someone forced this doji to close 75.Note that Oxley have been doing Share buybacks $0.071 to $0.075 recently  even today at $0.075.

Sunmoon also jumping in on the ‘China hype’ penny rallySmart Investor Relations team  I would say.Seems like they made the point to ensure that they are also ‘china-related’ with this statement ‘based primarily on the People’s Republic of China’Coincidence or ? $0.020 seems pivot. DYODD. Curious to see whether BBs will come in on Monday or not.Note to all: All these hyped games  no one knows how long they will last. OSOD . Take own responsibility where EP/SL/TP is concerned.,btohqsg
Overall Sunmoon chart looks decent with 22 being the closest resistance and 20 being the pivot support. Now it’s up to the BBs. Dyodd too.,btohqsg
