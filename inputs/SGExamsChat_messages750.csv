Imagine volunteering to do NS and wasting 2 yrs of ur life just to not be called a singapore citizen,btohqsg
Minh pls tell us if you see,btohqsg

Might be controversial but I think too many ppl with mild mental health issues are being given pes F when they should be given E instead,btohqsg
Can put him in non combat vocation  my friend’s office he said got one super athletic and buff guy rare blood type and got pes E instead of F,btohqsg
And also if you got private doctor report they can help exaggerate,btohqsg
Even heart issues should be pes E,btohqsg
today i learnt massaging services for kids exist,btohqsg
Unless there’s sth very serious we don’t know it’s quite likely he exaggerate some shit and got pes F unfairly,btohqsg
nah if u saw the reddit post  alot of the comments say tht thecommentswebsite is actually fake,btohqsg
but then u also realise the ad is kinda disturbing,btohqsg
That one was quite nice but i didn’t want to put in too much carbs if not wasting my money,btohqsg
There should be more stringent checks tbh. Legit too many ppl are being let off the hook,btohqsg
Even some ppl I know with mild autism wiggle their way into pes F when I know of ppl with slightly more severe autism still getting E,btohqsg
I want to excuse uniform but idk if I can,btohqsg
How does he get such a light schedule tho,btohqsg
I thought ASA is like regular office hours,btohqsg
So it’s like vacation leave 10-15 days a month,btohqsg
Hmm but you said 5-8 days one month tho,btohqsg
If 4 weeks it should be 20 days,btohqsg
Yeah but then other days can stay home and other stuff,btohqsg
That’s alr like vacation leave lol,btohqsg

Could be because they want to continue living in Singapore and don’t want to be judged by society (especially if they know they’re not worthy of pes f),btohqsg
I mean not just in baskin robins but like any place,btohqsg
My honest opinion is that back in 2010s baskin robbins wasn't good,btohqsg
