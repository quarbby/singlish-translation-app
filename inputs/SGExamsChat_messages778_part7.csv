How long should I wait for NUS  NTU and SMU uni application results to come out before applying to SIM? Applied to those unis and still haven't seen any results  despite it being late April. It's almost 100 bucks to apply to SIM though  don't want to waste the money on SIM applications or waste the chance to go to NTU  especially.,btohqsg
