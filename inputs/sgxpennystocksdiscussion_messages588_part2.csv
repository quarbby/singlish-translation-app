Singtel Loses Landmark $640 Million Australian Tax Case1. Australia on Friday won a landmark court ruling against Singapore Telecommunications  a victory in the country’s battle against tax avoidance by multinational companies through cross-border financing arrangements.2. The Federal Court of Australia on Friday dismissed the company’s appeal of a tax assessment related to the acquisition financing of Singtel Optus in 2001.3. Transactions between two wholly owned SingTel units “differed from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another ” Judge Mark Kranz Moshinsky wrote for the court.More here,btohqsg

https://www.cschl.com.sg/projects.phpWas driving along AMK  Bishan side and saw a real big ongoing project. The entire stretch at were at full piling capacity judging from the No of tractors  cranes and piling machines over there.Did some checking and I believe the project is Contract T312.Also  good to know that they secured a rather big ongoing order book.As we all know the pandemic have led to worker shortage. However  I believe this worker crunch situation will eventually be sorted out as the world gets more vaccinated and increase our herd immunity.I guess that is why CSC have been actively buying back all shares at $0.014.For those expecting a construction recovery and 2022  to be a construction boom due to catch up works  can consider load at $0.014 since it’s risk free here.Note: the key to making big money is from anticipation. Chasing have killed many in the marketDYODD,btohqsg
CSC  i confidently say  $0.014 is an easy collection for those who can hold.- Chart looks good (bull flagging)- MACD golden cross- Anticipate a construction recovery (take a look at PanUnited recent share buy backs too)- NAV : $0.033- Company Share buy backs $0.014Hence  quite no brainer  got money can collect $0.014 with the company.DYODD and hope 2022 will reap the rewards,btohqsg
