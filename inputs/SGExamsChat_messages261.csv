Hey any tips on how to get distinction for Chinese oral,btohqsg
oh my the only thing that helped was listening to chinese songs for a whole month 🤣,btohqsg
Flashbacks of YPs on an e-scooter playing Chinese EDM songs on their Bluetooth speakers at Lim Chu Kang during night time.,btohqsg
For me  I don’t need notes is needed for Chinese oral. I’m a Sec 3 student takingHigher Chinese and all I do for oral is gather necessary infos for some hot popular topics (热门话题）from newspapers etc. And you just need to know the answering technique (PEEL). First question is a personal question  second question is a application question and the last question is a argumentative question. As long as you know what I’ve said above  you should be fine for your Oral.,btohqsg
What do y’all think will be coming out for the next few days of oral,btohqsg
Is covid-19 and online learning a possibility?,btohqsg
But something you can talk about when answering,btohqsg
Wonder how many A levels here,btohqsg
A Level H1 MT is just O Level HMT,btohqsg
If its B3-A2  Merit should be enough honestly.,btohqsg
Read more chi books to increase vocab,btohqsg
Then make sure to use it,btohqsg
btw quick qn  do yall think that groups should discuss the workload tgt instead of just throwing it to ppl to do,btohqsg
Really depends on the intensity of the workload. If it requires brainstorming  collaborative thinking or decision-making  it'd be great to discuss it as a group,btohqsg
But if it's a manageable task that can be delegated  then it should be delegated. Saves everyone's time and makes things more efficient,btohqsg
My target I try to get B3 but then I screw up my ppr and listening,btohqsg
So If u don’t get distinction u abt hard,btohqsg
Ah  But You should be fine just give ur best!,btohqsg
For papers  i think u can retake right,btohqsg
Anyways  how's the progress on the stickers?,btohqsg
took a smol break due to second dose pain,btohqsg
Speak more   read more   好词好句 PEEL structure,btohqsg
