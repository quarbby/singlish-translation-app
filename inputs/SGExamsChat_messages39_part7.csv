but then there's the practical concerns,btohqsg
oh that's double major not double degree?,btohqsg
It was a joke btw  women already have that privilege,btohqsg
Intellectuals do not concern themselves with little things like semantics,btohqsg
Meanwhile some pes C managed to bingo twice,btohqsg
The things on the list are pretty typical,btohqsg
Therefore the conclusion is he is atypical,btohqsg
They should create a NxxL bingo,btohqsg
To check if u have any congruency,btohqsg
That means you don’t have a pet  you don’t support PAP  your height is not above average,btohqsg
Only the pap one would make me bingo LOL,btohqsg

Random question: Why is there a minority requirement for Members of Parliament  but no gender requirement?If the rationale for having sufficient racial minority representation in the Parliament to ensure that the problems and issues faced by the minority aren't being unintentionally glossed over by the majority race  doesn't the same rationale apply to gender  and that we should have enough women in Parliament to ensure that their problems aren't glossed over?,btohqsg
Also  how about age requirements? Why aren't we putting youths in the Parliament to ensure that problems faced by the youths aren't being glossed over by the 50-60 year old MPs?And shouldn't the cycle continue until every facet of society is sufficiently accounted for?,btohqsg
That's a practical consideration  it's still not logically consistent,btohqsg
Gender riots won't happen but that doesn't solve the problem,btohqsg
that women are potentially disadvantaged in the Parliament,btohqsg
Do you stay with your parents? YesDoes your grandparent/aunty/uncle/cousin/nephew stay with you? NoIf you answered my questions like how I answered you tick nuclear family,btohqsg
When you hold onto a position of power,btohqsg
You don't intentionally do things which don't help you,btohqsg
Don't direct too much resources their way,btohqsg
In Singapore  the definition of youths hit up to 30 I believe,btohqsg
Theres a definition of youth in sg?,btohqsg
And I think it's a very politically driven thing to say that we should only help voters  children are Singaporeans.,btohqsg
I think it was further extended to 35 lmao,btohqsg
Meanwhile I had 16 ticks and still no bingo,btohqsg
Getting bingo = dick measurement competition,btohqsg
I wonder if somebody here will blackout (tick everything) on the bingo card lmao,btohqsg
have to go find your age group,btohqsg
You're talking about politics aren't you? In politics  you do things that benefit you politically.,btohqsg
I am well above average then,btohqsg
im pretty sure avg height for guys is more than that,btohqsg
Well yes  but in the grand scheme of things  a government that pass policies with a mindset that it's going to help them maintain power  is not a good government,btohqsg
Average height for cis males in Singapore is like,btohqsg
Haiz didnt expect to see the day when i had to add/sfor mr nine o,btohqsg
btw I'm not complaining about PAP because they're clearly been passing a lot of unpopular policies that are arguably beneficial in the long term,btohqsg
Uh not sure about how being a good government is relevant to why sg doesn't have more youth representatives in Parliament,btohqsg
Should the government have more diverse representation,btohqsg
But some girl girls say they only date above 1.8... sed.,btohqsg
So ‘Is diverse representation in parliament a characteristic of a perfect government’,btohqsg
I was making the devil's advocate line of reasoning then if we have mandatory requirements of having a minority MP in every GRC  then it opens the question as to why they're not ensuring that equally important communities are being accounted for,btohqsg
Race is important  so is gender.,btohqsg
dont need to know  but ok,btohqsg
Then think about it this way,btohqsg
Why else would a government introduce a GRC system?,btohqsg
If we say that a disproportionately male Parliament can ensure that women problems are being accounted for  then so can a disproportionately Chinese Parliament ensure that Malay/Indian/other races' problems are accounted for.,btohqsg
If so  the racial minority requirement does not hold any validity anymore,btohqsg
Imo it's not about ensuring minority representative,btohqsg
yeah go on  I'm all ears,btohqsg
