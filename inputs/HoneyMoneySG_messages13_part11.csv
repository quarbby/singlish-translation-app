Can some gurus pls advise. I achieved the Grab Challenge for reward points  and through the process i have top up $ to Grabpay via PayNow VPA method. Question is can i transfer back the top up to my bank  once i gotten the reward points?,btohqsg
But you have to register PayNow on Dash,btohqsg
"so from Dash app tap ""send money"" then ""PayNow""",btohqsg
then the app will ask you to register for PayNow  complete the registration then you'll be able to add dash mobile number to Grab,btohqsg
however once you do so you cannot topup by credit or debit card to dash anymore,btohqsg
not that it matters since they charge $1 for that now,btohqsg
Can't undo this method once u enroll?,btohqsg
can you withdraw back to bank account if using Grab to top up to Dash?,btohqsg
but tbh the only change is that you can't topup to dash by credit/debit card anymore  which doesn't matter since1. you can still topup by debit card using grab as a proxy2. dash charges $1 for card topups anyway,btohqsg
Use debit then olmo use hahahaha,btohqsg
This works  but minimum amount $2,btohqsg
1.2% back in dash points  can be used to redeem store vouchers,btohqsg
anyone has an idea TPG/SIMBA recharge in-app counts as what MCC? Isit telco or wallet topup? ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Just top up via qoo10 or shopee got better discount,btohqsg
GrabWallet via FavePay for Hawker Centre food purchase  still earns you grab points ðŸ˜…$4.8 = 27 points,btohqsg
No diff if you use debit card or bank account transfer ma?,btohqsg
Why don't just direct topup bank account to dash?,btohqsg
Transferable grab balance all comes from bank acc / debit card,btohqsg
Thinking most wanna double or triple dip to earn Cashback,btohqsg
Dont understand  max cashback is dash 1.2%,btohqsg
SC jumpstart debit card gives 1% cashback on grab wallet topups,btohqsg
that's why I ask if can transfer grab balance to dash,btohqsg
which I just found out is possible,btohqsg
I've done that since i opened my account  it's always worked,btohqsg
But tio caught then they might ban you,btohqsg
SC jumpstart card cashback has a max of $60 per month tho,btohqsg
Quite a huge risk for extra 1% cashback,btohqsg
didn't realise that  yeah I think I'll stop doing it,btohqsg
Just Tested grab QR for hawker stukk got point duno if tomorrow is gonna nerf,btohqsg
or did you get the mystery box?,btohqsg
I buy liho yesterday and scan QR code I got 34 points,btohqsg
Grab already say you to 25kSo zero still a number,btohqsg
If amex & grab removed the top up scheme it's a nail to coffin,btohqsg
It will be gg for my extra spending,btohqsg
Im doing evol 6% for first 600And uob amex > grab > cdc total 3.7% for next 1750 spending,btohqsg
ohhh no points for Grab to CDC no?,btohqsg
Ya  uob amex 1.7% + 2% cdc,btohqsg
Which tier are you on? I was on blue tier but they didn't give rewards anymore so I cancelled my card,btohqsg
12pts is like the highest i ever seen so far lol,btohqsg
If you buy fraser voucher using grab  you get grab pts,btohqsg
So for this promo  you spend $50 topup grab  buy $60 fraser voucher,btohqsg
Get 300 grab points and 1.7% cashback uob amex,btohqsg
why u got boxes? i still getting points from shopee,btohqsg
Just tried grab instore payment.I was still rewarded 6 points per dollar + 1 mystery box.Mystery box - better luck next time. Lol,btohqsg
ALERT: Grab Rewards 20% off again for those who missed last round!,btohqsg
hi  currently the best way to topup youtrip is still amex tcb/uob absolute + grabpay? Topups to youtrip from other credit cards wont qualify for cashback correct?,btohqsg
If you all see it earlier than me can sound out too! Will credit to you on@HMSGHive,btohqsg
seems like it's a restock of the previous sale,btohqsg
Just saw ringgit break 3.3 on bank rate,btohqsg
Just try to reload using revolut on tng and got 3.29,btohqsg
