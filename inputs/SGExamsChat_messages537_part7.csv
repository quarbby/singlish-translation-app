Thatâ€™s why my investment style is donâ€™t sell,btohqsg
personally I go for a style that pays dividends,btohqsg
If u dont sell the loss is nvr realized,btohqsg
my capital losses are reduced by the dividends return,btohqsg
This is only applicable under certain circumstances and strategies  which are not picking individual stock positions,btohqsg
Your total return is affected by dividends  but if the cash flow is what makes you psychologically able to take the risk itâ€™s still better than not investing,btohqsg
those who bought SG etf at the 2007 peak are probably still at a loss or at most break even,btohqsg
Singapore exchange is a joke lol,btohqsg
My only SGx exposure comes from whatever the funds I invest in have in SG positions,btohqsg
it has probably given me a low returns of 5% including losses taken.,btohqsg
Better than CPF SA can liao,btohqsg
but SG is generally bad for the past 15 years.,btohqsg
"I know this is late..but the message was for the british people to tell them that dyson being in sg was not good because ""british pounds"" flew out showing dyson is wasting money being in singapore",btohqsg
SGX good for parking retirement funds and dividend collecting  but other than that I would stay away until you are old ah pek want to enjoy life in calm sg dividend withdrawal strategy,btohqsg
I play like old ah pek style ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"a Social studies paper  set in singapore..for a singapore national exam...and the answer is ""The message of the source is for the british public""",btohqsg

Money is just potential value  needs to be in motion to have value. Loan it out  invest it  enjoy it,btohqsg

Cannot be lost chasing the bag,btohqsg

Tan ah kow Pte Ltd donâ€™t bother,btohqsg
Even for MNC they donâ€™t appreciate it or fast track you just move on with the skills you have,btohqsg
Either that or just take it slow and steady,btohqsg

Could mean nothing  thereâ€™s a lot of morons in god places and gods in moron places,btohqsg

"Her dilenma is basically deciding on which subject she wants to ""drop""  chinese or Humanitiesshe has a tutor that teaches both chinese and humanities and she is going to decide based on the aforemention decision to direct her tutor to instead focus solely on the topic she decides not to drop likely.",btohqsg

Some robo-firms have better strategies and costs than others imo,btohqsg
Some straight up just waste of time,btohqsg
Others seem like they have good fundamental businesses,btohqsg
As long as you can actually leverage the experience I guess,btohqsg
I think i defo am ah,btohqsg
there are different strategies that can be employed when you have certain level of capital,btohqsg

For example I used to be working on a team which managed hundreds of millions of dollars in computer systems  one of my bossâ€™s bosses/Individual contributor legit has 30 patents to his name and is just one of the kings of the company,btohqsg
Probably one of the smartest software guys in the world,btohqsg
