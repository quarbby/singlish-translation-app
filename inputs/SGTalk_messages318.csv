The outlet one is the one at Hong Lim  but not from original,btohqsg
I think it’s some relative but they not on good terms,btohqsg
Had lawsuit over the Tai Hwa name. But judge rule that the name is not exclusive,btohqsg
So this is fake one ar,btohqsg
It is not from the Crawford lane one. That’s the OG. But the so called branch at Hong Lim did win Michelin bib but it sucks,btohqsg

Chicken rice also Michelin also not nice.,btohqsg
I very thirsty. Got sugar rush today. Maybe cycle too hard today.,btohqsg
I dunno leh I see the price I turned off,btohqsg

Still hungry and went to dabao burger king,btohqsg
Two brothers fell out over it.. now the hong Lim one is by one branch of the family and their son.. the branches are all franchises and they really CMI,btohqsg
