Hello gents Is oil leak common for an used car? I decided not to take it but could not get my deposit back as the dealer says it's wear and tear issue.,btohqsg
Oil leak is probably one of the most common wear and tear,btohqsg
Dealer usually only give warranty for engine gearbox.,btohqsg
But beware of dealer warranties.  Covering everything isn’t everything.,btohqsg
They will specify which parts are covered ma,btohqsg
Workshop said the leak from valve,btohqsg
One year used different from ten year used too sir,btohqsg
They will. Then a lot tell you afterwards it covers only total failure.,btohqsg
For warranty  they said only 1month,btohqsg
