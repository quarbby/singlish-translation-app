Hi Friends  just sharing.CIMB Visa Infinite if your annual income is below $120k  on website it says can apply with fixed deposit of $50k.Previously i applied online and anyhow key in $120k as my income and shared with them my FD account number but was rejected.Upon contacting CSO  they told me need to go branch and apply as Secured credit card.Go down branch already  they say need to pledge the FD and auto renew yearly  also only for the 12months FD. (Im on the 18months FD  cannot and need to take out and put into 12 monthsâ€¦)Just FYI  in case someone here is interested.To me  i think its not worth the hassle and prefer not to auto renew my CIMB FD annually.,btohqsg

Hey guys  for normal monthly basic spending  what would you all recommend for cash back credit card? Iâ€™m puzzled between UOB One card and Citi cash back,btohqsg
Citi prestige is way better then for your infinite visa usage.  unlimited priority pass for you and +1.  Every 4th consecutive hotel night is free via Citi concierge but the per night rates are higher,btohqsg
Citibank Cashback wanna claim their Cashback a bit troublesomeNeed to send sms  I cancelled the cb+ and switch to UOB.Not sure if the normal CB is same as +,btohqsg
Cimb visa infinite is zero annual fee for life,btohqsg
Is Amaze excluded from UOB Krisfkyer for overseas dining?  I only saw amaze transit as excluded MCC.Iâ€™m basically looking for a card to pair with amaze that overseas dining that is not from Citi/Scb/maybank/cimb.  I only have dbs and uob cards,btohqsg
I did mine 2 days ago in the branch. Secured 50k auto renewal 12 mth fd. If the fd rate next year is very bad  I will cancel the credit card and the auto renewal FD. Cimb infinite credit card can have 3 times free access to world wide airport lounge. No annual fees for this cardï¼Œno minimum spend required.,btohqsg
Must pay annual fees or to spend a lot to waive the fees?,btohqsg
Can't waive annual fees  or at least unheard of (other than during 2020 when nobody could travel),btohqsg
Per night rates used to be able to use Expedia  but they removed it some time in Oct this year,btohqsg
And they just removed Haute Dining too,btohqsg
"No  Amaze is not excluded. The UOB KrisFlyer card excludes transport spending  which is why the ""Amaze*Transit"" exclusion is there",btohqsg
Hi.. How useful POSB EVERYDAY CREDIT CARD other than 5% capped to 30$ Sheng Siong Supermarket..?,btohqsg
Oic. So seems like cimb infinite credit card is the only foc card with no fees that allow 3 complimentary access to airport lounge in a year.,btohqsg
I prefer Citi as it is not quarter commitment,btohqsg
just bid at least higher than current highest FD rate,btohqsg
U will get the rebate even if u dun hit the min spending...,btohqsg
Can redeem via iBanking or at outlets such as SS  or SPC outlets...,btohqsg

What about for hsbc revolution paired with fave? Can still earn 4mpd if used for dining etc? Asking as I just got both citi rewards and hsbc revo this week,btohqsg
Can have supp card. But 3 foc  access to lounge is limited to primary card holder only,btohqsg
Download rhb mobile app and register,btohqsg
By credit score AA  should be ok  but still get rejected by UOB system automatically,btohqsg
oh i thought only for existing user,btohqsg
FavePay will pass down MCC of merchant  so as long as both the MCC code of your merchant and FavePay is not explicitly stated in T&Cs to be excluded then you'll earn 4mpd,btohqsg
For the 6% cash back you mean?,btohqsg
