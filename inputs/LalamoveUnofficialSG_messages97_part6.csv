How long does cash out usually take? I placed a cash out order *last* Monday and it's still not in yet?! ü§®,btohqsg

If I keep seeing this  does it mean the app has problem or I'm banned or smth?,btohqsg
Oddle default service provider is LLM unless the eatery call their own delivery provider to deliver Oddle orders,btohqsg
There is some mechanism in the LLM job list that it does not exceed a certain number of jobs available. jobs will appear in the system 6 days prior to pickup time.11.30pm now u can see a booking for 11.30pm for this Sunday. you will not see this job once u refresh (manually or auto) as this will be parked at the very very bottom of the listIf there is alot of orders  anything beyond a certain timing gets hidden. for example now is 5.30pm Saturday. 6pm orders become red. 6.15pm 6.30pm orders is still orange. if 6.15pm orders are too many (mainly oddle ones actually)  u will not see 6.30pm orders until 5.45pm cos thats when 6.15pm orders turn from orange to red. If a 7pm order appears at this time  please dont refresh the list else u will not see the order once the refresh is done. then u have to patiently wait for the order to appear again which can be triggered by the Oddle account or something else.Good luck securing jobs during peak hours. plan your routes in town wisely so that you will not get love letter or kena app ban due to unintended cancellation.,btohqsg
Thanks for ur explanation. But nowdays  advanced orders don't become red until less than 10mins b4 their pickup time. For example  a 630pm order will be yellow even until 620pm. After that it will disappear and appear again as immediate order if it wasn't taken by any drivers,btohqsg
