Via axs or which mode of payment if using uob card?,btohqsg
Just to simplify (pun intended)  all contactless VISA  MasterCard and NETS cards are auto-enrolled into the SimplyGo program. Just (paywave) tap in and tap out with your card. Thatâ€™s all.The SimplyGo app is purely to track your journey  fare amounts and raise disputes. It has nothing to do with registering or anything.Please  oh please tap in and out with the same exact card. Physical tap in  physical tap out. Mobile tap in  mobile tap out. Watch tap in  watch tap out.,btohqsg
Physical card tap in  mobile tap out is equal to two separate transactions and youâ€™ll be charged higherâ€¦ mean you enter station / bus without exiting and you exit station / bus without entering  incurring maximum fares for both instead of one single fare. ðŸ¥²Why? Because your card number is different on different device so system thinks you use different cards although itâ€™s same card. Lol.,btohqsg
Yup.. that's where SimplyGo app comes in... Wrong device can use the app to claim back the extra charge for using wrong device.. they are very forgiving,btohqsg
Trueâ€¦ but with this knowledge (and lesson learnt for me)  can avoid inconvenience. ðŸ˜… Almost SimplyNoooo when I see the posted statement.,btohqsg
Anyone can assist. 2 questionsBackground:I have a housing loan to reprice / refinance soon (march). I think is reprice. Have to do it with the same bank.1. Is it worth putting in 200k with the bank to get a better housing loan rates? Was contemplating the 200k opportunity cost. My loan is about 1M.2) I have 400k for investment but want to be rather conservative. FD? Other than FD  is there other alternative? Looking at 2- 3 yrs horizon.TIA!,btohqsg

Seems that cimb auto renew fixed deposit. I thought withdraw option was selected during placement. Does anyone know how to redeem?  Can't find where and how to do it.  Thks,btohqsg
Would like to check about CPF vcsa  I understand that we can contribute directly to our SA. Questions I have below:1. Are we still able to do VCSA after 55 when our SA went into RA?2. If we cannot withdraw $ from SA (after 55 and already met FRS in RA)  how can we maximize SA for our retirement?Thanks in adv for the advice.,btohqsg
Yup.  Seems that this is only way.  Thought can do it online.  But can't find the option from online.  Interest only 3.15.,btohqsg
RSTU*You can top-up RA after 55 till ERS. Anything topped up to RA will contribute to CPF Life payouts.Highly unlikely to still not be able to withdraw from SA if hit FRS in RA as they use the reserved funds first to form RA. To maximise is to leave it inside and get 4.08% p.a unless you really need it  instead of withdrawing all the available funds past FRS. You'll need to do shielding so that they'll use OA to form RA.,btohqsg
UOB kris flyer shouldn't be a problem right? For health screening at private institutionsHave already fulfilled the $800 requirement,btohqsg
Hi Chris  when I click on your link to apply dbs live fresh  it directed me to the dbs website which show cashback of 150$ only.,btohqsg
1) How much interest will you save from the lower/ better housing loan rates by placing the 200K in the bank. How comfortable are you with the 200K investing in higher risk instruments that generate returns which surpass the interest you are  saving by investing this amount vs. placing in the FI2) Corporate Bonds maybe ? But I guess one needs to be an Accredited Investor. There are gurus here that can assist on thisMy 2 cts worth,btohqsg
Read the whole message. You need to apply the promo code. Make sure you don't hold any DBS/POSB CC in the past 12 months.,btohqsg
Oh. Meaning after applying through dbs website. Apply the promo code ? I tot the website straight forward show $388.,btohqsg
