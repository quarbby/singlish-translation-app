Dear team I'll take this opportunity to thank you all amazing people once again too,btohqsg
Other than what others have replied  you might want to note that  it doesn't matter it's SGQR or what other QR  it matters what app you use to make the payment.With the same SGQR  if you use bank app to pay  obviously there is no rebate since they directly deduct from ur bank account.You use Google Pay Paynow  maybe you will get some reward. That is given by Google Pay itself. And the reward will directly send to your Paynow account.If you use Amex Pay to pay  you earn Amex CC points/cashback.If you use XNAP to pay  you earn the linked credit card reward/points.I think if you use Alipay wechat pay will earn the respective reward also.So the same SGQR  different payment method yields different result. Please rephase your question.,btohqsg
