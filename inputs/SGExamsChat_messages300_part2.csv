usually  but some schools like my school doesnt. for example right  we dont learn partial fractions while learning polynomials. we are only taught partial fractions when we do integration (integration of ln functions) - this is for addmath,btohqsg

i dont take econs can you spare the technical terms HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
If you want to take just take  why bother if other's do it? haha,btohqsg
I've only known people that retook As  not Os  but most of them did use some external help e.g. tuition  but for the one that I know didn't did improve by 1 grade? There's quite a few posts on retaking on the subreddit  so you can look for it! :),btohqsg
Yea me I took Os last year,btohqsg
I self study  v ex if wanna go institution,btohqsg
Ofc that being said I have tuition this year unlike last year,btohqsg
My L1R5 for Os was 26,btohqsg
Actually to retake  I just briefly looked the poly courses n since theres not much I just whack and wait till they accept me then I reject the enrolment package(this one need to call them/or they will call you to double confirm ur not gonna take up the course),btohqsg
Do anyone have notes for hist paper 2?,btohqsg
For me it was the immense pressure from studying in express classes. Then  I wasn't in the right mind either lol my mind couldn't take the pressure.,btohqsg
Cause I transferred to express class  then I didn't know the pace would be that fast. Personally  there's not enough time to relax or settle in tbh,btohqsg
Was forcing myself to study at that point yada yada boom here,btohqsg
I retook every subj  only had tuition for 2 subj,btohqsg
Rest is either last min crash course/free tuition etc. thru reddit,btohqsg
Idk for other sch but for mine  to retake in my sch  need to meet its criteria like u fail english and 2 other subjevts,btohqsg
But unfortunately I didn't  lol but ngl  I was planning to study at home anw,btohqsg
If ur planning to retake hor and u didn't meet ur sch criteria to retake  you needa consider no. Of subjects ur retaking  the price of those subjects. Btw there's also application fee or smth,btohqsg
Cos my sch Cher told me to  since he confirmed with me that I was retaking so those are the steps to take to ensure I can become a private candidate,btohqsg
hello anyone have the Bio 2021 answers??,btohqsg
