Why r u surprised  UOB has the most subtle take your money conditions,btohqsg
for the DBS Woman‚Äôs World card  within the calendar month if i spend the first 2k on offline purchase(2k cap hit) and on a later date spend another 2k online purchase do i still get the 10x point for the 2k online purchase or it would be consider offline spend ?,btohqsg
Good question. You called in to cs. The cs will advice you best to ask the merchant itself.,btohqsg
I will also like to know what purchase fall under qualify category.Previously i called in to cs. They informed me that all my previous purchases are not qualify for the cashback.,btohqsg
Nope but u need to check if it is in block of $5 spend,btohqsg
Online bonus point only for online  if u spend offline u get based point,btohqsg
Your purchases from these merchants look eligible. CSO might be smoking you,btohqsg
Hi I was wondering too  did you get any answer for this?,btohqsg
That what I think of at first.Called in to the credit card department. They told me not qualify as the merchant codes is different. All depend on the merchant. Best to check with the merchant.However  out of goodwill they extended the deadline for me.,btohqsg
Think they mistaken with yuu merchants. I spent all on lazada and qualified,btohqsg
Does maybank take a long time for credit card application?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if citi payall can pay insurance premium to AIA?https://milelion.com/2020/08/20/citi-payall-now-supports-insurance-premiums-invoice-payments-donations-and-more/,btohqsg
Thanks. Is there other options for me to check other than call in? Or is there a reward department for me to check?,btohqsg
thanks for reply  so the 2k cap on points u can earn is solely for online spend right? that mean offline spend wont deduct from the 2k cap right?,btohqsg

Hello everyone  may I ask if citi rewards master card + instarem amaze card combo can be used if your phone doesn't support nfc? If can  how do I do that?,btohqsg
Amaze+ CRMC can be added to Gpay  apple pay  Xnap  etc...Depends on what are the payment systems the merchant can accept as well...,btohqsg
Thank you. Any idea how many days for payment to go through,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt use this feature so I can‚Äôt advise. But@ChrisHMSGrecently shared on this in the video but I don‚Äôt think he mentioned turn around time for transaction to be settled.If u set it up right  the trigger should be from IRAS. And IRAS usually triggers income tax around 5-6th of the month and if that deduction fails they will try again around 20th I think. It‚Äôs on their FAQ page.If u don‚Äôt see the deduction done  IRAS advised to log into IRAS using SingPass then check pending payments.U might want to manually pay if this happens as it might take some time for the set up between Citi and IRAS to take into effect. Manual paying during this transition is to avoid penalty imposed by IRAS for late payment.,btohqsg
can I just use the amaze card directly for payment? will I get the cashback that way?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sharing with u this as I recently set up paying of my income tax with HSBC EGA. So u and me are in similar situation just that we using different means to pay.,btohqsg
U can use physical amaze card but make sure u link the default master card in the app to the correct MasterCard before u make payment.,btohqsg
I see this way  I will be able to get the 10x points?,btohqsg
U use amaze to convert transactions to online spend right?That‚Äôs after u link the your Citi rewards to amaze and have that as default card right?So if u set up already  u can just spend on the amaze card and it will auto charge to your Citi rewards card and u can log into Citibank app later to check.If u never set up correctly  u can‚Äôt even charge the spending to amaze. The transaction on amaze will decline mah,btohqsg
