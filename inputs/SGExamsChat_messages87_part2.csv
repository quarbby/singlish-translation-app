I wish i hadnt sold my gc,btohqsg
That's why my math failed uh,btohqsg
Okay this group is giving me different kind of degen vibes now,btohqsg
@i_want_sushiiiiiiiiiiialso pls hahahaha you say ez,btohqsg
Imma go back to do my stuff,btohqsg
U can do it by hand,btohqsg
anyone here took CS2030 or CS2040?,btohqsg
Is that what you say to MW?,btohqsg
Just determine if there's even or odd amount of terms,btohqsg
is it challenging for non-java people to take?,btohqsg
it's fun if you love oop,btohqsg
cs1010e is kinda my core mod but not really,btohqsg
Ok i go work it out now,btohqsg
tbh i dont enjoy cs to any extend,btohqsg
Transition to java is not hard,btohqsg
is just a minor in cs is quite good,btohqsg
oh then you'll probably struggle a lil,btohqsg
those complaining about it are probably lazy,btohqsg
That can be said for most languages hahaha,btohqsg
cuz my only concern is transition from py to java,btohqsg
Esp if u are weak in ur 1010,btohqsg
Not going to lie  pretty straight forward,btohqsg
is python the only language you know?,btohqsg
i feel like im ok with 110e,btohqsg
If u can solve in pseudocode u can solve using any syntax,btohqsg
i can pick up java during cb ah,btohqsg
my friend also sent me his cs1010j notes for a heads up,btohqsg
But isn't the promo code 4 digit? O.o,btohqsg
then you'll probably struggle to get used to it being strongly typed,btohqsg
as in the difference in java and py? cuz i heard java is a lot more demanding in defining variables and stuff,btohqsg
Duh cause u cant enter negative number inside lol,btohqsg
Hahaha sorry i am stuck at here,btohqsg
I forgot the next few steps,btohqsg
sorry im still quite new to cs,btohqsg
U have to declare the type,btohqsg
Need to recap ðŸ˜… mind not working now,btohqsg
had no prior knowledge before taking 1010e,btohqsg
my friend told me abt it,btohqsg
So itâ€™s either 5 or 0 if youâ€™re lazy to find no of terms,btohqsg
your number = 1 in python is int number = 1; in java,btohqsg
And java have many diff keywords,btohqsg
