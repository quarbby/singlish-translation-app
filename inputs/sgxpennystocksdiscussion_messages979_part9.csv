If buy 100 lots can get 3k issit,btohqsg
YesAfter XD don’t know how leh,btohqsg
So meaning they must push above 12,btohqsg
Or they might push high then after dividend still standing at 11🤣,btohqsg
If use moomoo or tiger the dividend how to subscribe than when will the dividend money in?,btohqsg
I give you an example  you buy Chasen shares at 0.11 for 1000 shares at $1100  you get $300 dividend  how long does bank pay you $300 for interest based on a $1100 deposit. The rationale for special dividend is that the share price will drop more that 3 cents after XD but given Chasen share is undervalue  how long will it take for investor to recoup the 3 cents special dividend. If it’s anywhere between 1-3 years  it’s still worth it for me but for the really good investors they would not want to have their capital stuck thus BB may not be interested in Chasen at all,btohqsg
After chasen paid out dividends can go pok kai?,btohqsg
No leh…they still have leftover for their operations and to invest in other business,btohqsg
Push up 50% then we believe,btohqsg
worst strategy for chasen to buyback share using company cash after XD     next years the profit wouldnt be good  cannot justify the buyback !! smart boss will invest the money into  business with better yield !! just to highlight  currently for the buyback  the company can save on the 3 cents dividend !!,btohqsg
They buy back themselves so keep e dividends,btohqsg
aiyo    buyback as the treasury shares     freeze it  no dividend given !!,btohqsg
if u rem  Nordic  the company boss very smart     keep buyback shares at lower prices  and use it to buy over a company with the existing treasury shares (marked it at higher price)  meant the company make profit from buying back shares and sold it to another party !!,btohqsg
this is good for the company     ,btohqsg
recent BAD example   DBS CEO use share buyshare strategy to push up the DBS share price after the result announcement  then he cash out his holdings     very cunning person  useless CEO  which created so many hoo-ha in the company IT system during his term as a CEO !!,btohqsg
Spend $ do share buyback now sell the shares and collect money.....in/out neutral.,btohqsg
look at the average purchase price first !!  sold at 42 cents to the seller(company that nordic brought over),btohqsg
typo error    should be BAD example !!,btohqsg
