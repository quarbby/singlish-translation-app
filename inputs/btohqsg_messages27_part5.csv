Anyone has chosen the top level for new BTOs?Is there any potential issue?.Last time people used to say there might have roof leakage   hotter etc.Not sure if new BTO flats with the water tank on top will have any potential problems. Thanks in advance...,btohqsg
They say it is warmer for top level units - I am not sure if this is still true,btohqsg
To be safe  get a civil engineer  an electrical licensed worker to design and install wirings and fittings  licensed plumber to install piping and bca certified specialist contractors to renovate,btohqsg
If not  anyone less is underqualified haha,btohqsg
Hi   may I ask if I used up this year for my current flat  assume next year I got my BTO key collection  can I claim it again?,btohqsg
Looking at the rate. Jurong west not very popular. Potentially can get for 1st timer that applied 3-5rooms,btohqsg
If first timer allocations not filled up  will that give second timers higher chances?,btohqsg
ya heard will end up as SBF,btohqsg
It will end up in SBF then OBF.,btohqsg
yes it will. see ulu pandan vista and Alexandra peaks from dec 2023,btohqsg
Must be willing to pay high cost bah if u want to engage engineer and Bca specialists all these.,btohqsg
Yeah  our government got regulate one. It‚Äôs just high cost.,btohqsg
Any other certs is just HDB DRC  and only specialised in demolition only. Masonry works got no governing body one haha. Have to be patient,btohqsg
Use ID you have to submit to fate which group of pre-existing contractors they using  cannot choose and normal people won‚Äôt know how,btohqsg
Wah I thought as long only 300 applicant but 400 flat all will likely get the flat. Didn't know it will flow to sbf. For geylang meaning there is 14.5 for 2nd timer mean 14pax fighting for 1 unit?,btohqsg
Bedok 4 rooms.. sigh.. high demand..,btohqsg
Jurong West is like sure get,btohqsg
True. If any 1st timer that really want bto without relying on luck better choose jurong west,btohqsg
Yes. Limited allocation of unit for 2nd timer. 5-15% only.For example:4/5room allocation is 5% only.300 x 5% = 15 unit only for 2nd timer3room allocation is 15% only(standard bto).300 x 15% = 45 unit only for 2nd timer,btohqsg
üò≠looks like my chance is very lowww.,btohqsg
All along I thought 500 units than 400 applicant all will get it.,btohqsg
Below 7K combine income then can Apply while waiting for your keys,btohqsg
So what's your questions is about?,btohqsg
U need to check in hdb website every even month will out the place to apply,btohqsg
Yes this is correct  can do some self analysis based from old bto projects,btohqsg

3 room 155 units fighting for a total of 85 applicants (29 first timer and 56 second timer)Application rate for first timer 0.2Last queue called 88 (include mgps/GRO double queue),btohqsg
HDB only reserve 95% of flat for first timer if application rate for first timer below 1  more second timer will be balloted with first timer and may get even better queue than a first timer.,btohqsg
Ya  that‚Äôs why I say this is based on real life past data haha.Is like hdb say top floor doesn‚Äôt have high ceiling  believe anot  only when collect key then know.I applied Alexandra peak with a first timer rate 0.8 for 730 units  I was expecting a queue number within (730x0.95x0.8 =554.8)But I got 72x queue number  and I called HDB and they say application rate below 1  more second timer get invited that‚Äôs why which is ridiculous. I had feedback to them and I hope they will change the system?,btohqsg
You can dig out all the projects that has application rate below 1 and do analysis. Some projects only have 0.1 0.2 application rate. Quite easy to analyze,btohqsg

I also belongs to the 5%üòµ‚Äçüí´ looks like this one is like chances super slim but if jackpot will be damn damn lucky,btohqsg
Chances cannot say one . All is based on luck,btohqsg
I mean there are numbers under senior n singles  which one applicable to me or non,btohqsg
Please give HDB a call  they can better answer you.1800-225-5432,btohqsg
I also belong to the 5percent,btohqsg
wow u stay woodlands? u applied any bto in oct or already secured a unit?,btohqsg
ThanksI am referring to the numbers under the column not the eligibility,btohqsg
"Just call them anyways  we're not HDB and I understand that you've asked this multiple times already :"")It's better to check with the authorities for the most verified source of info! üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It is a new PLH model after all.",btohqsg
Just apply Jurong West. Highest chance to get any,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt be a first timer if you have taken HDB grant for your resale. But you should be under seniors. Have to call HDB to understand better however. Your situation is very unique for most of the people here to know how to advice  hope u get what u want,btohqsg
Refer to yr HFE letter. Go to ‚ÄúNew‚Äù tab instead of Resale. It state type of flat eligible to buy. If you are eligible for 2rm short lease or upto 99 years  refer to senior column and opt for senior priority scheme during application.,btohqsg
hey guys! came across something interesting  I noticed that the flat prices will increase from the lowest level to the highest  so far normal rightbut except for both the highest and second highest level flats  they are priced the sameanyone knows why?,btohqsg
Normally people prefer the second highest unit over the top floor,btohqsg
second highest unit is better if can choose?,btohqsg
