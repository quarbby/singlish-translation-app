@Jngngi see you have followed me thanks !,btohqsg
nice. no need wash my car,btohqsg
Rain water ph different will damage ur car. Good to coat or wax.,btohqsg
left 2 yrs Coe  don't really care much. lols,btohqsg
but from time to time will get a wash,btohqsg
I got 7 year more haha,btohqsg
after that change car. dunno go cerato or fd,btohqsg
Comparing to fd and cerato.. I believe the cs3 manual is way faster.,btohqsg
I don't want Volkswagen  I want horseswagon,btohqsg
all I know manual have better pick up than auto. because auto go the gearing lag,btohqsg
Or someone can attest to that.. I not v firm also,btohqsg
But I got see cs3 fly before üòÇ,btohqsg
But cerato and fd is on,btohqsg
That's why he ask you pick vw,btohqsg
But gearbox repair is another story,btohqsg
But I will still choose manual any day,btohqsg
But also see which car. When I drive cerato the pedal position I got no way to do heel toe,btohqsg
No matter how I try I cannot,btohqsg
But cerato I can do double clutch because the rev fall so slow  euro r I cannot üòÇ,btohqsg
The needle falls faster then can double clutch to 3rd,btohqsg
Speaking of manual  i feel like changing my 5 spd manual to 6 spd manual  think ok anot. Im driving a kia forte btw,btohqsg
Yep  i‚Äôve found a scrapyard selling 6 spd gearbox and a workshop that knows how to change,btohqsg
how about change my auto to manual?? got or not?,btohqsg
If price is good I think why not right üòÅ,btohqsg
I heard if change from auto to manual need lta approval  vice versa from manual to auto,btohqsg
Total cost is about 1.3-1.5 including labor and parts,btohqsg
Maybe find someone with it and test drive see if you like it,btohqsg
I know kia someone ever changed the final drive to get better acceleration,btohqsg
Oh but this one sacrifice top speed and higher torque eh,btohqsg
But realistically you not going to run top speed,btohqsg
So a bit more stress on the engine,btohqsg
I go 90 my rev almost touching 3k rpm liao,btohqsg
On cerato it's definitely more stress,btohqsg
But gearbox is definitely one way to get more acceleration,btohqsg
Maybe following months i do  then see how the diff,btohqsg
Change to 6 spd can but using what car model and drive shaft,btohqsg
Workshop owner say can be done ah,btohqsg
Change final drive and / drive shaft and gear ratio,btohqsg
