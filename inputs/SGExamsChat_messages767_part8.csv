Actually you will know a GE is coming when suddenly got more chicken wings,btohqsg
Nah I think it’s going to happen in second half of this year,btohqsg
Oh well that means I need to travel to the Singapore embassy and cast my votes again,btohqsg
pls happen second half of the year,btohqsg
We’ll see. I think most analysts think it’ll happen this year,btohqsg
Former MP Inderjit Singh also thinks so in the interview with him,btohqsg
I can’t even vote yet but that means whole day free at least,btohqsg
Maybe this upcoming election is like a very close tie,btohqsg
Nah. I think they will still get their 2/3 majority even if the opposition makes some more gains,btohqsg
If I recall during the previous election  its like 61% vs 39%,btohqsg
You living in what country now?,btohqsg
I kind of want to work there but idk if it’s a bad idea,btohqsg
Only time will tell. They probably all planned it out by now  but once the electoral boundaries review committee releases their report it’s very likely a GE would happen within 1-4 months,btohqsg
It seems that they are losing like 8% of the votes from 2016 to 2020,btohqsg
If the trend continues it will become a close tie,btohqsg
I don’t think the swing would be that huge tbh. Only slightly. Perhaps something a little worse than the 2011 performance  so I’d think high 50s percent,btohqsg
maybe they will gain two grc,btohqsg
Their popular vote share probably wont swing so much,btohqsg
And also it rly depends on the quality of candidates fielded in each constituency and the party contesting,btohqsg
Doesn't matter lmao the popular vote doesn't correlate to GRCs,btohqsg
Once the map come out then we know,btohqsg
Maybe they break up West Coast and East Coast,btohqsg
Sekali West Coast grc is gone,btohqsg
East Coast with Nicole Seah gone I feel like the incumbents wont lose yet (for now),btohqsg
They won't touch the Opposition ward tho,btohqsg
But I’m curious if Potong Pasir SMC will be gone,btohqsg
Ah yes the lowest population seat,btohqsg
By rite they should break up AMK,btohqsg
They will try to get Aljunied,btohqsg
Also Chiam’s set of 27 years,btohqsg
They give up for Hougang liao,btohqsg
lol with the current slate of candidates it’s very unlikely they would win. Not a single minister there,btohqsg
In 2015 they should’ve gone all in and sent a heavyweight team but too bad  the boat has sailed,btohqsg
U think that would have made a difference? Lmao,btohqsg
What if AMK candidate switch with Aljunied?,btohqsg
AMK is carried by him lol that's why it's the most unequal grc,btohqsg
In 2015 WP team got like 51% of the votes. Ofc it would. The pap team didn’t even have any heavyweights then. If let’s say george Yeo contested with PM lee in Aljunied no way they’d lose,btohqsg
Too bad George Yeo decided to retire from politics also,btohqsg
That's because they newly redistrict that,btohqsg
In 2015 there wasn’t any boundary changes to Aljunied I thought,btohqsg
I need to look it up again,btohqsg
Actually what's the sentiments in Singapore these days?,btohqsg
There's the Fengshan SMC cut off tho,btohqsg
Charles Chong actually said in an interview he suggested sending a heavyweight team to Aljunied grc in 2015  but in the end when they didn’t he said he was frustrated the leadership didn’t take up his suggestion,btohqsg
Yeah but I was talking about Aljunied,btohqsg
I am not in Singapore so I really have no idea what the sentiments these days are,btohqsg
They could’ve won it in 2015 but didn’t send a better team,btohqsg
All I know is things in Singapore are getting way way expensive now,btohqsg
Charles Chong is a former pap mp,btohqsg
It was reported in the press,btohqsg
