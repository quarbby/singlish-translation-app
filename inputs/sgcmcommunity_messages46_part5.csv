Then he must be a high pay phv,btohqsg
agreed bro. stay safe and all the best man🫶🫶,btohqsg
I also want to be phv then,btohqsg
Then every day at home shake leg  if he told me he 1 day earn 500$ as PHV driver,btohqsg
I 1 day have to pay him 500,btohqsg
X 13 days vehicle downtime that’s crazy bro,btohqsg
Actually I like talking in here.. cos I feel like it’s always a sharing point,btohqsg
And people are quite engaging here so it’s quite fun,btohqsg
We never know when it becomes our term… so good to share,btohqsg
Bro. 29k sgd no problem.. If you ask me to pay 100k sgd vs a live  I’ll still pay 100ksgd,btohqsg
But hopefully I won’t have to face this,btohqsg
aside from being a mazda+volvo echo chamber everything is fine 😘,btohqsg
Just a pro tip also for u all.. when u all accident etc. some tips to take note of,btohqsg
Bro Volvo the best la say real,btohqsg
i need to promote mazda too,btohqsg
How come they never advice you don't make a report😜,btohqsg
Rmb to participate in our current giveaway! We are giving away 1x Ceramic coating + full detailing worth $400🥳Details are in the pinned message!,btohqsg
Nissan also good  can run even with bald tyres,btohqsg
Haha because this kind of accident  even if I make a report  it’s a bit pointless.,btohqsg
I made a report at my insurance reporting centre  that’s all.,btohqsg
But if I rear end him  there’s really nothing much for me to dispute about,btohqsg
Unless I have evidence that he has ebraked on the road when there’s no obstacle in front of him,btohqsg
Or if I can put a video together to show that he was intentional in causing the accident,btohqsg
Otherwise this kinda accident relatively clear cut,btohqsg
No video camera in ur car?,btohqsg
If you’re prepared to contest the charges  tell your insurance company that you reject the claims  and you + your insurance company surveyor can systematically go through the claims,btohqsg
As long as it is not accepted  they can’t go ahead with the repair anyway,btohqsg
Unless they have some side arrangements with their workshop which would be illegal  all they get is restitution and no cash anyway.,btohqsg
$8k for a 13 day repair job doesn’t sound that crazy to me but I don’t know lah. Me not even a driver. 🤷🏻‍♂️ sounds serious to even need 13 days. Repair back at AD?,btohqsg
That one is true. I’ve seen it happen to my Papa before. Clear cut driver making illegal turn on a non turning lane  turn into my Pa’s car  can write until my Pa was speeding on inner lane in his charade and trying to say it should be 50:50 instead. Some more my Pa so nice. Stopped and asked the lady driver is she is alright and needs ambulance.,btohqsg
$8k repair for Ad repair is possible. I asked for my own damage before and was quoted $10k… but I did the repairs outside for $650,btohqsg
But if he is asking for private settlement  I would expect that the settlement for that knock won’t exceed $2k,btohqsg
