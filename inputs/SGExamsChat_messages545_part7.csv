i wish you all the best at saving up to visit turkey,btohqsg
i dont know what it is,btohqsg
depends on the type of balding you haveDermatologist will find out the actual reasoning.The most common solution without visiting one however is using minoxidil  Its a aliment that thickens hair strands and prolong the growth of hair.https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/374/Topical-Minoxidil,btohqsg
Hair in a can works by attaching positively fabricated hair strands to a negatively charged surface like a natural human hair.Because of this reasoning  hair in a can wont be effective on bald spots as they are void of negatively charged hair strands to stick on.,btohqsg
is it possible that health illness can lead to balding ? cause i battle w long term illness since sec 1,btohqsg
if it implicates your intake of iron or Vitamin D. But still visit a dermatologist if you have a longterm illness.If you have yet to use Minoxidil  then try it. If you have and the balding still persist. It could be one of the many factors mentioned above^,btohqsg
