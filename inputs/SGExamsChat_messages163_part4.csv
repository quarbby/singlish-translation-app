Because it was how to improve the WR. We were trying to find a solution to the littering conundrum in Singapore,btohqsg
HAHAHA tbh I really dk how students these days survive PW. EOM literally forces your group mates to contribute ideas for the WR  scrapping it made it optional lol.,btohqsg
Ok la pw was fine for me,btohqsg
My grp met only thrice in the entire yr  and that was enough,btohqsg
My group never even meet once,btohqsg
In this chat: old men reminiscing PW HAHA,btohqsg
Our group met so much I couldn’t count,btohqsg
My WR was one of the first in the school to be completed. No further comments. I was unhappy  so I went to edit the WR further to make it nearly perfect,btohqsg
But it’s always me convening the meeting,btohqsg
the best is yet to be,btohqsg
and forever yet to be tbh,btohqsg
I still remember that ridiculous groupmate of mine that was fretting and asking me if I think she’ll get A in results release day when she’s the same person that started on her EOM on the national deadline lol,btohqsg
Reminds me of Modus PonensIf P  then Q.PTherefore Q,btohqsg
I said yes  but of course deep down was hell no  I bet if I said no she’ll blame me for cursing her haha,btohqsg

We met everyday for 1-2month straight except Sunday from morning to 9-10pm,btohqsg

Take note of the subj code in TYS,btohqsg
cos ive seen advice encouraging redoing,btohqsg
Yea if you want to redo do this,btohqsg
Idk  I wouldn't redo if im u,btohqsg
Actually... when did you finish it,btohqsg
Cos if u do it once and understood it  redoing is like pointless cos u alrealdy learn how to do it and solved it already,btohqsg
Should expose to more new qn,btohqsg

If you completed it like 5 months ago  probs should redo,btohqsg
Redo the qn you had issue with  not the qn u ale know,btohqsg
I have a friend who told me he redo the TYS for chem like 3-4 times,btohqsg
Like he went from 2017 to 2008  den go back to 2017,btohqsg
And he only got like B3 in the end,btohqsg
Does one have so much time,btohqsg
Okay  application questions are like comprehension passages. Read the info carefully to answer,btohqsg
