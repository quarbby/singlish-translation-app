Hi does anyone know  if I link my Amaze card with UOB priv master card (2.4mpd for oversea spending)  will I still get the 2.4mpd for oversea spending? Cos it seems like Amaze is the one doing the conversion?,btohqsg

Hmm okay  but heard there is a cap for the amount of OCBC$ that can be earned a year tho,btohqsg
Not really worth it unless you‚Äôre eyeing for the sign up bonus which is spend 8k and get miles . There is better deals around,btohqsg
Ah okay  thank you so much!,btohqsg
Hi guys   just want to know   if I‚Äôm using OCBC titanium + Instarem amaze . Will I get the 4mpd if it‚Äôs charged in taobao app anyone knows ?,btohqsg
Excuse the ignorance but are mpd points calculated based on the statement balance or the total spend throughout the statement period? E.g. Spend $1000 but return $500 (within the statement month). Are points calculated based on the $1000 spend or the statement balance of $500?,btohqsg
Amaze converts to sgd so no FCY rate,btohqsg
Thank but will the Amaze via uob priv MasterCard gain 2.4mpd as priv card only give 2.4mpd for overseas spending.,btohqsg
Or else I get only 1.4mile,btohqsg
If u use amaze it is sgd so its always 1.4 miles. But transactions above 10sgd will get u the 1% cashback. If u want the 2.4 miles you should use the card on its own and pay the 3.25% fcy charge. So depends on what u want,btohqsg
I think it is a fair deal. With privi I would likely just take the 1% cashback anyway  since the extra fcy charge is not worth the 1.4 additional miles anyway. Would be slightly different if its a 4mpd card so really depends on your preference and use case,btohqsg
Haha understand. But uob don't have a MasterCard for men that allows higher mpd,btohqsg
Haha yea no worries. Just saying that if a hack feels too good to be true (i.e getting foreign currency miles but charged in sgd)  then it likely is. üòÖEither review your use case and consider using other cards (e.g. Crmc) or just live with whatever u have  no right no wrong üëç,btohqsg
