Good closing today for Amplefield too. Hope they can gain momentum from here. Good luck to whoever vested on this one too. has retraced quite a bit. about time i reckon.,btohqsg
Aizai. 3 lot nia 2.18. At least $3,btohqsg
Still vested  but ave price around 38.. So hope it can inch back up.....,btohqsg
Just don't know why JT cannot go up. Maybe no confident in China company or S chip.Current quarter profit will be huge  my estimate more than Rmb 60m. PE ratio based on 2020 earnings 3 times only.,btohqsg
They should give a maiden dividend this year so to get a re rating,btohqsg
Ya I think some bad experiences with Luckin coffee and others. Results can be unaudited for years. Not sure how that is allowed.,btohqsg
JT 1pip alone need clear 10m+ walls,btohqsg
If in play  volume easily hundreds of million,btohqsg
Yea  🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 hopefully. Slow and steady.,btohqsg
JT controlled heavily very tricky BB inside.Seems like want to break up but cannot break up,btohqsg
Very disappointed with MT le...2 days green  1 day red... thought today supposed to chiong...,btohqsg
PCK  so how? 😭😭 Maybe next week 1.6??,btohqsg
