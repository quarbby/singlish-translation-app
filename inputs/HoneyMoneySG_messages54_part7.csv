Omg… 😮 I didn’t know that… thank you for the minder. 🤓🙏🏻,btohqsg
Anyone has a BOC debit card which expired before? May I know if the bank will automatically send you a new card or I have to go down to the branch to request for a new one?,btohqsg
You are absolutely correct. I actually meant my UOB prvimiles. Thank you for reminder 😁🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hmm  keeps saying card not eligible. Can anyone confirm?,btohqsg
why SimplyGo (DBS Altitude) for mrt?,btohqsg
Smart credit card from SC is best without minimum spending,btohqsg
which TnC u referring to? DBS rewards?,btohqsg
Damn getting scammed by coinbase 🥲,btohqsg
Yes   just checked they are charging fee now. Earlier sgd to usdc was free,btohqsg
What would be the alternative for this?,btohqsg
i'm now exploring miles instead of cashback strategy.. can someone point me to where i can read up more on how Amaze card can help reduce fx costs and help with my miles strategy? thanks in advance!!,btohqsg
Have you looked at the videos by HoneyMoney or articles from Milelion?,btohqsg
reading up a lot of milelion but haven’t reached amaze articles yet 😅,btohqsg
For the Citi plus promo. Under clause 5ii (c)  anyone knows what the primary relationship denotes? Does it apply for people who had a citi credit card in the past 13 months?,btohqsg
how does the cardup mortgage strategy work?,btohqsg
"Just double check where I found it.It inside the PDF for titled ""Terms and Conditions for DBS Altitude Credit Card New Cardmembers Sign-Up Promotion (“Promotion”)""I found it at the dbs altitude promotion pageBut when I go to the rewards tnc on dbs altitude card page  the PDF doesn't mention any exclusion for cardup",btohqsg
Let me know too. Most of them charge a huge spread or fees now. 🥴,btohqsg
yes  only signup promo exclude cardup,btohqsg
Because I don’t have SC smart CC and this DBS altitude earns miles for SimplyGo. 😄this is the only chance I can use this card… lol .. I need to keep this card to have 2 time of lounge access annually and get 10000 miles when paying annual fee if I have extra money to pay.. otherwise  I will request to waive it.,btohqsg
I see  that's good news thanks,btohqsg
Any advice on which cc to use for HK Disneyland tickets purchase from the official website? To minimize fx and foreign currency transactions feesCurrently have OCBC365  HSBC advance SC simply cash and SC spree cc,btohqsg
maybe Amaze+sc simply cash  based on the few cards u have,btohqsg
Maybe I shouldn’t have called it my strategy in my initial post cause that might make it sound too atas 😅 actually i should just call it  my plan. Hahawell  I just want to earn miles from anything I pay.. and recently I got my UOB prvimiles card and need to pay min 1000 sgd each month for first 2 months and pay annual fee to get the bonus miles. Mortgage is more than 1000 sgd so I don’t need to worry about not reaching min 1000 sgd per month to earn bonus miles. 😬,btohqsg
Use it when you book for plane and hotel,btohqsg
oh my uob mortgage loan has to be deducted from my uob account. how do i use the cardup method?,btohqsg
I would use DBS WWC for my hotel and flight booking online. 🤓🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hi All  planning to sign up for chiro..which card or payment method would you recommend?,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2022/04/25/great-deal-enjoy-up-to-6-mpd-and-interest-free-instalments-on-the-dbs-womans-card/I just call dbs and was told 0% processing is no longer available,btohqsg
When you apply to pay mortgage on CardUp  u just set the amount to pay  choose the date to pay  key in your UOB bank account number where the monthly mortgage Is deducted and provide the mortgage documents from UOB as the proof requested on CardUp website when applying. Then the amount you set will be credited into your UOB account on the date you set. It’s very easy. 😉👍🏻I pay my maintenance fee and income taxes via CardUp too.,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone had any experience with both OCBC360 & UOB One?Im considering between a switch from OCBC (frustrated with the save portion & Giro Salary) to UOB but seen a couple of comments that UOB service is really bad  hence quite concernedBase on my situation  UOB does offer slightly higher rates,btohqsg
If u ask me i would say ocbc service is worst then uob  been a long time customer of uob liao,btohqsg
Personal View (it may varies between individuals):-a. OCBC - Branch - Always long queue filled with auntie and uncle  i went to open account and do some stuff and the queue is relatively reasonable. Their contact centre service - abit slow and their staff abit not well train. End Up i have to complain and talked to their managerb. UOB - the branch queue not as long compare to obcb  but that time when i went to open my account  it took me 5hours. (unless if you can open online  mine cause their system got issue  hence i got no choice but to go down.) their contact centre - relatively faster and their staff sound knowledgeable and confident. one call resolution.Overall  if u ask me  UOB may be a better choice as long as u dun need their branch services.* all these are my personal experience with them and it may diff between u and me.,btohqsg
Now they trying to push everyone to online  everytime i go to branch  they say “u have to wait xxxxx hours ahh  u go home do faster”,btohqsg
I'm using both with good experience so far,btohqsg
I used both before and currently i'm using OCBC 360 now. Rates wise yes UOB edges out slightly but the downside for me is that you need to use their specific credit cards. Whereas OCBC if you use their CC is just a bonus but if not you can use whatever you are comfortable with. I prefer that flexibility la.Customer service wise  i think they are quite on par. i had both good and bad experience on both sides. 😂,btohqsg
i’ve done the switch from ocbc to uob this year and i’d say the interaction with the staff is at a minimum. only thing i dun like abt uob is their support. i reported an contactless withdrawal atm issue 6 months ago and until today not fixed.,btohqsg
Can I ask what's frustrating/ bad about the ocbc 360?,btohqsg
one thing about ocbc360 is you need to increase $500 monthly even when exceeded $100k  and you need to find a chance to reset to $100k,btohqsg
Mainly the salary crediting have to be through giro (think they just implemented giro paynow)queue is insanely long so  it's a hassle to go to their branck (gotta wait more than hour)Their save segment  to increase avg daily balance by $500 each month  although had $500 inside and even topped up $200+  avg daily still below $500,btohqsg
I do agree with the service of OCBC 🥲,btohqsg
I went during weekday. Less people.Top up $600 on first day of every month will make our life easier.,btohqsg
Just asking if I spending monthly from $3000 -$4000  what cards will be the best ?Should I use Miles cards or rebates cards ?Currently I using UOB One cards to fulfill $2000 monthly (rebates) & amex platinum (points),btohqsg
Unfortunately weekday have work 😅 i topped up $550 exact  then add on later but it was still $300++ tho,btohqsg
Depends on what stuff you're spending on though,btohqsg
You top up on first day of the month or mid month?OCBC calculates base on average daily balance. If you top up in the middle of the month  likely you need to top up $1000.,btohqsg
Everything from Dining  Transport  Utilities  Online Grocery  Telco & Streaming,btohqsg
Start of month  left it in the account after pay is in,btohqsg
Can use uob solitaire for 2 categories other cat spends cn fulfil w citi rewards / hsbc revol / ppv,btohqsg
Should I consider using or Miles card or stay put at Rebates Cards since I spending 3K monthly on general stuff.,btohqsg
Depends if you're frequent miles chaser. If not then no point u get miles but don't use. Might as well get cashback,btohqsg
