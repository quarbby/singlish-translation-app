- Easing tensions between China 🇨🇳and USA 🇺🇸.- FED says interest rates to be slowed soon- President Biden says no imminent threats of Taiwan attackGood global updates indeed for the market and the world,btohqsg
"President Xi Jinping told American counterpart Joe Biden that the world is ""big enough"" for both superpowers to prosper  and that China does not seek to challenge the US  its foreign ministry said.Xi also told Biden that Taiwan is ""the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations""  state news agency Xinhua said.https://cna.asia/3E7rTz7",btohqsg
The global energy crunch is not some fake news. Just last year even before Russian war  China and other parts of the world faced power shortage and blackout during the winter periods likely due to Covid-19 circumstancesNow  with the ongoing war in Russia  it have further worsen the ongoing energy crisisIn addition  Natural gas prices jump will have many nations turn to cheaper and dirty fuel in Coal especially since winter is coming and many are anticipation colder temperatures.GEO energy IMO are at area of value and yesterday T+4 over. Expecting it to power above $0.40 as Winter season approaches.Watch closely.,btohqsg
As long as the war is ongoing  the energy crunch the world is facing will still go on.In sg  we are the fortunate ones but out there  there are a lot of problems that we do not see.Coal would turn out to be the hero of the energy crunch IMO. Although it will lead to higher carbon emissions but would the other nations rather race intermittent power issues  blackout  people dying in the upcoming winter?No  it is simply not a choice now. Short term survival always beats long term.I won’t be surprised to ever see GEO energy above $0.60 honestly . (As long as the issue is global   anything can happen)I think this is the final flushing.DYODDSource:https://amp.abc.net.au/article/101652960,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 15 November 2022🎉💰Fed's work is unfinished; here comes the hawk💸The equity market turned softer on Monday as comments from the Fed's officials rekindled the fear of inflation. It gives the market a breather from the rally from the past week. While the October CPI has been weaker than expected  Fed Governor Christopher Waller commented on the long path ahead for the Fed to ensure its mission is accomplished. This signals more rate hikes and dampens risk-on sentiment.After all  the 7% inflation rate is still too high for a target of 2%. Hence  Pika World expects Fed governors to begin dampening sentiments of any form of Fed's pivot.💣Amazon: Finally  the cut is here🎯The e-commerce giant is expected to report a large-scale layoff  estimated to affect 10 000 workers. This comes amidst a review of cost-cutting measures  a familiar theme of tech companies these days.Rumours suggest that the cuts will hit the corporate employees the most and will likely spread to Amazon's device business. Moreover  it comes at a time when many MNCs are grappling with a slowdown in economic demand and facing dual headwinds: a higher interest rate coupled with a strong dollar.Pika World will look at possible entry levels for long-term accumulation in the tech sector.🎢What is Uncle Warren buying these days?💎According to the latest filing on Monday  Berkshire Hathaway is buying more of Taiwan Semiconductor during the third quarter while selling US Bancorp and Bank of New York. The company is also buying Chevron and  unsurprising  Occidental Petroleum.The key focus was on purchasing 60 million shares in TSM  the world's leading semiconductor producer.Does that tell us something?📮What's on the menu today?📖At 9.30 pm  we will receive the Core PPI for MoM comparison  which we expect to hit 0.3%. Likewise  the PPI for MoM for Oct is expected to remain constant at 0.4%.It is 15 November  Tuesday  at 8.56 am in Singapore and 8.56 pm in New York. It has been a swing Monday  and we hope Pika World friends have a profitable trading week ahead!,btohqsg

Gold hover near a three-month high on Tuesday (Nov 15)  as a top US central bank official's comment raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would adopt a less aggressive approach on rate hikes  while a stronger dollar kept gains in check.US gold futures fell 0.3 per cent to US$1 771.80 per ounce.The dollar index rose 0.3 per cent against its rivals  making gold more expensive for other currency holders.While gold is considered a hedge against inflation  rising interest rates tend to dull bullion's appeal as the metal pays no interest.Traders now see an 89 per cent probability of a 50-basis-point increase at the US central bank's December meeting  with only an 11 per cent likelihood of a 75-basis-point rise.SPDR Gold Trust  the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund  said its holdings rose 0.03 per cent to 910.41 tonnes on Monday from 910.12 tonnes on Friday.Speculators cut net short positions by 30 659 contracts to 8 219 in Comex gold in the week to Nov 8  the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.A gauge of global stocks ended lower on Monday and US bond yields rose as investors assessed comments from Fed officials to try and determine the central bank's path of rate hikes.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 16 November 2022🎉🍏Another sign of inflation cooling🧮The PPI had risen 8% over the year  which is lower than the 8.4% expected. Companies faced with a minor cost increase bode well for the inflation narrative. It hints that the selling prices of products could start to cool down and support a projected weaker inflation story for the future.The latest PPI data further validates the hint with the recent CPI data that inflation is possibly declining. This shows the comprehensive spread support of such a notion  and indexes could sustain their green despite geopolitical risk arising from the Ukraine war as missiles appeared to have hit NATO alliance country – Poland.🕹Is Semiconductor turnaround on the horizon?🍄As we spoke about Uncle Warren's significant investment into TSMC  stock prices of many semiconductors rose sharply. Related counters such as AMD  QCOM and NVDA also increased with the optimism for the sector.The rosy outlook is also supported by Infineon  which has revised its long-term targets upward as semiconductors demand rose and its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations. This fuels the rally as investors buy back laggards in the upward swing cycle.🎢Can the market continue?💎With the sharp recovery of the indexes  say for the S&P 500  which had recovered by around 12% from its low of 3577 in early October  investors are getting ahead of the Fed in the pivot narrative  supported by recent data implying softening inflation.For traders  the S&P 500 is at a resistance level near the 4200 and 4300 levels  where we had sold massive sellers roaming in during the early part of the year. With rising risk-on sentiments  there are high odds that the rally could continue  but sellers could return.Pika World remains cautious in the near term. On valuation ground  if S&P 500 is to rise to the expected 4200 to 4300 level  it hints at the S&P 500 reaching around 18.5 times the total per shares earnings  which the companies are expected to roll in for next year. During this year  the low we hit was around 15 times.The companies' profits will reach about 5.4% of the total price at this multiple. This is just barely 1.6% higher than the 10-year Treasury yield. The additional equity risk premium  which has been around 4%  makes that valuation less appealing.As such  while we are confident of the long-term upward trajectory of the equity market in the face of better inflation reading  Pika World is mindful of the fundamentals and may switch to a tactically conservative stance.📮What's on the menu today?📖At 9.30 pm  we will send the Retail Sales data for MoM  which we expect to hit around 1% growth from just a natural 0% in the prior period.At 10.15 pm  we will also have the Industrial production data  which is expected to rise by a smaller 0.2% compared to 0.4% earlier.FOMC member Williams is also expected to speak at 10.50 pm  which will be critical. After all  the Fed has been trying to talk down on the market to sustain the decline in asset prices  hoping to impact consumption ability.It is 16 November  Wednesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a productive day ahead!,btohqsg
