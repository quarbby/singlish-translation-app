ok the silence is unsettling somone tell me whether it worjs,btohqsg
Ok so it sends messages when you click stuff?,btohqsg
Feature Request: add SUTD thanks. Same spiel  with link to relevant places. IGP just say 'SUTD Admissions does not publish IGP',btohqsg
definitely will add more content now that it isnt crippled from errors,btohqsg
you hosting it from your computer?,btohqsg
HAHAHA dont make me use the old file and spam u back,btohqsg
Can you send an email to Prof Chong Tow Chong and ask instead  way fking above my paygrade,btohqsg
any other features i should look into,btohqsg
If not then Director Lim Su Fang,btohqsg
Ya but still  in case anyone thought serious,btohqsg
TBH I pretty sure the upper management collectively (thru meeting) decide not to publish IGP,btohqsg
And it's not one person's decision,btohqsg
no it doesnt work like that,btohqsg
Anyone know how NUS CS compares to overseas?,btohqsg
Top few in the world if I am not wrong,btohqsg
H2 Further math can retake as private candidate right,btohqsg
Meanwhile I'm here with a ACD/BBC,btohqsg
I only 6 subjects pleb mode,btohqsg
also wtf ruffles Institution half get 6 distinctions,btohqsg
Does anyone know the distinction rates are like for h3 chem for the new syllabus,btohqsg
Ah. Because I'm debating if it's worth trying to apply for overseas CS over NUS,btohqsg
If you want to compare to extreme famous unis  don't bother,btohqsg
are you aiming for any scholarships,btohqsg
for my sch 3/8 got distinction,btohqsg
Oddly enough  I heard CMU Undergrad Godlike  but its post-grad isn't as near god-like,btohqsg
I mean  I find that it's odd a uni reputation depends on what level you talking about,btohqsg
Ya  but doesn't matter I not RI,btohqsg
as compared to engineering courses what made u choose math?,btohqsg
Far from it  I actually abhor pure math,btohqsg
Apparently he was in industrial engineering,btohqsg
Don't ask me Mech or EEE. Industrial almost nobody knows either,btohqsg
because one of my supervisor who studied civil engineering told me about how 'engineering' is a facade,btohqsg
Without math there is no logic,btohqsg
he went on to talk about how buildings will collapse if he went on to become a civil engineer,btohqsg
hence he became a math teacher,btohqsg
But even other than that  Engin Math and pure math are very far apart,btohqsg
Most sciences will include varying degrees of math,btohqsg
Luckily enough  we don't do mathematics like Foundational Mathematics,btohqsg
No 1st order logic (ok I heard some of my engin friends in other uni went through 1 mod of it),btohqsg
"""I'm sorry professor  what was that word you just used?""""No  not that word  the word where you said 'today we are going through a pruuth'? What's a pruuth?""",btohqsg
But either way  no real focus on logic systems,btohqsg
a pruuuuuuuth is a set of (directed) logical statements,btohqsg
NLP is a hot area now,btohqsg
*forced to learn about number systems in different languages,btohqsg
Not sure how involved the linguists/linguistics scholars are,btohqsg
Tom Scott made a recent video about it,btohqsg
TBH some of the results are quite sick,btohqsg
Caveat: 3/8 people in your class are scholars,btohqsg
We are seeing progress in certain problems where le machine is beating hoomans,btohqsg
Don't really need 90rp to get scholarship,btohqsg
