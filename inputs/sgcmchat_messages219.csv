Coz the back looks like the same,btohqsg
first time seeing this sia  the front looks like the first Tesla roadster,btohqsg
because the first tesla roadster was based on the lotus lol,btohqsg
Or was the first lotus based on the tesla roadster?,btohqsg
Explains why they're all shit thrn,btohqsg
The Tesla roadster is a rebadged Lotus Elise,btohqsg
Why is your car a tourist attraction,btohqsg
Tesla used Lotus Elise S2 gliders (empty bodies without engine or drivetrains) for the Tesla Roadster,btohqsg
Fake news all cars came from the same base chassis of a fiat 500,btohqsg

Does anyone know a sleeper turbo BMW SUV?,btohqsg
I saw one  the torque was crazy,btohqsg
Can you hear it?The glorious music of 4.8 litre V10 at 9k rpm made and tuned by Yamaha,btohqsg
you knew it had 600hp just by looking at it?,btohqsg
ofcourse  how else can you guess hp right,btohqsg
limpehwas warned by-.Reason:no telehitch2 out of 3 warns,btohqsg
I could see the pull  the rear went down like crazy  must have insane torque,btohqsg
I also could hear the turbo spool,btohqsg
isnt tht from soft front suspension,btohqsg
ikr it couldnt have been that its just an SUV with shitty ass soft suspension that sags under load,btohqsg
Vezel must have 600hp also. I see my friend drive off with handbrake. His rear squatted like crazy too,btohqsg
Clearly u haven’t seen my 800hp one,btohqsg
This is car meet chat. Not hitcher.,btohqsg
Excuse me Mr. If ur looking for hitcher or whatever stuff can don't do it here? Go find some other hitcher or whatever gc thx,btohqsg
did the guy get his ride back,btohqsg
or is he sleeping in the river,btohqsg
those honda shuttles with blown dampers must have crazy torque too 💯💯💯,btohqsg
i can hear the turbo spool on a stock e250 when i drive it,btohqsg
hellcat in sg not registered right,btohqsg
i saw one went in sentosa,btohqsg
Hellcats are all LHD out of factory,btohqsg
There are RHD conversions in Aus but I don't think those can homologate and import to SG,btohqsg
If it's green color  that belongs to TMJ,btohqsg
He also has a Dodge Demon in black,btohqsg
yes we have none  the one you saw most likely msia plates,btohqsg
guys what’s estimated total cost for manual drivers license in sg   given that i got knowledge on driving and road laws so go for private(?),btohqsg
I think if you know your stuff can finish around/under 2k,btohqsg
under 2k ah    est how long overall,btohqsg
but usually regular ppl spend about 2.5 up to 3+ sometimes,btohqsg
yeah that’s what i heard   but they go sch and stuff,btohqsg
must see waiting times one bro,btohqsg
average agar agar how long eh  or for u how long u took,btohqsg
I also go cdc.. finish 2k/- le,btohqsg
I think nowadays ppl take about 4 - 7months? is really based on you one,btohqsg
got ppl who spend years taking license also,btohqsg
yeah cuz i hear they keep failing haha,btohqsg
okay thank you so much gang,btohqsg
pm u the link to a chat where you can ask all your license related qns bro,btohqsg
If you can pass 1st time  6 months can settle from BTT all the way to final practical,btohqsg
But usually majority is pass on 2nd or 3rd times esp for Class 3,btohqsg
Time may be longer now since most of the private instructors are old and retired now so the schools are jam packed,btohqsg
I usually tell people when u in NS  that is best time to get licence because u are free AF,btohqsg
Or at least take BTT which is you just buy the little book with all the questions and just mug like O level 10 years series,btohqsg
BTT is valid for life so you can always anytime after that start your actual lessons,btohqsg
ask the government ❌ask Soran Pryde ✅,btohqsg
Yepp  next time we got any and about driving test we can ask him liao,btohqsg
Driving licence is the cheapest life upgrade,btohqsg
At least if you out of job  you can drive taxi or grab as an option,btohqsg
Some money always better than no money,btohqsg
is it easy to get into grab,btohqsg
Who can apply?Singapore citizens aged 30 years old and above  withA valid Class 3 or 3A licenceMinimum 1 year driving experienceLess than 18 demerit points (DIPS) accumulatedIf you’re a PR or aged below 30  you may sign up as a GrabHitch driver-partner  or delivery-partner.,btohqsg
Basically for both taxi and grab  u have to be 30 years and above,btohqsg
The min of of 30 for PHV driver is a fairly new requirement  it has always been 30 for taxiMany of the rules and requirement for PHV drivers were put in place because taxi driver and company whine and moan and bitch,btohqsg
Ans of course because one taxi company belong to cheng hu,btohqsg
You know why things happen la,btohqsg
Taxi driver always have the min age of 30 and taxi company they buy taxi  COE is 8 years cannot renew,btohqsg
So Uber and later Grab come along and don't have to play by these rules. The driver no min age and car rental companies all buy 8 or 9 year old junkers for cheap  fix them up a bit and rent them out to driver and run them until COE expiry at 10 years (some even go and renew because why not  can rent out some more to get back the money spent on renew COE),btohqsg
Of course taxi driver and company not happy lol,btohqsg
my guy helped me with overseas study and then i see this 😭,btohqsg
hearsay its coming to sg soon,btohqsg
no need hide plate right its the dealer unit lmfao,btohqsg
and thats how our coe is partially fucked,btohqsg
@dorifto_liniehahaha we almost bang tht car,btohqsg
Ya pretty much.Taxi COE was taken out of the bidding in 2012  but PHV still use normal car COE,btohqsg
When you are using the car as a business tool for profit  you dare to bid high because you can always cover back by renting it out at higher rate or you just pick up more fares (if it's ur own car),btohqsg
Anyway this year cheng hu try to release more COE to lower it abit because GE2025,btohqsg
The last thing cheng hu wants is oppo party use high COE prices as an attack point against them lol,btohqsg
Also buys them time to find a more permanent solution,btohqsg

White Testarossa = either undercover cop or drug dealer,btohqsg
Normally it's fine  I've done it multiple times but haven't gone there in a while so things may be different now,btohqsg
I mean at the end of the day they are running a business,btohqsg
If they let u take pictures of the cars  very nice of them,btohqsg
But if they don't they probably have a reason for it since it's private property,btohqsg
yeah. usually it's fine but I guess they switched up now,btohqsg
talked to the security guard  he told me they don't allow photos of customer cars anymore. the showroom ofc no problems  it's open for anyone to view,btohqsg
