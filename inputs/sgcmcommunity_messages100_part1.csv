Ur car taller than me wor,btohqsg
Who not use the OEM Toyota one? Or the castrol one  those are good.,btohqsg
Arguably  you wouldn’t need Amsoil or Motul…that being said  for the sake of argument…it’s purely a personal pref. Some like Amsoil  other’s live and die by motul.Both of them are good  Motul for obvious reasons have the higher budget to do a lot of marketing and a lot of development for their oil  but Amsoil is a really good oil that a lot of people use when running their cars.Penrite is also pretty good.,btohqsg
But er..save money lah boss  go get the Castrol Edge one. Good enough.,btohqsg
Tiagong Mobil also not bad  but some swear to keep away from shell helix,btohqsg
I mean  it’s not bad  but maybe not great for high stress 🤣,btohqsg
