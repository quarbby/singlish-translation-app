The form said is ‚Äúdamaged‚ÄùBut never mention damage for what?,btohqsg
Guy takw note this is scam order. The customer being harassed by loan sharks.,btohqsg
Which one kena harassed? Bedok or Teban Gardens?,btohqsg
Well if it's a fake order there won't be anything to pick up at Bedok side  so driver will never get to Teban?,btohqsg
Every Booking Take Video and photos of Itemz and Door Unit. Cos lalamove seem Every Weird Order they also tske. Then if anything we got prove show Send was ALL ok,btohqsg
We got take photos during pick up and delivered time ma,btohqsg
Why can‚Äôt they see the photo?,btohqsg
Take pic as in take pics with camera using own camera app  not the lala one and save the pics for our own. Can be 1 week later Lala will ask for proof when we are like wtf? Pick up and dropoff already taken photo. Can puke blood one when u need to submit appeal with proof,btohqsg
Order contact is not together with booking address. I was not able to ask as the person kept telling me is a scam and sounded very frustrated.,btohqsg
I was a bedok before proceeding the 219B bedok  called the person before hand  lucky he picked up and explained the situation. If not waste trip only.,btohqsg
Thanks Bro. Yap man. They Insist no have or what really spoil our moods.,btohqsg
Pls hor. If they Play punks say not record as you no send how you prove? Even the Block  we Send and Collextion I take photos so in case say I late or go wrong DropOff. I got my OWN photos to prove,btohqsg
I picked up a pig head for loan shark before. Instruction to hang at gate.,btohqsg
Thats why Take photos of Booking and the Booking Details in xase anything they change system we got prove Allocated by lala,btohqsg
Customer say piano can hand carry. No need trolley.Reach there liao got 2 extra chairs (not declared)For $20 you all suck thumb do or cancel? ü§Ø,btohqsg
ask them to book another lalamove order lor  otherwise undertable $50 anything also can lol. but that's just me la,btohqsg
Customer never declare two chairs when confirm. customer refuse to cancel. Lala say next time ask customer for photo. ü§î,btohqsg
Oh so it's driver fault now? Omg,btohqsg
But you can tell them that under lalamove guidelines the liability for damaged goods is $100 max,btohqsg
U ask them if still ok to carry piano and chair or not,btohqsg
Initially customer say will cancel. I think have cancellations so tell me she cannot cancel. Ask me settle with CS,btohqsg
then what u can do is u can quote customer a fee then let lalamove CS modify the order.BTW best of all‚Ä¶payment for customer claims made with lala? Pay to customer with lalamove credits...LOL,btohqsg
thats why i prefer undertable/‚Äúout of system‚Äù quote lol,btohqsg
But seriously these customer dont know trying what. Pay few dollars more for Van settle their problem.,btohqsg
honestly‚Ä¶sometimes customer also blur one la,btohqsg
Hahaa ya. If only piano maybe can close one eye and help. But tell me still got two chairs.,btohqsg
Lots of customers are MisUse Lala already,btohqsg
Sleep beta heavy rain no surge,btohqsg

Pricing adjustment by CS? WTH... Driver bear all additional charges  how to work for llm?,btohqsg
erm... din see this kind of cs adjustment before.,btohqsg
that is a lot of discount for the customer,btohqsg
That's why must see properly then take job. That day I saw 1 job cs deduct $50+. Wtf! Normal rate already pathetic,btohqsg
LLM is cheating driver by delivery fee and reduce price,btohqsg
Usually if no base price I won‚Äôt take. üòÖ,btohqsg
I found it when adding last locations when the sender also adding the locations,btohqsg
Still got idiots snatched!Many restaurants charged their customers delivery fee...& those florists with multiple drop offs without base price too!(Take a look at their delivery receipt next time when delivering their food or items)They are making tons of money & yet those yao gui...I'm speechless!KNN!,btohqsg
those with multi stops but low price  suggest dont take...not worth the time and $...,btohqsg
honestly LLM is not a good platform to use also if doing multistops,btohqsg
I took medicine once  all around punggol but drive car  wapiang really damn waste time,btohqsg
must see per packet how much lor,btohqsg
i heard is $11  nett $9 per package? not sure if they add extra $ for multistop,btohqsg
Anyone driving nvan here  t2 carpark can go in?,btohqsg
So stupid Sia this deliverychinatown platform. Delivered within 30mins also complain say I late now I need to appeal. Pick up location at mrt station don‚Äôt even have parking need to park opposite HDB. Lalamove also Rabak. Their own rule is 1 hour delivery. Delivered in 30mins also wrong,btohqsg
