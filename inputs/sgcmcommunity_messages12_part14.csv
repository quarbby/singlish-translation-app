AD always higher than ws.. their so call “premium” service and bs quality checks,btohqsg
what problems are you talking about? i said there are no problems.,btohqsg
that sounds like you are worrying too much. like you think gearbox oil needs to be changed because you think it ought to,btohqsg
then why dont you change engine oil every week? that kind of analogy,btohqsg
Change at recommended interval is sufficient,btohqsg

So how long before u change out your engine oil,btohqsg
I seen people driving till 15k-20k before changing or once a year,btohqsg
Maximum 15 000kmOil filter only last 15 000km,btohqsg
10 000 – 15 000kmThe regular service interval for oil filters is generally 10 000 – 15 000km or six months to one year  depending on whichever comes first. Sakura Filters Australia says it is best to consult your log book service manual for correct service intervals.,btohqsg
The Bosch Long Life Oil Filter is built to last for 10 000 miles on vehicles that use synthetic and semi-synthetic motor oils.,btohqsg
Oil Change Rules:Car models from 2008 or a few years after should get it changed every 5 000-7 500 miles. Cars made several years after 2008 should be safe to get it changed every 7 500-10 000 miles. If you drive aggressively you might want to change it sooner rather than later.https://hondakingsport.com›,btohqsg
