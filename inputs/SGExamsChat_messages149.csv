Hci has their own version of RA,btohqsg
I think I can wait till my skeleton dissolve already,btohqsg
some hci girl say she got in some special program,btohqsg
then no tutorials or no something,btohqsg
'hci girl' way to be not vague,btohqsg
When can I expect you to change the SMB so that you can do arbitrary code execution,btohqsg
There's a reason why they have much less market share then RI and NUSH,btohqsg
How else would I know about this,btohqsg
The skill levels of students inside still differ vastly,btohqsg
While student A was considering Lyapunov exponents of C1 diffeomorphisms  student B was solving questions about Argand diagrams,btohqsg
The highest ever IQ recorded is in the 190 range I believe. But to be honest I feel that a single IQ score is not an accurate representation of someone's intelligence.,btohqsg
No one can have the ability to do differentiation in the womb  let alone when they are just born. You can't be have knowledge prior to birth,btohqsg
How does the young of a barnacle goose know it needs to drop from the cliffs to reach food....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,btohqsg
Impossible I thought they just have to play music in the womb I got scammed!üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
U got scammed the moment the wrong sperm with subpar genes infiltrated the cell,btohqsg
I didn't know risking your life to reach food was 'herd mentality',btohqsg
It was a suggestion. But anyways even if they are born with this knowledge  no one can be born with the knowledge of differentiation,btohqsg
I mean you could call it a natural instinct programmed into them to jump?,btohqsg
Like I mean idk if its nsfw but no one told babies how to suck but they still know how to uk suck,btohqsg
Haha  but that would be great  then people can start university or A levels when they are born,btohqsg
I thought we don't attack the egg? We just lay back and wait for the others to work hard for us?,btohqsg
Ur brethren who worked hard for u to make it this far,btohqsg
Cook the egg and share with others p,btohqsg
is mercury miscible with organic liquid,btohqsg
Unless if u talk about organic Mercury,btohqsg
so separate mercury just separating funnel right,btohqsg
It depends on the temperature of the liquid,btohqsg
Whichever has the lowest temperature would be separated first,btohqsg
Because fractional distillation is for liquid liquid basis,btohqsg
That is for miscible liquids only,btohqsg
Simple distillation is to separate liquid out of the aqueous solution,btohqsg
Its not called seperating funnel  it's called smt else,btohqsg
U mean leaving it to settle?,btohqsg
ü§îI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs that but I would not confuse with your syllabus and my NA syllabus,btohqsg
U want take pic show the full qn?,btohqsg
but how do u explain to ppl,btohqsg
So no need to boil the thing,btohqsg
A is for collecting insoluble solid,btohqsg
Or more over check the purity of ink,btohqsg
Identification of whatever real world context,btohqsg
Okay   but do you have a video of how separating funnel works ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm NA . I didn‚Äôt learn separating funnel,btohqsg
Yeah if you can't answer the question  don't waste your time,btohqsg
Wait this isn't (A/IB/Poly) SGExams Study Group,btohqsg
@jinkaiiIf you want proper help  ask in the study group,btohqsg
There‚Äôs one which is less dense than the water,btohqsg
U let it stand  the denser liquid will be below  in this case mercury,btohqsg
So u open the tap  just like how titration work,btohqsg
And let the mercury flow out and u collect mercury,btohqsg
But it's a physical seprwtionz so defintely hage impurity,btohqsg
You dont have to add water or add anythung,btohqsg
"anybody knows someone who's studying marine biology? need help for PW :"")",btohqsg
Can connect u with a researcher,btohqsg
theres a marine sci course in rp  can try finding students there if u dont need someone w a v high lvl,btohqsg
anybody know if its possible to participate in JAE (to JC) when i'm above 18 next year?,btohqsg
i cant remember stuff easily :/,btohqsg
read them out loud and repeat,btohqsg
it will slowly edge itself in ur brain,btohqsg
or u try to understand the content first  before trying to 'cram'/ remember it,btohqsg
like talking to myself is it?,btohqsg
thats what my friend did to remember stuff,btohqsg
SS wise  it‚Äôs largely skill based  so practice the required skills,btohqsg
Compare your answer to answer key to see where you are lacking,btohqsg
Anymore binance bots want to try?,btohqsg
U might as well be a bot,btohqsg
Return? Retard? If it is the latter that isn't very nice,btohqsg
I thought it means retweet or smth,btohqsg
It's like +1 a post or smth,btohqsg
No need to be so political  anyways Taiwan is doing their independent movement (which I find ironic),btohqsg
shit I wrote this on my xiaomi,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not meant to be political,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt use so much Chinese please,btohqsg
Plenty of people here don‚Äôt speak Chinese,btohqsg
I thought you are replying to me,btohqsg
‰∏çÈÅé‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÁöÑË¶èÁØÑÂ≠óÈÇÑÊòØÊ≠£È´îÂ≠óÂïäBut the Republic of China's official script is still traditional characters,btohqsg
shit my chinese actually improved after NS,btohqsg
My Chinese getting worst when my English is improving,btohqsg
Like NS is a good thing I would say in terms of bonding friendship,btohqsg
Tons of people will try to speak to you in Chinese in NS,btohqsg
True  but you must remember that the language reform began after the may 4th anti imperialist movement,btohqsg
Ummm.... yes but I won‚Äôt speak a lot of Chinese,btohqsg
Even the bombastic words in Chinese,btohqsg
Because my chinese is like F,btohqsg
And only know the little little basic Chinese,btohqsg
But the ROC didn't go ahead with simplification.Which means claims that the ROC protects traditional characters is a joke,btohqsg
you better pray you dont end up in some infantry,btohqsg
They took the first step to simplify official script and literature from ÊñáË®ÄÊñá to vernacular speech,btohqsg
Japanese kanji characters are also simplified now  Êñ∞Â≠óÈ´î,btohqsg
Okay  but not the characters. Character simplification ‚â† the move away from classical chinese,btohqsg
I mean you are fighting the japs and the commies  I doubt they had time to care in parliament lols,btohqsg
Its a first step  which the PRC took a lil further,btohqsg
Yeah.It's also a joke when people claim Taiwan has always been a democracy when they were a complete military dictatorship...,btohqsg
they simply executed the policy from the kmt govt,btohqsg
Before that they were a colony of Japan  after the treaty of Shinmonoseki,btohqsg
Yes  but Sun wanted it that way. people's democracy in the three principles of the people comes after people's nationalism,btohqsg
technically  japan was a democracy. Parliament (the imperial diet) was made up of elected personnel  at least in the lower house,btohqsg
its just that the upper house held sway over budgeting and more important issues. And the monarchy was above  by divine appointment,btohqsg
Cant believe the amount of trash I learnt in history,btohqsg
Well  hahaha. You mean a constitutional monarchy?,btohqsg
But you know  it is not a full democracy in the past,btohqsg
more of a constitutional democracy  since monarch had more power,btohqsg
but then again the third reich was a democracy too,btohqsg
Yeah  so almost all countries are democracies then?,btohqsg
I think you pay too.much focus on what is on paper,btohqsg
So to say that Taiwan was never communist is true,btohqsg
To say that taiwan was always democratic is kinda true,btohqsg
But there were no elections before the 90s,btohqsg
How can you say it is a democracy without elections?,btohqsg
Well there were elections before the civil war  so the ROC regime can be considered a democracy,btohqsg
This same government took over and administered taiwan from 1945 onwards,btohqsg
and between then and the 90s  it was a period of national emergency plus the cold war,btohqsg
so yeahhhhhhh having elections was kinda hard when korea is getting bombed and the strait crises were happening,btohqsg
plus nationalism did come before democracy,btohqsg
As far as I am aware the general public cannot vote  is that correct?,btohqsg
Plus a full democracy may not be the best system anyways  you could argue it both ways,btohqsg
Adult males over the age of 21  who were educated or owned property and paid taxes  and who could prove two-year residency in a particular county could vote.[1] An estimated 40 million  4-6% of China's population were registered for the election.[2] This is an increase from the size of the electorate in the 1909 Chinese provincial elections  when less than 1% of the population was enfranchised.,btohqsg
But this was under Yuan Shikai's goverent,btohqsg
Correct  but the regime did have elections  so it is fundamentally  a democracy,btohqsg
This is far from a full democracy,btohqsg
So would you consider the DPRK to be a democracy?,btohqsg
Bear in mind adults can vote in the DPRK,btohqsg
they literally only have that ONE candidate,btohqsg
Yeah  you either vote for  or you cross out the name to vote against,btohqsg
Nope  it is Marshall Kim Jong Un,btohqsg
Both way pretty much fucks you over,btohqsg
Well  I think he used to be,btohqsg
Well  this was when all the warring states were united post qing collapsed. How else are you gonna define who gets to vote and who doesn't?Besides a citizen can be defined as someone who pays taxes. And an educated citizen who is familiar with the democratic process gets to vote. I think this is a fair criteria,btohqsg
"and there were real opposition parties  not like the DPRK where ""opposition"" have to be governmentally approved",btohqsg
This is the south sudanese ballot paper,btohqsg
It is meant for people that are illiterate,btohqsg
So claiming that people who have little education cannot vote is fair  is not really right,btohqsg
Yeah but people living in a dictatorship or monarchy for a long time might not have the knowledge to vote wisely  unless he is educated to some extent. Think how many soviet states revoted communist post ussr,btohqsg
China needed a transitional democracy and this was about the best way to do it,btohqsg
Is the USSR bad? Not necessarily,btohqsg
Plus the USSR had already de-Stalinised,btohqsg
of course  this was exploited to no end by the CCP who gathered support from the bottom rungs of society who had not had the chance to vote,btohqsg
USSR is still bad after de stalinisation because the other leaders still made questionable moves,btohqsg
Like Brezhnev and how he almost started a full out war with China,btohqsg
So because of communist ideology ?,btohqsg
That is if you look at the big picture. But to an ordinary Soviet citizen  it may not be,btohqsg
Yes their ideology forces them to somewhat be more protective,btohqsg
No it isnt  but it highlights the fact that that even with a 100% literacy rate  lack political awareness and education still sways the public to vote for a certain party,btohqsg
I think there‚Äôs a reason why communist ideology is there,btohqsg
When we Say about communist ideology is one party rule,btohqsg
Well  if you are poor and you don't have the ruling government to support you  what can you do? Support whoever is supporting you,btohqsg
True because after Gorbachev decided to let them have a whiff of western life everyone revolted,btohqsg
So maybe everyone wants one party to just control the whole year,btohqsg
technically  Mao almost started a full out war against the USSR. The USSR de stalinised  but china resisted progress,btohqsg
Because democracy has something to do with refinining the policy every year,btohqsg
Before the Sino-Soviet split the USSR was China's Â§ßÂì•,btohqsg
True he did try to oppose and then Brezhnev just pushed it together,btohqsg
But back then Stalin and Mao were friends,btohqsg
Communism somewhat works on promising the people wealth and health,btohqsg
They Ally together to help North Korea,btohqsg
Something like making the people good,btohqsg
That's socialism but USSR still works on that basis when it first started,btohqsg
The prices of items in NTUC is controlled,btohqsg
trying to let the poor get rich,btohqsg
see if kmt still ruled china  they wont go through stupid shit like encouraging people to make steel in their backyards  supporting north korea  collective farming or the cultural revolution.China would have great relations with the west  vietnam would not have happened and trump would not have been elected,btohqsg
Otherwise why did Singapore bar citizens from travelling to some socialist countries,btohqsg
Things is KMT was so corrupt that they would do nothing,btohqsg
That is not really socialism. That is price controls. The market is not completely free,btohqsg
Many countries do it. Not just singapore,btohqsg
Uighurs would have been treated much better because chiang had a powerful uighur generalHong kong would not happen because freedomTibet miigghhttt still happenMongolia would be under chinese rule (according to the ROC's constitution),btohqsg
But there is no chance of KMT ever ruling if they were able to blow their chance with US aid,btohqsg
No one helped CCP at all and KMT still found a way to blow it,btohqsg
If they weren't that corrupted the world would be a better place,btohqsg
Well  you mean Mongolia would not be officially recognised as an independent country  because the ROC vetoed Mongolia's application to join the UN,btohqsg
they did not have sufficient us aid anddd the CCP was brimming with USSR aid,btohqsg
Mongolian citizens used to be treated as mainlanders if they visited Taiwan in the past,btohqsg
They needed a ÂÖ•Ëá∫Ë≠â  not their mongolian passport,btohqsg
but not to the extent of corrupt african nations and middle eastern nations which has successfully defeat communist rule,btohqsg
btw what was USSR doing in africa in early 1970s?,btohqsg
they were causing some african revolution by setting up local governments right?,btohqsg
my teacher just told me ussr was causing trouble in africa and didn't go into specifics,btohqsg
Angola civil war  you can search it up,btohqsg
only in the united front period. Before and after the USSR aided CCP and sent dozens of advisors,btohqsg
They used child soldiers. Very sad,btohqsg
They kidnap children to use in war,btohqsg
No choice it would probably be under the guise of liberation from imperialist whatever,btohqsg
No  you had to fight for whoever kidnaps you,btohqsg
btw do u guys have echa award nominations?,btohqsg
A good chunk would come from ideology too because some people just go nuts I guess,btohqsg
and mao and his successors had the chance to implement proper communism in china but he blew it on MaKe StEeL iN yOuR bAcKyArD while he swims across the river,btohqsg
Those are the leaders  not the ordinary folk,btohqsg
but kidnapping is another source for soldiers no doubt,btohqsg
I feel that even till this day the chinese do not dare to speak bad,btohqsg
tbh if any other party had taken over china  it would be better than the CCP haha,btohqsg
Like my grandfather had to act happy when I told him of the red boys thing in china during the revolution,btohqsg
Then my grandmother basically told me to not speak about it,btohqsg
imagine a pap ruled china  where he group provinces into GRCs and set up ERPs on the highways,btohqsg
He is a Chinese citizen? Wow,btohqsg
"then he gets a ""tibetan"" to run for premier who is actually han",btohqsg
Let's not talk about singaporean politics...,btohqsg
I want to go to the jiuzhaigou thing in china it looks so good,btohqsg
Damaged by the earthquake I think,btohqsg
Let's not talk singapore politics here,btohqsg
Who is he? The Deputy PM  right,btohqsg
Your East Coast plan owner meme,btohqsg
where is our dear PM in waitiing? Didnt see him speak a word in the WP PAP debate on mon/tues,btohqsg
gan siow huang is a god tho,btohqsg
Do u guys think sg wld make all the hawker centres air conditioned one day?,btohqsg
You're really daring to be honest,btohqsg
I just eating food watching tv man,btohqsg
technically  jamus didnt claim monopoly over compassion,btohqsg
When you use so many abbreviations  I have to google it or think about what it stands for haha,btohqsg
I mean if Tharman has to say that anyone can be kind why don't I see PAP being very kind,btohqsg
Why are so many of you interested in politics when you can't vote just yet?,btohqsg
It's good to think about it now and for GP,btohqsg
tbh its good that people become politically aware lmao,btohqsg
Would you rather have a voter who‚Äôs been thinking about politics for years  or have a voter who started thinking about politics months ago,btohqsg
compare how politically insensitive our youths are to those in hong kong lmao,btohqsg
PAP big king give me $600 guys vote me pap,btohqsg
tbf the youths fight grannies trying to clear the road blocks so yes,btohqsg
My parents say never get involved in politics,btohqsg
tbh being a politician is good. You either end up rich and corrupt or broke  imprisoned and a hero,btohqsg
in sg there is only one,btohqsg
or you be the mediocre ones carried in GRCs,btohqsg
can't wait to see what happens when tharman retires,btohqsg
How did you get $600 if you are in JC1,btohqsg
He is the finance minister so good,btohqsg
I so young get more money :),btohqsg
If you receive the cheque it is a uob cheque,btohqsg
Gave Wee Cho Yaw $300 too,btohqsg
Even the mediocre ones hold high paying jobs so they don't really need it anyway,btohqsg
The former CEO of UOB? The first $600 is standard for those over 21 and the second payment depends on your salary and age and if you have children or not,btohqsg
Since I'm not above 50 and I don't have children and am poor  my second payment is $600,btohqsg
This is the second payment only,btohqsg
First payment is $600 for everyone,btohqsg
Because an apathetic youth demographic is harmful,btohqsg
Can i seek chinese help here?,btohqsg
Also  ask in the O level group,btohqsg
Trying to recall a chinese saying,btohqsg
Is there a saying like _ _ ÂèØÁ¨®‰πã _ _It explains that some ppl r silly n pitiful  but actually they got their reason for being in that state. Is there a saying like this? It is quite long,btohqsg
I'm helping her but I don't know... And I doubt it is common  or at least what I can remember,btohqsg
The friend who taught me this is in uk üòÇand she did not reply my msg,btohqsg
Or maybe I'm too fixated on stupidity,btohqsg
i tried my best googling haha let me try again,btohqsg
But it has nothing to do with stupidity,btohqsg
i was trying to find it in mandarin in google,btohqsg
pops up in some shady article haha,btohqsg
The pitiful must have something to hate  and those that hate must have misery.Or something like that. Google translate and then touch up by me,btohqsg
Lol?? Show me that shady article if still have link üòÇüòÇi wanna read,btohqsg
Omg am so into chinese articles these days,btohqsg
hopefully can send link here hehe,btohqsg
They seem deeper and hve more substance than english article? Is it just an impression??,btohqsg
yes haha i think cause got a lot of metaphor and a lot of meaning in a few characters! that's why,btohqsg
Not necessarily. But Chinese articles don't have to care about copyright in general,btohqsg
Whats the implication behind this copyright issue then?,btohqsg
In most english sites  you need to reference properly,btohqsg
In Chinese sites  you can copy stuff from others without referencing and just claim that it is yours,btohqsg
Oh so the authors can express themselves more freely?,btohqsg
In most stuff yes  without bothering about copyright. You can just take music off somewhere for free and use it,btohqsg
How does that link to the depth n substance of the article content then? Haha,btohqsg
If you write something sensitive it may go through manual processing first,btohqsg
But chinese articles r harder to read. I take longer to catch the content,btohqsg
If you have access to more content without permission  for free  your content will be more in depth,btohqsg
And chinese people are less critical about articles,btohqsg
So people feel more at ease making certain claims  even if it may be false,btohqsg
Once you are used it should be faster  but hardly anyone really fluent in both languages is going to read Chinese faster. The characters take longer to process,btohqsg
This is what you might see if they want to manually check that your article is free from sensitive content,btohqsg
The pitiful must have something to hate  and those that hate must have misery.Or something like that. Google translate and then touch up by me,btohqsg
Is it if a person is in a pitiful state  there must be a reason behind it,btohqsg
The second part i dun fully get it yet,btohqsg
So ppl who hate them have misery?,btohqsg
I mean those that are hated,btohqsg
What are you all chatting abt?,btohqsg
lol meanwhile im in misery over my CA Mod results,btohqsg
If only Mulan was in Chinese,btohqsg
A lot of the nuance was lost because they tried to pander to a Western audience,btohqsg
I watch mu lan cus the girl look quite good but other than that meh,btohqsg
Hahah there is sth hate?? Hahaha i anyhow apply one,btohqsg
Uh u not the first person,btohqsg
To begin with i seldom watch movie,btohqsg
I rather read synopsis and analysis critics etc,btohqsg
It's original but only because they remove so many parts of mulan,btohqsg
like the small dragon guy gone,btohqsg
Ya she was dating a korean star,btohqsg
Ya she beautiful r wuhan ladies all like that??,btohqsg
There is yangmi very pretty too,btohqsg
not being thirsty but just look,btohqsg
they look like bombs but they are average in their nation according to locals,btohqsg
lmao it just became a simp convo,btohqsg
Ya their blue eyes n fair skin,btohqsg
if you look at the girls are the other side of the world their average is so good,btohqsg
But hey they may find asians pretty too,btohqsg
Caucasians say asian features sharp n delicate,btohqsg
So i think exotic is beautiful,btohqsg
The grass is always more exotic on the other side,btohqsg
If you like food and travelling and reading Chinese articles  I recommend Á©∑Ê∏∏ÁΩë,btohqsg
idk if I should be saying this but some of them like asians for the wrong reason,btohqsg
This is not written by me though,btohqsg
Not really  but if I travel to other countries I don't mind collecting some,btohqsg
It's for nsfw reasons and because of what they watch.,btohqsg
R u still studying? And where which country?,btohqsg
why the uni students here so free haha,btohqsg
is it the mod bell curve not so steep,btohqsg
i not joking  mine is rly steep,btohqsg
I had to google it as well. Something like not safe for work,btohqsg
Don't know what that really means,btohqsg
such as not sexual or something. No idea,btohqsg
I had to google it as well. Something like not safe for work,btohqsg
Ya sth along that line üòÖlike kinky  not safe for work,btohqsg
You can afford to go overseas university and you still call yourself poor?,btohqsg
Yeah  otherwise the government would have given me $300 or $0,btohqsg
I planned to stay in Singapore,btohqsg
But later it became very clear it would be detrimental to my health,btohqsg
Plus Singapore's tuition fees aren't that cheap for citizens anyways,btohqsg
Although I save on accomodation and all that though,btohqsg
It is cheap for citizens no?,btohqsg
But it's still cheaper than most overseas universities by a large amount,btohqsg
(Except those free ones with questionable quality),btohqsg
is quite cheap alr liao ba,btohqsg
Not quite. Some other countries are a few thousand,btohqsg
but best to enter uni when f2f resume,btohqsg
Yes but what about ranking and quality?,btohqsg
I don't want to say it to 2000 people  but it has already taken a toll on my mental health,btohqsg
Would you really go to a Swedish/Norwegian university with less than 1K tuition fee?,btohqsg
I don't care about ranking anymore to be honest. Quality is good.I have a different set of requirements compared to most people,btohqsg
I mean my university produces prize winners  so...,btohqsg
Yeah. I grew up elsewhere and came to Singapore for JC. Something happened and it became clear that I can't live in Singapore for much longer.,btohqsg
Well if you're talking about mental health  JC is the worst,btohqsg
It took a toll on me too,btohqsg
Not about academics. I was fine. I don't wish to elaborate but it caused my grades from lots of As to failure,btohqsg
But of course I did well enough to get into lots of places in the end,btohqsg
But the mental health struggle was terrible,btohqsg
If you are at the point sitting for an exam and cannot even really do the exam because your mind is not even thinking straight  it is very serious,btohqsg
Many people suffer from mental illness,btohqsg
I find Singapore's mental health support inadequate. Yeah  better than where I grew up but it's not great,btohqsg
Ya their support not very thorough,btohqsg
and which country‚Äôs mental health support system is good?,btohqsg
Korean's? Don't know about them but I imagine it is not great,btohqsg
in singapore they at least find help,btohqsg
US  UK. Not sure about Canada,btohqsg
They get lock up in there,btohqsg
Woodbridge hospital has a stigma to it. Which is actually quite sad,btohqsg
Ok so that talliesThe suicide rates,btohqsg
I've heard bad stories about IMH,btohqsg
Yalor so many kpop stars committed suicide,btohqsg
Ya. I was guessing some switzerland norweigian country  is it right?,btohqsg
It's so sad... And some people say people that commit suicide are stupid or foolish. But that is false. You are essentially driven into a corner with no escape route,btohqsg
Yes. They don't bother changing their coordinates to match the victim's frame of reference and think from their POV,btohqsg
They look at it from their own perspectives,btohqsg
I was starting to contemplate suicide in JC1,btohqsg
I'm way past that  so clearly I'm not in that situation,btohqsg
Oh idk i dun feel so at all - not anymore. I feel educated generation like ours should embrace mental issues. Esp when society modernize  things get complicated. I went to mood disorder unit at imh last time  the young patients there were mostly highflyers - ntu grads  big 4 firm auditors  rjcian  acjcians..,btohqsg
Had I gone to the army I'd almost certainly kill myself. The mental health system in there is quite bad,btohqsg
YaAnd they r not considered to have committed crime under that mental state,btohqsg
Ah yes let's not talk about SAF,btohqsg
I'm sorry to hear that. Hope you are alright now,btohqsg
Imh very dirty lei. In terms of cleanliness standard,btohqsg
What a non standard way of saying worse,btohqsg
My referral to the counsellor took me 2 months,btohqsg
They have a constant backlog of cases to clear so it takes a long time for new cases to get attention,btohqsg
But the good thing about joker is he did not end his lifeJoker is deeply compassionate and he is a fighter,btohqsg
Ouch am thankful u r here,btohqsg
Which is fair. Even if they kill someone I love  I don't want them to be punished when it is technically not their fault.,btohqsg
Idk but there is a mood disorder unit,btohqsg
Have u recovered? Still on meds?,btohqsg
No not meI went to visit ppl,btohqsg
Hope you were downgraded or exempted. But yeah  I shouldn't talk about it...,btohqsg
Is it due to red tape?,btohqsg
Yes u can say that üôÉ quite fair right,btohqsg
No  thankfully I had good company in my unit so I got better on my own,btohqsg
AuditorsNo i mean they r all quite smart ppl,btohqsg
Well  justice is not about taking revenge. It is about being fair.,btohqsg
Is that why you want to know the secret recipe to PES F? Haha,btohqsg
The industry is toxic right? Some of them have to sleep their way up. And some get pregnant n abortion with co-celebs,btohqsg
My uni entry already deferred to after NS,btohqsg
Even if I PES F it would not be possible to change it back to earlier,btohqsg
ExactlyActually local justice system is not only fair  they r quite compassionate üôÉ,btohqsg
But had you been really depressed  if I were you  I'd rather be out and wait than spend the remainder of my time in there,btohqsg
Biggest grand prize that MINDEF can ever give you,btohqsg
I had to submit my exemption letter to NUS and NTU  otherwise they won't let me apply for admission that year. Hmmmm,btohqsg
As in start university that year,btohqsg
True. I wasn't feeling that bad  and I learned a lot of soft skills too,btohqsg
So I wouldn't say it's completely bad,btohqsg
ahah i just saw this but i agree,btohqsg
its like no rewatch value  boring and also slight cringe in the lines,btohqsg
The wire work in the beginning and number of scene cuts was horrific,btohqsg
to feel more like a half documentary than a film,btohqsg
Also  the Liu Yifei supports police brutality in Hong Kong so I'm not exactly jumping to watch her in action either,btohqsg
But you are already out of NS (at least I think so)  so why do you even care? Unless it is reservist or exit permit,btohqsg
liu yifei acting in this was also.. um....,btohqsg
PES F will not undo your full time NS already done,btohqsg
I'd rather watch the Whedon Justice League a hundred times than Mulan,btohqsg
There are always reasons why some ppl are exempted from NS,btohqsg
Hope those who are exempted ain‚Äôt judged or stigmatised,btohqsg
tbh there is a chance they will be stigmatised due to jealousy by others who served ns,btohqsg
and jealousy can leads to bad things happening...,btohqsg
I heard it is difficult to apply for civil service posts and scholorships in Singapore,btohqsg
I'm a 20 year old man and I've watched Frozen 2 twice  wouldn't do it again for Mulan,btohqsg
If that is the case  that would be systematic discrimination,btohqsg
those that are exempted find it hard to get to civil serviced post/scholarships in sg?,btohqsg
From those who were exempted and applied  it seems so  although there is no concrete evidence they were excluded specifically for being exempted. As they likely have access to the medical records  they might take that into consideration as well.This is sort of a speculation and in no way serves as evidenceBut for example  if I want to apply for certain jobs in the civil service  they expect PES A or B. It is stated clearly on the advertisement for the job. Even C or E would probably mean reject.,btohqsg
Is she even a good actress to begin with?,btohqsg
shes very famous in china  and she can act but anything that is not being pretty and requires alot of deep emotions she's not the type to do it,btohqsg
Maybe depends on role and settings ?,btohqsg
as she fits the pretty girl MC in those idol drama,btohqsg
not the very deep character and stuff because she cannot get the details as well,btohqsg
Her pretty face sustained her in the industry,btohqsg
i read on weibo a director once said she's quite pretty and ok at acting but she's afraid of making expressions and be ugly on camera,btohqsg
Sounds like shes not a highly skillful actress,btohqsg
Means she hasnt broken that shell lor,btohqsg
She has not let down her guards,btohqsg
Wow but this uptight can sustain her fame for so many years,btohqsg
her career has been smooth sailing actually  so they say that's one of the factors why she can't emote why because she doesn't know first hand what huge trauma feels like that kind,btohqsg
She happens to have that sort of luck,btohqsg
that kind lah and she got consistent shows also,btohqsg
but her shows/movies not rated high in china,btohqsg
I think she is in high demand alr,btohqsg
She has no chance for other kind of roles,btohqsg
Hmmm. Let me think about it,btohqsg
So she is highly sort after by small films?,btohqsg
certainly if i was a director i would choose maybe yangzi,btohqsg
the issue here is she is americanised and knows english 'fluently',btohqsg
they can't cast like yangmi and yangzi,btohqsg
Cos liu yifei is known to be pretty but truly not a famous actress,btohqsg
Her name is indeed quite ÂÜ∑Èó®üòÇ,btohqsg
she's known for her natural beauty and stuff in china,btohqsg
Thats all i know about her too üòÇ that she is pretty,btohqsg
yangzi is known for her acting but gets bashed for her looks and weight haha,btohqsg
But nth much about her being a popular actress üòÇ,btohqsg
yeah on weibo they always compare pretty actresses to yangzi because she's not the prettiest in their industry,btohqsg
I think yangzi is fine leiii,btohqsg
comparing yangmi  dilireba  liuyifei  zhao liying etc to yangzi,btohqsg
After awhile all looks so standard,btohqsg
Their faces may vary but the eyes n nose bridge all look similar to me,btohqsg
dilireba is damn pretty tho haha,btohqsg
They say she has never gone under the knife before,btohqsg
Y not show Casper the friendly ghost,btohqsg
One of the worst movies I have seen,btohqsg
Tbh not jus actress. Entire storyline wasn‚Äôt good,btohqsg
