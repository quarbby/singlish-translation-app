if they say the rubber or plastics dashboard i would give them credits. for example  Fiat coupe (made by pininfarina)  melts after many years under hot sun.,btohqsg
I am happy that my dash is metal 🤣,btohqsg
but if dashboard melts  it melts whether in Europe America or Asia. because the heat in those countries is just as intense,btohqsg

"Yuppp  so how is the so called ""negotiation"" any different from ""stealing"" like the lexus",btohqsg
many years ago my friend (sinkie) and i refuelled in bukit kayu hitam petronas. this is a very remote town next to the thai-border. my friend refueled using ron97. i went ahead with ron95. nobody bothered at all. well  there's nobody too.,btohqsg
negotiation means you asked for permission first!,btohqsg
which they feel comfortable. and they may allow. but you got to make it comfortable for them to say yes too. how? when noone around  when not many notice etc...,btohqsg
no harm if they say no,btohqsg

if so then i think 911 coming with steelies already,btohqsg
Always have the mid to higher tier model on display as well,btohqsg
Then they just point out what you will miss out on,btohqsg
Usually a good way to convince some people to spend a bit more on a higher trim level. Obviously in this case whole different car because of powertrain but the interior not that much different apart from seat shape and materials,btohqsg
Which can be optioned on the regular f-pace as well,btohqsg
Key difference would be the powertrain and suspension,btohqsg
And some standard options that aren't standard on the 2.0,btohqsg
Must set driver's seat and passenger seat to your position,btohqsg
That's usually how I test legroom,btohqsg
I don’t mind Volvo 24X wor,btohqsg

Model 3  C-Class and 3 Series all very small to me haha,btohqsg
so high demand but the owners all dont want to sell😂😂,btohqsg
wow looks like the alfa stelvio q4,btohqsg
Mr Xun is more concerned about space for his furry friends than space for himself,btohqsg
Okay how to determine whether the car the big enough. U set ur front seat to be comfortable and see if u can sit directly behind,btohqsg
frankly for model 3 and C-Class its impossible,btohqsg
I agree Mr Xun! Best way is to do it like that,btohqsg
I personally follow that method as well,btohqsg
i do have slightly longer legs so that contributes to it being uncomfortable,btohqsg
What car is a no no for you?,btohqsg
before i bought my XC40  cnc wanted to sell me a C200 Night edition for 170k but the biggest turn of was the rear seats,btohqsg
C-class still ok as most Mercedes models nowadays have rear seats reclined at an angle and enough space in the back as they tend to be slightly longer,btohqsg
I'm MPV lover 😂👍2 large dog middle seat2 large dog third roll seat fold up.No problems 😁,btohqsg
A4 also ok  3 series a bit more cramped. I personally am not a fan of the rear seats on the X1  X3 and 3 series as well. A bit too hard and flat for me,btohqsg
I became an odyssey lover last weekend,btohqsg
can hide the third row and have huge space for activities,btohqsg
Competitors offer more comfy rear seats but that's also to do with BMWs focus on driver pleasure,btohqsg
You tried the Stepwagon/ Toyota Noah?I fit entire baby crib behind and few boxes when moving to new house😂,btohqsg
Nope haha will check it out this weekend😂😂,btohqsg
