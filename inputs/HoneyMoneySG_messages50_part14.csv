Yes I would suggest best if u are HSBC personal keep $2k and withdraw all the rest once the promo over,btohqsg
4.58% is better than the banks! how to enjoy the 4.58% rates? just move money there can liao? any catch? must be in usd or sgd can already?,btohqsg
4.58% need 110K usd in Ibkr right ?,btohqsg
Trazorashifu quick check  maintaining 2k ADB is not a HSBC EGA Bonus Interest requirement right? I m willing to pay the fall below fee of $5.,btohqsg
not a requirement. In fact no fall below fee if u applied premier ega account,btohqsg
Premier EGA will require 200k ADB or otherwise $50 monthly service fee + maintain same customer segment till the disbursement day.,btohqsg
I am emptying my EGA account in the last qualifying month leaving $7 dollars for the fall below fee  to reset the next EGA period's reference month to a near zero ADB.,btohqsg
don't worry once premier won't get demoted so easily.,btohqsg
yes I'm emptying on 1 Jul too üòÇ,btohqsg
is there somewhere i can read up on EGA account strategy? haha looks abit complicated!,btohqsg
Easy way is to use your card expiry month that's the start. But if you want to be sure can call,btohqsg
there's a pdf every month. remember to download when you send the SMS to apply.,btohqsg
sorry am lost üòÖ sms to apply where? i‚Äôm asking about the strategy to get highest rate for ega account,btohqsg
according to this  premier no fall below fee. go ahead and empty to zero.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/102143,btohqsg
you need to send SMS to lock in the reference month. the pdf will tell you which are the months that you can earn the bonus interest.,btohqsg
better to call in and confirm with CSO.,btohqsg
Google pay support for paying your friends or others via GPay directly,btohqsg
Once again thanks to the community for Fantatsic support. The way Chris and other gurus has envisioned. When the community/forum can answer to each other   we can all reduce chances of any conditions misunderstood,btohqsg
oh that‚Äôs true haha but i can use paylah! too,btohqsg
always do your due diligence. sometimes can get wrong info too. I also might say wrong thing. safest to verify with official documentation.,btohqsg
So I just called Uob customer support. This wonderful guy called Seran answered and patiently Clarified all my doubtsUob one credit card1) the quarter is fixed to the month  the card is approved by Uob. Like someone else mentioned   the expiry date on the card is good reference point. My card approved on june2023.likehow trazora korkor verified   my first quarter is june23 july23 and aug23.2) there is no way (1) can be amended/modified. Uob has no system to adjust the statement quarter. So pls don‚Äôt waste time on this. Though  The billing cycle can be adjusted as per customer preference. So I have called in changed my billing cycle/statement to be on 30th of every month.3)anyone who signed up for the Uob one card can still get the promotional ‚Äòbonus additional cashback‚Äô for the next two quarters. Need to sign up before 30 june 2023 to get this promo. Up to 15% cashback on certain stuff.not bad.,btohqsg
How am i ‚Äúwrong‚Äù if you misintepreted a qns for a statement? Ka ki kong ka ki song ah?,btohqsg
Where is it indicated that the premier service fee will be waived for ADB less than $200k.,btohqsg
I only found info on HWZ leh. Any other more reliable sources?,btohqsg
oh yah just saw the $50. strangely I never got charged.,btohqsg
Hahaha u can  but I prefer to see what the deduction is for on the bank side (not a deal breaker for me tho!),btohqsg
are u on uob or ocbc tor interest tho? i‚Äôm thinking maybe i should have the savings account with them (not the 360 one) but not sure if there‚Äôs a min balance for that!,btohqsg
None - I'm on HSBC before I fall back to OCBC cause I can't justify spending $500 on things I can earn rewards on (lost opportunity cost),btohqsg
ah i see  that makes sense,btohqsg
Do you all normally pay your insurance payment yearly  or monthly (2% higher),btohqsg
yearly  more convenient if can claim to company flexi benefits  otherwise every month need to submit  too much hassle,btohqsg
Anyone has opinions of dbs vantage  voyage  and citi prestige?,btohqsg
Monthly can be higher by up to 4%. Can try annual then giro to hsbc for 1% cashback.,btohqsg
if you have 100k in UOB One and your premium is at least $500 per month  can consider using it to unlock the spend bonus. but do your calculations to see whether the additional interest is more than the extra you need to pay due to paying monthly instead of yearly.,btohqsg
Anyone do balance transfer before can advise which bank offer better rates?,btohqsg
Need help. Invest 250k cash. No job,btohqsg
Goal is to sustain a sabbatical as long as possible,btohqsg
high risk or low risk ? üòÉ,btohqsg
low risk - fixed D  T bills. high risk - stocks  crypto,btohqsg
How much is your expenses per month?,btohqsg
But if it is HSBC ega personal account  need to leave at least $2000 even if emptying the account after the promo as there is a fall-back fee?,btohqsg
Hello all! Hoping for all of your expertise in this matter  I'm currently in Bali using Amaze + Citi  and I don't quite understand how Instarem Point earnings are calculated. I understand that it's 1sgd equiv = 1 point  but is there a minimum transaction amount required to qualify or something?,btohqsg
Yes sgd10 minimum to qualify for points,btohqsg
Thanks@ChrisHMSGfor sharing at the event. It‚Äôs a great talk!,btohqsg
You need 4.8% of return to get $1k every month. So far only UOB one with $500 expenses + self transfers salary or 3 Giro can have 5%. The rest need to take a bit of risks.The other way is to place it in UOB USD FD (6 or 12 months) which currently give 5%++ of interest but with currency risks.Assuming the interest rate does not change  you shall get $1k of interest every month.Other have any comments on above?,btohqsg
How to self transfer salary to uob one?,btohqsg
if you can earn more than 3% outside  think still worth to pay the $5,btohqsg
Ok I see  thank you. Thinking that $2k might not be able to earn much too as the quantum not that big,btohqsg
what happens if its $0 balance? it goes to negative or they'll immediately terminate the account?,btohqsg
Uob one only up to 100k i think. Also i no job eligible?,btohqsg
