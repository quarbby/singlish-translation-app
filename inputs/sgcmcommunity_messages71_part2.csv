tried to void my warranty if cem (similar to ecu) said that there was 3 ocassions that battery was runned from 20-40 mins and 1 ocassion that that battery was runned for more than 40 minutes. They count that as misuse of battery and wanted to void my batt warranty,btohqsg

"Service consultant called me tell me CEM detect 3 times of usage 20-40min and 1 time more than 40 minutes. Tell me because of this they will void my battery warranty. I ask them where did they write black and white that this will cause my warranty to be void.""its a general car thing sir. any brand you go to will void your warranty. you learn it in driving school (???)""i just tell him its not in black and white stated clearly and explicitly explained to me during collection that the car running solely on battery will get the warranty to be voided.Then he tell me he will call me back in 15mins  he will check with his manager.2mins later  ""out of goodwill we will replace the battery for free.""",btohqsg

In the eye of the law  it is the owner's duty to read the manual hence technically i would have to take liability for the misuse of battery,btohqsg
Had a fellow beetle  battery died cos forgotten to turn off head light. Cars of my era dont have ding ding ding warning sound when u didn't turn off head lights. Everything needs to be self-disciplined.,btohqsg
