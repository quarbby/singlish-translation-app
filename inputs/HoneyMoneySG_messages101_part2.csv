i told her i saw this list in their website,btohqsg
hm  mcc 4722 is clearly under travel ah. U trying to dispute a transaction or just asking before making transaction.,btohqsg
already made but just want to confirm before i make other booking,btohqsg
Missing points? Or just checking? If just checking  the CSOs usually have a very good chance of giving wrong info.Better off checking onheymax.aior empty amaze wallet.,btohqsg
Hi everyone!I need some advice on which credit card to use for a Shopee purchase. I'm looking at getting a camera for around $3k. I've got the HSBC Revolution  Citi Rewards  OCBC 365  and UOB Lady's Card.I’m leaning more towards earning miles than cashback.Which card do you think works best for this? Thanks for your help!,btohqsg
They are not always right. A lot of time they don’t know what they are saying,btohqsg
This cso talking nonsense. Cut her off. Try another cso,btohqsg
More like always not right 🤡,btohqsg
Empty amaze wallet won’t tell if Agoda is under Travel category for UOB Lady’s 😅,btohqsg
That's the bank's own rules. MAS regulation does not require.,btohqsg
True but you can check mcc and description. Will roughly tell you if will be counted or not.Heymax.aiis the easiest way.,btohqsg
Have you triedheymax.ai? It's a great tool to find out what's the best card or cards eligible for your spend.,btohqsg
For example  I know from ML which things under Travel. But if you refer to TnC  there’s no info about which MCCs are under Travel.Heymax yes  but not empty amaze wallet,btohqsg
Yup  they only provide a vague description. That's why best to check againstheymax.ai.,btohqsg
Still empty amaze wallet is useless for checking if it’s under Travel,btohqsg
the cso is saying mcc 4722:  travel agency is not under travel  lol.,btohqsg
You can get MCC and check against other merchants with the same MCC onheymax.ai  if it somehow doesn't exist in their database. Not entirely useless.,btohqsg
Most of the time we use amaze + empty wallet. Get the mcc to be 4772 or 7011 and we know it’s safe for Travel (pun intended),btohqsg
Heymax.aistates 4722 as well. Unlessheymax.aiis not accurate anymore. 🤡,btohqsg
5309 is also under travel. But again  Amaze will give you MCC  but won’t tell you if it’s under Travel Category for UOB Lady’s. Even TnC of UOB Lady’s won’t tell you that. You need more tools and sources (or test and see),btohqsg
yea  the issue here is a cso giving rubbish answer. Anyway knowing the mcc or being listed in heymax does not help justify whether uob give bonus points or not.,btohqsg
He isn’t making a statement  “lol” refers to smth else 😂,btohqsg
Question. Is tuition centre under the exclusion list for UOB Visa Signature  meaning no 4 MPD even for contactless payments?,btohqsg
Tldr:That Uob cso is talking rubbish.,btohqsg
Depends on mcc. High chance excluded.,btohqsg
Lol maribank then no miles. There's a good tool you use to check calledheymax.ai.,btohqsg
What is a good Kris credit card to go for at the moment,btohqsg
i would have asked her  if 4722 MCC is not under Travel  then can you please list the MCC that you have just checked against to verify if its against Travel  because the T&C does not list down the MCC. checkmate her whilst revealing the MCC list,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to seek confirmation if HSBC Revo 4mpd cannot be used for hotel banquets downpayment,btohqsg
depends  if mcc 7011 or 4722 then excluded.,btohqsg
Huh how does maribank get you miles lol,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone know if Taobao has affiliate programmes like Shopee and Lazada?,btohqsg
taobao lasada lor...but shipping damn long time,btohqsg
Guys  do you buy travel insurance if your credit card already have complimentary insurance? I use the hsbc revolution card to book my flight so is it advisable to buy a travel insurance?,btohqsg
The coverage offered by credit card tends to be quite minimal  you might want to look at what's offered by your card first,btohqsg
"https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/credit-cards/revolution/travel-insurance.pdfAssuming this is the one that you're looking at  I will say... some things like Medical expenses and maybe definition of ""Loss of luggage"" could differ. Try reading the terms abit and u will see what i mean",btohqsg
End of day  travel insurance (at least to me) is to get peace of mind. If the free one can covers what you think is sufficient then go ahead.. if not  purchase one so u won't travel with a worried mind :),btohqsg
Does amaze card works with DCS mastercard to qualify for rebate ?,btohqsg
Hi  may i know does DBS Live fresh card new tnc awards CB for Wogi?,btohqsg
Hi CitiPrestige/PremierMiles owners  does anyone recall how long it took for your PriorityPass signup pin to be sent?Wondering if it'll be ready for my upcoming trip. I vaguely recall it took more than 2 weeks.,btohqsg

How come the chat icon button went missing from Amex app?anyone having the same issue?,btohqsg
