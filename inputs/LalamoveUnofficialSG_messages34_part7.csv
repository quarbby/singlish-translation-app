Last month the job orders was good  this month since last week the orders are always snapped up  more riders?,btohqsg
Time to go airasia? Who in it?,btohqsg
airasia doesnt really have volume at the moment. plus base starts at $5.50  llm starts at $10. But AA no signup fee or gear purchase  so nothing to lose. except maybe your time.,btohqsg
if really want to do food delivery the 3 main platforms still where the money is. they got volume n consistency.,btohqsg
airasia like llm  must camp at app for jobs. but the app no autorefresh like llm... must manual refresh nonstop.,btohqsg
Waiting time claim become like this,btohqsg

Seems like nowadays only fri-sun is good,btohqsg
Waa cb customer. Deliver parcel to them at tuas. Then complain say cannot find. I chiong back to tuas from novena. Reaching tuas then call me say found liao,btohqsg
Huh you passed the parcel to whoever received should answer for it what why call you say cannot find sia,btohqsg
The receiver was a colleague cos the person went lunch.,btohqsg
Then ok lo. I just leave.,btohqsg
in this situation i would just leave too. but now that you mention  maybe better take picture or something proof delivery.,btohqsg
Yea. Next time should take proof,btohqsg
But abit seh cos i literally chiong back sia. Reaching liao then tell me found,btohqsg
Ya  must take pictures every drop off  no waste time to go back,btohqsg
Probably next time better get the fella name then text the original recipient so and so collected on your behalf. Take pic as well. If chiobu even better lol,btohqsg

yooooo can I checkhow to use waze instead of g map when you press the location icon in app,btohqsg
"go to apps under phone settings  scroll to maps or google maps  ""clear defaults"".",btohqsg
then select waze on next use n set as default.,btohqsg
Thanks alot guys but you all know how to do it in Oppo?,btohqsg
I tried uninstall  the app is still there.under phone setting clear default still cannot..,btohqsg
Wave GPS is better n clearer.,btohqsg
Waze sometimes also holland gao gap,btohqsg
I go triple one from jurong   after expressway suppose to go via oxley rise   waze wan me go one big round to reach almost cost me 10mins,btohqsg
GPS antenna is phone hardware  any map app on the same phone relies on the same GPS. If it's more sensitive would mean the app polls the GPSmore frequently. Better response at cost of battery life. Btw  Waze is a subsidiary of Google.,btohqsg
Interface differs... but both are Google underneath.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone notice jobs in lalamove drop drastically  only a few immediate jobs. I can't with CS and they said is 5km job I can see  but I'm still seeing 16km job. CS so eager to hang up while I am still typing,btohqsg

I agreeThere are certain routes that waze gets wrong also  and google maps has improved a lot over the yearsI feel like waze appears more reliable only cos they give more route options lol,btohqsg
And yes i find waze sucks a lot of batt/data/memory,btohqsg
