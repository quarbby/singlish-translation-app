reminds me of my mummy back home sir. growing up I lie on her lap and watch tv while she dig my ear,btohqsg
Aww... Most of us did that when we were kids,btohqsg
Car not necessary in sg la,btohqsg
our mrt system is actually very good,btohqsg
But this  you sure it's drool Mark?,btohqsg
The parking   road tax n insurance,btohqsg
at least... I think so.....? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I don't mind the parking and insurance actually. Road tax just doesn't make sense for me. Coe is to control no of car  tax is to?,btohqsg
after work at end of day I take the train home to joo koon there. very fast.,btohqsg
Cat a and b for small and big cars,btohqsg
Road tax also different for diff cap engines. Small cars usage lesser?,btohqsg
I'm sure there is a proper explanation  just that I can't personally justify it,btohqsg
might be more coz usually they are bread and butter cars?,btohqsg
would it be better if and once they move to satellite based road tax system so people actually pay for what they use?,btohqsg
But road tax is cheaper for smaller cap engines if you refer them to bread and butter cars,btohqsg
do you feel that is a fair system (not that you and I can change anything)?,btohqsg
And more tax for coe cars. Do old cars go on road more?,btohqsg
I say  scrap road tax ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
apparently they pollute and break down more?,btohqsg
someone wants us to sell and buy newer cars,btohqsg
along the way  can scrap COE and ERP too pls?,btohqsg
One at a time pls ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It's just multiple ways to get money,btohqsg
Coe so that you can own a car,btohqsg
Road tax so that you can go on the road,btohqsg
Insurance so that you pay road tax,btohqsg
then maybe one day I can own a VolVo like kors kors such as Mr Xun here@Jingxunn,btohqsg
after reading all this chats  I am convinced Volvo and Mazda are best cars,btohqsg
I'm quite sure you have a very nice car,btohqsg
like Mr X say  volvo for life,btohqsg
S90 b5 is kinda downgrade from previous t6 and T8 tho,btohqsg
wait.. you even know what engine designation is on the S90?,btohqsg
are you also a VOlvo expert sir like Mr Xun?,btohqsg
I have a good friend called sgcm,btohqsg
give me money last month in a giveaway,btohqsg
hmm it is to a certain extent,btohqsg
He only tempted me to spend money,btohqsg
S90 no T8 if im not wrong,btohqsg
I havent seen b6 yet. Or I'm outdated,btohqsg
its the same  just diff engine,btohqsg
Saw a Malaysian S90 t8 in sg the other day,btohqsg
if u not gg to msia and tiong myvis  B/T5 would be enough,btohqsg
cos im prettt sure dont have sg S90 T8,btohqsg
If money is no problem  wad car to buy to show off?,btohqsg
I am very used to this... sometimes I have female customers who tempt me to spend money but i really just don't have money.  So problem solved!,btohqsg
Sorry to break it to you,btohqsg
I really have no answer to this one sir. I prefer to keep cash to show off how much cash I have... like buy most expensive car in Singapore is just showing off how much money I am burning off every year... like not very clever leh.. end up showing off but backfire massively in my dark face,btohqsg
can I just buy a Vios. Show off how clever I am at saving money one,btohqsg
smart ones buy multiple properties . not multiple cars,btohqsg
I agree Mr Anwo  some people buy Rolls Royce phantom viii to show off  then their chauffeur kena stuck in small lane. Got no parking,btohqsg
