Should be inclusive as it is not that far off from model 3 pricing,btohqsg
Maybe a bit higher than 250 though,btohqsg
Model S is the dream thou.. for tesla imo,btohqsg
Have  no ready stock though  must indent. But no one wants because cannot use supercharger,btohqsg
I believe so but when it comes to SG COE sky High hahahaa. 250 is just basic range LOL,btohqsg
Depends on the COE I guess,btohqsg
Lets say car price for model Y to be at 180k?,btohqsg
Should be around that give or take,btohqsg
How can it be omv close 1 eye 63 k for entry level,btohqsg
shld be abt 10% more than 3,btohqsg
Since model 3 performance is close to 170,btohqsg
Lets see when it hit our shores?,btohqsg
hannor  maybe next time tesla come with inbuilt twitter😂😂,btohqsg
NOOOOOO inbuilt Tweeter i ok not Twitter,btohqsg
Ya pi can’t sell   if they sell no warrently no repair,btohqsg
Where has the tesla pi owners been servicing/repairing their cars,btohqsg
I find that to be very rude@SGCM_Adminplease issue yellow card,btohqsg
Before Tesla SG came in Hong Seh sell afew liao enough lah HAHAHAH now they retire tesla those buy PI Tesla cannot charge at Tesla Supercharger So sad. So those buy bf that have to think of a way to change the plug LOL,btohqsg
Hong Seh still says they are selling and they still have ready model 3s in their showroom. But no one wants to buy since Tesla is here already,btohqsg
Its abt the charging port they have is different LOL,btohqsg
Cannot use supercharger as I said here,btohqsg
This is before coe but I get what u mean haha,btohqsg
We were talking about price before COE,btohqsg
Warranty is one Charging is another. Whoever have landed sua get from PI but i think universal wise cannot charge except own house. So they have ready unit also no use LOL whose buying,btohqsg
It bascially very funny   u go service with tesla but hongseh pay for it,btohqsg
Can charge at some sp power outlets as well I think,btohqsg
Any new cars came in after tesla sg is here will be deny all service,btohqsg
They shld have a servicing plan for the pi teslas,btohqsg
Afterall its their car n brand.. 🤔 and these owners willing to own their car even before they coming into the mkt,btohqsg
hi guys anyone without vep manage to drive in to malaysia? any issues?,btohqsg
Not feasible just get from Tesla SG,btohqsg
Got   tesla service for you and u reimburse from pi,btohqsg
They where will cover.. unless its in ur contract when u buy,btohqsg
It is standard   u buy car from dealer and pi  the price is mark up,btohqsg
The servicing package all these is from the mark up u given to them,btohqsg
If not where got free stuff,btohqsg
Bang hoh ownself bid COE they sell u car easy for them LOL,btohqsg
