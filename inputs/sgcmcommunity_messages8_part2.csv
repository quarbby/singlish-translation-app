Early Worm Gets Eaten By Bird,btohqsg
He‚Äôs been bugging me since yesterday to install trust wallet. And I finally did. Next step the Ben‚Äôs been showing me how to setup. And interestingly asked me to keep the secrets carefully. Then ironic asked me to email the secrets in order to obtain a code to do mining. He wanted to do this to steal that‚Äôs more like it. Who would be so stupid to email secrets in order to aid his stealing. üòÇ,btohqsg
The 2002. Rust is biggest enemy. My 1990 e30 is showing this too.,btohqsg

Never ever reveal your 12-word seed phrase to anybody,btohqsg

sgCarMart Quotz guarantees the highest selling price for your car. We‚Äôll even give you $100 cash if you find a better offer elsewhere!ü§ëGet afree quoteto find out how much your car is worth today!üòâ,btohqsg

Cannot‚Ä¶ sell car to u‚Ä¶ my hands will be itchy after a while‚Ä¶ then buy a new car‚Ä¶ end up  I will be even more broke,btohqsg
I actually wanted to play with him by sending him fake secrets to him. But then I don‚Äôt have time. So I decided to expose him.,btohqsg
I ever encountered at a CC  the gantry gear moved but the bar only shifted forward lol then one uncle pass by saw and moved the bar further so that I can drive out üòÇ,btohqsg
We forgive you if you drive a Kia! ü§≠,btohqsg
The bar btw was obviously crooked and bent at the gear end,btohqsg
I find that sgcarmart search needs to improve. Users must not input exact info of car. For instance I want to search e92 m3. But seems it wants to follow proper data. Must enter bmw,btohqsg
Anyone else have similar thoughts? If yes  we will give feedback to our backend team,btohqsg
Wah  still lookin' good! How come pics cannot give thumbs up?!,btohqsg
Must hover your cursor around the bottom right of the image and the reaction emojis will magically appear,btohqsg
Oh but I wanted to be first to give thumbs up but like cannot leh. I try on another. Only when someone already giv then can. I try again heh,btohqsg
Sgcarmart must allow intelligence query that allows non structured data,btohqsg
Alternatively you can long-press on the message for the reactions to magically appear,btohqsg
Like Amazon type of search. The shopee search is also lousy,btohqsg
Continental simply tells us the region the car originated from not the quality etc. in Germany vw are for the masses,btohqsg
