Question:Putting aside the practical implications of re-modelling the existing facilities to accommodate to female cadets  what good reasons are there that women don't have to fork out 2 years of their lives to serve the nation?,btohqsg
I'm genuinely curious  not here to force my opinion,btohqsg
I’ll try to think of a response,btohqsg
Imma be honest i don't think there are any,btohqsg
My current stance is that it's more of society'spotentially patriarchalperspective of women rather than any actual good reasons  on why women don't have to serve NS,btohqsg
I have thought about this for most of my sec and jc life LOL,btohqsg
I strongly agree! Can't rly think of stuff rn so i agree w this,btohqsg
ya i ask my teacher  they roll their eyes,btohqsg
Long story short(not short) Compare 2 lives1. You have the stereotypical PSC scholar  'studied very hard' 90rp  can't do much CCA cuz no $(so no music)  maybe Librarian Vice Pres. Assuming he indicates interest in certain areas of SAF  he will enter a different world which is only accepting of people who area. generally paid highlyb. accountable to few people  but in the same manner  should be highly accountable to themc. accepts no moral failings  and certainly not the kind involving moneyThe environment is shaped by these systematic requirements.2. Stereotypical NS boiboi. Normal life. Went through BMT mono. Considering that 'discipline' is important  safety rules are thrown out the window. The lesson is simple: don't die  don't get caught doing stuff not to be done.How can these two people ever meet?,btohqsg
I’ll just give my own response ah haha,btohqsg
I thought Dynkin was gonna respond to me  I got nervous,btohqsg
The super important and practical implication of changing any part of NS as it is. Have you seen NS numbers? Tell me which ruling political party in their right mind would change a policy in support by up to 90%+ of the population,btohqsg
That's the political perspective I suppose,btohqsg
In SG  it won't be that much lower than number 1,btohqsg
actly i feel this is damn valid,btohqsg
Let her foreves be lazy HAHAHA,btohqsg
"PAP preaches the ""we want to do what's right  not what is popular"" when doing things like raising taxes or building casinos  but I guess they're not internally inconsistent when it comes to policies that are more impactful and polarizing (377A and women in NS) I suppose",btohqsg
I've not seen high support of NS for women in polls anyway. The highest numbers IIRC re women is when they are not necessarily going combat  and go into stuff like nursing/healthcare.But actually still a lot of practical problems to handle with hat,btohqsg
Preach all it wants. It is a political party.,btohqsg
"It's not valid  it's basically saying ""there is no good reason except for the fact that women will resist the policy change and PAP will lose supporters""",btohqsg
Valid but not right of course,btohqsg
Political support should not be the only thing holding the party back from making such a decision,btohqsg
This is why anarchy is the best/s,btohqsg
Then again i am simultaneously for and against NS,btohqsg
> raising taxesYa  and tell me how to support the poor without revenue? They already doing the NIRF or whatever GIC framework alr  so they are tapping onto many many revenue streams> building casinosholy shit 2% of GDP - which rich man is going to give 2%? 2% of GDP means jobs  buildings  schools  AIRCON,btohqsg
Even if somewhat 'unpopular' these obvious (somewhat) economic policies will gain PAP more votes in the long run,btohqsg
A fair point is also the fact that a much larger % of women won't get very good PES with the current system  so the system may need to be tweaked quite a bit to suite that. Training will definitely need to be different if ippt standards for women change too,btohqsg
Someone asked me throw leather in water,btohqsg
Everyone gets nervous when they think Dunkin is typing to them,btohqsg
??? PES is wrt to PULHEEMS. Not sure how different it currently is. Either way all soldiers should be able to NIGERUNDAYO cuz apparently that's a lifeskill according to movies. But honestly many jobs don't require that apex machine of a man who can deca-ironman.,btohqsg
"My ""magnus opus"" against that point is: a huge part of war is not about the combat itself  it's about strategy  managing supply lines and communications etc.  and women who lack the physical prowness can easily fill up these positions",btohqsg
omg ur hair is so bleached wow,btohqsg
PULHEEMS is diff for men and women? Or what,btohqsg
not what i was going for but yes,btohqsg
I like him though  I always learn something when he responds to me,btohqsg
The problem with strategy is that it's a problem of people. Who's going to decide strategy?*insert lines from a few good men here*,btohqsg
PES is based on medical conditions rather than physical fitness though,btohqsg
IDK man  this one far too back in memory lane. If you asked me 'back in my day' I might know.,btohqsg
Oh i always thought that ippt stuff and the whole test besides that also affects,btohqsg
??? ok smokey  imma pull out my big boi run,btohqsg
Did they do another weird video ...,btohqsg
I mean there’s already women signing on,btohqsg
It’s not like there isn’t an existing system in place to deal with including women in NS,btohqsg
Women are only allowed to sign on for combat iirc,btohqsg
by that logic id be a pes f,btohqsg
Why would you sign on for clerk anyway,btohqsg
If your pes isnt high enough then they dont allow you or strongly urge you not to,btohqsg
"What happens when I throw an elephant into a black hole.""wait  what black hole? Is it a Kerr black hole?""""I don't know! Let's try first! :D""",btohqsg
Because I love my nation and I want to serve it/s,btohqsg
They had one on that concept,btohqsg
And I want it to be free to be free,btohqsg
To be fair  their target audience are 12-18 year olds so they need to simplify and 'make things fun/funny' for them,btohqsg
I enjoy Oversimplified videos  although as the channel name implies  the contents are oversimplified  sometimes to the point of being misleading,btohqsg
?_? Somehow I don't think you should be talking about nukes to 12-18 year olds... Is their target audience really the teens?,btohqsg
Why shouldn’t you talk about nukes to them,btohqsg
^ I'm curious about this too,btohqsg
It's an educational channel that covers a variety of 'interesting' topics,btohqsg
quick sidetrack but I'm at rocky hill camp on tekong and there's a cute cat sleeping on my bunk bed uwu,btohqsg
You kind of need a certain maturity and context to understand nukes and its history. But ok I guess  people should be mature enough at those ages.,btohqsg
Weekend guard duty  I volunteered because I love my nation,btohqsg
okay 12-18 might have been a little too liberal of an age range,btohqsg
U mean cause someone offered u extra money,btohqsg
WTF nearer the sea  we never had cats ;_;,btohqsg
or does it still cut ur balls,btohqsg
I haven't taken a shower yet hehe  but the toilet kinda nasty,btohqsg
Meanwhile i reside in peaceful HTA,btohqsg
I'm doing guard duty  not rocky hill coy,btohqsg
Speak for yourself!!! Me and my section mates scrub our toilet every week for standby area,btohqsg
I dare to lie on the toilet floor after the cleaning,btohqsg
Toilets at my camp usually very clean,btohqsg
got a lot of weird ghost stories but,btohqsg
you'll need to see it to believe it,btohqsg
Area Cleaning Specialists on the job,btohqsg
I'm an atheist so bless my lucky stars,btohqsg
Later my 1am shift  I see whether can see hantu anot,btohqsg
LOL in my vocationthe toilet IC cleans it only a daily basis,btohqsg
no ah i lucky school 4 campus,btohqsg
for mine we have cleaners to clean it but only bc we reside on the 2nd floor,btohqsg
At worst people forget to flush toilet,btohqsg
area cleaning is always admin time,btohqsg
i see admin time on the timetable i facepalm,btohqsg
admin time is laze on bed time,btohqsg
i rather PT than standby area,btohqsg
I remember stayback force was given 5h area cleaning,btohqsg
“go up and do your area cleaning”,btohqsg
"""wait for further instructions after that""",btohqsg
Ok can  say yes to cmd schl for OCS for more scrubbing,btohqsg
my friend got summary trialed for taking the lift,btohqsg
Oh you sir ah... sorry sir...,btohqsg
Feels weird to get called sir like McD,btohqsg
When I never got in OCS,btohqsg
actually true  i did more pushup during SBA than during PT,btohqsg
But my point was anyway  OCS lots of FUN FUN times in toilet,btohqsg
Feels bad when u dont understand any acronym coz u from spf,btohqsg
cannot hear you back to zero,btohqsg
Real OCS goers could probably attest to this,btohqsg
"one sergeant  ""I SAY START FROM ZERO RIGHT  BACK TO NEGATIVE FIVE""",btohqsg
at least bmt they cant screw u too hard,btohqsg
ok if you want to hear the story,btohqsg
Minority as a civilian  minority as a serviceman,btohqsg
if u ever end up in cmd sch or mono,btohqsg
true  somemore i encik coy  welfare,btohqsg
if sgt mistreat  we complain encik,btohqsg
punishments dont rly have a limit,btohqsg
basically imagine this  yall have lots of camo  your uniform stinks  you got someshit next your whole group of ~60+?(IDK how many) need to do,btohqsg
so long as u get 7 hr uninterrupted rest,btohqsg
And everyone needs to change and not stink  how?,btohqsg
Excess bottles of febreeze and dry showers,btohqsg
Simple  when people go bathing  the cubicles aren't locked  everyone showers in 2mins (1min?) or less,btohqsg
then some guy takes too long so other guy kicks the door open,btohqsg
Wa I only heard stories  is this really true manz,btohqsg
mono got a lot of wild shit ba,btohqsg
fun part is u can be normal enhanced bmt batch,btohqsg
and then get sent to mono intake as a man,btohqsg
worst time is before entering unit,btohqsg
I’m probably never gonna pick up a rifle to shoot again,btohqsg
i want SCS then become quartermaster at bedok camp or smth kekekek,btohqsg
but knowing my luck if i go SCS cf kena tekong sgt >:(,btohqsg
We  members of the Singapore Armed Forces  do solemnly and sincerely pledge that we will always bear true faith and allegiance to the President and the Republic of Singapore.We will always support and defend the Constitution.We will preserve and protect the honour and independence of our country WITH OUR LIVES.,btohqsg

buttt if i survive guards  wa i gonna be fit as focc bois,btohqsg

OCS for SPF AFAIK only come from Tekong?,btohqsg
and i got posted here hehe,btohqsg
Not really thats SOC from what i heardOur ocs is called OCT i think,btohqsg
go MO say you feel like stabbing ppl when you see army personnels,btohqsg
I heard it in purple light,btohqsg
....... bruh way to end your whole life  not just NS,btohqsg
so a big part about guards RO is PT ah  so they can maintain fitness?@binsonnnn,btohqsg
2 or 3 times a day,btohqsg
then 2nd yr 2 times a day,btohqsg
for me everyday was more of morning pt,btohqsg
eh legit  ik will regret for saying this  but i prefer PT over doing useless saikang,btohqsg
Basically from what I know  INSP (NS) come from Tekong. If you go into SPF and get assigned to it from day 1  you have no chance for INSP.I heard you can still get SGT equivalent though,btohqsg
bmt is ntg till u go unit,btohqsg
When the generation that this group started with progresses into NS,btohqsg
In 2 years this will become SGUni,btohqsg
u see 3rd quarter  this chat will be full of panicking j2 students,btohqsg
yeah was wondering if this will become some adult grpchat eventually,btohqsg
"""eh my prelims like sht how""",btohqsg

What's the difference between methanol and ethanol,btohqsg

IDK if recce trooper is the peeps that do jungle  but did you heard the story of recce peeps supposed to walk through jungle  didn't  and got caught by star,btohqsg
isn't it that chain thingy  i remember learning,btohqsg
but my h1 chem is E so,btohqsg
I'm thinking of like having a long chain molecule but it's technically an alcohol,btohqsg
do whatever u want dont get caught,btohqsg
i want to meet star one day  then can sing to him twinkle twinkle little star,btohqsg
abit different from rifle company procedures,btohqsg
basically we do whatever we want,btohqsg
The price of being PES Female,btohqsg
get the important info back to our CO,btohqsg
i rmb my bunk door opening by itself after lights out,btohqsg
also what you said previously abt those 90 rp psc scholars,btohqsg
mono intake has a lot of like 90rp with scholarship,btohqsg
but theyre nt in rifle coy,btohqsg
griffin got ghost but dissolved >:(,btohqsg
my bmt section had some rj and hci ppl,btohqsg
The problem is that then they won't really really serve reservist  since their gahment rank is typically higher after they get out.Or even if they do serve reservist  wouldn't it be super weird,btohqsg
lets turn this army chat political,btohqsg
but the scholarship isn't government funded,btohqsg
Mono has very weird dynamics I feel,btohqsg
We have ite poly and jc  as well as 90rp scholars,btohqsg
Technically the mono peeps  you do well enough you still can go OCS,btohqsg
only in bmt phase ba mostly,btohqsg
did yall watch the BMT anime video made by mindef,btohqsg
The Uni will email us if they accept us right? Can’t wait!,btohqsg
so I have no idea how they'll group us  but we will end up doing reservist together as a platoon either way,btohqsg
feking cringe but very funny af,btohqsg
but I have to say it's interesting that you'll end up having people of different socioeconomic backgrounds mixing together.,btohqsg
My friends said the vids are kinda inaccurate as they don’t display certain prohibited contents,btohqsg
Oh  good  one of the better parts  you find out how others in different environment act,btohqsg
A few seconds in I already want to LAUUUUUUGH,btohqsg
Still merely men  so just slaves to the system lot.,btohqsg
had a good laugh in bunk w my friends,btohqsg
I’ll watch it nearing my enlistment ah,btohqsg
Still expand world dude. JC people only see JC people  might not really know how people in other streams really think/act,btohqsg
yeah thats better cus ull feking cringe more,btohqsg
theres more episodes which ill nt send here to spare you guys,btohqsg
i genuinely believe that such videos can adversely affect my brain chemicals and actually increase my chances of getting brain cancer  i kid you not,btohqsg
wash ur eyes with bleach maybe,btohqsg
This grp many serve alr right?,btohqsg
For this mono thing  it's still going to be a small minority ba. The situation where scholars mix with the middle and lower class is rare  mostly only occurring in the support company,btohqsg
Because they fill in the slots for support coy with people from normal BMT,btohqsg
I got the nation I wanted,btohqsg
Wait wtf  day 1 can fold smart 4 amazing,btohqsg
nowadays you learn it dat 1,btohqsg
cfm got this one guy in ur section whos wayang or was in a UG,btohqsg
I’ll pm u which nation :),btohqsg
The UG people are the MVPs of BMT,btohqsg
theres one episode where that one guy lost his magazine during outfieldsuper relatable cus my outfield had a guy who dropped his,btohqsg
some dude lost his rifle during atec,btohqsg
never knew what happened to him,btohqsg
That it was made with a MINDEF perspective,btohqsg
got fall in late and knock it down at 5am?,btohqsg
Dunno yet  but already got mention parent complain MP,btohqsg
vid is super unrealistic thats why its funny,btohqsg
obviously not  how to show trueblue BMT on YouTube,btohqsg
but if you PES BP like me  cannot eat,btohqsg
;_; the gardenia(?) bread thingie is not a proper snack,btohqsg
What constitutes a proper snack to you?,btohqsg
Usually they give out cookies or gardenia bread,btohqsg
The dude was shown eating like a chocolate snack or something  probably a personal snack lmao,btohqsg
Cookies is fine  but rare I think,btohqsg
the choc chip kind is good,btohqsg
Ya they don't give often rite,btohqsg
ok back to watching crash landing on you,btohqsg
happily sleeping in my aircon bunk,btohqsg
no sane human lets a cat sleep in the wet corridor,btohqsg
it's normal on rocky hill i believe  maybe someone else can confirm,btohqsg
but the fan bloody cold anyways so no need aircon...,btohqsg
Ok I lasted only 3 episodes of the anime,btohqsg
holy shit it's cringe to the max,btohqsg
it's propaganda in the form of anime  of course it'll be bad,btohqsg
Bruh no  some propaganda is a bit watchable,btohqsg
Not just any vacation  it's paid leave with free food and lodging,btohqsg
Like the SingSon II (OCS) or the GCC ones,btohqsg
tekong has that feeling in it,btohqsg
No surprise cos this is china,btohqsg
can ask if a 2nd major in uni can help you find a possible career in ur 2nd major?,btohqsg
I mean you will definitely be qualified to find a job with your second major,btohqsg
like the breadth/depth of study is sufficient for it?,btohqsg
As to whether or not you will be less competitive in the job market compared to those who pursue only that major  I don’t think so,btohqsg
Yeah if you do a double major (I think) your breadth/depth of study should be sufficient  unlike a minor,btohqsg
u just solved my uni course of choice crisis,btohqsg
I mean clearly people with the primary major will be chosen over you with the 2nd major,btohqsg
How many module credits is a primary major vs a 2nd major?,btohqsg
but just wondering whether one is still employable,btohqsg
im not rly into whether the single major is more employable than someone second majoring it,btohqsg
Yes but you lose out to the ones with primary major,btohqsg
Actually it depends on what the major is leh  and what job,btohqsg
science degree with 2nd major cs,btohqsg
FYI I've seen ppl who have a business degree  but hired as software engineer in government tech agency,btohqsg
Have you thought about what cs modules you want to do with that 48 mcs?,btohqsg
tbh things like programming methodology( the year 2 thingy)  data structures and algorithms  and if possible AI lor,btohqsg
"But it doesn't hurt to do this. Alternative way to look at it  instead of comparing whether ""sufficient"" or not  is to look at how much you get to learn instead. Take the option that allows you to learn all that you want to learn",btohqsg
but losing 1 of the 2 hurts a lot to me ngl,btohqsg
Ok i've seen the module plan,btohqsg
Good la  you have your answer haha,btohqsg
But i think it gives a lot of exposure,btohqsg
Nah it's pretty much the foundations of any cs student,btohqsg
if i take the mods given  does the bell curve include the primary major cohort as well?,btohqsg
Yes the bellcurve is for the students doing the module,btohqsg
seems like my cap will tank,btohqsg
Might as well go for computational biology 😂,btohqsg
That's partly why they have cs1010s vs cs1010e vs cs1010x,btohqsg
"But highlight here is ""foundations"" for a cs student. But that being said it should bring you enough exposure to pick up other stuff on your own",btohqsg
The technology hasn't been fully actualised for now  but if it becomes successful  would you guys switch to cell-based meats  why and why not?,btohqsg
At most it might go to 15/dumpling,btohqsg
All the health screening job temp taken?,btohqsg
SuP homies it would be great if yall could send some messages 🤩🤩🤩🤩,btohqsg
Pretty sure this aint the correct place to ask,btohqsg
Pretty sure this place is good to ask. Tons of student here Someone them sure have lobbang,btohqsg
By when must pay sp course fees?,btohqsg
It should be stated in your enrolment form or email,btohqsg
I do PT in SP  i think abt 2 weeks before it starts iirc,btohqsg
what is this PSEA thing  its saying my course fees are zero?,btohqsg
Does anyone know anything about this?,btohqsg
iirc its what ur edusave account becomes after tertiary educaiton],btohqsg
so if i select that dont need to pay anyt?,btohqsg
I scared later rejected or what then they kick me out of the course,btohqsg
Nvm  i am told its a loan thing,btohqsg
i mean if it says 0 dollars,btohqsg
Could i have that too 🤩,btohqsg
u dont need to write like that to get gp A,btohqsg
Why take gp when u can just sign on SAF,btohqsg
Not a very good idea but regardless,btohqsg
Why take General Paper when you can go for Graduation Parade,btohqsg
Why go graduation parade when u can ORD,btohqsg
Why go thru ns when u can pes F exempt,btohqsg
Sorry we dont allow recruits/trainees here,btohqsg
We r the true boys in blue,btohqsg
TRANSCOM IS JUST MRT SECURITY  CHANGE MY MIND,btohqsg
How to pull out 'hello' from d = {'k1':[1 2 {'k2':['this is tricky' {'tough':[1 2 ['hello']]}]}]},btohqsg

"Saw these words plastered at the front of the building  ""The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom""  not sure if I'm misinterpreting it  but if it is what I am intepreting it as  that's some horsesh*t to teach impressionable children.",btohqsg
That's a very euphemistic way to put it,btohqsg
Anyways the internet teaches lots of horsesh*t to kids already,btohqsg
For instance  watching live streaming of people eating  reading  living their lives  just short of sh***ing,btohqsg
Other ppl religion y need say is shit :(,btohqsg
anyway anyone still studying in nyjc right now? got some qns to ask,btohqsg
?? Just because City Harvest pastors are scammers doesn't mean all pastors are scammers  in a similar fashion  one church's stance/teachings does not reflect the beliefs of all Christians,btohqsg
They want follow that teaching is their problem no meh,btohqsg
ill wait for a response haha. random stranger pm very creepy,btohqsg
Anger was probably not my primary emotion,btohqsg
U just called whatever they believe horseshit leh,btohqsg
U can keep ur confusion n disappointment to urself n not bash other ppl beliefs right? :),btohqsg
You're doing the fallacy of composition  by the way,btohqsg
Just because I disagree with verse 1 of the bible doesn't mean I denounce all Christians' beliefs,btohqsg
And I chose to voice out my objection  you can choose to keep quiet  that's your choice,btohqsg
We can move to the dms if you wish to continue  since no one else is in this convo atm,btohqsg
Nvm ah my point is dont need call horseshit,btohqsg
Idc if u disagree with it or not,btohqsg
You mean Biz A? Cuz Biz A not exactly a biz degree,btohqsg

Honestly i think john's sgt is much scarier cough,btohqsg
