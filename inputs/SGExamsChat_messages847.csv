my family of 6 had to wait over 10 years for a BTO approval and we only got a 3-rm flat,btohqsg
i'm probs just going to buy a condo in the future,btohqsg
condo's a btr alternative compared to hdb now,btohqsg
market rate of hdb can be on par with hdb now,btohqsg
i mean best thing by right is hdb first then save for condo,btohqsg
ppl still follow it blindly though,btohqsg
career  cash  car  credit card  condo  country club,btohqsg
it's the whole golf is for rich ppl thing,btohqsg
wow you memorised it so clearly,btohqsg
a lot of rich hobbies died,btohqsg
nah there's still quite a few around,btohqsg
i'm literally going golfing in the morn LOL,btohqsg
i mean partly bc it's just cheaper to drive to jb,btohqsg
I think the land once expire cannot renew alr,btohqsg
like one session of golf in sg can cover a year in some places in jb,btohqsg
in that case  might as well demolish more unused buildings or land sites,btohqsg
i forgot that sg currency is fkin mad,btohqsg
Sg currency now too stronk now all nmcs all running 😩,btohqsg
i have lived in a third world country before and the disparity was like day & night,btohqsg

Got a class mate who watched vtubers,btohqsg
So far I have none of that,btohqsg
But deeeep down each of us know most of us gonna spiral down to it,btohqsg
I really suspect 5Cs is the dangling meat in front of the hamster wheel for those boomers to chase,btohqsg
I run my expenditure like the US government runs theirs,btohqsg
i mean it's not smth to chase per se lol,btohqsg
3 of those Cs you naturally get,btohqsg
U assume far too much for career,btohqsg
Forward sg had something about redefining each person’s Cs or smthing liddat,btohqsg
Meanwhile my boomer parents only know the 5Cs,btohqsg
Chaseper se.. are you telling me to get a credit card from Chase?,btohqsg
Another depressing thing is singapore doesnt look like singapore anymore,btohqsg
Can I use your name for the application?,btohqsg
Actually the 5C never specify if the credit card had to be yours,btohqsg
So technically credit card fraud counts,btohqsg
where to find golf course  bowling arena and tennis courts this day?,btohqsg

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9kkI3BswlU/?igsh=MXRiMmVjeHJxd2htNA==.UCAS 4000 word essay is revised. 😂 applying to the UK seems easier now.,btohqsg
Wait until age 35? Or just buy a Condo/Landed in Johor 😂 but you need a car too  which is another RM 40k.,btohqsg
When will be Singapore-Johor SAR ready ah? 🥲,btohqsg
Does this align with most folks in Singapore? I found my consumption in Terrace in Malaysia aligns with Singapore. lolhttps://www.spgroup.com.sg/our-services/utilities/tariff-information,btohqsg
are you using both malaysia's ringgit & singapore dollar  as a comparison model?,btohqsg
imo  it's not really a great alignment statistics tool but it's just a rough idea,btohqsg
kWh as units for power usage.,btohqsg
my family uses a lot more than the average tho,btohqsg
I mean a household in SG or MY is the same,btohqsg
The only difference is that we have to pay tariffs and levy,btohqsg
Computer Engineering or Digital Systems and Design\,btohqsg
same here in Peninsular Malaysia  next July  15% electricity bill hike. jesus,btohqsg
can try  see whether you like your environment.But certain places in Europe  cost of living is so damn high.Like 20 Euros+ just for a simple meal.Also limited choice of options.,btohqsg
terrace  yes for meAbout $800 to $900 electricity bill monthly,btohqsg
That unit seems to be kWh not SGD 😳,btohqsg
for my side is because there are 6 adults 4 kids,btohqsg
parent in laws + 2 helpers 😂,btohqsg
if you're the only breadwinner of the family. Your family expenses surely quite high 😂,btohqsg
It's pretty high.Groceries alone could be near $2k monthly.,btohqsg
Can't imagine when your kids going to start university 10+ years down the road... 😂,btohqsg
ok la  then $$ spent on enrichment now will be zero,btohqsg
"how you define ""enrichment""? In Singapore means tuition programs ah?",btohqsg
now at their age it's piano  swimming  taekwondo  art  balleton top of English and Chinese classes.,btohqsg
i see. Really quite privileged kids. 😂 Hope they enjoy what you signed up for them.,btohqsg
ok la  wife planned and paid for them. 😂,btohqsg
swimming is a life skill. Need it sooner or later. Better to learn younger,btohqsg
Actly i curious abt the piano and stuff,btohqsg
Sacrifices  no $$ and time go overseas trip.,btohqsg
Why ah? Besides maybe hoping they develop an interest?,btohqsg
I feel your overseas trip most likely is end up at Johor buying groceries. 😂,btohqsg
cuz wife likes piano. She's going to take diploma exam soon,btohqsg
this I wish I learnt this earlier on in life. I mostly sink in the swimming pool haha,btohqsg
Realistically is it rly that useful for self defense?,btohqsg
cuz my son overly active. So I gave him an avenue to burn off excess energy without being destructive while leanring something,btohqsg
as long it doesn't end up hurting someone else 😂,btohqsg
ballet for girls  flexibility. But stopping soon  not something to continue long term,btohqsg
Ballet at a higher lvl seems crazy,btohqsg
art is for them to express themselves in a different manner.More useful for my son  after a year plus can finally sit down for a whole class,btohqsg
not enough strength. 5 yr old going be 6 only,btohqsg
they like drawing. OK la. Better than drawing on the walls,btohqsg
Kids nvr know can randomly do smth ridiculous one💀,btohqsg
ahhh you be surprised... I went to dinner with my colleague's family.Her 6 y.o. kiddo hit me at my belly after dinner. 😂 really a powerful hit...,btohqsg

Vinicius clearly deserved to win it,btohqsg
has anyone visited nami island bfr ? is it worth gg,btohqsg
Anyone know why i cannot post in SGExams? Post gets auto removed,btohqsg
ur post most likely got removed by auto-mod's anti filtering on r/sgexams1. iirc  u must meet a minimum quota of200 Words / Charactersin ur post2. there's also a differentiation of academic & non-academic posts on weekdays & weekends  but nt v sure on this subject,btohqsg
u can check with the reddit mods,btohqsg
did u add flair (tags)if not  then it's probably an issue with reddit's end,btohqsg
such stuff happens a lot with the platform nowadays,btohqsg
do know Engineering is not the be-all and end all.It is the soft skills that you learnt along the way. 😂,btohqsg
weird polls on SG Ask Everyone,btohqsg
Maybe u keep yapping in ur post lol,btohqsg
She's referring to posting in the sgexams reddit my guy,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure there's no other subreddits like SGExams (correct me if I'm wrong),btohqsg
Hi  is there a way for me to contact the sgexams subreddit moderators?,btohqsg
My post from a while ago was removed  I sent the mods a message and didn’t get a reply,btohqsg
For me SGExams works just fine so yea,btohqsg
I was thinking they could have telegram and be in this chat,btohqsg
I genuinely don’t know what was wrong with my post,btohqsg
It was a rant about my family  there was nothing potentially inappropriate in it,btohqsg
And it was posted on a weekend if that matters,btohqsg
No there are people who post about random rant as well,btohqsg
They allow non-academic posts on weekends,btohqsg
And sometimes non-acad rants are allowed on weekdays too,btohqsg
Though not always  they don’t seem consistent on this,btohqsg
Mine isn’t a r/s post though,btohqsg
Ite course results are supposed to release at 9am,btohqsg
Now its 12am and i alrdy got an email about course acceptance?,btohqsg
And its like my last choice,btohqsg
Does that mean thats the only course im offered or will there be more results shown at 9am?,btohqsg
bro.. i got accepted into a course i didn't apply for ☠️,btohqsg
Cuz rlly my 9 to 12th choice dam shit,btohqsg
go to Self Services > Student Admission > Application Resultsyou'll enter a page called View Application Results,btohqsg
Bruh legit got my 11th choice sia,btohqsg
Is there a chance that more offers will show up at 9am?,btohqsg
i don't think so  it's not like EAE ( early admission exercise ),btohqsg
but anyways we have until this friday  3 Jan 2025 to make a decision,btohqsg
Idk bruh im js so shocked rn,btohqsg
Like i got 21 for n,btohqsg
Since dpp cut off is 19 i thought that 21 is a good enough score most for higher nitec courses,btohqsg
Especially since most of my most desired choices are ones where the requirement is to simply finish N lvl,btohqsg
Like srsly 1 to 10th all cannot with a fucking 21,btohqsg
I wld expect smth like that if i got like 24 or below but not fucking 21,btohqsg
and i think dpp had their offers separately done,btohqsg
my brother received his way earlier,btohqsg
idk why bro chose to apply for the campus all the at the west when we're like at the east side,btohqsg
especially since he did pretty well for his N(A)s,btohqsg
he got raw 13 for EMB3meanwhile my EMB2 in 2023 was 13 🌚,btohqsg
When did he get his results?,btohqsg
specifically not too long after the cut-off period to apply for ITE courses,btohqsg
Ok but is it common for someone to be offered more than 1 course?,btohqsg
Feel like for O levels  answer would have been no. So  I presume it would be same for dpp also for n levels,btohqsg
Alright then i wanna appeal like rn,btohqsg
The instructions to appeal doesnt make sense honestly,btohqsg
Anyone here knows how to do it?,btohqsg
the only way to appeal is to accept the course offer & do it on campus,btohqsg
like during the start of school,btohqsg
And everything is the exact same thing as the original course application,btohqsg
is that some kind of animal trafficking shit,btohqsg
I did not even bother to apply back then,btohqsg
Different programme different type of application,btohqsg
Btw who here applied for DPP (like got ur course already or waiting for appeal results),btohqsg
thats the course u have been posted to,btohqsg
nah  some ppl one come out damn early,btohqsg
Appeal results will be out on 10 Jan 2025 from 9am,btohqsg
just reposted something from r/singapore reddit,btohqsg
actually i think this person was talking about the other guy that sent a nsfw link,btohqsg
there's a chance it will fail,btohqsg
Same to the rest of y'all who appealed,btohqsg
v high chance ( sic. of failing )esp for those who want to study at ite central,btohqsg
u shld also accept whatever course offer u received first,btohqsg
1. local SIM cards2. mental health bill2. Immigration & travel clearances,btohqsg
Congrats to those successful JC/High School students received an offer from Oxford and Cambridge:1. RI - 30%5. HCI - 36%52. NUS-HS - 40%https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/schools-colleges-top-10-oxford-cambridge-oxbridge-university-students/https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/676e5e280000000013019dc5?xsec_token=ABFp1_ujoWsNuwqH8GN8y642gdQwmjmbG3GzcRRUbfpt8=&xsec_source=pc_feed,btohqsg
I'm always reading up on the latest laws,btohqsg
It's no surprise that RI is number 1,btohqsg
scoot delayed my flight more than 6 hours,btohqsg
departure frm sg: delayed fr 3 hours. now departure frm seoul: its delayed fr 7 hours,btohqsg
budget airlines can't complain too much ._.,btohqsg
given how many incident happened in this past few days.,btohqsg
But scoot has been quite reliable,btohqsg
Bruh I just remembered the last time I flew was to India 5 years ago,btohqsg
first time taking scoot  last min book so cldnt book sia,btohqsg
Oh then maybe delay is defo expected,btohqsg
i mean it can be reliable schedule wise  but if plane has some parts malfunctioned and required inspection  definitely would be safer to be delayed. lol,btohqsg
Singapore Airliners got rules saying if delay how many hours need to compensate with food/water/hotel things?,btohqsg
Just checked and apparently there isn't,btohqsg
Oh yea yall know another jeju airlines planes had landing gear problems and returned to airport,btohqsg
Jeju Air Flight 7C101 was flying from Azerbaijan to Russia,btohqsg
Also two KLM planes had emergencies,btohqsg
This is on top of the pakistan international airlines plane that caught fire after landing in canada,btohqsg
yea  i was one of them,btohqsg
do u know ppl in digital & precision engineering,btohqsg
hey but im getting the cert for my currebt course so..,btohqsg

at one point  your past messages showed Deleted Account again,btohqsg
oh the other acc  deleted by tele again. idk why  no reason given,btohqsg
I saved your sticker pack lol,btohqsg
is anyone getting more & more spam calls from god knows where,btohqsg
yeah it is postponed due to a operational / machinery fault,btohqsg
mine will call me back sia,btohqsg
"i pick up hear ""hello ica"" I put down",btohqsg
they call back with a diff number,btohqsg
you just gotta give them a chance man,btohqsg
idk where do they get our phone numbers,btohqsg
those long ass phone calls i had amounting probably over 2 hrs today (30 Dec 24) was from a dude,btohqsg
he kept insisting if i could help with wechat verification,btohqsg
i found it weird how he kept calling me back with diff numbers,btohqsg
i put my phone on do not disturb mode,btohqsg
eh giga got problem these few days ah,btohqsg
crazy slow internet sia  youtube vid also buffer for half a minute,btohqsg
thinking of changing telco  any recommendations?,btohqsg
thanks man i’ll check em out,btohqsg
is it prepaid? I noticed alot of Singapore phone call / SMS spam using Singtel Prepaid lol,btohqsg
does anyone know how to do javascript,btohqsg
I only can do C++ and Python.Javascript might need to chatGPT abit lol,btohqsg
I'm a full-stack software engineer experienced in JS/TS  Rust  Java etc.What do you need?,btohqsg
rlly ??? i’m using singtel ( not prepaid ) but i didn’t get any,btohqsg
I guess it was bot generated. Where they randomly spam numbers. Normally it is those Loans or Gamble ads. Or random US calls,btohqsg
all these local numbers belonged to the same dude,btohqsg
idfk how personal contact is getting leaked left & right,btohqsg
two possibilities(1) Our telcos outsourced cust service to other countries. Maybe leaked from there.(2) Not very tough for programmers to just write code to call from 8000000 to99999999It's just 20 mil numbers to automate,btohqsg
As a programmerPossible but computationally expensive,btohqsg
anyone apply under them before?? Rapid Recruitment Asia Pte Ltd,btohqsg
You don't need no programmer or any shit,btohqsg
Try out the M1 Maxx plan,btohqsg
All this yapping just to realised that ScamShield will help,btohqsg
Arguably one of the best songs by MJ,btohqsg
I am pretty sure this just means your 1-12 all unsuccessful,btohqsg
Btw guys I called ITE yesterday and they said appeal results for DPP will be out on 10 jan,btohqsg
Then there is actually one more appeal date from 10 to 14 Jan and results will be out on 16 Jan (for this appeal  have to choose vv carefully),btohqsg
yeah  there are a few appealing phases,btohqsg
but u still gotta accept the offer u received first,btohqsg
if u reject it already then gg,btohqsg
Don't worry I understand your pain,btohqsg
now all the courses with leftover vacancies are those engineering ones,btohqsg
im gonna walk towards higher grounds,btohqsg

Damn the clearly AI generated art,btohqsg
poly pw submission is a week after new years and it’s hard to get it done bcs many ppl are gg overseas during the 3 wks holi break,btohqsg
They should at least give you 2 more weeks,btohqsg
Good news is the paper they print the cert on is very nice,btohqsg
Is it laminated? I think psle was right,btohqsg
No the cert where never laminated,btohqsg
It was always printed on acid free parchment paper,btohqsg
Oh i must have confused them lol,btohqsg
If u hold all SEAB certs to the light u should be able to see the watermark,btohqsg
Doesn't degrade as much even after moisture and improper storage,btohqsg
Is laminated after by your parents,btohqsg
Even my parents ones are not laminated,btohqsg
unless my pri sch decided to be extra,btohqsg
aren't parchment paper the one for microwave/oven food lol,btohqsg
didn't take o levels and never collected a levels cert,btohqsg
Anyways the paper is the same paper used on the school graduation cert too,btohqsg
you took NUS High School Diploma or what lol,btohqsg
was in ns then lazy to travel from kc3 to my sch lol,btohqsg
Singapore can get Result Slip and Official Certificate on the same day?,btohqsg
cert was only ready for me to collect from general office a while later,btohqsg
I know some schools till today also separate,btohqsg
But in my experience is same day,btohqsg
Only the School Graduation Cert is separate,btohqsg
Your school got the rule of unreturn library books no cert?,btohqsg
😂 why you want to steal library books ._. mostly will be obsolete in few years time lol,btohqsg
Usually they stagger is for that stick one,btohqsg
Some of them is legit lost what secondary school kids,btohqsg
or maybe they did have the rule  but i never borrowed anything anyway,btohqsg
Actually which batch then fully SEAB ah?,btohqsg
Singapore-Cambridge is more like 2001 thing.,btohqsg
Is only recently then they fully be separate,btohqsg
dunno from the TYS books I collected. I noticed Singapore Syllabus codes uses their own syllabus after 2001 onwards lah 😂,btohqsg
I thought only like certain papers like Mothertongue or what is SEAB one,btohqsg
Is all joint then for MT is SEAB only,btohqsg
The newer batches not even joint fully SEAB for all,btohqsg
anyways now gce exam results on singpass alr,btohqsg
and psle results is in skill future,btohqsg
😂 well atleast HR company can directly go online check  without going through certify by True Copy crap,btohqsg
very funny how Malaysia jobs  you still need your SPM/O-Level cert  despite you having higher than O-Level cert.,btohqsg
The kind that is very soft and good for wiping ass with,btohqsg
Seab using the same paper we bake cookies on for our results? Sure boh,btohqsg
u gna wipe ur ass with the cert ah,btohqsg
If it's Nlevel it's probably the only useful thing u can do with it,btohqsg
library will ask you to pay for the books before that,btohqsg
Do not pay do not pass go do not collect 200,btohqsg
ask parents to come to general office to pay,btohqsg
If the parents don't come what next,btohqsg
What u send the bill to collections isit,btohqsg
i js hope i pass everything 😭😭,btohqsg
U underestimate the amount of bochup parents,btohqsg
U also underestimate the power of giving the school a fake number for your parents,btohqsg
Your parents' number is in your school's / MOE's records,btohqsg
I still keep my entry proof,btohqsg
It's kind of a good luck charm,btohqsg
dun curse me leh wth 😭,btohqsg
too bad i working on results day,btohqsg
dont hv to go hall with the sweaty ppl,btohqsg
This place keep getting gambling ads,btohqsg
idk why the bot isn't working,btohqsg
😂 can always go take the International Cambridge iGCSE/O Level Syllabus.Heard those paper are weak af. lol,btohqsg
yeah they are much easier I believe,btohqsg
88% out 100% scored Grade E and upper. lol,btohqsg
international exams  need to account for countries with poorer math background I guess.,btohqsg
but IGCSE Mandarin Foreign paper is a joke lol,btohqsg
That was my o levels target score as wellAfter cca  it was 25 🤔,btohqsg
what did you get for o's,btohqsg
Idk where my n levels one went,btohqsg
Can find in singpass don't worry,btohqsg
No use for it alr 😂,btohqsg
People collect kpop cards he collect GCE certs,btohqsg
i feel like im too much of a tea loverwell  more like gossiper ahem,btohqsg
the fact i recognise this reference.. well sorta,btohqsg
omg if liddat can still qualify for EAE rite,btohqsg
Successful Eae acceptance  below 26  irregardless of grades enough,btohqsg
Had friends that applied for eae whom had f9 for English during the first eae opening and were accepted..so all they needed was to score 26 or below for o levels,btohqsg
i think ur eae might not revoke if u meet minimum entry requirements and cop,btohqsg
just fail to remember the format for the comprehension qns...you will fail the whole subject super quickly,btohqsg
tfw my p3 chi teacher insulted my mum for working low class job so im now sleep deprived trying to complete 7 years of chinese syllabus by mid year chi papers,btohqsg
look at chinese news  slowly learn what each chinese term refers to,btohqsg
i cant even understand the instructions on the exam paper😭,btohqsg
you dont need to  just take note of the commonly used chinese words,btohqsg
usually refering to things people normally see  use or smell,btohqsg
What if your oral  essay and LC is good,btohqsg
essay is your 2nd largest mark contributor  dont write out of point and you will be alrght,btohqsg
i got E8 for my english  thats why i know how it feels to fail english,btohqsg
Idk usually I score decently for essay,btohqsg
Bc I don't make grammatical errors,btohqsg
Oral - just talkLC - take notesPaper 2 - Use common sense to answer in own wordsPaper 1 - Come up with storyline or points and just bs your way thru,btohqsg
Apply same tips to Chinese to pass,btohqsg
i wrote abt priyanka chopra in my essayy,btohqsg
oral was so bad the examiners literally told me to stop speaking i was yapping for 30 minutes straight,btohqsg
you're prob one of those who is particularly obsessed with remembering certain ppl's names and quote/ idioms for the essays lol,btohqsg
...you prob talk bs too much all day long that were irrelevant and making it a monologue.,btohqsg
😭 wdym all points were related to climate,btohqsg
not sure if that's how you talk to your frens too but why wld you speak 30 min straight to them,btohqsg
i might've fallen asleep listening to you drone on and on,btohqsg
idk i just have a lot to say abt climate change,btohqsg
hahahaha  i hope the examiners were impressed with you,btohqsg
did you score well overall for english?,btohqsg
for prelims i got 25 for oral,btohqsg
what were the compo topics btw? just curious,btohqsg
😭 i think im gna fail o’s tho,btohqsg
ig bcuz the examiners had to tell you to stop  you must lower your expectations in that aspect,btohqsg
unless god works up sm miracle,btohqsg
same topic for compo as oral?,btohqsg
they were like “okay thats all we need u may go”,btohqsg
do you have the whole qn,btohqsg
idk all ik is the bellcurve high,btohqsg
if everyone who thought they're gonna fail actually fails,btohqsg
i actually do think im gna fail,btohqsg
i think i hv to go sec5 leh,btohqsg
i think you might not fail everything  perhaps just oral,btohqsg
oh whatever atleast i wont be put in the gangster class,btohqsg
got 12 ppl in sec5 in my sch,btohqsg
Cus you over-presented and the examiners have more ppl to examine. When you do that  you affect their moods to be more negative,btohqsg
Which increases your probability of failing,btohqsg
😭 also if you mark based on emotions,btohqsg
Cus both examiners will be pissed off,btohqsg
that just reduces the legitimacy of the exam,btohqsg
i mean if you step in the shoes of the examiner what wld you feel?,btohqsg
girl idt ppl mark based on emotions,btohqsg
inherently thats just a wrong way of marking,btohqsg
i mean that's why there's a certain limit to the number of words ideally for compo as well,btohqsg
um cambridge is a very prestigious and internationally renowned academic institution,btohqsg
yep  but if someone really spoke for that long in a supposed 15 minute oral I would really want them to get over with it,btohqsg
i don’t think they mark on emotions,btohqsg
i'm sad to disappoint you that your oral examiners aren't from cambridge,btohqsg
is it like the mt one,btohqsg
You can pay up $50 to ask for the SEAB to look through  but they won't show you the marks,btohqsg
anyways i hope you pass sincerely,btohqsg
cus you sound like you studied a lot for it,btohqsg
or i do coin toss and let it decide,btohqsg
o levels in sec 4 then retake again in sec 5? or what?,btohqsg
sorry i don;t get it cus my sec sch was all o level,btohqsg
they put the retakers in sec5 class,btohqsg
but i hv to appeal to the sch,btohqsg
which in it of itself is a tedious process already,btohqsg
i could go to ite mechanical engine and js like do well to skip a yr of poly,btohqsg
depends on your progress :- if you really dislike the academic curriculum  ITE would be hands-on and practical-based so you would enjoy being there instead- if you are able to go to any poly course  just go for it and avoid going ITE cus nitec is lower qualification as compared to diploma level- if you really did badly but you felt it was cus you didn't put in effort (which I doubt applies to you) or you had major distractions  perhaps retaking O level (either all OR for certain subjects) might benefit you,btohqsg
idk if i fit in ite tho.. like i dont vape and shi,btohqsg
im gonna get jumped on my first day,btohqsg
oh its not nitec its higher nitec,btohqsg
also its 2 years compared to the NA 3 years,btohqsg
that's all a stereotype of ITE lol (according to Min Chan  it's not getting your kid into a good school  but entering a school good to your kid in terms of educational pace and focus),btohqsg
i lowkey wanna try a vape tho,btohqsg
what's your l1r5 for the prelims?,btohqsg
gd to hear that  otherwise i might have to redirect you to MOH's site on harmful effects of vaping (so you can write a full essay on it and discuss for 30 minutes straight on it in future),btohqsg
anyways i wont collect my results bc im working,btohqsg
i think that shld be sufficient to enter some courses in poly.,btohqsg
yeah but my f9 was math,btohqsg
Plus you're more likely to improve from prelims as you sound like you place huge emphasis on academic grades,btohqsg
lol there was 2 mths to push it up possibly to C5 or even a B3,btohqsg
i genuinely feel you're overthinking a lot.,btohqsg
idk i hv to wait for results dayy,btohqsg
and decide on the best course of action,btohqsg
ugh ite graduation is in feb 2027,btohqsg
all the best for the collection on 10 Jan,btohqsg
which courses are you looking to enter though? cus poly range for last year for l1r5 is not extremely low,btohqsg
no  there's prone to be oppt there as well,btohqsg
;( js that my math is terrible,btohqsg
do the teachers know the results already,btohqsg
let's keep our fingers crossed and await the results,btohqsg
no  the certs aren't sent in so early,btohqsg
its sent on the day itself rightt,btohqsg
10th jan my shift is like 10am to 7pm soo,btohqsg
likely they'll send the certs on the day itself or a day earlier but as you know  the teachers will have a summary or analytics of how their classes fared as a cohort,btohqsg
haha i didn't collect mine on the day itself tooig not collecting on the day itself means it will be left in the general office so all your teachers can discuss more about your results and gossip about it,btohqsg
my class is more like an NT class,btohqsg
who knows  they might have studied without your knowledge?,btohqsg
also like so many ppl had mental health issues during o level seasonn,btohqsg
If everyone does badly the bell curve helps you,btohqsg
*i suppose this helps everyone too cus all the cut-off points will increase and the range for everything increases even if there's no bell curve,btohqsg
that's how supply and demand work in general based on school placements,btohqsg
😍🤞 i just have no idea what to take if i go there,btohqsg
Rohit are u kurt tay lawyer,btohqsg
Girl came out of the spectator stands and threw a bombshell 💀,btohqsg
also Girl your book is upside down,btohqsg
You gotta wait like 6 to 7 weeks for it to appear,btohqsg
hallo ⭐⭐ im sec4 this year ! from last yr sec4s cn i ask if u guys have any tips for olvls,btohqsg
i will do you proud ⭐,btohqsg
Put in all the effort you can,btohqsg
I also thought so but they won't know,btohqsg
Vape is for wannabes don't do it,btohqsg
Honestly  even though ppl do vaping in sg (p.s. quite illegal to vape btw),btohqsg
How's his performance as his personal TA,btohqsg
I gave a good rating for the survey thing :D,btohqsg
But results wise im only finding out in 12 hours,btohqsg
after all the effort i went through for him…,btohqsg
What makes you think i will do the TA feedback,btohqsg
Between a rock and a hard place lestin,btohqsg
I NEED to know my discrete math grade,btohqsg
Probably not because she lazy af,btohqsg
i’d have been surprised if she did,btohqsg
But you dont need a feedback to know youre the number 1 TA in my heart,btohqsg
He alr submit the grade long ago liao,btohqsg
I put 5 out of 5 stars,btohqsg
He's so good he doesn't need a scale,btohqsg
I need fgo to come NOW,btohqsg
I need to remove my su,btohqsg
Is abt me removing my su so that i can su later,btohqsg
second this  ur lungs are gonna suffer in the long run,btohqsg
what was the subject combo again,btohqsg
I'm planning to take PFME or XFME actually,btohqsg
I would have done something like PCMH but that's a bad idea LOL,btohqsg
I did study the syllabi beforehand  is that commonly expected,btohqsg
My friend said bio + hist + geo + something was suicide,btohqsg
So far people have told me geog is the hardcore one,btohqsg
yeah  it's a lot of content,btohqsg
history can be a lot of memorization but you gotta study history as a story/narrative and not just facts on a page,btohqsg
Ever since I began studying in December I found it really enjoyable,btohqsg
JC econs is nothing like econs in uni or irl,btohqsg
I'm ... using a uni textbook to study econs,btohqsg
it's quite essay based but then as soon as you hit uni it's like week 1: calculus,btohqsg
But would say it may interest those who wanna look into business and governance related topics,btohqsg
no such thing as a demand curve  demand is the partial derivative of a utility function,btohqsg
If I can I might decide to triple major,btohqsg
Quite impossible to triple major in sg tho...,btohqsg
a bit like a second major,btohqsg
I'm planning to enter MIT / Stanford,btohqsg
Math + CS + maybe Econs,btohqsg
planning is a strong word here but all the best,btohqsg
triple major is far too broad  it's usually better to pick one or two things and specialize in it,btohqsg
thing isi already studied uni content for math and cs,btohqsg
We actually have a professor who did a triple major in math wcons and phy,btohqsg
you can be multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary  but it's usually because what you're studying can't be categorized into one or two disciplines,btohqsg
i'd be relearning my math and cs,btohqsg
so i'm seeking new things to learn,btohqsg
i'm just saying what my prof took,btohqsg
Yeah but econs is more applicable i wld say,btohqsg
this will trigger most physicists butphysics is applied math,btohqsg
i mean it worked for him based on his research,btohqsg
i'm not triggered at all lol,btohqsg
if you cannot do math you shouldn't be in physics,btohqsg
any physicist will agree with you,btohqsg
It depends on the type of physicists,btohqsg
it's like if you can't do calculus you shouldn't be in econs,btohqsg
my friend does HEP physicsand yes he's a theoretical phy,btohqsg
LmaoHe still uses a lot of math,btohqsg
my friend is at cern too lol,btohqsg
He hates hearing me tell him that all the time,btohqsg
mb he thinks physics is too applied and like  beneath math,btohqsg
i mean you don't have to tell him that all the time,btohqsg
it was printed in one of my jc math notes,btohqsg
and that was 10 years ago,btohqsg
my uncle told me he read what if xkcd when it was being released weekly when I bought the book,btohqsg
I'd wonder how many xkcd comics are there now,btohqsg
I would say i enjoy jc math tho,btohqsg
How do you find Statistics enjoyable,btohqsg
feel like you either love it or hate it,btohqsg
iff is so stupid but it makes more sense in like game theory,btohqsg
they decided to put stats in FM,btohqsg
stats is too useful to not try to enjoy for me lol,btohqsg
the UK lets me take group theory instead of stats,btohqsg
prove that the stable marriage is strategyproof (25 marks) wah dllm,btohqsg
the moment you start coloring your notes  you know shit has hit the fan,btohqsg
Ever since they removed it and then reinstalled in 2018,btohqsg
i haven't written on a piece of paper in very long,btohqsg
It's the answer to qn 14,btohqsg
i've just been writing my paper,btohqsg
i think higher level stats is interesting,btohqsg
