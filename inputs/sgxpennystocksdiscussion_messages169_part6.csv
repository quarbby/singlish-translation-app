Now focus is on micropennies. So many traders attention will be on micropennies which mean many other popular counters we played is not easy to run up. When micropennies are in play  usually there will be 1 or 2 micropennies leader that lead the micropennies. And BBs usually use a theme to push it up. And when the micropennies leader move a lot  traders will tried to buy other micropennies thinking they will move like the leader. But I tell you many traders will be stuck because many micropennies are pump n dump kind. Those with very thick queue is even harder to move if no power BBs like the leader to push them. E.g. if you buy at 0.002  you want to huat the price have to move up to 0.003-0.004 which mean must clear all the queues at 0.002 n 0.003. If queues are very thick  to move 2 pips is like moving a mountain if there's no power bbs. So pls trade with care. Also  I have mentioned many times previously that when micropennies are in play  it tells us that a market pullback is on the way. So it's good not to hold too many counters or trade bigger lots from now on. How many ppls will believe and will do that?. I doubt very few....,btohqsg
I think it's good to read this with serious note.,btohqsg
Like what Dax said   don't happy happy buy and think it will shoot like volcano every day.,btohqsg
Yup. Very good heads up and advise.,btohqsg
This one i still holding half. Rly hope will run keke,btohqsg
Bro  Polaris has no theme to play up. This is just 1 of the  micropennies that follow the leader or I would say chase by retailers. So no sign of direction.,btohqsg
Yea never read much into Polaris  the float quite big I think 17 B.I feel HS Optimus (formerly KLW holdings) might have better chance for run if micropennies crazy sentiments continue.,btohqsg
blumont becos or takeover also got theme? but alrdy 7.. so dun knw too high anot,btohqsg
Market pull back = blue chip correction or general all correction ah?,btohqsg
I believe some one have accumulated   based on calculation at least 100 000 000 shares. Ready to fry it. Back in 2013 to 2014 period. 0.006 to 0.045 I recall. This one quite popular. I believe the BBs will be back to play. Anyways  this counter fundamentals not so bad. $17mill cash . NAV: $0.012x . They will likely strike soon. Current timing ideal,btohqsg
I hv feeling BB try to play the micropennies which are popular before last time.,btohqsg
Hello everybody.Do u like TANHTantech technologies for the next days?,btohqsg
This is an extremely good news and strong signal not only for Hartalega but also the sector as a whole. It is a validation of the call that Hartalega is a good long term value pick you should have in your portfolio. Take comfort in the fact that EPF has been buying instead of selling Gloves despite the Vaccine news announcement of Pfizer and Moderna. Congrats to all who bought on weakness. For those who missed my earlier article of Hartalega as my Long Term Value Pick  please feel free to read here :https://www.tradeview.my/2020/09/tradeview-2020-long-term-value-pick-5.html?m=1,btohqsg

The word 'improving' seem so nice.... But it is so sad,btohqsg
I cannot understand  its definition in this case  contradictory to what we saw on news with Long stretch of >100k new cases daily,btohqsg
Those who caught UG and Eindec on Friday evening. Get ready to Huat next week.,btohqsg
You can use the EW chart to see the trend. As for me  both are plateau with minimum movement. Even with the so call approved vaccine is ready to be dispensed in selected countries. I think you can see  no effect at all. I call it â€œ Vaccine Fatigue â€œ. For the BB  itâ€™s time to do some pushing. Dyodd.,btohqsg
