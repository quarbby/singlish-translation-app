Wait for capita Amex card promo with capita vouchers,btohqsg
Hi can i ask how come i got 100k in my Uob one account and i met the credit salary and spend on cc but only got $213 interest?,btohqsg
Depends when u deposit the 100  it’s average daily balance,btohqsg
Ah i see  does that mean following month onwards then i can get the full 7.8%?,btohqsg
By right yes if u have fulfilled the criteria’s,btohqsg
5% p.a.* you should get $424.6 this month,btohqsg
i think u need to fulfill 3 girl transactions,btohqsg
??? Means what  need to pay for spa  manicure  Sephora spends?,btohqsg
how do we get the 7.8%?,btohqsg
7.8 is only for the last 25k,btohqsg
ah so the highest interest is actually just 5%,btohqsg
Yup  effective interest rate on 100k is 5%,btohqsg
Yes it’s clearly stated in the website as well,btohqsg
Thanks  i tried the uob lady’s then apply for solitaire but my solitaire card application was rejected (probably because i dont hit the min salary requirement). Do you know if i can fulfil some other criteria like maybe a few months of spend on the lady’s card  or deposit a certain amount into uob one account?,btohqsg
Hi everyone i came across this article n point 3 is a bit confusing. With the employer contribution for ma not flowing to oa  where does it go then?,btohqsg
How long did you wait before you try applying for solitaire? I’m not sure if putting money will help you get the approval but definitely can use the normal lady’s card for a few months and try again.,btohqsg
I didnt wait much because i wanted the solitaire card. Will try again after a month i guess  thanks!,btohqsg
I think it’s a typo..instead of now  it becomes not,btohqsg
Haha maybe can inform the author on the typo,btohqsg
If I have 100k sgd which one best to get highest interest?? Uob stash or Uob one? I am new to UOB,btohqsg

Anyone knows if Evol is applicable forZym mobile payment (count as online?)Anytime fitness gym memeveship?,btohqsg

max 60 days (with subscription S$50K)  no min,btohqsg
UOB One @ 5% p.a. with 1.6k salary credit + $500 cc spend.,btohqsg
ZYM is online based on my understanding,btohqsg
Banks have the rights to amend their prevailing rates. Just need to pay attention and Move your funds around in reaction to changes.,btohqsg
Giro transactions cannot get $100k 5% eir. Must be salary and $500 spend.,btohqsg
Morning  for hdb loans repayment with cpf  i understand that the deduction is on the Sunday  between the 6th and 12th (including both dates) of the month. Anyone know a more precise timing? As in the hour in which it happens?,btohqsg
Can share wat is the purpose of knowing the precise timing? 🤔,btohqsg
Eh... actually i am short of funds in cpf  so need cash top up  but i also can use the funds throughout tomorrow  so it will be useful if i know exactly when i need top up  be it today before midnight or x timing tomorrow,btohqsg
I’m really confused.If the cpf deduction is at 6am or 12pm on 10th feb. Does it make a difference?U still need to move in the funds on 10th feb right?Unless your bank earns u interests by the minute like car park?,btohqsg
Hello all  UOB Krisflyer only awards 3mpd on online shopping. So will offline shopping paired with Amaze earn 3mpd?Assuming I spent the $800 on Singapore Airlines,btohqsg
If the mcc matches the white list. And U fulfil $800 sq spend,btohqsg
It does makes a difference in my case cause i can use the cash throughout tomorrow  i suppose can imagine that i place it in a bank that earns me interest every min,btohqsg
Sounds kinda sus but I suggest you can ask HDB?,btohqsg
Sat today  tomorrow payment  so...But ok  its a very tiny thing which most wouldn't take note ba  was just trying my luck here to see if anyone knows,btohqsg
Haha can ask HDB for subsequent ones lor,btohqsg
there are banks which earn you interest every minute?!,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone has AIA proachiever policy? I am paying $6000 premium per year. I think generally for all ILP needs to wait quite some time to see the returns? It is also because the hefty fees in the beginning. Mine incepted since Aug 2021. Does anyone bought it way earlier than me?,btohqsg
Can I check if I buy something with monthly installment of 100 bucks each with UOB one cRs. Will the 100 bucks be considered for the eligible spend of 500 bucks?,btohqsg
Or UOB will just take the spend of the full amount ( e.g 3k at the start),btohqsg
I have mine rejected until I updated my income. Your exp may differ. They seem more particular for this card - that is with spending history with them and deposits,btohqsg
Can check for UOB lady  if redeem biz with tax of around $300 in euro. Will still earn 6mpd,btohqsg
What method are you using for monthly installments?,btohqsg
lol. that guy sounded so convinced there were.,btohqsg
