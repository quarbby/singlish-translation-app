Hello! If we use cardup to pay income tax  do we need to go IRAS site to indicate GIRO payment by monthly instalment? Or can just apply via Cardup?,btohqsg

Hi all   wanted to ask for the instarem amaze+mastercard vs instarem amaze wallet option. I tried both options(transactions were made 15mins apart on the same day) in Malaysia last month and the exchange rates on both had a 2% difference (amaze+master having a lower fx). Any idea if it's still worth to tag a mastercard to accumulate miles?,btohqsg
It is know to have 2 percent difference in spot rate for wallet and link card option,btohqsg
worth it if mastercard earns more than 2%,btohqsg
i'm surprised only a 2% difference was observed  since amaze wallet > MYR is usually better than MC rates,btohqsg
amaze wallet now has MYR in-wallet  using their own rate. generally better than MC's own rate and closer to spot,btohqsg
does amaze wallet if u use sgd auto convert and then make payment? i realise if i just top up sgd in amaze wallet  even if i dont convert it to myr  the conversion rate they give if i link amaze to wallet is very goodlike better than if i convert using their conversion thingalso way better than if i link to credit card,btohqsg
Worth if linking 4mpd Mastercard with amaze.,btohqsg

yesterday holiday.. give UOB chance please.. check tomorrow laanyway as long as u see it under ACCOUNT BALANCE.. no worries,btohqsg
you can convert to lock in a good rate (like youtrip) but not necessary,btohqsg
his is the other way.. he waiting for release,btohqsg
Does the UOB app display the end date when the ear mark supposed to finish? I dont see that.,btohqsg
no it won't.. have to rely on the table.based on my memory.. the earmark is released ONE DAY after the official datee.g. if it stated 18th June 2024  you can only see the release on 19th June 2024 (day hours  not at 12.01am).but if it is 17th June 2024 (public holiday)  maybe +1 day la.. give chance please,btohqsg

When I was overseas  I had one establishment that kept getting rejected. Amaze said it was rejected under their internal review guidelines too. No further explanation.,btohqsg
That is terrible I got the same too I am now panickingThis might force me back to using normal ATM nets card if it continue,btohqsg
Do you consistently spend >1k every month or only occasionally to absorb any spend that are >1k but <2k  wondering whether it's easy to get annual fee waived. And also wonder whether UOB considers spendings on other cards like when considering waiving annual fee.,btohqsg
I use it to supplement other card when fully clock or use it for fcy spending. Usually have no issue waiving uob card  i do think they take overall spending as considering i have more then 10 card with uob,btohqsg
Wow you remembered !!How does it looks like? All good ?,btohqsg
Always have YouTrip as ultimate backup,btohqsg
I have trust and UOB prvi as backup for overseas uses.,btohqsg

I do have HSBC revolution but is useless now that they nerf it is still active though...you are right I should start looking out on other card,btohqsg

From my understanding  don't think GXS debit is suitable for overseas use. Best for Singapore use only. Trust card can check rate unlike YouTrip. I have no idea on how other card or app work. I only know trust and YouTrip.,btohqsg
Amaze wallet top-up with CC will incur at least 1% fee and get no rewards  so can only top-up with PayNow to get their better rates.Still better to link card and get smacked with 2% spread but earn rewards to cover the spread and come out net positive.,btohqsg

I was just relooking at the TNCs of Plunging Chicken (attached below) and I think it doesn't really make sense for 1.6(iii).It means ALL YOUR UOB ACCOUNTS must have had NO ACTIVITY from 1st June to 30th June if you want to take part in the 1st July promo.So if you already have a salary credit for your UOB One account  BY RIGHT  it will also be caught by 1.6(iii). For example  your salary is $10 000 on 10th June  and you immediately transfer out the money (to maintain $1k MAB for example). Isn't that $10 000 considered as withdrawn from existing UOB account?Kind of ridiculous. It should be impossible for anyone to have ZERO ACTIVITY on all their UOB accounts from 1st June 2024 till 1st July 2024.1.6 “Incremental Fresh Funds” means funds in the amount of S$20 000  S$50 000  S$100 000 or S$150 000:(i) in the form of non-UOB cheques or non-UOB cashier’s order;(ii) that are not transferred from any existing UOB current/savings account; and(iii) that are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account 30 days before or during the Promotion Period and re-deposited (whether part or all the amounts withdrawn) into the Account indicated in the Registration (as defined below).,btohqsg
TLDR: I feel they would most likely NOT / UNABLE to enforce those who withdrew funds on 1st June morning (those we were worried about) since they would likely belong in the same category as those who have inward salary credit for example on 10th June.Disclaimer: This is just my own interpretation which may or may not be correct. For myself  I would only be using one of my humans (who had $1k MAB all along  BUT will have salary credit within June 2024) to take part in the new round of Plunging Chicken). I will NOT be using the human who withdrew $150 000 on 1st June as I don't want to lock up 2 humans for 4.5 months.Mitigation: In the event I am wrong  and the human I took part in July's Plunging Chicken does not get earmarked properly in August (registration month July)  I will just abandon the promo and take it as I earned 4% p.a. only,btohqsg
Uob one account itself also has a monthly average balance tracker (can only see after month ends) which is very useful for the earmark promo. Make sure you maintain the earmark amount + this mab amount + $10 buffer at all times throughout the promo.,btohqsg

What if The spending period has alr ended?,btohqsg
The old t&c states the same  just didn't include 30 days before promotion period.Technically just think of fresh funds as registered funds (150k) + salary crediting amount (which is 1.6k  for those who self-transfer).,btohqsg
Get 3.33% with Maybank Platinum Visa + CardUp also better.,btohqsg
yeah i think we over think it la...i think the SPIRIT is they don't want the big funds that are already inside UOB One account to be withdrawn and immediately put back in...,btohqsg
yes if follow the TNC strictly.. but i think very hard to enforce / program the system.,btohqsg
I mean if cannot earmark then find somewhere else lo. They prefer 1 day missing the big funds or all the way missing the big funds hahah,btohqsg
Not difficult ba. They just use all withdrawn amounts from all accounts for the last 30 days can already.,btohqsg

If follow the latest promo  you need to withdraw 20 days ago already.,btohqsg
Still better to use Amaze + CRMC at that rate. Trust card 0.22% only  compared to 0.27% after accounting for 2% spread.,btohqsg
No one say it's bad  just that people need to know the risk of using such apps. YouTubers are paid to advertise for these products.YouTubers also say FTX is good  but we all know what came after. 🥴,btohqsg
I would still use CRMC x Amaze combo strictly for miles redemption instead of cashback  be it local or overseas spend. I can't stand leaving lost value at the table,btohqsg
Yup. Cashback probably better off using GXS and it's lucky draw. If need ATM withdrawal then YouTrip.,btohqsg

There were suspected cases merchants “work” with customers to do many SoCash transactions so that both sides benefitted. So what you see is these merchants have very high usage of SoCash transactions being done with a usual group of people. After a while  SoCash detected these cases and blocked the merchants from offering SoCash. In the early days  the rewards from SoCash were quite generous.,btohqsg
"True. Actually the ""cashback"" for withdrawing cash quite good. I remembered when I used it in the earlier days.",btohqsg
Hi all  I had been trying to search history on UOB privi and agoda 6 miles benefit but couldn't find anythingI recently sign up the card  make a purchase via agoda app. But the UNI$ did not reflect the 6 mpd.E.g. I spend $190. By right I should get 1140 miles  equivalent of UNI$570. However I only get UNI$228. Anyone know why?,btohqsg
U need to use separate agoda UOB prvi pge to get that 6mpd. And that page price is usually more expensive,btohqsg

Has anyone done the comparison after the recent changes in the interest rates,btohqsg
How/where can I do the exact comparison,btohqsg
I think the top up function is not stable. After few tries just now  it is working now. Thanks for the reply. 👍,btohqsg

Just curious  what is deemed an acceptable cost per mile?,btohqsg
Really should ask yourself  individual valuation differ from person to person,btohqsg
Go to ur fav airlines and search for flights to your fav destinations during your fav time of the year. Compare how many miles required and how much it would cost in cash. Calculate cost per mile then add some of ur own buffer.,btohqsg
Cost of aquiring mile should be as low as possible  below 1.5 cents per mile. Eg. paying $197 annual fee for 10000 miles  1.97 cpm would be on the high side.,btohqsg

Hello  with the EVOL nerf  just want to get some advice. I have UOB one account so need to clock S$500 every month. My frequent/significant spends are on Food/Dining including GrabFood  Transport including MRT/GrabRides/TADA  Telco etc are > $500 but less than $1 000 on cards  because I pay allowance to family instead. Other spends are on insurance  utilities and taxes. I travel at least once a year  don’t need to be on business class.Current credit cards:1) UOB Solitaire (got it by luck as I didn’t meet the income requirement) 2) UOB PPV3) UOB EVOL4) Citibank SMRT cardPlans:1) Cancel EVOL  apply and maximise UOB One Card ($500) for interest. Charge Grab transactions & SP bills here.2) When $500 minimum spend is met  additional expenses to use UOB Solitaire  especially if the spends are of the chosen bonus categories (Transport + Dining) or (Transport + Travel if travelling).2) Cancel PPV since UOB One & UOB Solitaire covers most expenses and PPV do not count towards UOB One Account (but PPV covers more scope?)4) Cancel Citibank SMRT card to wait for 1 year before applying CitiPremier to use Cardup5) In the intervening period of 1 year  apply UOB PRVI to use Cardup,btohqsg
Boss Chris  in your latest video on OCBC card for the 365 card  you mentioned that 365 get 3% cashback for all pharmacies. But actly there was a sneaky nerf on April 1 where it was restricted to just Watson.https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-governing-365-cc-cashback-programme-1april24.pdfFreaking strange restriction to just 1 store  instead of a whole MCC. But it is what it is  OCBC has a hardon for Watsons 😃,btohqsg
Imo  no harm in keeping ppv when you need backup. You can split expense after 500 between lady sol and ppv. Citi premier is not that good for cardup though. Prvi visa is a much better card for that.,btohqsg
Thanks for clarifying. I missed it,btohqsg
Np boss :)  quite characteristic of OCBC to confuse  they left the old T&C and new T&C (post 1 April) together on the main webpage 🥴Annoyed that the McDonald’s card reader is still laced with OCBC 365 6% off when 5814 was nerfed by OCBC long ago too,btohqsg
Ocbx easy to waiver if can't meet the 10k min spend? If can't waiver just cancel?,btohqsg
Just cancel if cant waive and wait 1 year for ntb,btohqsg
Why not GrabFood  Grab rides  public transport charge to UOB One card for additional cashback then UOB Lady's Solitaire card put Dining and Travel?Maybe focus Grab rides and public transport to UOB One card so that you can charge GrabFood to UOB Lady's Solitaire card?Do factor in the additional cashback portion for UOB One card.,btohqsg
It's a good time to try it. You can get referral at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony for the tip! Could you share more on why PRVI visa is better for cardup? It has higher annual fee and does not give miles if you pay it  round down in the calculations of miles etc,btohqsg
Good point Melvyn  thank you for sharing!,btohqsg
Is it possible to cancel citibank card via online or must call in?,btohqsg
1.4mpd vs 1.2mpd for citi pmvisa usually has slightly better promo rates on cardup  works with uob prvi visa.if they don't waive your AF just cancel the card  as long as you have one UNI$-earning card the points are pooled and retainedif you're using it for cardup i don't think the $5 rounding will affect you much if at all,btohqsg
If I have an insurance premium worth 3k  can I use 2 transactions of cardup for the premium fee?,btohqsg
Hi experts  i just signed up cardup. Can i pay one time the first income tax bill using the referral code of $30? Then subsequently i schedule next mth payment using the 1.75% visa promo code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Yes  remember to use the promo codes herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/209091,btohqsg
Most likely because you can go to Unity to top up NTUC gift card/Guardian to buy DFI voucher,btohqsg
Even so 3% is a pretty bad rate  SC Spree give 2% with no min spend and very high cap,btohqsg
My view on OCBC 365 is that any categories not 5% or 6% cashback is not worth looking at. So it's a pseudo specialised spend card. Those 3% categories are more to hit the min spend requirements (especially utitlities),btohqsg
Hello! Are there similar alternatives to HSBC revo? Am thinking to change but I’ve already accumulated quite some points in HSBC.. and also worried that if I apply for another card they will nerf it too lols,btohqsg
Just to that last part...Can't avoid that. And no one has a crystal ball to predict when it might happen.As a general rule of thumb  you could find out when the last nerf for said card was  and if it was recent  can probably assume it won't be nerfed for a while.Ironically  that logic would have worked terribly for HSBC revo this year 😂,btohqsg

I have malaysia card that can earn about 4 mile/dollar due to oversea spend. Directly using it in cardup charge 3.3% for rental.

So thinking whether can use amaze on cardup so that can further reduce the charge ( 1%+1.79%  provided amaze can be used on cardup and no additional charge),btohqsg
Understand previously some users cant add lady to krispay.It works fine for me on tues but not today.Did i miss out anything?,btohqsg
Why comparing to bank rates? You should use MasterCard or Visa card rates depending on your card. And also against Amaze's 2% spread + MasterCard rates.,btohqsg

Amaze also cap instarem points rewards at total 1k spend  regardless local or overseas spend. But this shouldn't stop you from using Amaze.,btohqsg
has anyone bought endowment plan called maxgrowth enhanced from GE?,btohqsg
Happens. Use backup card like YouTrip or cash.,btohqsg
You can search the chat for general sentiments for ILPs and endowments.,btohqsg
Likely transport. But you should verify the MCC with empty amaze wallet.,btohqsg
What kind of transaction got rejected? I have been using without issue for regular retail spending,btohqsg
Welcome. Depends on how much savings you have and if you can hit the other criterias. You can check out Chris' videos on both accounts.,btohqsg
too late as i have gotten it 8 years ago haha. just wondering if anyone else got shortchanged as my projected maturity value dropped significantly in this year's bonus statement. wanted to see if anyone took any action,btohqsg
hello there! Thank you for the reply:)  if i have just about 10k savings  both seems to be relatively similar right?,btohqsg
As long as it's not perpetual premium paying it shouldn't be too bad I guess.,btohqsg
new projected is 1% simple interest for 10 years. literally put into savings account also better,btohqsg
that is if it doesnt get reduced again in the next 2 years,btohqsg
Assuming it's gonna be your primary bank account (will have active transactions) and you can meet $500 eligible spend on your eligible card  then you might want to see OCBC 360 account with their account opening promo. EIR 5.25% p.a for first 2 months  eventually dropping to 2.65% from the 3rd month onwards.If you are not able to be approved for their eligible card because of no prior income  it will become EIR 4.05% p.a. for the first 2 months.You are also be eligible for the 1.2% p.a. under Save criteria for the 1st month since your MAB is likely to be $500 more than $0. But subsequently you will need to keep your MAB $500 more than the previous month for that 1.2%.,btohqsg
Sad sad. Treat it as death coverage that increases with bonus 🥲,btohqsg
yes maturing in 2 years. saw from seedly that GE removed the terminal bonus portion thats why theres a drop. total returns drop more than half from 2%+ to 1%,btohqsg
My tots. You need to balance between how much you have lost and you much you can able to make it if you put in other money instruments like t-bills  stocks etc. Give yourself a target timeline to recover the losses and if you think you can achieve it  then jump for it. It is yourself you need to convince. Anyway  not just for GE products  I lost much putting money into Prudential ILP.,btohqsg
Food(5812) contactless  it doesn't work when linked to uob lady's  but works when linked to crmc.,btohqsg
no la die die must hold till maturity which is 2 more years. surrender even one day earlier is super bohua. just take it as a super low returns  no losses involved,btohqsg
There were some problems reported for uob+amaze since 2 days ago.,btohqsg
Like utilities and phone recurring bills.. I see  seems like infinity card won’t work for me then. I’m tryin to minimize spend on the cashback cards since I’m accumulating miles. 365 might be a better choice then,btohqsg
can use ocbc 90°N for telco bill if u going for miles,btohqsg
That’s a good idea  I will keep it in consideration. I should be sticking to HSBC and Citibank for miles atm to prevent orphan miles  will considering switching to UOB/OCBC since HSBC revo is practically useless now,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know if for sign up gifts for singsaver for the Citi rewards card  does transactions on Amaze + Citi count as the qualifying spend of $500?Looks like yes right?Thank you 😀,btohqsg
amaze linked card transactions are ok as long as non excluded MCC,btohqsg
Why not crmc paired with amaze?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if which credit card is the best for annual insurance payment and can be converted into 12 mths installment without processing fee and interest?,btohqsg
Is there a minimum spend required for SC simply cash cc annual fee waiver? Doesn’t state that you can waive annual fee so I’m wondering if anyone tried before. ☺️,btohqsg
Is there any month where Krisflyer doesn’t have spontaneous escapes? Seems likes it’s not out yet for July,btohqsg
u can try calling in to customer support officer  if u use the card consistently they should waive for u,btohqsg
July dont have for this year.,btohqsg
he want to clock spending for ocbc360,btohqsg
easily waivable  if they dun waive just cancel card,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to ask if shopback got rewards for dbs wwmc ?,btohqsg
Yes for the last part  once opened account  your MAB will be considered as zero,btohqsg
Thank you for the add on as well,btohqsg
For reference  my account was opened on 4th Feb with initial deposit of 1k  but I still got my save bonus in March. So i guess they still count the increase in mab for the month of account opening rather than the next month.,btohqsg
Hmmm sifuHaving a hard time to find the proper answer for using uob signature on uob merchant.. I know plat visa dun get any uni. Seems like signature can get. Anyone know or try! Thanks,btohqsg
get 3.6mpd if met min 1k local spend,btohqsg
Oh.. okok I can’t find in the T&C… mostly say dun have ..😀,btohqsg
Thanks .🙏 meaning 1k min to hit 4m per $ but if some is use in uob merchant will have 3.6,btohqsg
hi guys  which credit card would you use for airtix purchase (around 5k)?,btohqsg
Anyone tried hsbc sg giro ? Is it down now? Keep on getting pc7 error,btohqsg
Has anyone tried out if telco recurring bill payment via the Amaze card linked to CRMC gets the 4mpd? Or it has to be a manual payment each month through the CRMC card?,btohqsg
I tried recurring with Amaze + CRMC for Giga but did not the get 4mpd,btohqsg
It was a mistake. Input the wrong card number. Has changed it to direct for this month. 🤣,btohqsg
Filled up the form to update and within one hour all done. Really impress by the efficiency,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I check with you the following transactions are deemed eligible to be qualified for the 1% hsbc cashback on the GIRO bill payments?1) income tax payment to IRAS2) property tax payment to IRAS3) insurance payment to Great Eastern4) credit card of ocbc5) housing loans of ocbc,btohqsg
may i check for N90 paired with Amaze  purchased made in MYR  does it count as Local 1.3mpd  or Overseas 2.1mpd. TIA,btohqsg
5(b) Cashback on GIRO Bill PaymentsEligible Customers shall receive a cashback of 1% of the payment amount for any GIRO billpayments in SGD made via an Eligible Account during the relevant Spend Period (as definedbelow) excluding:(i) Self-initiated GIRO bill payments from HSBC online/mobile banking(ii) GIRO bill payments to any HSBC Credit Cards(iii) Top-ups  money transfers or purchase of credits of prepaid cards  stored-value cardsor e-wallets (including but not limited to EZ-Link  Transitink  NETS Flashpay andYoutrip);(iv) Payments made to financial institutions  securities brokerages or dealers (includingbut not limited to the trading of securities  investments or crypto-currencies of anykind);(v) Such other categories of transactions which HSBC may exclude from time to timeFrom tnc of hsbc ega  which part of 5b is the giro payment to ocbc credit card under? It would be so beneficial to me to earn extra on top of the ocbc spending bonuses,btohqsg
This is exclusion. Not excluded so you will get 1% cashback.,btohqsg
Omg.. my bad.. i misread.. *embarassed* 😳,btohqsg
I am new to this hsbc ega. Still learning how to optimise it. Thank you so much gurus for guidance👍👍May i ask do u guys use it to pay all GIROs and earn the 1%. (So far i am paying giros from ocbc and earning nothing) is this the best way?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check for nets top up  is it eligible for miles via amaze+crmc?,btohqsg
Its the best for now. 1% better than nothing. Ppl pay tax with hsbc ega too.,btohqsg
For those with DBS multiplier accounts  how do you guys hit the 4.1% return?,btohqsg
I've directed all giro arrangements to hsbc because of this 1%. Lol. Got free money why not? Enjoy while it lasts!,btohqsg
Yes. Mine matured this month and it was much lower than projected,btohqsg
I tried to find this on my trust bank app but couldn't so far. Anyone know what's the criteria for the selected customers ?,btohqsg
did you raise it up to GE? or just suck thumb accept,btohqsg
What matured this month? Was it Endowment?,btohqsg
I don't know what I can do...,btohqsg
do you mind sharing (you can amend the numbers but please don't amend the proportions)Total number of years?Premium Amount (monthly/annually)Projected Maturity Value (when agent first sold you)Actual Maturity Value credited in your bank accountThanks!,btohqsg
i just googled this at Seedly.,btohqsg
Understood hsbc pays optimum interest for $365k. Mind if i ask how does one do such a large sum transfer on Day 1 for the rotation method to human 2's hsbc acct. Online limit js cappes at 200-250k? Have to do over 2 days?,btohqsg
put in lump sum of 38k(GE gave a 2k discount for upfront payment) in dec 2016 for 10 years  projected supposed to be 49786. so starting value should be counted as 40kbase on latest bonus statement  projected has become 44321. thats if it doesnt drop anymorethis is for me  getting money back in dec 2026 only,btohqsg
yes.. can split over 2 or more days for amounts bigger than $200-250k,btohqsg
However  do note that 4.6% p.a. is only capped to $360k MAB.If you have more than $360k MAB  suggest get access to another 2 x HSBC EGA,btohqsg
ah but this one still cannot 'complain' since haven't matured yet  they will say wait until really get the money back then say,btohqsg
yea i assumed so as well. just hope it stops dropping more,btohqsg
yeah if you complain the official response would be market conditions have been bad over the last 10 years.. blah blah blah generic nonsense..sure the interest rate in the last 10 years have been close to 0 due to Fed action.. but too bad right.. cannot be insurer make money give you small share.. insurance don't make money give you even smaller shareit is win/win for the insurer no matter what. Customer is the one bearing the risk.Might as well invest yourself.,btohqsg
played it too safe when i was younger. anyhow throw this money into decent shares im sure see at least 30% returns. at least,btohqsg
Go read the thick policy  they did say is projected and cannot guarantee the returns. Sometimes there's a guaranteed returns in 1 of the table.Based on my own GE policies  so far I got around half of what is projected.,btohqsg
For insurance premiums that are scheduled in full  can I send two cardup transaction to complete that 1 full scheduled premium fee?For eg  PRU bill me 2400. Can I use two cardup txn 1000 and 1400,btohqsg
Hi guys  what cards would u recommend for miles for booking a trip from a travel agency? Looking to spend about 10k total for 4 pax,btohqsg
UOB solitaire. Best if u can split payment,btohqsg
Is there any card besides solitaire ?,btohqsg
You can use general spending cards such as Vantage/Uob prvi,btohqsg
Ah okay so u suggest 2k on UOB solitaire then the remaining 8k on vantage if i dont have the option to spilt payments right,btohqsg
How long it took for all your Giro Arrangements to go through to hsbc?,btohqsg
Technically can. Just don't arrange too far from premium payment date.,btohqsg
3 working weeks from GIRO application date,btohqsg
Can't rmb... 4 to 8 weeks?,btohqsg
Wah they nerf Revolution gaogao and come with stunt bring in this to take over EVOL spot,btohqsg
Suddenly all the Revo nerfs made sense. Revo is just a stepchild of HSBC. Liveplus is the new bae in town.,btohqsg
Revo had its time in the sun... Now time to give way to new card,btohqsg
But no extra 1% cash back for giro credit card payment..,btohqsg
Must fulfill whitelist plus 600 per month for 1 quarter. Like uob one plus hsbc revo combine. Quite a narrow whitelist  prefer maybank fnf more,btohqsg

600 minimum spend per month for 3 months 🤔,btohqsg
It's one of the lower spend req already. Evol  365  live fresh all need 800.,btohqsg
I read is like 500?Charge a minimum of SGD500 in Qualifying Transactions from Card Account Opening Date to the end of the following month.Read through the T&C. They exclude the qualifying spend for cardup and ipaymy.,btohqsg
What is the real cashback rates?,btohqsg
Monthly $450/500 (can't remember now)  paid for 5 years  maturity at 10 years. Projected maturity $61k  get $55 385.,btohqsg
seems to be by whitelist MCC  based on the tnc. This is for the HSBC LIVE+ CC,btohqsg
Tot have some cap earlier. But seem like the limitation is whitelist,btohqsg
"""Those fixed dated maturity plans have a terminal bonus which is based on projection. Dependent on the previous year’s performance  as such this gets affected "" this is OCBC RM reply. I.bought through bank.",btohqsg
cashback cap at 250 per quarter,btohqsg
Ya got 250 cap for cashback  which is 3125 a quarter at 8% or 5k a quarter at 5%. Way above monthly 600 spend.,btohqsg
Whitelist mcc very little and must hit consistently for 3 month,btohqsg
i think its the standard eating and shopping mcc looks decent,btohqsg
So can spent like $600  $600  $2000,btohqsg
Seems decent  here’s my thoughts.Pros:- relatively high 8% cashback (due to +3% promo) for dining/shopping/entertainment  decent 5% for petrol- no cashback cap by category- high cashback cap of $250 by calendar quarter- follows calendar quarter so less confusing (ahem UOB One)- Dining includes bakeries (rare for dining cashback cards which typically only cover 5811  5812  5814)Cons:- shopping MCC not that wide encompassing (e.g. missing 5399 which is a common MCC for e-commence platforms like Qoo10)- need to fulfil min spend of $600 for all 3 months within a quarter (similar to UOB One). Miss any month within the quarter and u’ll only get 0.3% cashback. Exception given for 1st quarter (min spend of $1000 within the quarter instead of monthly min spend).- cashback credited as late as 2 months after end of quarter- may revert back to 5% after 31 Dec 2024,btohqsg
The cashback 2months after quarter is annoying if you want to cancel the card. Need to make sure u get ur cashback first  use it up (take another month) before cancel.,btohqsg
Yup  that’s a risk. Timing can be tricky.,btohqsg
Oh well let see user datapoint after they get the card and use for 1 quarter to see their feedback on the usefulness,btohqsg
5311 is ok. Problem is that ecommerce platform can use a range of mcc,btohqsg
5732 (apple/istudio) is not included. Cannot use to buy iphone 16. 🙃,btohqsg
no not really   shopee and lazada don't think so. But may be hit or miss depending on range of MCC,btohqsg
Ya that why haha  must go brick and mortar,btohqsg
This card has no annual fee right? Can't see anywhere.,btohqsg
but brick and mortar expensive compared to laz and shopeee,btohqsg
Link the card to heymax. Buy and check mcc. if not 5311  cancel 🤣,btohqsg
Annual feeWe'll waive your annual fee for the first year  starting from the issue date for your credit card. From the second year onwards  we'll waive the annual fee for your card if you spend more than SGD12 500 with it per year.,btohqsg
should have  if not why will they say first year fee waiver,btohqsg
How long for the new giro arrangement to be effective? Need to fill up form thus subsequent month? Or can most institutions able to do online? Thks.,btohqsg
"Hey guys for the OCBC 360  do you think the criteria of ""Increasing average daily balance by 500"" is feasible? Just wondering as if your salary is uusally credited to you end of the month  wouldnt it make it quite difficult to achieve that criteria?",btohqsg
deposit 500 to 530 on first day of each month then keep the amount constant,btohqsg
does this mean i need prep transfer out 500 every end of the month to prep for next month i/r?,btohqsg
Crmc direct recurring with giga can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
average balance must increase by 500 each month. excess transfer out. deficit transfer in,btohqsg
isit wise to use it as your main savings bank then? it seems quite troublesome,btohqsg
yea its abit of work to optimise the interest,btohqsg
would you recommend just using uob then? 3% only but much lesser work,btohqsg
If you are lazy  just deposit salary and leave it there. At most you lose your first month Save interest.,btohqsg
the extra 0.8% does return quite a big as your salary accumulates as well? So probably worth the additional effort,btohqsg
uob one is fine as well. simpler. just clock 500 spend on an eligible card,btohqsg
thats true! UOB one was the clearer winnner last time due to the interest rate  but the recent changes made it slightly inferior in terms of interest rate,btohqsg
soon every bank will follow suit. market expects interest cuts. the differences are marginal. this time A might be winner. next time it might be B,btohqsg
makes sense  i guess just got to see whats suitable for me now,btohqsg
thank you so much for the advice!,btohqsg
@WhereAreTheBestBananas@mlim321I went to take a look at my last 3 giro applications (all credit cards) for HSBC EGA. Scb took less than 1 week surprisingly  maybank 2 weeks  cimb slightly less than 3 wks.,btohqsg
Hi  want to ask if anyone ran into the same problem trying to pay taxes with CardUp,btohqsg
If hsbc savings account gives bonus interest for credit card spending  I will be more willing to ditch uob and start using hsbc new card... But for now I think I will stick with uob one cos I still buy quite a lot from shopee.,btohqsg
my husband got double charged  the designated credit card was deducted (tax plus service charge on Cardup's end)  and his GIRO also got deducted(the original tax amt),btohqsg
despite the interest rate drop  i feel like uob is still one of the more reputable banks thats why i was leaning towards uob one as well,btohqsg
we wrote several times to CardUp after trying to call but never end up getting anyone to answer,btohqsg
Iras will refund if duplicate payment for one shot  if is 12 month installment will offset next month payment i think,btohqsg
when he pay? his NOA issued?,btohqsg
When did he put the charge on? Still got next month's charge which will be reconciled by IRAS.,btohqsg
and now they are ignoring us  the last reply was 7 days ago,btohqsg
on 6th June 2024 he was charged to both his card and GIRO,btohqsg
Card up is just a payment processing third party  u should contact iras instead,btohqsg
problem not on their side mah,btohqsg
need to pay at least 1 week before,btohqsg
Should not put on 6th. 6th is for GIRO deduction. If y'all followed the instructions provided by CardUp  they have informed to charge on the 12th for the following month.,btohqsg
I see  I will check with my husband again later tonight  thanks for the info!,btohqsg

Same. I also see somewhere is 500. In their website,btohqsg
500 SGD is to qualify for the welcome rewards offer. $600 SGD is the monthly spend requirement,btohqsg
it seem like unable to link UOB ladys to amaze anymore,btohqsg
https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/liveplus/wonder how is thid new card to replace hscb revo and evol,btohqsg
wow 600 then its same as evol,btohqsg
and EVOL is soon to be $800 spend tier,btohqsg
If we link UOB lady's card to amaze  the best way to use it is just for overseas spending?,btohqsg
Also to bypass the UOB$ merchants?,btohqsg
can't seem to link the card to amaze now,btohqsg
Assuming ur lady cat is dining  yes,btohqsg
bro chris think tjhis new hsbc live still shortchanged i suppose not able to replace plus 600 neeed o spend rather use  uob one and another one,btohqsg
UOB cards having some problems now  give them a while to fix it.,btohqsg
Ok I managed to successfully use amaze + Uob krisflyer cc yesterday and today.,btohqsg
Oh I dont have one now but I'm wondering what's the best way to utilize since I saw the discussion of lady's card + amaze,btohqsg
For UOB lady  only 0.4mpd was affected by UOB merchants. I just use lady as is without amaze. Better that way. Get cashback and 3.6mpd too.,btohqsg
Yes. That’s the main reason to link to amaze,btohqsg
was originally wanted to linked to amaze as I'm buying air ticket in foreign currency,btohqsg
it's okay. it's for biz trip. can claim.. haha,btohqsg
Then wouldn't it be better just use lady naked? You get higher amount (more miles) and company will reimburse.,btohqsg
Then yes. Can claim always do naked and get the foreign spend rate,btohqsg
Ohhh okay makes sense to do this,btohqsg
so on amaze  will not get the full 4mpd?,btohqsg
This is about uob merchant. Some ppl use amaze + UOB card to avoid UOB merchants mechanics.,btohqsg
Amaze will get 4mpd but consume amaze $1k free limit,btohqsg
lol don’t.Get uob$ + 3.6/5.6mpd better!,btohqsg
what does UOB merchants mechanics meant? sorry. i'm an amateur on this.,btohqsg
Ofc. Disclaimer: better to use UOB lady with the right cat for uob merchant.,btohqsg
When you use a UOB card on a UOB$ merchant  it will give you UOB$ cashback instead of UNI$The UOB$ cashback is lackluster for some of the merchants and also you only get the cashback on your next visit like favepay hence why people would ask to avoid using them or use the amaze if possible with Mastercard version if your purpose is to get miles instead of the cashbackFor exampleBreadTalk give 3% back instead and you will forgo 4mpd if using PPVBut if you have UOB ladies and VS it a different story where only base point 0.4 mile is convert to UOB$ but the bonus point is still given,btohqsg
Certain cards u only lose the base miles at uob$ merchant,btohqsg
Yeah was about to add that part in,btohqsg

Hey guys  how's the experience using FlyAnywhere in Heymax?,btohqsg
I tried Living in Malaysia without Cash (as a foreigner)https://youtu.be/88wU3ADSUEQ,btohqsg
Which ewallet app for m'sia more friendly  Grab or tng?,btohqsg
Around the same  TnG works more like Alipay for Malaysia  Grab is more integrated for Food and transport and one less app to download on phone.,btohqsg
One good thing about TnG is can transfer unused balance topped up from debit card,btohqsg
but TnG ewallet has top-up fees from credit cards,btohqsg
with the ewallet providers continuing to waive the MDR fees  cashless probably has better penetration there than in sg,btohqsg
did you have to sign up for another grab account to use the ewallet function? i recall if you've ever gotten the GPMC in SG  your grabpay would basically be locked in to SGD and unable to transact in MYR,btohqsg
How did he even choose 6th? Cardup block the dates,btohqsg
Can Amaze + CRMC be used for iPhone in-app purchases?,btohqsg
Didnt need to  but i unlocked it quite a while ago during the early stage. things may be different now,btohqsg
why not just use your CRMC directly? it's not an apple pay purchasee: i presume your in-app purchases are purchases in mobile games or similar,btohqsg
Probably to prevent the odd treatment of apple pay / google pay by Citi,btohqsg
i.e. Kris+ isn't recognized as online if using CRMC directly,btohqsg
need to differentiate if it's an apple pay purchase  or app store purchase. app store purchases are fine,btohqsg
should be app store purchase since anyway amaze cannot be put into apple pay,btohqsg
You can actually.  But for Apple Pay app-related purchases. Not sure how Apple/Google differentiates cause theoretically app store purchase goes through Apple Pay,btohqsg
you can add amaze to apple pay?,btohqsg
I do. (And use it to pay for my Apple Music),btohqsg
sir that's not apple pay  that's apple ID payment 😁,btohqsg
Settings > Profile > Payment & Shipping > Add from there,btohqsg
the differentiator is basically  does the card go into your apple wallet?,btohqsg
But that said  in app purchases would go through apple ID payment what 😅,btohqsg
Not sure how Citi sees this so... good luck 😜,btohqsg
yup this is the gray area...because IAP can use your Apple ID CC directly...or go thru Apple Pay,btohqsg
we wouldn't be discussing this confusing thing if CRMC didn't have that strange mobile wallet exclusion 🤪,btohqsg
https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/liveplus/HSBC has a new cashback card to offer,btohqsg
Yeah we discussing more of direct citi hahaha,btohqsg
bobian lo  but then again they are literally the only option to accept amaze as a blanket online solution so... live with it 😂,btohqsg
Think of it like a quirk of your partner. Deal with it and move on 😂,btohqsg
Doesnt matter actually. If your salary is credited on the last day of the month  you'll clock the $500 increase in MAB next month.,btohqsg
Note that they use monthly average balance  so you cannot just top-up $500 on 1st July  then spend $500 on 2nd July.,btohqsg
oh really? wouldn’t it be calculated in that current month instead of the next?,btohqsg
If say ur current month 30k  end of the month ur salary come in and have 32k  ur average balance for the month is still 30k only  one day extra abit wont change ur monthly average by muchThen the following monthBalance of prev month = 30kCurrent balance = 32kAlready 2k increaseIs not based on ending balance of prev month  is 500 extra over the average of previous month,btohqsg
Month 1:- Balance $5000- Salary in on 31st $1000- MAB = ($5000×30 + $6000)/31=$5032Month 2:- Balance $6000- Salary in on 31st $1000- MAB = ($6000×30 + $7000)/31=$6032Your MAB from Month1 to Month2 has increased  even if salary is credited at the end of the month.,btohqsg
this is better than UOB one?,btohqsg

Hi  I am new to ocbc  don’t have an account yet. Planning to open an 360 account on the 1st July. But a bit confused:1. I would like to get the sign up deals for the 365 credit card  do I open a 360 account first and then apply through the link/singsaver? Or just apply first  by the time the card approve then just nice start of the month. First time applying a CC through third party here.2. To get the EIR of 4.65%(+ add 2% promo)  must I open the account on the 1st July and put in the 100k on the day itself? What if I open on 15th July  is the amount prorated or just maintain the MAB of 100k will do?3. In order to get HR to credit salary into account they need to have our statement with name & account number  but the account statement only will receive the following month. How do we approach the bank to get this statement?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
suggest u make the change in case u exceed 1k domestic spend. After which will incur 1% or min $0.50 fee per transaction,btohqsg
1. Application for credit card usually take longer than account opening and there’s no guarantee that you will be approved. So application for cc should come first imo2. If your amount is only transferred in on 15th  your MAB won’t be 100K.3. If you open an account offline  they will give you a paper with your name and account number if I rmb correctly. Not sure if your HR can accept this. Otherwise you can do a transfer from another bank to count as salary,btohqsg
Did anyone tried balance transfer in Ocbc credit card ? How much is the interest ?,btohqsg
FD is capital guaranteed. Sfye cash plus is an investment and therefore not capital guaranteed.,btohqsg
I used to think so until I sawThis table. Got a few types. One is really guaranteed like fixed D.,btohqsg
I referring to the capital being SDIC protected which only banks offer,btohqsg
Probably we just need to agreed on the terminology,btohqsg
People may have different understanding what is capital guaranteed,btohqsg
Do note this also means SSB is not guaranteed given this. (Since in this case the backing is on the SG govt),btohqsg
What I want to point out in terms of protection  they are not in the same level. But I agreed risk of capital loss for syfe cash plus is very remote,btohqsg
Non Capital guaranteed kinda means your “investment” might lose money which is not the case for syfe cash guaranteed lol,btohqsg
Arguable. The fixed deposits are by hsbc from what’s written. Yes there may be no direct SDIC but very unlikely for hsbc deposits to default. U are not taking Syfe credit risk.,btohqsg
If a Company is at risk  the money that placed in bank depositas an investmentwill be formed part of assets of the Company during liquidation process n can be seized to pay off its debt and liabilities first instead of transferring back to the investors.The deposit that placed in bank by the company will notsolelybelongs to the investors. Hence  not insure by SDIC.I have no financial knowledge on this n have zero background. Can somebody who has financial background confirm Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
1) Syfe is not able to use the money stored in HSBC for its own use. I believed even in the situation where it goes bust2) client’s money is protected from syfe creditors even if syfe needs to liquidated assets3) in the event of closure  syfe WILL transfer the money or assets to other FI or return the assets or money to clients. Probably similar to moneyowl,btohqsg
In such case of the investment company collapse  I don’t think the custodian bank will not automatically return the money in the account to the investors even though it is “protected”.,btohqsg
This seems to imply the Hsbc deposits are all pooled together from all the syfe guaranteed investors. So not Individually owned or assigned.So I do believe in a case of syfe running into trouble  it would be joint ownership or division by all similar investors.So if there is fraud involved where the funds are stolen u might not get back in full.However I do not believe it is a case where syfe guaranteed investments would be considered as part of syfe assets.,btohqsg
I would put the risk is minimized whereas investors  you might not suffer the whole loss  but what you recover also may not be in full and there is no definite timeline when you can get back depending on the legal process. So I guess is the difference between SDIC protected and not.,btohqsg
Money invested in syfe are never considered as syfe assets.If you’re talking about fraud  this applies to any banks out there.,btohqsg
Actually sdic hasn’t been tested and proven yet. So…. Haha,btohqsg
At least the framework is there. Similar like a company business continuity plan in crisis  we know there is a plan black and white in place. But for Sfye and other investment house  they tell you your capital is protected but beyond that  we don’t have visibility or how it suppose to work if things goes wrong.,btohqsg
Good discussion. Teaches us never to take things at face value,btohqsg
But do SDIC actually tell you how you will get your money back and when?,btohqsg
They have this statement “Your monies placed with a Scheme member bank under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) and CPF Retirement Sum Scheme (CPFRS) are aggregated and separately insured up to S$100 000.As your insured deposits are covered under the DI Scheme  SDIC will pay you the insured amounts if your bank or finance company fails.” So if Sfye is willing to put down a similar statement saying they will pay investors back up to xxx amt in event the company fails,btohqsg
“ensure the orderly transfer of money and assets to other licensed financial institutions or the return of all money and assets to clients.”Isn’t stating “all” good enough?,btohqsg
Is this statement from Sfye? Anyway  the word “or” means it may or may not happen. Also without words like “they will return” doesn’t reinforce strongly that they will return all money to clients regardless. But language is subject to interpretation especially if not looking at from whole context. I just looking at from one angle.,btohqsg
Of coz it’s a statement from syfe? Where will I pluck this out from lolDid you read the statement before and after the “or”? Either they transfer to another FI and you withdraw or they return the money if they can’t find a FI willing to take over. Same as what moneyowl and ifast did last year.Isn’t “return all” the same as “they will return”,btohqsg
They will transfer to other FI but it never said you can withdraw 100% and when after that. Moneyowl wind down business and not collapse. These are 2 different scenarios. That is benefit of SDIC protection. Regardless of situation or wording we may interpret  we will get our deposits back. Anyway on Sfye site  they stated their investment should not be taken as deposit.,btohqsg
Wow shiok. How come I cannot get/see on my app,btohqsg
Was it? I am in same situation and curious of outcome.,btohqsg
For point 3  does it need to be from a corporate account? Or any bank account? How does it work?,btohqsg

Yes don't have it   also the Krisflyer UOB is only 1.2 until they proof you spend 800 SGD/SIA,btohqsg

I deleted my last msg cuz its not relevant to ur case (buying Lufthansa tix). For UOB KF  you get 3mpd without the wait for transaction on SIA group (SQ  Scoot  Krisshop) and Krispay. Other bonus cats then you get 1.2mpd right away + 1.8mpd (after 800 spend).,btohqsg
But I thought one condition to get 3MPD is to first spend 800 on SIA,btohqsg
no need to qualify 800 spend for SIA group transactions. btw  can your Lufthansa tix be purchased in Expedia? if yes  consider UOB PRVI for 6mpd uncapped.,btohqsg

Hi would like to consult the community  for the Amex Local Activities 50% offer if I purchase overseas attractions on Klook (e.g. london attraction passes) would it still trigger the offer (although technically not local activities)? Prefer not to purchase gift card if possible as my attractions are just nice $60,btohqsg
I think its the same for all bkk atm.,btohqsg
Any recommendation which card for unlimited miles to get.krisflyer uob  citi premiermiles or uob privi visa miles or any others that idk about,btohqsg
Generally everything. As a backup card when my ppv gets maxed out,btohqsg
Id say you can look at uob offerings to avoid orphan miles. Citi premier miles is only good if you want lounge access.,btohqsg
I have citi rewards too thats why im stucked between premiermiles and uob.Krisflyer or privi visa which is more preferred?,btohqsg
I like uob krisflyer better as it offers better value overall (more choices for 3mpd). Prvi visa is only good if you want to use cardup. Btw  have u considered uob lady? It can help with expenses like dining/shopping so you wont hit ur ppv cap often.,btohqsg
Im using uob lady for travel hence i only have privi and krisflyer for comparison. Seems like privi has a minimum spending?,btohqsg
Hi miles experts. For UOB VS… does $2000 UOB local spending via contactless payment qualify for 4MPD? Or local spend is capped at $1000 only? Thank you!,btohqsg
You have 2k for uob vs,btohqsg
points from citi rewards and premiermiles dun pool  so no point consider premiermiles to avoid orphan pointsyour citi rewards is mastercard or visa?,btohqsg
ok then you asking for backup when u used up Amaze+crmc and uob ppv? What u usually spend on?,btohqsg
Yes. Online  general spending and overseas spend (jb etc),btohqsg
get dbs wwmc for online  reserve ppv for offline  use amaze+crmc for overseas and offline  uob lady for travel,btohqsg
Im using amaze+crmc for other stuff thats why im considering privi miles or krisflyer..,btohqsg
would u be able to clock 800 sia related spend annually?,btohqsg
Nah i dont think so. If i were to take SIA it would be to redeem miles for it,btohqsg
then uob kf is not suitable,btohqsg
consider uob visa signature if u clocking min 1k for local contactless,btohqsg
Hmm i wont be able to hit 1k local contactless tho. Any reason why uob privi miles is not recommended?,btohqsg
uob prvi is not good for spend below $20 because of its points rounding  no uni$ at uob$ merchants  and at best only 1.4mpd,btohqsg
any cc suggestion for SG airlines flights (est. S$2k),btohqsg
