Major gas traders seek cash to cover margin calls(Bloomberg) --Major energy traders including Gunvor Group Ltd. and Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. have reduced the size of their trading positions and increased borrowing from lenders to cover large margin calls stemming from the unprecedented surge in European gas prices  according to people familiar with the matter.Commodity trading houses have been expanding their natural gas dealings in recent years  signing long-term contracts to purchase volumes of the fuel  and typically building corresponding short positions in derivatives to hedge potential losses from price swings. As the price of gas in Europe has spiked  the traders have been told to deposit additional funds -- known as margin calls -- with brokers and exchanges to cover part of the value of their positions in gas futures  the people said.Both Gunvor  the biggest independent trader of liquefied natural gas  and Mercuria  a major power and gas trader  asked banks for additional credit to fund margin calls arising from their hedging positions  said the people  who asked not to be named because the information is private.Gunvor received margin calls of about $1 billion in total for its gas and LNG trading positions and has paid that out in the last few months  one of the people said. The company has about $3 billion in readily available liquidity to cover obligations  according to the person.The two trading houses  both headquartered in Geneva  have also reduced their gas-trading positions to help manage the extreme volatility  the people said.Gunvor and Mercuria declined to comment.Vitol Group  the biggest independent oil trader  has also increased borrowing because of margin calls but hasn‚Äôt been forced to reduce its trading positions  the people said. Vitol declined to comment.Trafigura Group  the second-biggest independent oil and metals trader  has increased its credit lines by about $6 billion this year amid rising prices for commodities from copper to LNG  but has not significantly reduced its gas trading positions or increased borrowing in response to recent margin calls  another person said.The margin calls don‚Äôt necessarily reflect losses. Even profitable trading positions would need large amounts of additional capital to cover margin calls as prices have surged. The challenges faced by trading houses show how Europe‚Äôs unprecedented energy crisis is creating difficulties at every step along the supply chain  not just for end consumers.Even Russia  the world‚Äôs largest gas exporter  has been trying to talk down the market  saying the recent frenzy -- in which prices have jumped 60% in two days -- is in nobody‚Äôs interest.Trading houses rely on short-term borrowing facilities from banks to fund their business of buying  storing  transporting and selling raw materials. Their pool of banks has been shrinking in recent years as one-time major lenders including Dutch bank ABN Amro and BNP Paribas of France exit or pull back from the sector following a series of trading scandals  and losses in Singapore.Gunvor also issued a $300 million bond last month  returning to corporate debt markets for the first time since 2013.,btohqsg

Ltd. (‚ÄúGCI‚Äù)  the USD Bonds have been cancelled and there are nooutstanding USD Bonds.‚Ä¢ This has strengthened the Group‚Äôs credit profile and saves up to US$4.8 million in its annual financingcosts. The Group‚Äôs cash position as at 10 October 2021 was US$62.4 million  after fully redeeming theUSD bonds and paying the accrued coupon interest and increased working capital.‚Ä¢ With the Indonesian Coal Index price for 4 200 GAR coal (‚ÄúICI4‚Äù) reaching a record high of US$122.08per tonne as at 8 October 2021  the Group expects its 2H2021 performance to be much stronger than1H2021  with revenue expected to exceed US$700 million or S$1 billion for the year.‚Ä¢ The Group targets production and sales volume of over 1 million tonnes per month from October toDecember 2021  following the approval of increased RKAB production quota of 11.5 million tonnes  inline with its optimised mining plan for a higher production in 4Q2021.‚Ä¢ At today‚Äôs coal prices  the Group has an average cash profit of over US$50 per tonne  even after takinginto account the lower selling prices of its domestic market obligation (DMO) set by the Indonesiangovernment at 25% of total production with a price cap of around US$38 per tonne. This is more thantriple of the Group‚Äôs 1H2021 average cash profit of US$15 per tonne.‚Ä¢ The Group has seen its market capitalisation increase to over S$550 million. This is a total shareholdersreturn (YTD) of 114%  including the final dividend and interim dividends paid during the period. Thisoutperforms the FTSE Straits Times Index (‚ÄúSTI‚Äù)  which has a YTD return of 10.99%.,btohqsg
The full redemption of the USD Bonds will give the Group flexibility to declare and pay higher dividends  asthe bond covenants previously restricted us to do so. We are committed to our dividend policy of at least 30%of net profits attributable to shareholders  subject to capital requirements.,btohqsg

üöÄPika World Update- 14 October 2021üöÄüçéApple: Global Chips ShortageüçèJust as we discussed the long waiting time of the Apple iPhone yesterday  we now receive possible news that Apple is looking to cut its iPhone 13 production for up to 10 million units. The shortage of components had constraint its ability to meet demand on time.The news also affected Apple's suppliers  such as Broadcom and Texas Instruments were impacted. However  Pika World continues to favour the value-play company despite production issues  given an expectation of continued high growth in the service segment of the business.üèÄNike: To buy Now?üèÄAccording to Goldman Sachs  the stocks appears to be a good buy. Since reporting a poor earnings result on 23 September  the stocks had fallen. However  analysts believe that most of the sourcing problems are not permanent and that the company is still likely to fare well compared to its rival  Addidas.Given that Nike does not lag behind the returns of the S&P 500 often  there has been a keen interest that it might outperform in subsequent years. Pika World has not initiated any positions on the counter.‚è∞S&P 500: A test to MeetüíéAs the new earnings season arrives  the equity market is likely to wobble if profit estimates are persistently lowered. For example  between 3 September to 8 October  we have seen a fall of 0.8% in third-quarter profit estimates for the S&P 500.The downward revision may become a reality as companies suffer from higher labour costs and labour shortages to meet their sales forecasts. In addition  higher commodity prices do not help to the weakening earnings outlook too.Pika World continues to see any fall as a good accumulation point as supply chain issue while enduring will hopefully recover with time.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Initial Jobless Claims  which is expected to moderately fell to 319K from 326K in the prior period.The PPI (Mom) for Sept will also arrive. We expect a slight fall to 0.6% from 0.7%. Recall that Pika World sees this as an essential indicator for possible CPI outlook given producers are likely to pass on some costs to consumers to protect ther profit margin better.Various FOMC members are speaking from 10 pm to 1 pm.Crude Oil Inventories is expected to be at 0.14M  a fall from 2.346M at 11 pm.It is 14 October  Thursday  7.15 am in Singapore and 7.15 pm in New York. The stock market has been holding well this week . Pika World wishes all friends a profitable week.,btohqsg
