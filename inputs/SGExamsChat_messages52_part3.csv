Then go back to CB again,btohqsg

U would have to spend a lot,btohqsg

if the uk and the rest of the world inflate their grades  its only sensible moe does the same if not we will lose out internationally,btohqsg
US is alr suffering from grade inflation  but yet SG isnt experiencing such an issue,btohqsg
the uk is inflating the gradrs its on the news m8,btohqsg
Wtf is 'lose out internationally' tbh,btohqsg
That will make their certs worthless tbh,btohqsg
At the end of the day,btohqsg
To the admissions officers  they will know that sg a lvls are on a totally different level from uk a lvls,btohqsg
They are just making their own national exams 'easier' to do well and thus harder for candidature differentiation,btohqsg
How different level are you really though?Note that there's a very broad spectrum of 'A-levels' in UK,btohqsg
aren't they even stricter w intl applicants though,btohqsg
There will still be a difference ba,btohqsg
Not specific to UK. Everyone is stricter with international. Same for NUS,btohqsg
because the point of their universities is to grant admission to mostly uk residents,btohqsg
Ultimately is inevitable the bulk of places are reserved for locals,btohqsg

if cambridge inflates grades  we shd too,btohqsg
Theres no bell curve  jesus lol,btohqsg
Why do still people believe in that,btohqsg
