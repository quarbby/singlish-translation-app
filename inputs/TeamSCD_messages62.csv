Whois coming to orto for chill n drinks tgt,btohqsg
I can share my experience.HKS have approved exhausts for JDM cars. Some cars with diff names in SG  might not have. Like my car is MX-5 while japan is Roadster,btohqsg
They only have approved exhausts for roadster when it's essentially the same car,btohqsg
If your fit/jazz is Kahmotors one  likely is HKS no approved,btohqsg
Paiseh  idk SGDM is Jazz or Fit,btohqsg
The biggest reason is because HKS they did lab test is with their JDM unit. They didnt do on export unit. So LTA wont accept. Even tho it's the same car. Because again  diff name means diff car.,btohqsg
Hahaha. Kah motor one is jazz. PI is fit.,btohqsg
U can still check with them,btohqsg
If Garage R sent local units go for tests,btohqsg
Normally cars like Jazz because there is many units in SG  they might do that,btohqsg
anyone noes or can recommend anywhere in jb which do good engine bay detailing?,btohqsg

I think it’s been quite long already. Doubt they will do it for the jazz.,btohqsg
last time my kia had approved exo 11 years after it came to life,btohqsg
LOL. I think they are weighing the roi. Since gk5 already has tanabe approved  sending it for approval will only mean sharing the pie.,btohqsg
I think generally fit jazz drivers would prefer hks though. Sounds much better.,btohqsg
