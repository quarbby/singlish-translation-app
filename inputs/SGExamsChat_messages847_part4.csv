The instructions to appeal doesnt make sense honestly,btohqsg
Anyone here knows how to do it?,btohqsg
the only way to appeal is to accept the course offer & do it on campus,btohqsg
like during the start of school,btohqsg
And everything is the exact same thing as the original course application,btohqsg
is that some kind of animal trafficking shit,btohqsg
I did not even bother to apply back then,btohqsg
Different programme different type of application,btohqsg
Btw who here applied for DPP (like got ur course already or waiting for appeal results),btohqsg
thats the course u have been posted to,btohqsg
nah  some ppl one come out damn early,btohqsg
Appeal results will be out on 10 Jan 2025 from 9am,btohqsg
just reposted something from r/singapore reddit,btohqsg
actually i think this person was talking about the other guy that sent a nsfw link,btohqsg
there's a chance it will fail,btohqsg
Same to the rest of y'all who appealed,btohqsg
v high chance ( sic. of failing )esp for those who want to study at ite central,btohqsg
u shld also accept whatever course offer u received first,btohqsg
1. local SIM cards2. mental health bill2. Immigration & travel clearances,btohqsg

scoot delayed my flight more than 6 hours,btohqsg
departure frm sg: delayed fr 3 hours. now departure frm seoul: its delayed fr 7 hours,btohqsg
budget airlines can't complain too much ._.,btohqsg
given how many incident happened in this past few days.,btohqsg
But scoot has been quite reliable,btohqsg
Bruh I just remembered the last time I flew was to India 5 years ago,btohqsg
first time taking scoot  last min book so cldnt book sia,btohqsg
Oh then maybe delay is defo expected,btohqsg
i mean it can be reliable schedule wise  but if plane has some parts malfunctioned and required inspection  definitely would be safer to be delayed. lol,btohqsg
Singapore Airliners got rules saying if delay how many hours need to compensate with food/water/hotel things?,btohqsg
Just checked and apparently there isn't,btohqsg
