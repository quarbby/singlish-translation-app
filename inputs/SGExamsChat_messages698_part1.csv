SUNLIGHT ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
My batch got 4? Ppl from sci stream,btohqsg
how does the timetabling com settle timetable which such mix classes,btohqsg
Her a lvl tsd n art paper,btohqsg
i prefer the old system where most classes are fixed subj combination,btohqsg
Dunno she need to settle w her CT sia,btohqsg
But it's literally not her fault,btohqsg
maybe it is a rare combi,btohqsg
wait wait  h2 chem no longer comp ah,btohqsg
S5 also got some ppl take H2 Phys only,btohqsg
wait how to take both P and B,btohqsg
no there are like rules regarding h2 chem and math,btohqsg
P and B tgt only acjc offer iirc,btohqsg
oh H2 chem used to be compulsory in sci stream,btohqsg
seem like they had dropped it,btohqsg
The H2 maths rule isn't even a thing now,btohqsg
ik quite a few bio h1 maths,btohqsg
for mine i dun think any sci class took H1 math,btohqsg
Some of those are the people who want to do bio but failed ip maths,btohqsg
but i heard h1 math can score 100,btohqsg
They don't even have trigo differentiation,btohqsg
the top in h1 math for my batch was 100m,btohqsg
i think the only subject that u can reach 100 lol,btohqsg
Yea so they just do BCm lol,btohqsg
cause like really cannot take h2 maths,btohqsg
but then again h2 math not required for med so like,btohqsg
yea if you sure udw h2 math courses then go ahead,btohqsg
med only need h2 chem and h2 phys/bio,btohqsg
tbh for h1 sci (math included)  it is much much easier than their h2 version,btohqsg
while i heard h1 and h2 geog not that much difference,btohqsg
for med is H2 Chem + H2 Bio/Phy,btohqsg
same goes for econs in terms of content (coz tm use same notes for both h1 and h2 so we h2 peeps know what the h1 dun cover and it aint that big difference),btohqsg
I only know h1 and h2 hist h1 doesnt have sea hist at all,btohqsg
which is why josh kept asking me to take h1 hist,btohqsg
i feel for arts the difference lies more in terms of the format (H2 econs is 1 30m CSQ + 3 25m esay; H1 is 2 CSQs),btohqsg
i remembered at the start of j2  my econs cher came to me and say 'i think u will do better in H1',btohqsg
Cuz right we also try H2 drq,btohqsg
Doesn't feel that diff from h1,btohqsg
it's becoming a dating/relationship advice sub reddit,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
drq is it data response qns,btohqsg
but i dun get why arts subject dun hv prereq unlike sci,btohqsg
haven't heard of that phrase in such a long time,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
how do people who dun take geog / hist in sec sch do them in as,btohqsg
Jump from no geog to H1 geog ok,btohqsg
Jump from no geog to h2 geog kinda insane,btohqsg
Ik someone who did this in my batch tho,btohqsg
