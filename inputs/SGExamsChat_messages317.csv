guys for poly jae appeal if we didnt put the course in the original 12 choices can we still appeal for it,btohqsg
Depends if u meet the cut off anot,btohqsg
but nvr put in first 12,btohqsg
Can appeal but likelihood is lower and my guess (not confirmed) is priority is given to those who had put it as part of their choice.,btohqsg
Usually  unless you have a strong skillset (cca) that the school really wants  it will be tough to appeal.,btohqsg
Now public library got time limit?,btohqsg
Technically can walk in if ur early enough,btohqsg

thanks guys ! also if  I may ask  anyone here has tried for dpp,btohqsg

I've heard if you appeal and succeed  the previous allocation gets cancelled,btohqsg
It depends what course uw go ah,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why  to be honest I wanna do some kind of writing course in poly.. maybe be a scriptwriter  but parents said must do something that is suitable for the job market now ah  im someone who‚Äôs very passion about languages (like malay and literature) but my second interest is social work -//,btohqsg

any thoughts on school counsellors? I am thinking of seeing one in uni as Im feeling quite stressed with sch though i had a bad experience with a school counsellor back in sec sch,btohqsg
My current school counsellor is lit!,btohqsg
i do want to seek help as my uni journey has been quite tough  feeling quite stressed and down lately,btohqsg
i am pretty much an introvert so i dont have a lot of friends to talk to and i kinda like being by myself but that backfires when there are grp assignments and i have to be grped with not so good people,btohqsg
for one of the mods im taking  i joined a grp with 2 girls who are pretty close to each other and they dont really make the effort to talk to me or get to know me,btohqsg
i feel kinda invisible tbh and im kinda dreading going to sch,btohqsg
any advice on what shld i do?,btohqsg
"im not sure how much this will help out but i think this is something u need to speak up to get to know them because nothing can really come to you on a silver platter in every grp projthough  if they're shitty people then i think u j gotta bite through for the sem :"")",btohqsg
if it helps  i think there are tele channels that cater to people finding study buddies in their unis,btohqsg
thats true i did make the effort to speak to them but they just dont really care tbh,btohqsg
"hang in there yeah! im currently in uni dying too HAHAHAHA :"""")",btohqsg
AHAHAH my plan is to just contribute to the grp assignment and after that i'll just pretend i don't know them,btohqsg
hi I'm looking for students who are also posted nyp's accountancy and finance- anyone here?,btohqsg

Anyone knows if poly or jc is suitable for intp/infp,btohqsg
I don't think it really matters.,btohqsg
Mbti can know if you‚Äôre more hands on or theory,btohqsg
i dun judge by mbti. tell me ur good/evil alignment and i can tell u poly or jc more suitable,btohqsg
eg chaotic evil  chaotic good etc,btohqsg
MBTI means nothing. Don't get defined by a series of questions.,btohqsg
You can roughly know how you learn best,btohqsg
I'm a stereotype of my MBTI but it really is a pseudoscience  it doesn't really mean shit.,btohqsg
MBTI depends on how you answer the questions. If you take it twice  you may even get a different result.,btohqsg
"But anyway yeah  y'all are right  it's kind of astrology for people who are ""too good"" for astrology.",btohqsg
Last time I took MBTI  my result was ESTJ.But the I and E  the scores differed by 1 or 2 points I think. It's like somewhere in between.,btohqsg
direct translate not accurate. ask her to do the alignment test.,btohqsg
It was a joke  that's what I meant to say.,btohqsg
"I went to google ESTJ learning style:""ESTJs tend to do well in group discussion and learning situations. They like to think out loud with their peers and discuss facts and ideas in order to understand the concepts better.""I think I generally fare the worst in group discussions.",btohqsg
u claim to be a lawful evil. most lawful evils are just cowards who dont dare to be truly evil. üòÇ,btohqsg
I use the commonly-used interpretation of theDNDalignment chart,btohqsg
Evil just means I rather do things for myself,btohqsg
yes  but u dun dare to break the rules  hence u are a coward,btohqsg
Lawful means I have my own set of morals I follow.,btohqsg
The alignment chart is for a game anyway,btohqsg
Was a prank bro ü•∫ believe me bro was a prank,btohqsg
My irl alignment is non-existant btw  TLE is what I like to use because TheNecessaryEvil was taken,btohqsg
Like how loki variants are different,btohqsg
u cant js make a conclusion about a particular grp of people just by looking at one person of that grp,btohqsg
Come to jc and u will do more personality tests... Ive lost count,btohqsg
Apparently poly students too  my friend keeps posting them on her story lmao,btohqsg
Theyreallywant students to know what their personality type is ig,btohqsg
I got intp and idk wat it even means,btohqsg
Funny story when i got home i saw ants moving from the kitchen to the living room,btohqsg
I used a lighter and created an ant genocide,btohqsg
glad u listened to my idea,btohqsg
I got INTJ  it fits  but apparently only because I'm a walking stereotype?? Idk  what I've been told.,btohqsg
Well i guess if u liked barf u wld like the smell,btohqsg
I didnt take hist so whos stalin lol,btohqsg
Btw anyone knows where should i go to study philosophy,btohqsg
If i had to describe my first time smelling bbq ants it would be like drinking for the first time but you keep going back for more,btohqsg
"Humans ""freeze"" when they get badly burned idk.",btohqsg
Yeah i just find it quite interesting ngl,btohqsg
bruh. obviously i know lah hahaha,btohqsg
Singapore shut down that liberal art subject so uh pray the next one doesnt suck,btohqsg
I mean it looks like they're playing the tag you're it,btohqsg
Philosophy is interesting  happy someone's going for it lol,btohqsg
Yeah i dont think many schools offer it at all,btohqsg
I heard theres a course in nus with philospht  politics and economics together,btohqsg
Just nice i trying to learn russian,btohqsg
My friends say ignore that and aim for the oxbridge ones thou,btohqsg
Cus sg not exactly the shining beacon of philosphy,btohqsg
Most jc's dont really offer philosophy tho,btohqsg
I dont even know whats my mbti lol it keeps fluctuating  among infp intp infj,btohqsg
U wanna go russia ah haha,btohqsg
If I had to make the world's most inaccurate guess infp.,btohqsg
Anime spoiler aot dont click if dw get spoiled lol  i wanna ask abt eren.if there are aot fans here  how did eren become the founding titan? Cause I'm confused over the utube comments arguing how it happened,btohqsg
