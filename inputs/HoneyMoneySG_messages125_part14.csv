How soon can we pay the annual fees for HSBC T1 annual fees upon getting the card?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  will there be any difference in the 4mpd reward if i use amaze+crmc in fairprice app to pay in kopitiam vs using crmc directly in the fairprice app?.,btohqsg
should appear in statement within 90 days,btohqsg
So it will automatically add to our statement  and we have to hold for a minimum of 3 months before cancelling it?,btohqsg
yes auto added to statement. dun remember if TnC states need to keep how long before cancel but at least wait till u get the bonus points and redeemed them?,btohqsg
Hi all  Can i check for the uob savings acct promo 4.5m earmark. After earmark  the amount will disappear from the account  where will it show?,btohqsg
How about Rewards tab in ocbc internet banking?,btohqsg
Click into One account > Details.,btohqsg
Hey all! wanted to ask for this promo  after i put fresh funds in  can i still buy stocks with the fresh funds and be eligible for the promotion?,btohqsg
That tab has been loading since forever,btohqsg
Hi guys  may I checkCiti reward credit card use on shopee and grad got 4mpd?Or do I need to pair with Amaze card to use it,btohqsg
Hi guys  can someone pls enlighten me if I have multiple UOB cards  do they follow the same statement cycle? Or varies for diff card?,btohqsg
have if mcc is not excluded. Shoppee has varying mcc.,btohqsg
Anyone here bought SCHG? is it better than QQQ?,btohqsg
Which joint account have the highest interest rate,btohqsg
Would it be wise to treat moomoo as an savings account? I was thinking of putting in a third of my liquid funds into it so it'll collect interest,btohqsg
cardup mcc code is 7399 right? I saw Citibank and UOB does not excluded this MCC  mean can get miles?,btohqsg
Yes and you get base miles.,btohqsg
No. Don‚Äôt think your fund is protected if moo moo closed down. Put in those you can afford to lose,btohqsg
okay  looks like issue with ocbc website,btohqsg
my uob statement date is on 2nd  is this mean UNI$ earned is until 1st or 2nd of trans posting date?,btohqsg
"""If your holdings are US stocks  you should be covered by SIPC too (says so on the Moomoo dot com slash sg page). For SG stocks  under their MAS license as a custodian broker  I believe that your stocks will be transferred to another custodian  or maybe you pay a fee to transfer them to CDP. Funds (unit trusts) should be covered as well.""",btohqsg
So your understanding that Moomoo fund is as secure as SG bank account that is insured by SDIC under up to 100k? There is a difference. From their page ‚ÄúIt is important to understand that SIPC protects customer accounts against losses caused by the financial failure of the broker-dealer  but not against an increase or decrease in the market value of securities in customers' accounts. SIPC does not protect against market risk  which is the risk inherent in a fluctuating market.‚Äù,btohqsg
Wondering anyone tried? Ntuc inapp payment under dbs women card. Is it 4 miles per $? üòÇ,btohqsg
"the person i replied to said that the fund is not protected if moomoo close down. Which the original poster probably is talking ""interest"" in terms of moomoo cash plus funds",btohqsg
Then follow calendar month. Doesn't matter what is ur statement date.,btohqsg
Ok  so 1-30 or 31 of posting date,btohqsg
But max 2000$ is based on statement month of posting date  so for mine is 3rd to 2nd  is that correct?,btohqsg
You can consider aligning ur statement month to calendar mth. Easier to track..,btohqsg
I asked before and cso give me the new statement date on 2nd  which I think not too far from month end.,btohqsg
Oh that's odd. My UOB cso gave me month end.,btohqsg
I think the point about custodian and how the customer investment is protected is not verifiable. The brokers don‚Äôt go into details on how in such events  that the customers can claim back and if it will be 100% of their investments. So from my point of view  the protection is there to some degree but not total. But I guess each of us have different levels of interpretation. Main thing when one invest in these funds  they need to know what are they investing into with the pros and cons. Good to discuss our thoughts,btohqsg
but if customers cant really claim back if the company goes under   then whats the point of custodian account? why not just the broker hold all the customer's money?But i cant give a clear answer also   never been through any broker going bankrupt,btohqsg
You hit the answer. It has not tested or verified by a third party unlike SDIC which is from MAS and not by the banks themselves. So that why I have higher confidence if a bank really goes down  we can get back our deposit. For these brokers  it is more of ‚ÄúI do  I say but who verify‚Äù. As much saving account does not offer attractive interest rate  they are still important as part of our financial planning. I definitely won‚Äôt put my emergency funds into these funds not even the MMF. But spare cash  yes  I willing to put in these funds for higher interest.,btohqsg
Yup legit. But it's not cash u can redeem. It's like PayPal credit  subway credit etc. Not many choices. And in blocks it 5000 points redeem for $25 worth of credits,btohqsg
Hi guys  I was wondering if anyone have tried using atome fortrip.comand pay using citi rewards card on atome. Does this qualify for the 4 MPD? ü§î,btohqsg
Tried Atome + CRMC  but not ontrip.com. It works.,btohqsg
Should be similar for others as Atome uses its own MCC. Try to manually make payment from Atome. Do not let it deduct automatically  heard it might treat it as GIRO for automatic installments payment.,btohqsg
MCC 5999  eligible for 4mpd for CRMC.,btohqsg
I tried transfer $1600 from my DBS Account to paynow NRIC which is linked to my UOB one Account  and put Salary Payment as remark  But it did not satisfy the UOB one Account Salary Credit condition.,btohqsg
Try fast transfer from dbs with salary purpose?,btohqsg
Hi I am trying to weight between Citi signup bonus for 40000 thank you points vs sing saver 300 PayNow+150 Shopee voucher. Does anyone have a value comparison on how the thank you points can be valued at ?,btohqsg
40k tk pts are 16k miles. Avg value is 1.1c to 1.25c per mile. I feel singsaver offer is superior.,btohqsg
But if going for business or 1st class  won‚Äôt the miles be more worth it?Each mile would be otherwise valued at 5-8cpm if 1st class,btohqsg
16k miles for 450$ is 2.81cpm. And you can pay annual fee for many cards at 1.9cpm. and other options like cardup for 1.4-1.7 cpm. Would u want to do this instead?,btohqsg
I believe 16k for $450 is not exactly right as we are not ‚Äúbuying it‚Äù for $450.Both are free welcome offer.So if the person value business class or 1st ticket more then an economy  that means he/she prolly value miles at 5-8cpm.Let‚Äôs take 5cpm for example  that would means 16k *$0.05 = $800 return from the miles which is more then the total value of $450 from singsaver.,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm still learning as well,btohqsg
You can get 16k miles at lower cost than 2.81 cpm  i.e. paying annual fee  using cardup  ipaymy. Even buying directly from uob payment facility at 2.1 cpm,btohqsg
Ik and I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not 2.81Cause he/she is not buying any miles here,btohqsg
The guy have an option to choose between 16kmiles vs $450That‚Äôs like choosing between a cashback card or a miles cardAnd so if he value business class more then it makes sense that the miles reward is better,btohqsg
