But O levels have so many more subjects than a lebel,btohqsg
I like to focus on a few subjects  not a little bit from all over the place,btohqsg
Ya and more complexIf never seriously study  its difficult to scrape thru,btohqsg
At least o level can anyhow scrape thru and still get decent grades,btohqsg
i went from N to O levels so many teachers around me made Os seem v scary,btohqsg
Many teachers make A levels sound scary,btohqsg
Ya hahaha ðŸ˜‚ this is the breather among the other subjects,btohqsg
I can tell you that is not true in most cases,btohqsg
he never got an A until he did A levels,btohqsg
Yes cos is content heavy tooIt is no joke! But memory work can help alotA levels must fully understand  more difficult,btohqsg
They dun even have toðŸ¤£ it is originally scary alr,btohqsg
O lvls and a lvls big diff,btohqsg
He suddenly kai qiao is it,btohqsg
When I do prelim papers  I donâ€™t count marks,btohqsg
Yes  I never never seen my A levels results,btohqsg
But I have never gone to the level of not seeing my exam marks,btohqsg
Ur personality like to focus on one thing n analyze deep deep is it,btohqsg
YAAA they encourage us to enter pfp or dpp instead,btohqsg
How do you enter uni then,btohqsg
the internal sch pprs are q hard tbh,btohqsg
Hahaha??? Never seen any of ur grades why??,btohqsg
Ask my parents to fill up the form. Got accepted by Ntu within 48 hours. NUS within a week. Not that hard...,btohqsg
wait till 2025 they change the whole exam,btohqsg
Because I developed depression in JC.,btohqsg
yeah! my principal showed us the stats in jan  average l1r4 was 21 for the previous batch,btohqsg
Maybe cos it will affect sch ranking and cut off point,btohqsg
And I am still depressed till this day,btohqsg
l was q upset at my teachers :x,btohqsg
That's why I say  don't emphasise too much on grades,btohqsg
Oh ok. Ya that justifies greatly,btohqsg
Not academics. Something else that I won't discuss here. I transferred JC as a result,btohqsg
Less Sec 5s = Less students to handle,btohqsg
"they kept emphasising on how previous batches of sec 5s ""failed"" and went to ITE even in the first month of sec 5!",btohqsg
Just pass u off to another school,btohqsg
Hahahahah ya sia how do u know which course to apply ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
schools do this to every cohort I feel,btohqsg
like they dun believe that we'll be able to succeed :x,btohqsg
Itâ€™s like gambling during CNY u know,btohqsg
Oh... u seem like in a special position,btohqsg
PROVE TO THEM WIF UR OS RESULTS,btohqsg
Many teachers told me privately after their announcement that please don't study too hard.,btohqsg
Because I am usually study crazily,btohqsg
Teachers see Sec 5 from the POV of someone whoâ€™s seen hundreds of Sec 5s,btohqsg
Maybe you all can make it,btohqsg
But theyâ€™ve seen hundreds more who cannot,btohqsg
My first report was almost straight As. I think I failed in the mid semester. Because I can't even focus in the exam. I was so depressed,btohqsg
Ok.. yes jc is quit depressing.. if we dun properly focus. I also v depressed sia,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a â€˜ends justify the meansâ€™ kind of thing,btohqsg
No  it's to do with something other than academics,btohqsg
What does it matter the tactic you use as long as you can get them to make the right decision (in your mind),btohqsg
