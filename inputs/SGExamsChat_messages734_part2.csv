Okay its a new lecturer now right? But my laziness continue,btohqsg
And then proceeds to guilt trip us into answering that we have seen the email,btohqsg
I dont even watch qm lectures to study anymore i just read textbook,btohqsg
I was hoping to see at least him mentioning about the answer scripts....nope.,btohqsg
and i heard qm2 teaching wise is even worse than qm1,btohqsg
self study qm1 and 2 leggo,btohqsg
basically seniors say the prof make no sense,btohqsg
read lecture notes alslo make no sense,btohqsg
As long as he does not force me to answer I shld be fine,btohqsg
nobody can force you to answer anything my child,btohqsg
Oh yea  the TA and professor of QM showed otherwise,btohqsg
Do they not use calculator in QM lol,btohqsg
okay i do not go for both so,btohqsg
Why am I the one typing in calculator FOR HIM,btohqsg
ever since i learnt that my TA doesn't go through every question for tut I decided its not worth my time lmao,btohqsg
Heck he even has the bloody workings and answer sheet WITH HIM,btohqsg
Oh  I am in that slot,btohqsg
I stopped going after his first lesson,btohqsg
He went through a whole debate with another student on how lg x and ln x are the same,btohqsg
Legit not worth my time at all,btohqsg
Like he was like  no you are supposed to use lg x not ln x,btohqsg
When the qn uses ln x,btohqsg
He pretty much confused ln x with lg x and vice versa,btohqsg
Idk how he even got a phd,btohqsg
not the same  as lg is log base 10 while ln is log base e,btohqsg
but if you ln or lg both sides still same ah,btohqsg
I feel like we often do this,btohqsg
So we just justify lg 10 and ln to be the same,btohqsg
But ya if this TA dude doesnt even know the differende then idk man,btohqsg
Si yan can take over qm1 tut,btohqsg
I promise i attend all lessons,btohqsg
Yes I know hence why I skull you,btohqsg
hello! how was your day today? :D,btohqsg
i mean my gpa also rabz lah,btohqsg
I did not get a single D,btohqsg
is this your favourite sticker o.O,btohqsg
?? Should be higher lmao if its just that,btohqsg
Na he's not telling the full story the math legit doesn't add up he's tryna say he got 2 when literally B= 3.0,btohqsg
So the average should have been pulled up,btohqsg
ya i also tot so. shld be 3.0,btohqsg
If so then yes it's possible cuz u D for all before in the previous semester,btohqsg
gpa grading shldnt differ to much between ite and poly,btohqsg
It still means average is D,btohqsg
Give me a sec I'll show sor,btohqsg
If its cGPA he also funny cuz he say his grades all for this sem,btohqsg
my first sem was 2.000 2nd sem 2.722 now my cgpa is 2.351ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
How tf is that 2.0 on the dot.,btohqsg
Ya la means only your first sem all Cs,btohqsg
2nd sem was abit btr but cgpa got pulled down,btohqsg
i think the grades are different but the calculation shld be the same,btohqsg
