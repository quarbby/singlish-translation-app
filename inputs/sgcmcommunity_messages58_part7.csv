Hi R/J  how do you comment on a tyre without comparing it to its competitors?,btohqsg

okok not you guys okay r and j i still love you,btohqsg
You are right that everything is subjective!However  I am sure the brand has tested the tyres and conducted their own R&D to back up their tyre’s performance abilities.-R,btohqsg
Those kind of articles are advertorials to push their products/brand etc. They engage Sgcarmart to get the word out for them,btohqsg

Always stick to tyres that you feel confident and comfortable with🥰-R,btohqsg
