i not working haha so no point put money in bcip,btohqsg
but may take a look at it!,btohqsg
not much loss. Max 9k only,btohqsg
if u are into SSBs  this month's Govt T Bills is 3.32% per annum  for 6 months. Just closed yesterday but they release each month like SSB. Difference is you don't know yield until after it's issued as it's a bidding system.,btohqsg
i read that t-bill is short-term,btohqsg
but i will keep a look out,btohqsg
the other ones locked for like 10 years or 6 months yikes,btohqsg
SSB not worth to keep for a month. The yield typically starts lower and rises as the years increase.6 months T Bills is a better alternative in that sense. In fact  you get the interest back first.,btohqsg
eg for the last T Bill  if 1k was put in  $16.80 would be returned. Then they return 1k at the end of 6 months,btohqsg
cannot 1 month la ssb HAHAHA 0 yield si,btohqsg
can if u have large sum of money,btohqsg
u put in a million u yield so much,btohqsg
if u have a million  it's no longer just SSBs,btohqsg
SSB max per NRIC is 200k,btohqsg
take an accounting module in uni,btohqsg
u took more than that to reach uni. Nothing wrong.,btohqsg
for more investment advice  you may register for my investment courseIt's a non existent course that will never be around and never be conducted.,btohqsg
You may join my investment telegram channel.But I also don't know the channel,btohqsg
if you like crypto  it's more worth it to start an exchange and release your own coins.,btohqsg
people just dump money at you,btohqsg
u put money in crypto uh?,btohqsg
I put about $0.00 for 20% yield into Anchor Protocol,btohqsg
Create a crypto and list the sell price at 2 million,btohqsg
The allotment is so pepega now coz it's so popular hahaahhaha,btohqsg
I don't like those that lock for long periods,btohqsg
Everyday i see you grinding on IG,btohqsg
its a good thing either way,btohqsg
are you aiming for overseas uni,btohqsg

either way  don't go to CHS unless you want to become a full fledged social science slave,btohqsg
The exception is if it appeals to you,btohqsg
As a math major i literally spend more time on my non-math mods than math mods,btohqsg

is it not a common college for fass and sch of sci or smt am unsure,btohqsg
just personal experience so far as a Y1 CHS man,btohqsg
i just find it ridiculous that i take more non-math mods than math mods  and these non-math mods take up most of my time kek,btohqsg
