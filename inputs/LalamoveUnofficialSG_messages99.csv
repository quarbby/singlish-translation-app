Hi all  Im new to llm. Just looking the llm infographic on when is it ok or not ok to cancel order. Theres this clash of order... i think it means multiple pick up in same delivery window... is it allowed?,btohqsg
I just choose as and when I am free to do pickups.. depends in the distance and the dropoff timing... usually shld be able to do at least one or two per day.,btohqsg
But i dont stack orders... i complete one and i accept another.,btohqsg
If i get an advance timing order  am i able to take up the pick up now orders too?,btohqsg
Do we need to pay income tax for earning from Lala? Thanks,btohqsg
The app doesnt allow u to take orders for the same pickup time.,btohqsg
U cant even see the details if u had already confirmed one job at that timing.,btohqsg
If i didnt remember wrongly  the system will not allow u to take 2 same pickup time jobs.,btohqsg

Guys I recently got an order from AMK to Bedok  but that order was used by loanshark to collect money from the sender which is at AMK   when I reached there I didn't know that I was to go n collect $$ until that old poor lady told me that I was the third person come and asking for collection  I called the person who made that order and not available   but when I first called he nvr told me anything but to just go and collect and the sender will pass me  later he called me by other number which was not from Singapore and told me to collect cash from that lady if she refused  slap her or throw slippers and take video then he will paynow me  I immediately make a report to that help segment to complain but there was no human to chat and reply over that matter  frustrated   I went to make a police report  I was not compensate for the effort and lalamove ignored and nvr investigate  what advice would you give should such event happen again?,btohqsg
Dont take jobs that require u to collect cash and u will be safe,btohqsg
It doesn't indicate on apps and u can't cancel right away,btohqsg
Tell the customer to cancel on their side,btohqsg
Then just leave the job as it  next day contact cs to tell them about it so that they dont penalise u,btohqsg
Ya post be careful so we also can avoid . Now they come out many patterns,btohqsg
Walau. I Kenna reservist that day!!,btohqsg
Last year I did valentine day quite okay leh . Midnight also got order hahaha,btohqsg
Cash order... must call first. Not all cash orders are problematic  but all the funny business orders are cash orders. Scams  loansharks  etc.,btohqsg
If unable to call through... just be prepared that it might be a waste of time if still go ahead to pickup. Might be legit job of course.,btohqsg
No choice brother things will be better,btohqsg

I waited and got fed up when he said he won't be able to complete packing even 15 mins. Then told me to cancel the job. I asked him then how? I already arrived  already waited 25 mins  already incurred parking charges in the shopping centre.Message CS knn  they told me to wait n look into it. Contact them again  told me to wait again they r so fast to cut me off.Can anyone advise me what to do? What if i had cancelled the job  will i still b able to take the fee? But now have i completed the job. The 25 mins waiting time how? Then i left n came back cos that guy gave me short of one box of shoe. Another wasted time.Really  cannot be too nice.,btohqsg

May the morning breeze bring you coolness  may the morning sun bring you warmth  and may my blessings make you happy today,btohqsg
U mean i shouldn't have left?,btohqsg
U mean when i arrived there n that user not ready  i should have waited there n inform CS ?,btohqsg
Then i would be late for my next job,btohqsg
But i did waited n pick up n completed the job,btohqsg
U mean if after waiting more than 10 mins  i can cancel the job if i refused to wait?,btohqsg
Ok. So after contacting CS to cancel job. Then there is no fee for me to collect?,btohqsg
I tried to claim.  But CS kept telling me to wait for User to call to confirm. It's been 4 days already. CS still saying User haven't call to confirm. Really knn,btohqsg
Yes i did wait n i did finished the job. I even took photo 9f my watch timing at the shop,btohqsg
I should have told them to pay orelse those 42 boxes of shoes would be sold at a pasar malam,btohqsg
Wa lau. And i so kind some more  when back to shop to tell that guy short of one pair of shoes. Then i spent time packing the shoes box by box inside my car boot to ensure that the shoes don't drop out of the boxes,btohqsg
I had similar issue before during Christmas period.My office work start 9.30.I took a job 8am for 4 locations = $42.But reached the sender still haven't ready yet. Waited u til 8.30  bopian told C's  I cannot wait any longer cos I got work. They say they will cancel.I told them  can cs put comments that it's not my fault.Also can I claim cancellation fee 50%.Both requests accepted. $21 in my pockets,btohqsg
But I think it's only much possible because the sender is using credit  easier for the CS to penalised the sender... If cash payment  unlikely  cos llm would incur the cost then  cannot penalised the customer.,btohqsg

Last time.. now no more but commission more,btohqsg
Guys new Lalamove driver hereGot any fuel discount at shell?,btohqsg
i think they realised that instead of forcing MPV without sticker to be car account  they tax more instead. very clever of them,btohqsg
But doing mpv not worth coz the item is really heavy.. i ever kena carry floor tiles.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg

Went there nothing to collect. Called the number given and owner talk to the sender and then found out from the owner that its loanshark prank. And then sender block calls and messages üôÑFile a police report  reported to CS. Not sure will compensate anot.,btohqsg
End up still kena f by owner's father. He thought im in cahoot with loanshark üòí,btohqsg
I think if reach there CS will compensate half most likely,btohqsg
Money hard to earn liao  ahlong still can think of this kind of tricks to harrass ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
As long as there's at least one single driver willing to take the job  they will continue doing this. It's free and untraceable. Even if traced  the one doing the harrassing is the lalamove driver  not the one who placed the order. Can only prove it's a prank order  can't prove it's a loanshark operation.,btohqsg

The rate is not very favourite,btohqsg
If cancel account  can get back the money?,btohqsg
I mean rate is quite low after commission,btohqsg
lalamove rates are the highest in sg for short distances  starts at $10. Do one of the food platforms better for more walkable distances.,btohqsg
Thank you boss for advise. Hard to come by walkable trips,btohqsg
There are orders within walkable distance (within 1km) but those are rare,btohqsg
I recommend you deliveroo. For deliveroo  you can cancel as you wish. Price is reasonable,btohqsg
For those orders I also walk to deliver even when I drive.,btohqsg

I took the Job bcos I want to go back to my destination. But was shocked that car park 7.xx  I took less than 30 min to pick the items.,btohqsg
not worth taking job over there  Especially those branded stuff (i see many),btohqsg

TUAS south jobs are for Taxi drivers or PHV as they can pick up jobs. Not for normal car or motorcycle. Basically one way trip.,btohqsg
i had to carry 4 cartons from MBS to its Westgate outlet. that time forgot to bring trolley. so i have to carry 1 box at a time from the shop to the car. i checked where the shop is  and where is the best place to park the nearest.i did the most troublesome method of going in and out of MBS carpark 4 times to avoid $7.49 first hour.but when i reach westgate - only $1.40 - give la.,btohqsg

Sometimes the order has been picked up already but job not cancelled in llm app. Either the resto nvr inform oddle to cancel  or oddle nvr cancel yet,btohqsg

Spent lots of time searching for the address at  Malls. And also many times  the apps don't give complete address. The apps navigation brings me to wrong location,btohqsg

Just to ask any idea how to avoid prank orders call the receiver first before proceeding to collect?,btohqsg
So far I did 6 deliveries so far so good üòä,btohqsg
do credit orders. or orders that u commonly see in the app. like oddle or medicine or deliverchinatown or some florist. usually these orders are corporate accounts and are generally more trustworthycash orders u can proceed if there is sufficient information in the remarks. call before proceeding.do some more  get the feel  then you will find your sweet spot when doing LLM and not be a random cherry picker not knowing anything.,btohqsg
If I were took an order which has 4 stop  must I follow in sequence or can I plan my own route,btohqsg
And what does it means by contact customer for additional expense?,btohqsg
150kg should suffice for most of the car jobs.,btohqsg
Stick to the route.. if u r stacking  got to judge the timing. As llm will track the timing to each location i think,btohqsg

Not that I mind these penalty  but it's just mind boggling how these can happen....??? Its like I am wondering if I am the one who has gone insane...,btohqsg
Has these happen to anyone before?,btohqsg
I am pretty sure somehow is their tech issue  but how to proof???,btohqsg
Because using car to do good seem not very convenient in parking leh,btohqsg
oh  means you actually did complete the job with no issues but somehow after that it reflects cancelled?,btohqsg
Never do the job... Never even relaised I had such a job,btohqsg
I never even click complete job... Again I never know I had such a job.,btohqsg

Btw  I tried to sent asking them to review if there is any conversations w regards to these. I just sent today... I am very sure I did not request cancellation nor even aware I have this job at hand.,btohqsg
Really very tiring just do 2 trips only from 11 am to ard 3 pm plus,btohqsg
$7 not worth lah. But kills time. Y notm,btohqsg

If more than 20kg you can ask for Mpv rate,btohqsg
So after complete a job just wait and saw,btohqsg
It's the season  extra surcharge for cny just over...so now  hahaha kill time  can lah. Along the way  can lah. Double job can lah. Otherwise  it's very tiring for little money  and car maintenance.,btohqsg
Focus on car job only lah.,btohqsg
If motor job car can take also yah,btohqsg
Peak 11-1pm. Still okey lah. Otherwise  I dun bother... Focus on car job  with good locations... Otherwise body maintenance is more worth it.,btohqsg
Cash out after Sunday only get the money next Wed yah,btohqsg
If cash out before 2359 hrs Sunday will get following Wednesday yah?,btohqsg
So far I feel even do 2 to 3 trips a day if really got nothing to do also like not really worth it,btohqsg

You dun accept  u will be penalised with low acceptance rate.. disqualify from some of their perks..,btohqsg
Means cannot like lalamove can choose?,btohqsg
But they give to the relatively nearest rider to the shop.,btohqsg
So for lalamove multiple stops I see some even got 8 stops in between that's crazy,btohqsg
Hi I need assistance. I ask live chat to cancel 1 order from 53 ubi to sin ming however without my knowledge after live chat cancel they reasign me an order without my consent. Now it's still ongoing. Try contact live chat no avail. What should I do,btohqsg
I'm unsure as I'm new with lalamove,btohqsg
Can you share the fare breakdown?,btohqsg
Do u include the time u spend tryg to get jobs,btohqsg
Relax know that complain also won't change anytg 1,btohqsg
Not worth it to get angry,btohqsg
I realised that 3 mths after I started,btohqsg
Now I just do wat I can  everything else I f*** itüòÇ,btohqsg
Cos they so many drivers minority complain they can't b bothered,btohqsg
Same pick up same delivery location,btohqsg
Have to learn to stack in lalamove. Won't break $10/hr doing one at a time. If don't want to stack  doing grabfood or panda will give a better hourly rate - the per-job pay is lower but much shorter  so the hourly is higher.,btohqsg
Knn Extra Virgin pizza @ Asia Sq there really fucked up. Monitor our gps movement and keep calling when we on the road. Deliver within allocated timing also end up kanna bad rating and soft ban from Oddle. ü§¨ü§¨,btohqsg
Nxt time don't take their jobs lor. Last time I take their job. Even when accepted the job liao they will call and ask me what time I can reach etc. After that I nvr take their job liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre like that. Prev take also no such issue. Now I know already will not take theirs anymore. Same pattern like WaaCow nearby there also ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Not all the time like that I guess. But once awhile is enoughüòÇ,btohqsg
Can take for stack If u drop theirs first lor. Or take as single job,btohqsg
When LLM raising our rates?? ü§î,btohqsg
Waa cow as well. Monitor our GPS. I once stacked an order with theirs and deliver the other one first. The guy from waacow keep calling. Subsequently he rated me 1 star and I emailed lalamove to remove it.,btohqsg
Most likely is they got complaint from their customers  over oddle delivery.  So their management implement loElse f&b ops alr quite bz  got spare time catch Netflix in toilet better  who want to monitor some gps,btohqsg
Thank you. Good sharing information on Extra Virgin pizza and WaaCow.,btohqsg
Waacow got write in the job order no stacking n deliver straight  so they monitor I accept. If I stack their job I will make sure theirs is the first drop. For extra virgin pizza is oddle job with a timing given. I don't see anytg wrong if I deliver within the time frame. But they will still call n check. That's y I give their job a miss,btohqsg
But note that their job the oddle timing given is 45 mins,btohqsg
Most other oddle jobs is 1he,btohqsg
I have same thoughts too haha,btohqsg
I think LLM should impose premium on jobs that indicate no stacking,btohqsg
Sharing an experience with Dempsey cook house and bar. Waited at the restaurant for almost an hour. I tried to contact CS a couple of times after 10 min of waiting but no response for 30+ min. Meanwhile I keep checking with the service attendant there and ask them to inform the customer that the order will be late. My next scheduled job cancelled on me as I was late. Finally after waiting for more than 45min  the order is ready. To my horror  there are 20-30  paper bags that filled up the boot and the back seat of my car. I'm frustrated but okay never mind I decide to suck thumb and deliver. On my way to the customer place  the customer dropped me 10+ miss calls  and upon arrival I was greeted with an angry customer saying I spoiled her birthday party. She said that the restaurant told her I was late for an hour. Tried to clarify but no avail. All these waiting and opportunity cost for only $13 earnings. Please avoid Dempsey cook house and bar!!,btohqsg
Nxt time when at the resto n they say will be late u call the customer b inform then,btohqsg
I always do this when the resto is gg to be very late.,btohqsg
