Hi all  would you suggest to have either UOB PPV or CITI Rewards? Or to hold both cards?,btohqsg
Also for transport use  i took Standard Chartered Smart Credit Card. Is this a good choice for transport or is there any better UOB card?,btohqsg
their uses kinda overlap. Id only suggest having both if you are exceeding 1k cap on citi rewards.,btohqsg
citi rewards with amaze can earn 4mpd on more categories than UOB PPV for online. UOB PPV is very good for mobile contactless payment (blacklist approach) but online categories that earn 4mpd are limited (whitelist). However  UNI$ are pooled together with other UOB miles card.,btohqsg
Transport u mean simplygo or ride hailing services,btohqsg
May i know credit cards shall I use to get max miles for buying flight ticket and booking hotel on agoda? I have dbs women world  citi reward amaza  citi premier miles  hsbc revo and ocbc 365,btohqsg
Dbs woman's world card. There is also this app called heymax to check which card to use.https://hmsg.link/heymax,btohqsg
1.5k per calendar month i think.,btohqsg
UserForexhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:you may have good intention but this is not the group for this. Welcome to discuss anything finance related in the future.,btohqsg
Did you use paynow sala? It seems they didn't credit,btohqsg
Oooo  yea Sc smart is one of the better ones  else u can go with UOB one if u have UOB One account as well,btohqsg
That has stopped working since last month unfortunately.,btohqsg
Isit... why would OCBC not update their online tracker then,btohqsg
Well their website tracker bugged out but their system check was working. Unless you have legitimate paynow salary  I wouldn't argue with ocbc and find alternative.,btohqsg
So did you receive the interest? For salary credit from personal account?,btohqsg
Any idea when did they patch it?,btohqsg
patched meansFor the BETTERorFor the WORSE,btohqsg
Imagine you credit your salary on the 14th but they only patch on the 26th July,btohqsg
Btw  I'm not working for ocbc. A bunch of dps around this time last month not getting interest forsavesalary.,btohqsg
Since Jun  since ppl did not receive the interest in Jul,btohqsg
Ya meaning jun salary credit didn't get interest in jul. If you credit ur sal in jul  confirmed not working already.,btohqsg
Is using gpay QR with paylah as payment method considered as a paylah retail spend for DBS multiplier calculation? Or must I use the paylah app to pay?,btohqsg
Lol just migrate out of OCBC then. It's really not worth banking with them,btohqsg
Thanks. I was thinking of salary but typed save. Fixed.,btohqsg
I tried fast salary transfer from my wife uob acct to my ocbc 360 last weekend. It did reflect in the ocbc website tracking. I guess must be different account name,btohqsg
Yea it updates the tracker. But you will not receive the salary bonus next month,btohqsg
According to others  it will reflect in the tracking  but bonus will not receive.,btohqsg
I see. Then alternative can use uob one. Tried last month still working. 😁,btohqsg
Ya. My salary is with ocbc then use workaround for uob.,btohqsg
existing hsbc customer also can apply thru this link?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I bought SPYL fractional shares for USD 500 but got charged fees $4.47 instead of minimum for Tiered acct USD 1.70. Did I miss anything here?Checked my account setting to ensure Tiered. This was my first buy since opened account 3 months ago.,btohqsg
Just wanted to check  got any wallet than revolut where you can top up via apple pay and transfer money? looking for alternative,btohqsg
Hey guys any reccos on aggressive short term investment platforms?,btohqsg

Hey guys  which trading platform is best for beginners?,btohqsg
I usually do recurring trade for smaller amounts to get ~2 USD commission.,btohqsg
My Top 5 Credit Cards of 2024https://youtu.be/SYF8KOpS1Tg,btohqsg
So u mean fees different for recurring versus direct buy?,btohqsg
Hello! I intend to buy some stuff on Taobao ($400-$600) but not sure if it’s worth the miles for using Citi rewards. Because Taobao is charging some fees at 3%(?),btohqsg
Combine with amaze? Will help reduce foreign currency spread.,btohqsg

UOB funds earmarked for Nation of Savers promo and cash gift credited.,btohqsg
Ma'am u earmarked w UOB stash?,btohqsg
Mine din so earmark failed? Coz still full amt in uob one,btohqsg
What are your alternatives? If the 3% is due to FCY  can try using amaze to reduce the spread. If the 3% is due to CC being used  treat it as though you are buying miles at 75cents (assuming 4mpd for CRMC).,btohqsg
