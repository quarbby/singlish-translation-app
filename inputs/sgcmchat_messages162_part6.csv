you can say the same for the Nissan HyperForce then.,btohqsg
the rear lightbar isn't just a Taycan exclusive.,btohqsg
it is unique though  if it has an ICE it would be pretty neat.,btohqsg
it just depends on what Honda would put into it. A K20C1 might barely keep up with the German counterparts.,btohqsg
errr  like I said. Not exclusive to the Taycan,btohqsg
still a concept for now  designs and inspirations would change.,btohqsg
hm the bumpstarts aren't really great imo,btohqsg
tends to kick in every damn time the battery is flat,btohqsg
what friendliness does a sporty Honda give to said neighbourhood,btohqsg
aside from pleasing the VTEC enthusiasts,btohqsg
hm. the E300e does that to an extent. it is useful for city driving,btohqsg
we test drove a C350e  the older PFL estate,btohqsg
but spins the rears for days once you whack,btohqsg
i'd get a decent conti hybrid any day,btohqsg
if you ignore the slightly smaller boot space  and heavy ass weight,btohqsg
and iffy reliability with the EV,btohqsg
except the sound system in an E Class. sounds like ass,btohqsg
the stock ones are absolutely ass,btohqsg
that's why we changed ours out,btohqsg
look at dr seuss over here,btohqsg
those were optional from cycle iirc,btohqsg
it's okay  but BMW pulled it off better i feel,btohqsg
going from the F10 to the W213,btohqsg
but the W213 is modern and comfier,btohqsg
surprisingly the F10 holds up well,btohqsg
G30 5series is pretty neat compared to F series,btohqsg
I'm driving G20  checks all my boxes :),btohqsg
a shame the FC is quite high though,btohqsg
