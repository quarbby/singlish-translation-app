Thanks for the advice guys. Now need another piece of advice  better to take bank loan or in-house loan? I see that bank loan interests are lower.,btohqsg
bank is better if you have no issues securing it,btohqsg
see what works best for you based on interest rate and your credit profile,btohqsg
the dealer can go look for you as well as they do earn a commission on it,btohqsg
they wouldn't be opposed to it,btohqsg
yeah unless you have a long standing relationship with one that you can leverage for better terms,btohqsg
As long you pay on time,btohqsg
I think just go bank ask for full loan more better,btohqsg
Wait. Is this for car engine?,btohqsg
7 men who drove up to 173kmh on PIE in convoy of 30 cars fined  disqualified from drivinghttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/7-men-who-drove-up-to-173kmh-on-pie-in-convoy-of-30-cars-fined-disqualified-from-drivingcomments?,btohqsg
Such character should be ban for driving for life! They might perceive their lives as cheap and disposable but not other productive road users or pedestrians! No shame from their mugshot!,btohqsg
I am curious if the last Toyota Alphard is also prosecuted lol,btohqsg
