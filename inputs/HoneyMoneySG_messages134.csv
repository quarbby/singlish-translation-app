My statement doesnt have giro stated so will need to pay manually. I thought 10 days will be enough for dbs to register but apparently its not.,btohqsg
I think its a dbs thingie.. other banks or instituition is quite fast,btohqsg
Ya i submit form end of aug and got sms confirmation from HSBC on 20 sec.,btohqsg
Maybe can appeal to dbs and see if you can have a new dp for us,btohqsg
Anyone receive this vouchers from hsbc? I’m not sure how it works,btohqsg
Hahahaha welcome to team failed to register GIRO with DBS because their system is trash.Just check your postal box daily  and pray you receive a letter that tells you that it passed. Or drop HSBC a live chat asking for all the GIRO arrangements you have for your HSBC EGA account.,btohqsg
Not safe. The only safe is if your card statement has the word giro,btohqsg
Can always use that as preemptive check. Every time they will tell me no such GIRO arrangement.,btohqsg
Hi All  for UOB SAVE UP CASH promo 1. can i deposit the funds in batches?2. Then submit the form after i hit MAB $150k?Cos i will only have 150k MAB in the second half of the month,btohqsg
Doesn't matter. Can always register first and wait until have 150k then deposit in.Not sure what you mean by hit MAB $150k in second half of the month lol.,btohqsg
Deposit funds in batches also can?,btohqsg
I mean i will have $150k MAB at the end of the month. Right now idh $150k,btohqsg
Hi  has anyone taken an interest free loan before ? Where is the best deal in SG ?,btohqsg
Tagging on: if participating deposit date is 1-31 Oct  do I need to have 150k in account for earmarking by 31 Oct or 29 Nov?,btohqsg
Yes. If you think that's more interest-efficient lol.,btohqsg
You need it by 31 Oct UNTILend of the specified earmark period.,btohqsg
Just don't be JIT warrior. 31 Oct is PH.,btohqsg

Hi all  will like to check if anyone knownwhen using the HSBC EGA debit card to pay via AXS will earn the cashback?,btohqsg
I think it is mentioned in clause 5a in the HSBC everyday+ rewards TnC.,btohqsg
where is the best place to park some cash <50k. i don’t have 2 EGA accounts to switch around and promo rate ended in Sep,btohqsg
hello gurus  quick question — for HSBC EGA  if we GIRO our insurance premiums  are we eligible for the 1% cashback? i saw that using the Debit Card won't get you the 1%. am looking to sign up soon! though i dont have fresh funds of 50k lol. currently on ocbc 360 (salary + save) too (just adding some context). mainly gonna be using it for GIRO paymentsnot sure hows best to minmax things 😂,btohqsg
I was in similar shoes. My ega is only for giro. Don't need to think too much. Just open ega account then set up giro to pay ur insurance. Maybe add giro for income tax too. Then add giro for your credit card(s). 😁,btohqsg
does using card and paying it off straight helps improve credit score compared to just paynow? or doesn't make a big difference 😅,btohqsg
Pay bill right when statement is generated is enough. Your score will slowly go up.True story I have a friend paid his bill before statement is generated. Then last month he had a transaction posted early and wasnt part of the amount he paid. He ended up got a late fee and interest charges. 😅,btohqsg
holding the cash in mari for extra 0.70$ per day 😂,btohqsg

Good morning everyone! Anybody tried the DBS SAFRA credit card? Can pair with Instarem?,btohqsg
Technically kris+ is considered mobile wallet payment. So Revo doesn’t count am I right?,btohqsg
Only considered mobile wallet for Citi Rewards. Revo can be used on Kris+ and counted as online transaction (provided MCC is correct),btohqsg
Oh so mobile wallet is still considered “online” in a sense?I read the tnc and it says only online + certain contactless..,btohqsg
It is an online transaction for most cards  only Citibank treats it differently,btohqsg
Can I know what the next cashback card taking over Citi Bank reward? (No min spending)? Thank in advance 🙏,btohqsg
Anybody here know if the UOB one debit card $500/month spend is compulsory and what will happen if I don’t do so? I don’t need the extra interest 😅,btohqsg
You will just earn the base interest 0.05%. But do try to hit the $500 if you have substantial amount in the account. If the amount is small  you should consider the smaller digital banks for better interest.,btohqsg
Thanks! I read the T&C  doesn’t work 😅,btohqsg
so u have uob one account but dun need bonus interest? Then better use other high interest account without need for spending.btw can spend on uob lady/evol/one/lazada credit card to meet $500 card spend for up to 4% interest on uob one account  not compulsory to spend on uob one debit card,btohqsg
Better to just find a different card and different account lol. If you can't meet the spend criteria  better to just put somewhere without it.,btohqsg

Instarem amaze has 2 features:1. top up balance like youtrip2. Link to sg mastercard. They will charge ur master card directly,btohqsg
yes if u mean Food Panda,btohqsg
I have a similar experience too. No brownie points for settling the bill well before payment due date. To be safe  pay two days before due date would be fine,btohqsg

I will not recommend it as there are costs if I’m not wrong in the execution of an equity loan. Those costs can easily take the small margins of 0.7% you need to jump through some hoops to make.,btohqsg

Noob here sorry for asking a basic question auntie . so u basically ask the bank for a loan on your house (I assume in this case u would have paid up the hdb loan ? ) or do u mean u ask the bank for a loan to finance ur hdb loan then u dump in a high interest acct ?,btohqsg
1. HDB cannot 'refinance' one.. you can only take it at the start. So I am nagging whoever can take it at the start  TAKE THE MAX AND THE LONGEST.2. If non HDB  it would be the terms and conditions the bank extends to you when you approach it. Can be uncompleted  completed  reverse mortgage. Just make sure you fully understand the costs when undertaking the loan. Generally if there is no repayment penalty / low penalty  it makes sense to max the loan as long as you are able to find a close to risk free place to park the 'excess loan'. You should never use cash to reduce the loan as long as cash earning more than loan rate.,btohqsg

thanks for your good reminder.Just to share my logic / thoughts after i considered hsbc Live+ and maybank fnf.I have decided to use HSBC live+ to buy all my heymax klook voucher requirements. WHY?1. i going travelling soon. Best to keep quotas available in both hsbc Live+ ($1800 this month) and Maybank fnf (only $312.50)2. both are similar 8% anyway3. there are 4 MCC codes which hsbc and maybank covers differently. Best to keep quota in both cards. 5399 5611 5655 59414. Maybank can still be used with Amaze. More precious to keep limit.,btohqsg

Yep...1 time processing fee depending on how many mths loan u take ranging from 4mths (1.35% processing fee) to 6mths (2%) to 12mths loan (3.85%). Im calculating whether it is worth taking such an interest free loan to do short term investment. What u think ?,btohqsg
Of course not worth lah. They indirectly charge you interest through the processing fees.,btohqsg
you can do up an excel sheet and go month by month to calculate if you can break even at your expected interest/earn ratetip: highly unlikely unless you expect something like 10%p.a. ROI,btohqsg
Actually MAS should clamp down on these misleading adverts. Advertise big big say no interest but whack consumer on the processing fees.,btohqsg
Yes. Most don't advertise EIR or put it in front size that is too small to notice,btohqsg
Depends on ur investment. If you are taking loan to expand ur current business that is doing well  maybe yes. Other typical investments may be not.,btohqsg
Sometimes they do give example altitude amex. $60 gift i forgot whats the form,btohqsg

Did chocolate finance reduced their rate?Usually get $2.30 - $2.31 per day for 1st $20k but today got $2.15,btohqsg
You need to understand how chocolate finance works for amount >20k. There is a reason people suggesting to keep it 19.5k-19.7k,btohqsg
as in paid from corporate account?,btohqsg
I got $2.29 😂😂I withdraw the amount everyday so it keeps to $20k everyday.I suspect they gave out extra fractional and now clawing back?,btohqsg
Mine is never more than $20k though. Maybe need to keep it $19 900 or so,btohqsg
hitrying to purchase electronic from samsung1.5kI am thinking to use atome  mcc 5999 according to heymaxpossible credit cards for cashback: DBS Livefresh  UOB EVOL  UOB ONE  OCBC FRANKmay I know if this is correct? or any better suggestion?Or is there other better card for 5732 electronics? Physical payment,btohqsg
What cc is the best right now for daily spending,btohqsg
Okay thanks let me check it out,btohqsg
If you like miles  Amaze+CRMC is rarely beaten unless you spend on travel  hospitals and insurance.For cash back  just do UOB One. Avoid hospitals and insurance. As a small bonus  you get added cash back from Grab  Dairy Farm Group and MacDonalds.These two are general spending cards and function on blacklist basis. Least painful to manage.,btohqsg
Looks like the return is not consistent. How come my return is less than 4.2%?,btohqsg
Is standchart journey card having the best promo on singsaver now? How do the rewards compare with previous promos?,btohqsg
I thought only the amount above $20k is not guaranteed? First $20k is guaranteed?Eg. $20010 of saving  $20 000 has guaranteed return.$10 has no guaranteed return.,btohqsg
Actually this is a bit misleading. The first $20k won't be negative  but anything above can be. Which I think will affect the total returns for the day (i.e. daily returns minus capital loss).,btohqsg
The $10 is not only no guaranteed returns  it's no guaranteedcapitalas well. So you're better off making sure you don't exceed $20k.,btohqsg
It’s definitely they are being misleading.A reminder that chocolate finance is an investment and your capital is not guaranteed.,btohqsg
No.. your message is misleading. You're saying if they have above $20k  everything including the $20k can drop. But their t&cs clearly stated that the first $20k in everyone's account will not drop below that  any capital losses/target returns not met will be topped up by CF.,btohqsg
There are 89 days till dec 31. You can put 19.7k and be done with it.,btohqsg
Also about this  I'm sure plenty of people are already onboard and CF's AUM might have reached $500m*.If they have reached $500m AUM  and they just decided to pull out from 4.2% guaranteed returns/$20k capital promo  they can. Which was what they have stated in t&cs from day 1.,btohqsg
If they actually just pull the plug on the promo  the first $20k also can 💸,btohqsg
Do you mean if I have $20 000.50 of saving in CF  it will become $20 000 next day if the return is not good. My $0.50 that put into investment as a capital can be totally 100% lost?,btohqsg
Definitely the wordings in my comment can be improved. Negative here is for the daily return but total balance wont drop below 20k.,btohqsg
@MouseHunter88firstly it'snot a savings account  so you're not saving in CF.If let's say the fund somehow drops 50% in a day  you'll lose 50% of $0.50  which is -$0.25.Your total returns will be $2.30 (from 4.2% guaranteed returns)  minus $0.25  which is $2.05.,btohqsg
Oic. Which means the return of first $20k(ie. $2.30) is not guaranteed if total investment amount is more than $20k.,btohqsg
Any1 knows wats the mcc for top ups to youtrip? Does it count as online spending?,btohqsg
Topping up youtrip will not get rewards for most cards,btohqsg
So to be safe  just ensure balance always below 20k. Eg 19900,btohqsg
What happened to chocolate finance? I thought it is fixed 4.2% till end of this year?,btohqsg
First $20k**** always read the t&cs,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.I now keep $19 997.50Then aim to withdraw the interest once it’s been credited. That way it won’t exceed $20k but still get about $2.30 daily,btohqsg
Ya I always withdraw dailyThen realised a drop that’s why,btohqsg
"Hi gurus  a noob question please. I am using crmc+amaze. I understand that both cards has a ""limit"" of 1k. With that being the case  can I say that I don't have any benefits in using the crmc card naked when shopping online please?",btohqsg
How come different accounts different negative return?,btohqsg
1 thing. Amaze follows calendar month while crmc follows statement month which may not be the same.Let's say crmc statement starts from 10th. If your amaze + crmc hit 1k in the first 10 days  now 10-30th of the month  ur amaze + crmc will be charged 1% even though your crmc cap is still available.,btohqsg
Different amounts in chocolate finance. More money more loss 😔.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I would like to seek advice regarding moomoo Cash Plus. Previously I participated the 6.8% campaign and it was just ended for me. It seems like moomoo is very particular about fresh fund. We can’t just withdraw all and deposit back as it won’t be counted as fresh fund. So  I guess I’m not eligible to join the extended campaign for existing users unless I have spare money to put in.Now I have 50k in Fullerton SGD Cash Fund @ 3.2478% and I plan to withdraw all and deposit into GXS @ 3.48% first 30k and Chocolate Finance @ 4.2% first 20k.I understand that it will take T+1 for the redeemed fund to arrive our moomoo account after we submitted the redemption request. The interest amount earned during weekends will be accumulated and credited into our account on every Tuesday.So  my question is  when will be a good time to withdraw all the fund? Will I lose all the interest accumulated on weekends if I redeem the units on Monday? Should I redeem it after they credit the interest on Tuesday? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I got $0.45 instead of $2.30 today.  I thought the first 20k is fixed at 4.2%.,btohqsg
just scroll up a little. Admin Melvyn explained ithttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/236913,btohqsg
if OP took a 12 month loan with EIR of 3.85%Use the loan proceed to put into EGA with interest rate of 4.1%Theoretically  he can make money right?,btohqsg
First  you will need 2 EGA accounts. 2nd  nothing guaranteed EGA interest rate % will stay 4.1% for the next 12 months.,btohqsg
that is too fine a margin to be worth the effort / time / admin risk.,btohqsg
yeah  the risk is if the EGA interest rate falls under 3.85% in this 12 months.which is a very high probability,btohqsg
Yes  and you lost $1.85 from the amounts above $20k.,btohqsg
Hi all  for UOB ONE new account opening  i participated in the 150k incremental funds promo. I can still withdraw the funds as and when i like and just ensure that by 31 oct end of the month i have 150k inside to be eligible for the earmark. Is this correct?,btohqsg
a bit harsh to lose so much... i am more inclined to think they messed up somehow,btohqsg
you need to follow the table. When did you register?,btohqsg
Read the tnc how they compute the balance,btohqsg
Registered on 1 oct. So i just ensure there is 150k by 29 nov? I can still utilise my funds first right?,btohqsg
"not so simple.1. How much is your September ADB?2. ""whichever is later"" means what?3. how are you transferring?",btohqsg
Im new account opening. Opened on 1 oct so idh sep ADB. I will ensure there is 150k by mid of the month and i will top up more to have 150k MAB in mid of th month as well. I will tsf from a non-UOB account to my new UOB account,btohqsg

1. Great 0 September ADB  so you are correct you just need to maintain $150 000 for this promo.2. So you will make it such that October ADB is at least $150 000? That is fine too.2a. Just make sure you have at least $150 000 on 29th October onwards and do not touch it. Don't do too late in case miss cutoff or 31st October holiday issue.3. make sure you do not do any transfers across UOB account. Always in from non UOB account and you should be good.,btohqsg
Anyone can advise me on this? Should I withdraw fund from moomoo Cash Plus on Monday or Tuesday? Thanks.,btohqsg

like when i deposit funds into my ONE account. How to check the posting date? cos that day i deposited at around 9pm plus so i want to double check the posting date so i can count the MAB correctly,btohqsg
i would say it is safe to assume all banks will post SAME DAY if you do it BEFORE 10pm on a normal weekday.,btohqsg
My problem with UOB one card is that I have done a transcation on the last day of Sep which just hit over the $500 spent requirement. However this transcation was only posted on 1st Oct which mean that I did not fulfill the Sep $500 spend requirement. Then the whole quarter is forfeited. Called UOB they say can't do anything on the transcation and need to wait for end Oct before I can do my appeal. Damn lousy service.,btohqsg
Skill issue  t&c clearly stated liao. They have no obligation to accept your appeal.,btohqsg
this situation you mentioned can be encountered for all credit cards that use POSTED DATE (which is almost every bank i know except DBS transaction date).a suggestion is not to do your transactions last minute (last few days of the month). And  always have credit cards that do not cut off at calender month end so you always have a 'safe' card to use.,btohqsg
Does insurance spend consists part of the i.e. UOB One card minimum spend ($500) even though it does not earn Cashback bonus,btohqsg
For my household what we do is this:1. we INTENTIONALLY stagger our cards cutoff into 3 periods. 10th/20th/31st. So we always have cards to use2. we make sure we hit the required spend / caps at least 5 working days before the cutoff.3. we use Excel to track everything (one main person  and the main person has a group whatsapp to inform/update all parties).,btohqsg
No. But eligible for UOB One account bonus interest spend criteria.,btohqsg
Can’t complain to UOB like that. They reply to you n say appeal at the end of October means their service is good. At least they give you chance.I encountered with other bank  the reply is no  you are not entitled to the rewards  please ensure you fulfil the requirement few days before month end in the future.,btohqsg
Maybank also can try appeal but of course got limit lah,btohqsg
Based on T&Cs  they are not wrong. UOB One card is not an easy card to use for beginners. But at least the community here have many experienced people to guide the right wayhttps://youtu.be/41PcWeNnVWg?si=u-UkUosnU5wbVjZ1,btohqsg
Thanks for advice. Will do that..greatly appreciate😉,btohqsg
2 Oct return is likely -1.21%. So they apply to entire $20206.26  but instead of losing $0.67  you get $1.63 after offset from 4.2% guaranteed on $20k.,btohqsg
technically they do it wrongly..i read the website.. should be first $20k safe  only the excess amount above $20k subject to normal calculations.,btohqsg
Ya. That's what I understood from t&c. But losing $0.67 from $206.26 is insane. It's 118% loss.,btohqsg
trust card also by transaction date,btohqsg

maybe trying to earn interest from both banks 🙂,btohqsg

haha this sounds familar.. do too often and u know what will happen,btohqsg
yeah i always assume 10pm for weekdays  1pm for saturday. Sunday and public holiday i don't do,btohqsg
I think the best conclusion is  don't put any funds above 20 000. Even 20 000.01 is not spared.,btohqsg
That said  we are now in a falling interest rate environment  whatever rates above 4% p.a. now will not look good in the next coming months,btohqsg
yes  work for 2 years+ already (from video date),btohqsg
"I've some feedback from my ChocFin contact regarding the negative return on CF for balances above $20K  so here's what they said:""it is linked to some rebalancing work happening on the portfolio and the team is investigating it.

Again  CF is not a bank deposit account and not capital guaranteed. It is an investment portfolio  so please* assess your own risk tolerance,btohqsg

Do you have existing bank account like ocbc/UOB?,btohqsg
If ur uob not maxed and you have 500 cc spend + salary in  can jump to their current bonus interest promo. Can earn 200$ on top of usual interrst. Good for 5-6 months at least.,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  I checked if we need to go down to a physical branch to register our signature. Now I’m conflicted 🥲,btohqsg
you can trust us and the answer is YES.. you need to go down branch to register your signature.Simple: HSBC verify your signature on the form.... against what?,btohqsg
Yeah makes sense. Thanks! HAHA tyty. You guys are the experts 💯,btohqsg
Does anyone know any credit card provides golf related services? Which card is the best?Very few information on Milelion website,btohqsg
Can try Citi Prestige. Access to 6 golf courses. Can read more at website. I know Maybank VI has some benefits as well,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to confirm for favepay payment via DBS altitude card is it consider a qualifying transaction?,btohqsg
Cool  thanks! But it’s weird very few information on the website  does this mean this is not a popular benefit?,btohqsg
hi  what cards do you guys recommend for large online purchases? Other than Citi SMRT.,btohqsg
Rate drop for chocolate finance  top up programme increase from 20k to 50k,btohqsg
Cut more than fed cut 😔,btohqsg
UOB KF if mcc is in whitelist,btohqsg
Not far off  fed is 50 basis point  cf is 60 basis point loh,btohqsg
That's 3.36% for the full $50k if my math is right?,btohqsg
quite low leh.. for a Fintech that is not a bank,btohqsg
3.6 for first 20k  3.2 for subsequent 30k,btohqsg
doesn't bode well for the existing surviving bank savings accounts.. sighbut we cannot say we didn't expect it,btohqsg
Small saver can choose to keep just 20k. Will not be surprised other fintech reduced rate too. Just that cf pull the first trigger,btohqsg
Is this a new account? Yes you need to go to branch. Otherwise if this is NOT your first signature with bank then Inform your RM to come to your house to get your signature .,btohqsg
won't be long before people start complaining why never max out SSB when it was above 3%,btohqsg
Nothing to complain. Opportunity will come in many form. Just go find like what other will do in low interest enviroment,btohqsg
Yup new account! Why will the RM come down to my place though 😂 I could go down to a physical branch,btohqsg
Managed to park some small sum in ssb when it's > 3%. Should have put more.,btohqsg
10 year ssb consider too long for me. I think lots of place to put money although risker but possible return much higher in low interest environment,btohqsg
the beauty is you can sell back to government anytime at 100%..and 3% is going to be more attractive than bank savings accounts soon,btohqsg
I rmb at low time uob one was also 2 plus so if they still run saver promo might just stay par at ard 3 percent,btohqsg
Money will run to reits  stock  crytpo etc as lending will increase again when money is cheap,btohqsg
i found this that day while tidying up....,btohqsg
I got quite abit at around 3.3%. Lucky me. Haha.,btohqsg
Fed intended interest rate is 2 percent,btohqsg
this is the best one.. capped at $20k or $20.5k per human...December 2023,btohqsg
Got a few months keep fluctuate around 3.3 to 3.4 period. Just keep buying. 😜,btohqsg
no la.. 3.3% year 1 is the highest one liao.. i kept track of every single SSB in recent 2 years...,btohqsg

which uob card? dun remember one specially for supermarket mcc,btohqsg
for offline spend  uob ppv award for mobile contactless so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Ppv is usually fine cuz it's black list card. Supermarket doesn't always show up as 5411 overseas. I can think of carrefour in Taiwan 😁,btohqsg

anybody doing this? issit basically just deposit for 3mths?,btohqsg
Hi thanks. See my answer below 🙏Meet min income1st time appliedNo have any kind of loanno have any missed paymentI only have OCBC 360 account and Never allowed any one else to useNo black list from other bank alsoNo idea about credit score,btohqsg
Not fresh but foreigners working here. Maybe my nationality plays a part,btohqsg
Nah  start with DBS or Citi. OCBC will likely reject if you don’t have credit history,btohqsg
I see. I will try it. Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Do you have any savings account with any banks. I suggest try apply cc with the bank you have savings on.,btohqsg
Yes. I have OCBC 360 accounts and try applying OCBC infinity credit card and got rejected. It is my first time credit card applying in Singapore,btohqsg
When did you start working in Singapore?I presume your salary above $45 000 per year but not $30 000. Right?,btohqsg
I had a salary increase of about 20% and I applied for a credit limit increase  but the bank reduced my limit by more than 50% instead.  My credit score is AA. Until today I also don't know why they reduced my limit. I always pay in full.,btohqsg
Five years plus. Yes salary above 45000,btohqsg
Did you max ur card every month?,btohqsg
OCBC 99% will reject GX rating (no credit history). Having savings account with them doesn’t help. I got my first OCBC CC only after getting Premier status 🤭,btohqsg
Tbh I didn't know ocbc was that strict.,btohqsg
To be exact the bank reduced my limit exactly 56%,btohqsg
anyone got DP for GIRO deduction from EGA for stanchart CC ? Is it on the actual day ?,btohqsg
Oh  we are good now. Using Ocbc infinity,btohqsg

I made a booking on Agoda  and cancelled the booking. Agoda made a refund. But the refund is wrong. Whom should I contact? The bank or Agoda ? Has anyone experience this ?,btohqsg
May I know if this is charged by the bank ?,btohqsg
I will call in to try my luck for bank to waive it. But not keeping hopes high,btohqsg
Anyone's citi cc is due today but no giro deduction yesterday?,btohqsg
Nope. Very long liao. Just that yesterday's didn't deduct,btohqsg
Yes it can be linked to Apple Pay and yes  is a qualifying transaction,btohqsg
The bank probably have looked at your past (recent) applications and grant you a credit limit based on their risk matrix. Bank would never explain why we are granted such a high or low credit limit.If u really need higher credit limit  I suggest trigger the credit review process of the bank after 3 months.Personally  I ask for lower credit limit by stating what limit I want instead of letting the bank decide. The downside is I have to go through the credit review process if I need to revise up the limit,btohqsg
Thanks ! I called in to the bank. They will submit a request to waive it and get back to me by 7 working days. If bank is not willing to refund  I will call in to Agoda. But I won't keep hopes high 😂,btohqsg
How many companies you work for last 5 years?How long you have been working for your current company?,btohqsg
2 companiesCurrent company working 4 years plus,btohqsg
The difference between paid and refund could be due to exchange rate. Example: When u booked  USD/SGD was 1.33. When the refund was processed  USD/SGD was 1.31,btohqsg
Yes I thought so too. I usually like to book on Airbnb   had refunds with no problem ...first time booking with Agoda and had bad experience 😂,btohqsg
To be frank  if the hotel rates on a platform is based on foreign currency  we might get back more or less for refund. To mitigate  I would choose to Pay in Advance and ensure the rates displayed is not based on a foreign currency converted to SGD,btohqsg
"This is just a ""feature"" of booking Agoda with Mastercard. Their payment gateway for mc is in HK and you will get DCC both ways. Can't really avoid this tbh if you choose to use Agoda.",btohqsg
Can we use hsbc advance credit card to earn cash back for mcc 8062 (hospital bill or charges)?Heymax.aisays can  but not in the credit card terms condition,btohqsg
Now that you explain it it makes sense. I made a booking with Agoda a long time ago with a Visa card . Got a full refund. Going forward if I were to use a Mastercard  I will make sure not to cancel at all cost 😂,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing this helpful information! Just curious if u happen to know.. would DCC charge apply if a Visa  Amex  UnionPay or DCS card were to be used?,btohqsg
Agoda will unlikely entertain you. The fees are charged by the bank and to Agoda  they have refunded fully.,btohqsg
According to their FAQ  they will refund. I will wait for the reply from bank first before contacting Agoda. If both sides don't want to refund  then I take it as a lesson learned. Either book with a Visa card   or just simply avoid Agoda 😂,btohqsg
Not bad if they actually refunds it,btohqsg
visa also charges this fee. if you want to avoid it totally  use amex,btohqsg
thought agoda via visa no fee cos processed locally,btohqsg

Hi guys  I am quite confused with Agoda booking...I am planning to book Malaysia AgodaWill I be charged RM or SGD?what is the best card to use for cashback?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
For which cashback card to use  you can check heymax.Sgd vs myr  it depends you pay now or pay later.,btohqsg
I am going to pay now  because pay later is more expensiveSo that would be SGD or MYR?,btohqsg
From your previous post  I will be charged a dcc right? No way to avoid this?I am going to book a Malaysia hotel  pay now  and use OCBC frankIs there a better way for cashback?,btohqsg
Ocbc frank is visa card right? Then it wont get dcc cuz agoda visa payment gateway is in Singapore. Only master card kenna,btohqsg

Hi yall  isit suggested to put into MA account first or SA?bcos MA can supercharge the CPF %.but for SA  might have issues with tax relief in future   but technicallt we can turn to SRS still right ?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if i deposit 200K in ocbc  fulfil salary  $500 credit card spend  maintain $200k  I would get 2.5%+0.6%+2.4%=5.5%?,btohqsg
Most the interests are only for first 100k btw,btohqsg
Err ok. The website misleading.  So the best place to park is still uob one $150k. Any other place recommended for any amount above $150k?I see gxs 3months 3.48%. Thats probably the next best I find.,btohqsg
Ever since closure of SA at 55  both ways are fairly the same. MA first if you want to supercharge your CPF but you'll lose potential tax reliefs. SA first but to have overall more tax reliefs but like you said  can still turn to SRS for tax reliefs.,btohqsg
Website not misleading. It is very clearly stated that what bonus interest is being applied for how much.,btohqsg
Ys there is a calculator on the website too fr u to use :),btohqsg
Hi experts  does anyone know when will UOB one cc’s cashback come in? ☺️,btohqsg

Hihi  is it worth it to pay SP utility bill using UOB uni$? Or should I keep it to pay convert to travel miles.“redeem UNI$500 (S$5) for every S$10 of bill payment”,btohqsg
Are you intending to use uni$ to transfer to miles?,btohqsg
Yes!But I saw the SP bill can redeem uni$500 ($5) for every $10 bill as well. But I’m thinking if it’s worth it.Else will just transfer my Uni$ to air miles,btohqsg
500uni$ is 1000 miles then you work out it's worth it anot. For my own value of miles  it's not.,btohqsg
Maybank visa platinum still a worth it ?If after max 500 uob 500 ocbc wanna spend on Maybank visa platinum for the remaining,btohqsg
Any exclusiion I Ned to remember for Maybank Visa platinum,btohqsg
see the TnC for the exclusions,btohqsg
I would suggest you double down on UOB One instead since it has a bonus component for Mac Donalds  Grab and Dairy farm group.Once you max UOB One  maybe can try Maybank VP for the standard 3.33%.,btohqsg
When I topup YouTrip with Mastercard cc linked to HSBC EGA giro for payment  will that get me 1% cash back? 😅,btohqsg
Ya not into fast food grab,btohqsg
It’s cool. Just that one got bonus and the other don’t have. If you do $1k still same 3.33% plus incidentals at Cold Storage  Giant  BreadTalk etc sort of tips it into the UOB One for me.,btohqsg
Ya now mostly on uob one and ocbcUob one 500Ocbc over 1k sometimeBut sometime lowerSo maybe want spread outUnless theie is other card without min spending sum,btohqsg
Can I get some recommendation. What platform should I use if I want to invest in STI ETF on RSP and I want the dividends to just reinvest without any manual intervention.,btohqsg
Always spill into UOB One instead of OCBC unless 365.You can consider Amaze+CRMC for no minimum. Effective cash back is 2.27% from it or 4 miles per dollar  flexible.Amaze+CRMC better make hay while sun shines in case Citibank starts excluding Amaze as well.,btohqsg
Ya don't have Citi but hmm if less then 1k sometime I think risky on uob one,btohqsg
That why the Maybank visa $300 min sound safer,btohqsg
Actually having a general spend card with no minimums is not a bad idea rather than adopting another one with a min spend. You do give up 1.06% on it but it allows you flexibility to save more or invest if you want to 😊,btohqsg

yea to meet UOB one account’s requirement,btohqsg
Depends on ur insurance policy. What insurance did u get?,btohqsg
If you have received compensation from the airline then generally there’s no double dipping involved.The clauses may vary slightly so best to confirm with your agent or policy wording,btohqsg

Hi  I just want to put a note for those using YouTrip in Malaysia… the rate fluctuate a lot compared to to XE exchange rate or google rate and it is not weekend.,btohqsg
yes  like i mentioned in the video,btohqsg
hi all  i see a bank offering me 2.8% and up to 120k  why is this so when there's over 3% interest with FD. Does it mean i can loan and redeposit?,btohqsg
hey guys  do i still get bonus miles (for UOB lady’s) if i pay via apple pay?,btohqsg
Yeah ringgit appears to be a known problem withAmazeYouTripIn the sense the actual fx spread charged over spot rate can fluctuate greatly. Not the usual 0.3% for YouTrip. Not the usual 2.5% for amaze.I myself haven’t analysed a lot as I hardly go Malaysia but if I go Malaysia I always use Maybank family and friends for 8% cash rebate. Sure enough to cover the fx spread.,btohqsg
ive purchased travel insurance that states to cover flight delays/cancellations,btohqsg
yes understood  however the airline did not compensate for the cancellation.as such was wondering if anyone here sucessfully made a claim via their travel insurance for a cancelled flight/flight delayed above 4 hours,btohqsg
If it is loan 2.8%  actual rate EIR is 5-6%.,btohqsg
yes for MCCs under your selected category,btohqsg
Bank can offer you zero interest rate. It is real but the processing fee may cost you 5%. Some banks may defer the release of payment to you  that will cost you another $$$. Real EIR is different from advertised rate. Ie. 2.8%,btohqsg
Yes  I had viewed your video and take that. To my surprise  it was transacted at 3.18..I can’t share the screenshot yet as I had just joined into this telegram,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip  look like no choice but to apply for this Maybank credit card … else it will be Trust or GXS Debit,btohqsg
Will CPF OA use for CFPIS-OA investment will charge accrued interest?,btohqsg
For UOB PPV it calculate based on statement month or calendar month?i just read t&c few times   can’t find,btohqsg
"You can ""preview"" the exchange rates before you use your Visa/Mastercardhttps://www.mastercard.us/en-us/personal/get-support/convert-currency.htmlhttps://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.htmlYou can then make an informed decision whether to use Visa/Mastercard or just use cash",btohqsg
c) The UNI$10 awarded to you from qualifying spend on Selected Online Transactions and Mobile Contactless Transactions is comprised of a basic UNI$1 earned plus a bonus UNI$9. The total bonus UNI$ awarded to you from qualifying spend on Selected Online Transactions and Mobile Contactless Transactions is capped at UNI$2 000 for each calendar month.,btohqsg
Thanks for the pointer. I had made the assumption(at that time) that it is always more beneficial when using YouTrip in Malaysia. Didn’t bother to check again when I was there.,btohqsg
Halo  its my first time redeem SQ miles  i have enough miles to redeem 2 tickets  but i have child  can buy remaining ticket for child only? Via online need at least 1 adult. Anyone experience with this?,btohqsg
note that need min 800 monthly spend. Might as well use maybank family and friends,btohqsg
Good for those who didn’t select right categories for Maybank FnF,btohqsg
I didn’t say cannot.Some people changed recently and now need to wait the next quarter. Some people don’t have Maybank FnF.,btohqsg
May i know the Maybank family and friends credit card can add into Google pay wallet?,btohqsg
So when i using Amaze to simplygo is consider online fashion or transport category?,btohqsg
Of course Transport 😂Using it with Amaze turns it into online transaction  but not everything under Fashion. Maybank provided which MCCs for Online Fashion.,btohqsg
Bcz the Amaze is covert all the transition to online spend  so i get is under online fashion. Hahaha,btohqsg
So the amaze is covert to online spend the mcc is remains  right?,btohqsg
Ok  thanks. May i know how to get the Amaze physical card,btohqsg
May i know the cardup is under the Maybank family and friends credit card min spend for $800?,btohqsg
U can look at article wrote by mileslion on the new ocbc app update,btohqsg
redeem the adult and child ticket. buy the adult ticket. price about the same unless your child is below 2 or something. otherwise you need to call up the customer service.,btohqsg
Yes but also depend on insurer. Maybe need airline to give u letter to backup your claim,btohqsg
You can search from referral codeshttps://t.me/sgpromocode. Open an amaze account online then you can apply for the physical card,btohqsg
Ok got it  thanks. Btw if i redeem with miles  will i able to select seat immediately? Otherwise i need to wait for the other adult ticket purchase,btohqsg
If it is not waitlist flight u can choose seat after u done booking,btohqsg
Hello.. can I ask for those who owned a car  which insurer is recommended? For first time car owner 😬,btohqsg
UserDrhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:not the right place,btohqsg
Hey guys for UOB can convert to Qatar Avois points?,btohqsg
As I said  depends on ur policy. Like mine from fwd only compensates if delay is more than 6h.,btohqsg
Ok  im also not familiar with waitlist flight. I will find out more  thanks for reply,btohqsg
Hi Guru  anyone knows OCBC Titanium rewards CC  OCBC$ reward based on transaction date or posting date?I got OCBC$600 rewards for $600 spending on 29th Sep as shown on my app but my posting date for spending is 1 Oct.2nd Oct  I spent another $500 and got 500 rewards. In total this month  I spent $1100 according to posting date but I’m not sure rewards OCBC$ 600 counted Sep or Oct.If rewards OCBC$600 counted as on Sep then I can continue to spend additional $600 this month as maximum spending is $1110 for maximum bonus.,btohqsg
Ok then I stop spending for this month. Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi all - if im purchasing iphone from APple store under installment plan  is it considered as online txn if i pay using DBS women card or CRMC?,btohqsg
29th is too close to month end  25th Is saver if you also have ocbc 360 account spent,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone expert with DBS Visa altitude? They claim that points are awarded in blocks of $5  but it’s not clear if this is happening on your entire aggregated transactions total per month or each single transactions. For example  if I do 5 transactions of $4 each in a calendar month  am I getting 0 miles or XYZ miles based on a $20 card expense? Thanks in advance for the advise!,btohqsg
I’ve no worries of spending OCBC 360 bonus account spending as I already spent $500 on 13 Sep and was hoping to get 29th Sep $600 under Sep spending so that I can spend additional $600 for Oct but too bad I can’t thus I’ve to switch to other card instead.,btohqsg
Dbs is doing their 5$ block a bit different. They divide ur amount by 5 then multiply by 3.25 then round down. Effectively min transaction amount is 1.55 for sgd. calc is done for individual transaction.,btohqsg
Just reminder for peeps using dbs altitude to register oct 5mpd challenge,btohqsg
Hotel booking in foreign currency  any suggestions?,btohqsg
Hi  bros. Just asking  if I pay using amaze at counter at fast food  does it counts as online? I linked to citibank rewards cc.,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc  uob lady travel  etc,btohqsg
Oh but i thot there is about 3% of fx fee?,btohqsg
If pay at the hotel which card is better?,btohqsg
Thks for replying. On what transactions don't count as online.  Sorry I bit lack of knowledge.,btohqsg
Can I take all transactions paying via amaze linked to rewards cc is online?,btohqsg
Depends on amount. Uob lady travel. Above 1k can use uob visa signature.,btohqsg
Again trust cashback card is an option.,btohqsg
Haiz  i paid for dive course in myr with amaze + crmc and it turned out 4722. Should have used naked UOB lady instead. Too occupied to test mcc first.,btohqsg
all is online. Get 10x points so long mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Is there any dress code for SATS lounge?,btohqsg
Nope. dont even think TPR got dress code ..,btohqsg
anybody managed to waive off T1 first Annual Fee ?,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I saw smart casual was specified in the PP app so was a bit concerned,btohqsg
Hi guys  could anyone recommend a daily-use card? my monthly expenses is usually $800-$1000 and most spending is on F&B (bars and restaurants).Should i be looking at miles or cashback?,btohqsg
It depends on which do you value more. Your spend seems to be more targeted at offline spend since it’s F&B.,btohqsg
yes  i have almost no online spend. Hardly do food delivery and little spend on groceries.Could you recommend a good daily cashback & miles card then i can do a comparison?,btohqsg
I wouldnt suggest miles card unless you are really dedicated to the game. Maybank family and friend seems to be something relevant for you. 8% cashback in selected categories with min 800 spend.,btohqsg
hmmm  i dont mind jumping in but really dont know where to start. Regarding the Maybank F&F  i notice the category MCC 5814 is for fast food and not restaurants?,btohqsg
uob lady card dining category for 4mpd+2mpd on uob lady account if keep 10k balance,btohqsg
yea but dining only cap for 312.5 spend,btohqsg
oh you mean these categories are newly added? i thought they were the exisitng ones,btohqsg
Can consider citi cashback card for spending on dining,btohqsg
the normal cashback and not the + right?,btohqsg
yea but dun include mcc 5813,btohqsg
At this point  crmc + amaze seems good haha. Can decide to redeem cashback or transfer as miles later.,btohqsg
Unless he can get uob lady solitaire on entertainment and dining then he can get miles on both cat. But cashback wise i think this is one of the better one,btohqsg
oh.... if i earn below $120k can i still get solitaire?,btohqsg
Just try apply nobody know. But if u only can get uob lady then back to square 1 also. Personally i go for cashback then miles,btohqsg
i was thinking of big spending (>$200) going to miles and the daily and smaller spending stuff going to cashback,btohqsg
i arleady have a DBS altitude but the local spend MPD is super low,btohqsg
hi all  made a payment using ipaymy yesterday. Current status is in progress but scheduled for the 9th oct. possible to cancel the transfer? Couldn’t find the option,btohqsg
There is a few consideration when u want to go into miles game. So let just say citireward with amaze  u get 4mpd for both your dining and bar spend as it is not travel related. Based on fully spending 1k every month. U will get max 40k miles per year.,btohqsg
sounds like a good plan - my wife has the option of paying for company meals and claiming later on. hitting >$1k would not be an issue,btohqsg
Second part is that miles can get devaluated by airlines and there is expiry after conversion,btohqsg
Third is we dont know how long amaze plus citi reward combo can last,btohqsg
You can get 10mpd with lady soli provided put 100k in lady acc savings and make sure u hit 2k spend per month. 240k miles per year 😘,btohqsg
The opportunity loss in interest is just not worth it. Unless bank interest rate goes back to under 1 percent. I believe chris have a video on it?,btohqsg
Hi guys  regarding the UOB lady's Card  Uni$ are awarded in blocks of $5  if I do 5 transactions of $4 each in a calendar month  am I getting 0 miles or X miles based on a $20 card expense? Thanks! Also  can I add lady's card into Google pay?,btohqsg
Uob lady bonus point is based on total spend per month but base point have to be in 5 dollar block,btohqsg
Sorry I'm a bit dumb  can you give an example? 🙏🙇🏻‍♂,btohqsg
Based point is 1x  bonus point is 9x. So let say u spend 4 dollar 5 time u dont get 20x1 but instead u get 20x9 ÷5,btohqsg
I see  but if I spend $5  5 times I get 20x10?,btohqsg
If u spend 5time then is total 25 dollar u get 25x10. But rmb to divide by 5 coz uob is in 5 dollar block. In term of 25 spend based on 4 mpd u get 100 miles which is 50 uni dollar,btohqsg
Everything take out one “0” then maybe I can afford,btohqsg
bars is counted in entertainment category. so $312.50 for dining and entertainment each,btohqsg
Evening  anybody expert with UOB one account + UOB Save up Cash in ProMotion.. is the reward from UOB Save up Cash on top of the usual one account benefit (after credit salary and meeting $500 per month spending)?  UOB save up cash in promotion - need to set aside the amount for 5 months,btohqsg
Is there a list of Categories I can refer to?,btohqsg
No dress code  fyi Sats lounge is not considered as luxury,btohqsg
Thanks  I think so too. Looks like they act like luxury lounge,btohqsg
And their shower facility looks like the one at public sport arena 😀,btohqsg
Hi all wanted to ask for DBS altitude if i use it to pay at an overseas hotel via foreign currency  is it still eligible for the oct 5mpd promo?,btohqsg
hi  wanted to ask if dbs yuu card earns bonus points on guardian medicine purchases?,btohqsg
October one needs to be online I think,btohqsg
Oops i missed that out   thanks!,btohqsg
It should cuz the kiosk will charge same mcc regardless of buying med or some drinks,btohqsg
I have question abt dbs yuu and singtel telco bill. I know we can earn bonus if made payment via self-kiosk but what if i make payment via singtel app?,btohqsg
Thanks for the reminder. I need to book flight and hotel by month end 😂,btohqsg
hmm ok  thanks! i was wondering bc yuu card is able to check line item of a transaction rather than mcc itself.. so they r able to exclude certain purchases from one transaction,btohqsg
Any recommendations on which card to use for bft membership fee,btohqsg
Where u read that? I doubt it cuz its as per transaction mcc. Good question though,btohqsg
Oh my! You're right. You can check it out at their T&C. Its under Guardians: exclusion (applicable to 1x yuu point). But it doesn't mention medicine but infant formula are exclusions.,btohqsg
Quite risky. Unless u know mcc for sure.I thought my club membership was sports but it wasn’t… lucky I tested with amaze empty wallet first.,btohqsg
I personally charge BFT and got the 8% monthly,btohqsg
Oh this is weird. Thought club m’ship would qualify..,btohqsg
If the club sets up its payment terminal properly.,btohqsg
Seeking advice - just signed up for the trust cashback card to use for overseas spend  as follows:1st month (Nov 24) select irrelevant category as preferred (eg wellness) & spend $10k overseas (from unselected categories)2nd month: spend $500 locally3rd month: spend $500 locallyWill i get the 1.5% cash back on the $10k from the 1st month?Thanks!,btohqsg
thanks for this! just had the time to read through the whole doc. Not sure if i will be able to consistently hit the $800 and split it among all the other categories to secure the cashback...,btohqsg
Hi gurus! I’m a Malaysian working in Sg and exploring some travel credit cards. I’ve been watching a number of YouTube videos and exploring the cards available on the market. Wondering if HSBC travel one is the best for me if I’m a frequent flyer between Malaysia and Singapore (and also to other countries) for about once every 2 weeks? My expenses in Sg are mainly food at hawker stores and grocery only and hence I’m not sure how much mile I can collect from them.Would like to hear from anyone who’s more experience than me in this! Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
how much do you spend on groceries a month?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc or uob lady would earn better miles.,btohqsg
Probably around 1k max only actually - my rental is another 1.3k but I usually just do direct transfer,btohqsg
yes so long not excluded and you are new to Trust,btohqsg
thanks! e.g. let's say i buy bags/shoes overseas - got no cap to the 1.5% right?,btohqsg
🙏🏼to confirm  the prereqs are:-no cap 1.5% only applies to the non preferred categories-must spend min $500 per month for 3 consecutive months,btohqsg
once u pay they auto minus off ur outstanding balance once transaction posted  for preferred categories  they hold the cashback until end of the quarter  so for 3 consecutive mths : 500$ - 5%   1k - 10%   2k - 15% cb,btohqsg
ill recommend dining 🤣 went to a few bars/pubs thinking entertainment but all tagged as dining 😱,btohqsg
how do you check the MCC code in advance?i think its the other way too that quite alot of restaurants are actually coded as bars and pubs too right?>,btohqsg
for overseas spend  will it also be categorized by mcc?,btohqsg
i used heymax to check 😅 eg. Club Rich was entertainment in heymax but when paid MCC was dining so only got 1%. Had a few encounters in JB eg Uncle don different outlets different MCC  austin was entertainment but pelangi branch was dining so a little confusing...,btohqsg
Heymax not accurate. Best to use Amaze empty wallet.,btohqsg
yep its categorised by MCC as well  based on experience a more well-rounded option is dining 🙏🏻,btohqsg
does revolut work tht way too?,btohqsg
New to money smart  is applying for credit card the only way to get smart points without buying the smart points directly?,btohqsg
If I’m buying a MacBook… would u recommend using citi rewards or UOB one 🙂. Citi rewards right?,btohqsg
Citi rewards is capped at 1k spendWhile uob one is not suitable for big ticket item,btohqsg
Try to look up for Chris  big ticket item video about him talking about the best card to spend for big ticket item,btohqsg
Does it make a difference if I use UOB one card when I buy the Apple product on Shopee.. for that extra 5% cashback,btohqsg
Uob one gets 10% cashback at Shopee.,btohqsg
Do note of the tier cap for the additional cashback.,btohqsg
If you're pass month statement is over 2k  then it's worth using one card to pay since you're getting 6.67% Cashback. Which is quite high,btohqsg
If you're using uob one  you need to see your pass month statement. Since there a tier of either 500  1k or 2k,btohqsg
Ahhh got it! Many thanks all ❤️,btohqsg
https://singsaver.link/TG-apple-iphone-16-launchIf you want  you can follow this post.I know that is about iphone 16 but it's the a big ticket item,btohqsg
Hi if u pair ur card with amaze n spend   do it counts as the “minimum spend” requirement for the gift for new sign up??,btohqsg
If referring to CRMC paired with Amaze - Yes  on the basis that MCC not excluded,btohqsg
count as min spend provided mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Saw the TnC  should be ok  provided MCC not excluded,btohqsg
Ok thanks!! Quite new to this but if spend in jb also considered? If MCC included ones,btohqsg
think you should aim to get 8% rebate which require 800 min spend in a month1) if mcc falls under one of your selected categories and within S$312.50 spend for the category  use Amaze2) otherwise use the card direct at jb in myr,btohqsg
Ahh alright  im concerned about the 1.3k minimum spend now. If i spend in JB using myr will it be counted in 1.3??,btohqsg
Yes should be  counted in the equivalent S$ amt ofc,btohqsg
hi  does anyone know if its a qualifying transaction for citi smrt card if i made a payment at fairprice through apple pay?,btohqsg
Need to check tnc  but if thought fair price  should be qualified,btohqsg
Good morning everyone  (probably discussed before) just wanna get a feel of what everyone is doing and which platform are you using.I’m down to moomoo vs ibkr- like the ui of moomoo better- fx spread of ibkr better  moomoo fx spread is shit- on ibkr can set up recurring payment to negate the 2usd exchange fees but moomoo has no exchange fees- moomoo deposit and withdrawal almost instant  ibkr for reason takes a long time and ibkr only allow 1 free withdrawal per monthQuestions to everyone1. Which platform are you using moomoo or ibkr?2. Is it worth it to put up with ibkr just for its favourable fx spread and its ability to buy Ireland domicile ETFs?3. Are you guys buying Ireland domicile ETFs of just heck  buy US domicile ones (as moomoo only offers that. (Not the worse idea as us domicile etf has better volume bid ask though got 30% dwt!),btohqsg
Is there anyway to use all yuu points in one shot? Or what's the fastest way to clear all yuu points ?,btohqsg
How long it takes to convert to Kris flyer miles ?,btohqsg
Or can it convert to Kris pay miles ?,btohqsg
Convert KF miles first then convert KF miles to krispay miles. But value is bad imo.,btohqsg
Ok already done ! It's really instant ! Thanks guys 😀Yes and the value is super bad . About 70% lesser from yuu value to Kris pay miles value,btohqsg
I wanna cancel the Yuu card for personal reasons . So wanna quickly clear all the points,btohqsg
if canceling Citi credit card beside not to touch the annual fees given’s 10k miles  does anyone know is I should not touch the annual relationship bonus miles too?,btohqsg
What is touch annual fee? Cancel or not cancel that card?,btohqsg
Citi credit card gave 10k miles for renewal but also the annual relationship additional miles…,btohqsg
Any DBS treasures/ WMA users here can confirm if there is maximum limit on the number for SGD fixed deposits I can have in my account? I believe treasures allows multiple FDs of $19 999 (12 month tenure at 3.2%) wondering if there is a cap to it?,btohqsg
Hi  I just watched Chris's latest video on multi currency card. Trust  GXS have only 0.09% mark up fee on foreign exchange. But in reality the bank charges additional 3% fees for foreign transaction right?,btohqsg
Trust and GXS are already the banks. No additional fees,btohqsg
I see .. but the relationship years to me is not that important focusing on 4mpd is the key. As for 10k miles is your miles valuation more than 2cpm?,btohqsg
I've already got $19 999 x5 in my WMA   was thinking of adding more. the limit is def over 2 just not sure how much,btohqsg
the relationship years for Citi can be decent for Prestige Card if you whack Payall.I just whacked one cycle for Payall and I got over $100+ value of Relationship year bonus,btohqsg
27 062 points / 2.5 = 10825 miles x 1.5 cents = $162 value (goes towards offsetting the $545 annual fee).,btohqsg
Of course this is for LAST YEAR  since Citi Payall had decent promo pricing so it made sense to whack it.25 000 renewal miles10 825 relationship bonus milesTotal = 35 825 miles x 1.5 cents = $537 (already can cover the $545 annual fee). And we all know Prestige has other perks of good value like limo  unlimited priority pass  4NF.Must see Q4 2024 Citi Payall pricing  if it is lousy  then the allure of Citi Prestige will go down also.,btohqsg
chocolate finance reducing interest from 4.2 to 3.6 starting 1st nov,btohqsg
The $162 is amount spend ?,btohqsg
Personally I go for universal 2% cashback for category I cannot earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
u know i am talking about Citi Payall right? which you can use to pay things that usually earns no rewards.,btohqsg
Yes that’s why I’m thinking how is it considered as offset the annual fees?,btohqsg
It ok leave it this way,btohqsg
Can UOB PPV or UOB Signature ViSa be used for petrol spending?,btohqsg
Somebody mentioned this in chat history before. Can do a search.,btohqsg
looks more like a loss of $383 and oppprtunity cost of using other cards with higher earn rate,btohqsg
citi payall fees is high and the promo is bad,btohqsg
can use say uob prvi/dbs vantage for cardup/ipaymy instead?,btohqsg
dun see how to justify the annual fee,btohqsg
Can i use instarem amaze card in Jb ???,btohqsg
Can use anywhere in this world.,btohqsg
you have to work out the rates... the previous payall promo was about 1.2 cents per mile if you include the $80 grab voucher.,btohqsg
citi prestige is already one of the easiest cards to justify its $545 annual fee already because of the 25k renewal miles which at 1.5 cents per mile valuation is already worth $375.You just have to figure out how to extract another $170 of value from all its other features.Suggestions:1. relationship bonus miles2. unlimited priority pass3. 4NF4. limo after spending5. payall promo,btohqsg
For 4NF  can this be 3 star hotel? And payall count for limo spending? Assume that you have this card,btohqsg
1. yes 4NF can be any hotel as long as it meets 4NF tnc.2. OF COURSE  payall with fee counts towards the $12k required limo spending.glad to see you are asking all the right questions!,btohqsg
I will just drop one more tip:I DO NOT use Citi Prestige for any normal spending at all.I ONLY use Citi Prestige for:1. Citi FX Spend Promos2. Citi Payall (during promos)3. 4NF hotel bookings4. OTA Citi promo codes,btohqsg
My relationship bonus is like very little  how I get to much lol,btohqsg
> 10 years + citi payall,btohqsg
Hmm but the percentage is same for me 15%,btohqsg
then the relationship bonus would be determined by your payall amount,btohqsg

Yuu card limits at $600 so it is also not the best if you need more. Charge it into UOB One if you can use it to maintain quarterly spending.Otherwise use existing cards which reward grocery purchases. Citi Cash Back  MayBank Family and Friends ($312).UOB Ladies card with Family selected also works for $1k.,btohqsg
