Hi Guys  this message is a long but I really need help!Firstly  don't feel sad for me as I have accepted the news of my stage 4 cancer weeks ago.Received my critical illness payout of 250k and wanted to put it in somewhere that I can have more money in next 6 months (the life span I have if treatment failed)I went to UOB and wanted to open and enjoy the 5% but the advisor highlighted if I am not around then my 18 years old son cannot enjoy the 5% because there will be no more 1.6k  salary contributionsAny good recommendations please.Thank you,btohqsg
Wah very sorry to hear  all the best  i hope it works out for you.,btohqsg
Anyone has posb everyday card referral links ?,btohqsg
Think need to make sure wills etc is OK. If stay hdb. Need to put hdb nomination.And overseas like US stocks and assets is sold. As they charge inhertance tax of more than 40% and above.,btohqsg
Thank you. Hope so too.Will stay strong to fight üí™,btohqsg
Arranging for will and all. ThanksJust wanted to leave more behind,btohqsg
The priority is to live the best life in the remaining time. I wouldn't recommend UOB One 5% too since it needs some management that an 18 y/o may not understand. If you just want a safe place backed by government  SSB/T-bills are the ways to goMake sure you do the CPF nomination and LPA as well (separate from will),btohqsg
if u want higher return next 6 moths  and flexibility to withdraw  look at money market funds,btohqsg
to add on to chris. make sure u also done up a will. Moneyowl lets u do it for free,btohqsg
A person may need to buy maximum $100k of insurance(if the person is still allowed to buy)  this allows the fund can be disbursed to beneficiaries immediately if have will.Once a person pass away  all money/bank accounts n assets will be locked/freezed until the letter of administration/grant of probate is obtained. During this period  the dependents need to use their own saving to pay for any expenses.If can‚Äôt buy insurance  may need to have a separate arrangement  not sure bank joint account will help.You may need to consult lawyer who is specialised on this.The idea is the dependents can still have access to fund to pay for any expenses.,btohqsg
.... She already have cancer....cannot buy insurance already..... Not sure u write this for what.....,btohqsg
Read the last sentence. All money/fund will be freezed. Dependents will need to use own saving.,btohqsg
Then write so long for what. üòê,btohqsg
Just transfer some money to u son or someone that u trust for ÁîüÂêé‰∫ã expenses.Hope you will be cure and nothing happen.,btohqsg
Yes. Am looking at this and sfye and endowus alternative to uob,btohqsg
Ok. Will go and take a look at moneyowlThanks,btohqsg
Will still ask around on this.Thanks,btohqsg
Many thanks for all info and your well wishesThis part is Important too.Too many things now as too sudden for a 52 y/o so a but lost.,btohqsg
