Yet BIE grads were mostly jobless,btohqsg
U can say the same for life science too,btohqsg
I think last time got a short bangwagon for accountancy degree too,btohqsg
is this the same dude as the nus confession page,btohqsg
He wrote this to debate against the ntu prof view,btohqsg
dun scare mr milo he's going to study accountancy,btohqsg
If i start caring about people i wont be able to say anyth,btohqsg
scallywag indeed the way i know u,btohqsg
anyone familiar with how UK A level works? Because I just want to ask whether As level is the same as H1 in SG,btohqsg
if u are taking it for admission to local unis  u prob need to score A*/Asfor all/almost all subjects on ur cert,btohqsg
They are usually easier than sg a level,btohqsg
because the uni im looking into now says they do not accept any AS subjects  and im wondering if that's the same level as h1,btohqsg
google searches have not been proven useful,btohqsg
Eh I heard my friends say must take all the A2s,btohqsg
oh if i'm not mistaken UK unis don't rly look at h1 subjects! so they'll take ur h2 grades only,btohqsg
np and all the best :^,btohqsg
I think they call it AO subjects for H1,btohqsg
oh nvm they call it AS subjects,btohqsg
Ah where does AS fit in all this HAHAH,btohqsg
There are like 5 different exam providers in UK?,btohqsg
I think each have a slightly different system,btohqsg
Alright so much for looking into UK unis HAHHAA,btohqsg
Sg uni also tough  overseas uni also tough omg imma just sign up hdb and sweep roads,btohqsg
rhetorically with a decent amount of effort  what’s the probability of scoring a 6 for O’s ?,btohqsg
No idea how much is decent,btohqsg
Decent amount of effort can give you 7 or 8,btohqsg
My brain cant process the use of the word rhetoric there,btohqsg
The probability depends on more things than effort,btohqsg
to what extent does one have to work to achieve a 6,btohqsg
Ya I also can’t understand why use the word rhetorical,btohqsg
tbh don't think too much bah,btohqsg
If I tell you high chance/low chance,btohqsg
To get 6 points  the main issue that you will face is scoring an A1 for english,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s based purely on effort alone,btohqsg
That also depends on the person,btohqsg
Also depends on luck and ur cohort?,btohqsg
To add on  hardwork does not guarentee you success,btohqsg
Anyway what do you need 6 points for,btohqsg
Same reason why one would want a million dollars I suppose,btohqsg
If you work hard but careless on the day of exam  your efforts will be in vain,btohqsg
Good ability  exam taking skills   effort  or a dumb cohort,btohqsg
Dumb cohort is nearly impossible  there is St nick  catholic high  nan chiau and other powerhouse.To add on  grade boundary is not dependant on others performance,btohqsg
honestly i’m not concerned with the probability of all factors you guys have considered because it’s purely based on luck. rather  i’d like to see what extent i’d have to go with what i CAN control.,btohqsg
I’d say work as hard as u can,btohqsg
U can’t work more hard than u can right,btohqsg
But it's just my personal opinion that 6 points isn't necessary,btohqsg
i get that i am to work hard  but what is ‘hard enough’ ?,btohqsg
I can only read first para,btohqsg
Enough is subjective  that is for you to find out.,btohqsg
If you’re asking for specific numbers like how long to study or stuff like that  we can’t really answer you because it’s up to you,btohqsg
