‚úàÔ∏èPika World Update 14 Dec 2021‚úàÔ∏èThe equity market tumbled on Monday as leading central banks are scheduled to hold meetings to discuss the prospect of monetary tightening soon. Without the Fed's support  the fear of future trading unnerve investors accustomed to a great stimulus feeding the market.‚åõÔ∏èMarkets ExpectationüïπThere is a general sentiment among investors that the Fed will lay out plans to remove its bond-buying program faster  which could lead to the path of an early interest rate hike. A combo that isn't helping equity valuation.Some economists are expecting 2 rate hikes in 2022. With the Fed pumping less money into the financial markets  there tend to be less liquidity bidding for riskier assets. Likewise  as we expect slower growth in 2022  the duo combo tends to put the market on edge.üß®Tech Stocks bear the blunt‚õΩÔ∏èAs discussed  technology stocks tend to see their future profit in present terms diminishes in value are likely to be hit the hardest. Smaller cap growth stocks face the same fate since many aren't profitable in the first place.üéâTreasury: Safe Haven  for nowüíµInvestors who are seeking safety will shift to purchasing Treasury bonds. So we can see the 10-year Treasury yield fell. The environment also favours the more defensive sector  which is less economically sensitive  such as the utility sector (XLU  ETF) and Consumer Staples (VDC  ETF).With about 20 central banks meeting this week  it is clear the volatility is on the rise and that the impact of Omicron on the background unsettle most investors.We hope you enjoy this read.

üçéApple Shining Againüî¶JP Morgan had raised its target for Apple for 2022 to $210  which is a climb from $180. It helps push the tech company towards a $3 trillion market capitalization. As we had talked about often  the services revenue for Apple is robust  and iPhone 13 appears to have decent sales.üì±Budget 5G PhoneüóùThere is a growing expectation that Apple will also launch an affordable 5G iPhone for its SE model that can help to motivate a large group of people to upgrade to the new model and potentially attract Android users. It is expected to be released sometime in the first half of 2022.Indeed  the product cycle will give Apple a good edge as the SE model helps capture the mid to low end market segment  which is currently almost untapped. The opportunity is enormous as analysts expect Apple to sell 30 million sets of iPhone SE model during next year launch  bringing home around $10 billion in revenue.With an AR headset a possibility in 2022  there is a lot baked into the stock and market participants are giving the blessing for Apple to keep rocketing ahead!We hope you enjoy this read!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

ü™ÑPika World Data Checkü©∫At 9.30 pm  we will receive the US Producer Price Index (PPI) for the month-to-month result. It will be crucial information for us to understand the depth of the inflation roaring into the market.üçπWhat is PPI?ü•ÇThe PPI is a metric that measures the degree of a change in the price of goods that a manufacturer sells.üí°Why is it so important?üî¶Pika World sees this as a leading indicator compared to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).Essentially  PPI accounts for a large portion of the overall inflation in an economy. Think about this. When PPI is high  retailers tend to pass on some increases through the prices of their products to consumers.Hence  this fuels price inflation for consumers. As such  PPI is seen as an essential piece of data to get a sense of the underlying inflation pressure looming in the economy.üéâThe ExpectationüèãWe are looking at the PPI for the month to month to moderate to 0.5% from 0.6% in the prior period. Any reading above the estimate suggests a continuous heating price pressure in the economy.We hope you enjoy this read! If you find it useful  do share it with your friends  as it helps us reach out to a larger audience.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

üíéPika World On the GoüíéüçèA fearful Day for NasdaqüçéTech stocks tumbled on Tuesday again as the hot inflation PPI data re-ignite the true fear of inflation  almost handling a confirmation for the Fed to taper faster. Investors are not seeing any signs of inflation cooling  which is a concern. After all  PPI is a leading indicator  as we had discussed.üèÄWe are Readyüí∞Investors appear to be preparing for the day when the Fed announces a faster taper pace. The question is perhaps the degree of acceleration. In addition  it will imply whether the central bank will also ramp up interest rates in 2022.It will be a volatile trading day  and we are keeping things on a light note with only selective accumulation as we prepare the FOMC announcement.We hope you enjoy this quick read.
