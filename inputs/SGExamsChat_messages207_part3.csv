I finish like 15 minutes earlier,btohqsg
Hmm but if it‚Äôs +1 charge has to be group 1 which is more reactive than iron,btohqsg
Lol then I 2 wrong for the paper,btohqsg
its not even grp 1 lol,btohqsg
But didn‚Äôt it say XCl with no other chloride of X exist,btohqsg

the fact that its found as an element uncombined implies that it is very close to the bottom of the reactivity series,btohqsg
Oh nvm so I realise it could be Simple molecular structure,btohqsg
grp 1 metals are very reactive  so is impossible to find them uncombined in their elemental state in nature,btohqsg
just that is not very reactive,btohqsg
Eh then what kind of metal u think it is?,btohqsg
Hi can I check does anyone know where to donate used TYS?,btohqsg
Oh so it‚Äôs those sort of transition metal with so called no transition metal properties?,btohqsg
Like doesn‚Äôt have variable oxidation state or coloured compound,btohqsg
That qn answer is D right?,btohqsg
the unknown metal X is probably silver,btohqsg
based on the unknown molecular formula given,btohqsg
so that means to say  statement 1 should be correct too,btohqsg
Lol if like that I got 3 wrong,btohqsg
3 is considered very good alr,btohqsg
the avg student prob gets 6-7 wrong,btohqsg
But I guess I‚Äôll probably drop to A2,btohqsg
i disagree with their answer on that,btohqsg
its alr proven some tuition centres dont give 100% correct ans,btohqsg
wah the first qn i put d at first then change to c,btohqsg
and the rationale was explained why,btohqsg
if u all take a lvl chem next time  you all will know why,btohqsg
u all will hear the same thing from your teachers,btohqsg
for next 2 yrs in prac,btohqsg
How come tuition centre got the qn paper?,btohqsg
My classmate threw the qn paper in the dustbin on his way out üíÄ,btohqsg
If u think of it  like the written papers or and listening comprehension  I tot after the exam the invigilators will collect the papers and how to remb the papers?,btohqsg
Some teachers secretly scan and leak,btohqsg
My geog teacher said by right they‚Äôre not allowed to do that,btohqsg
So must be the invigilator or CPE leak,btohqsg
aiyo no need so scared one la,btohqsg
So far I haven‚Äôt found a leake copy of the pure physics paper,btohqsg
%A is ard 45-50% As for pure chem,btohqsg
I estimate I only got like 80% (or maybe 78% if they mark strict) overall tho,btohqsg
Ohh do you mind sending here,btohqsg
But I'll pm if u want,btohqsg
If I get A2 for both physics and chem I‚Äôll hate myself a lot,btohqsg
u can redeem urself at a levels,btohqsg
i got 13 o lvl chem mcq qns wrong,btohqsg
i redeemed myself at a lvl chem mcq paper,btohqsg
I would‚Äôve dropped to combined scuence and guarantee A1,btohqsg
Cos it‚Äôll be useless in L1R5,btohqsg
i screwed my humans so most prob cant get to jc,btohqsg
Yeah some people flunk their Os then A level get straight As,btohqsg
and just focused on pure geog,btohqsg
