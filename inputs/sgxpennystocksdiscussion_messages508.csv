My toilet light keep blinking. Got a handy man  came first time adjusted the switch. After a few months blink again  he changed a component. After a few months blinked again  he changed the whole light. Now blinking again,btohqsg
Every 1 or 2 months get him back. Maybe he doesn't know the problem  just anyhow change something  then I pay and pay,btohqsg
Cos your switch and light already change .. so only left wire issues only,btohqsg
Switch didn't change  he adjusted something  only change light. Maybe get him back to change the switch,btohqsg
But light blinking usually is light problem leh,btohqsg
The BA la for problem if not wrong,btohqsg
Show me your led light ?,btohqsg
BA la is a starter for the light .. it connect to the wire and the light,btohqsg
Take a photo show me see,btohqsg
Must be the starter for problem,btohqsg
Mine too have this issue before,btohqsg
This second visit he changed the BA,btohqsg
A couple of months  he came back changed the whole light,btohqsg
Just changed the whole light less than a month,btohqsg
Last time those old lights better  spoilt just change the tube  easier,btohqsg
This is your light model right ?,btohqsg
The old want no more Liao . Seldom have,btohqsg
I don't know which model  he got some with him  so just changed for me,btohqsg
I see the photo is same ..,btohqsg
U take a video see .. I see how the blinking like ?,btohqsg
The photo is another light. The toilet now dark  I can't take photo,btohqsg
Switch is off  it keeps blinking,btohqsg
Is the starter or light spoil,btohqsg
Alamak  just changed less than a month,btohqsg
U sure he buy new want to change for you ?,btohqsg
This kind of light left than 20 dollars or maybe less than 10 dollars .. depend on the size,btohqsg
Yes I change myself .. 😂😂 I buy online and change myself,btohqsg
You so clever ah? I thought you only know how to use scissors,btohqsg
How to use old ones. If old ones spoilt already  install I will know,btohqsg
I know how to change all the led light too .. my shop and my house all the light I change my self,btohqsg
My house all this led light,btohqsg
My living room also this type,btohqsg
Go you tube learn can Liao .. 😂😂 I know to service aircon too 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Did u off the main power supply when u change the light?,btohqsg
No need to off main supply,btohqsg
Cos only take out 2 part of wire only .. so not dangerous .,btohqsg
I saw the man just change without off power supply  i also scared,btohqsg
Ya lar .. no need to off want,btohqsg
I also never off .. cos never touch the main wire .. so no issues,btohqsg
So if light just changed  maybe is switch spoilt?,btohqsg
But . From my experience .. I can say it light spoil from the video you send me see,btohqsg
No problems . This is a small issue only ..,btohqsg
Means he gave me a light spoilt one 😡,btohqsg
Maybe .. cos usually led light quite long lasting want ..,btohqsg
It either the starter spoil or the light ..,btohqsg
Yes  I moved here changed all the lights  so far this is the only light that always give problem,btohqsg
Cos when you purchase the light.. it come with the starter,btohqsg
Or maybe I didn't see  he put back an old starter,btohqsg
I don think is the switch problem .. base on my experience .. 😂,btohqsg
Perhaps .. cos usually it a tactic to earn more Money 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Then better don't use his service already,btohqsg
Some of them it like that want 😂😂,btohqsg
He took my old light away  also he changed for me about 1 year ago,btohqsg
Usually can last more than 3 to 4 year for led light,btohqsg
My neighbour recommended him to me. She said the light he changed for her also very fast spoilt,btohqsg

Digged more into Moya Asia. ($0.068/$0.069)Needed to be convinced that this investment is right.1) The shareholding float is as such:- 13% (Gateway Fund - Private Equity firm)- 14% (Public)- 73% (Tamaris which is owned by the Indonesian Billionaire Salim group)2) Cost of SSH-Salim group investment cost per share should be in the $0.06x to $0.08x-Gateway Fund cost per share is approx $0.10x as they first spent $31.46 mil to buy over shares from the founders at $0.110 before subscribing to a 2-1 rights issue at $0.095 in 2018.3)RHB gave a price target 🎯 of $0.150 back in 2018.In summary  Moya Asia has huge growth potential.The fact that Gateway Fund (Smart money) has investment in Moya Asia shows they understand the potential in this one  hence they are willing to invest about $40m in them at approx. $0.10x.For me  follow the smart will hardly be wrong. Furthermore  at current price $0.068  it is 2/3 of Gateway costs.This counter easily 50% gain when in play. For Investment. DYODD,btohqsg
I’m painfully holding this too.. ha ha,btohqsg
Will only re-rate when there is more clarification on Jakarta concessions.,btohqsg
👍 actually Moya price action is decent. Looks more like a flush to me. Tomorrow T+4 should be good time to collect.I believe 67/68 will hold for this flushing.However if 65/66 does breaks down  need caution ⛔️ might go to rest and good to SL first,btohqsg
Yes  65/66 should hold....but this counter very tight range for long period. Only 1 cts range.,btohqsg
Yea the range hard to play man. Once break out with volume   this one ☝️ like rubber band.There’s plenty of prior accumulation already by MM.Now  perhaps waiting for a catalyst announcement to run it,btohqsg
Moya Asia  by next year should be trading over $0.1x . My view.,btohqsg

What I understood is  there will be no privatisation of concession as it has been challenged in courts before. It is illegal based on Indonesia constitution.However  I think Moya is trying to win the “open tenders” after their concession ends. As such tender is via PPP model where they act as the private contractor  I believe the operator will be held between gov and moya  and hence  the margin will be lesser than it used to be due to “sharing” of costs and “returns”.,btohqsg
Joo Chiat better or this ?,btohqsg
The winning of such tenders is very important as the concession forms > 50% of their revenue. Concession ending in 2023  2 years to go. Anyone can write in to moya to ask about their future direction if they fail to retain  renew or restructure their concession ?,btohqsg
Their Tim sum so so only leh... dunno why always there is a q...🤔🤔🤔🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂,btohqsg
Jakarta concession amounted to Approx 46%. However  bear in mind that the 10500 capacity prob has higher tariff as moya acts as concession consignee  where they are also in charge of the whole chain for eastern side of jakarta (from water production to water distribution).,btohqsg
I think that the above investment risk explains why moya is so under-valued on top of its thin float.,btohqsg
Ate once and never think of going back again..😂😂😂,btohqsg
ha so wat dim sum u go for then?,btohqsg
I like the old skool dim sum style....trolley bring the dim sum for you to choose,btohqsg

The Board of Directors of Golden Energy and Resources Limited (the “Company” or ‘GEAR”)wishes to update shareholders on the following development relating to its subsidiary  PTBorneo Indobara (“BIB”).On 7 August 2021  Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (“MEMR”) releaseda list of 34 companies banned from exporting coal due to potentially not fulfilling theircontractual coal supply obligations to state-owned electric utility PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara(“PLN”) and its affiliates during the first seven months of 2021. BIB was one of the companiesincluded in the list.Following the news of the proposed export ban  BIB commenced discussions with MEMR toclarify its potential areas of non-compliance.On 8 August 2021  MEMR  upon further assessment arising from the discussions with BIB informed BIB that its export ban was lifted. The assessment took into consideration BIB’scompletion of a 55 000-ton coal shipment to PLN which had been scheduled for late July butwas inadvertently delayed by a few days to early August. This completed shipment ensuredthat BIB met its coal supply obligations to PLN for the first seven months of 2021.This matter has been resolved with MEMR and does not have any impact on the business andoperations of BIB and GEAR.,btohqsg
