Am on contra  due tmr. Should let go now?,btohqsg
master yuan mentioned ANG MOH devil !!,btohqsg
I thought he said they short UG?,btohqsg
MT is their current target. They are targeting UG,btohqsg
Oic. I thought UG has EPF backing,btohqsg
Entered MT at 1.01. Queued to let go @ 1.60 but never materialised. Now suck thumb.,btohqsg
You can still sell to lock in profit if you want what,btohqsg
When 2-3 big BB gang together  i think EPF also no fight,btohqsg
Yeah. But not as much gains as I would have gotten if I had gotten out at 1.58,btohqsg
Took a nap after lunch ytd and MT went down together with my nap,btohqsg
What happens if it drops further?,btohqsg
After I woke up from my nap,btohqsg
Then wait for it to go up Lor,btohqsg
Most of us went through the cycles of missed out profits before.,btohqsg
can hold until q3 result announce.. on that day itself must make decision already..,btohqsg
John where are yyou my sunrise leh,btohqsg
i folo others buy..SL 42 already.not looking too good,btohqsg
Hmm SINJIA and Sunrise still flushing?,btohqsg
Agree! SGX is just an exchange nothing wrong with it! Just a lot of people buay zai or greedy ... play on borrowed money and want fast profits hence cannot hold to let share price appreciate!,btohqsg
MT 124 can hold ?? 35 minutes to go,btohqsg
As long as you don‚Äôt say must hold üòÇ,btohqsg
I think psychological game at work between BB and retailers now,btohqsg
I observed many times  if must hold  they will break it within 15 mins,btohqsg
Today not a good day also...rest well for tml...save some bullets,btohqsg
Market sentiments really changed fast this time round. Better sidelines until there‚Äôs better sentiments guys.,btohqsg
IFAST is the star performer this week,btohqsg
"Dude that is only profit guidance. They released it to ""support"" the dropping share price.Final Q3 financial statement is still next month",btohqsg
Else u should cut loss immediately liao. Why would u think price will still go up after the huge drop yesterday,btohqsg
Q3 won't have official financial statement..,btohqsg
Oh.. they don't release hor... not like other companies,btohqsg
They only release 3 numbers each quarter.,btohqsg
Just wait full FY in Jan.,btohqsg
Q1 and Q3 is profit guidance  usually they don't announce this as well.,btohqsg
Cut loss is right thing to do,btohqsg
ABUNDNACE support very strong 32...BBs in control...the range 32-35..,btohqsg
Yesterday close 136... today 126... tmr 146!!!!!  Fri good for medical,btohqsg
Aspen BB 1 mouth 205 n 210 liao,btohqsg
Give it a miss in the end...i was queing 47 then i see market not good so i withdraw,btohqsg
Save some ammunitions for tml if market is better,btohqsg
ABUNDNACE 33 still got buyer...surprise to see...TML maybe the key to breakout resistance 35,btohqsg
