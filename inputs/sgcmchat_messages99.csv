Do you guys agree that it's better to buy rims in Malaysia? I noticed considerably lower prices,btohqsg
The super cheap ones available there tend to be lower quality,btohqsg
Unless you're comparing apple to apple on specific brands,btohqsg
The ones I got eyes on go from RM1500 to 1700  idk if that's super cheap by their standards,btohqsg
I've seen some at RM800 and yeah they seem lower in quality,btohqsg
Try to see if the same ones are available in SG and judge the quality,btohqsg
You're probably going away with a cracked or warped wheel,btohqsg
I plan on sending them home in Europe  can also sell them there if I don't run them and profit bc everything here is rare there,btohqsg
Well  sure but you're just gonna give someone a wheel that'll crack easy,btohqsg
The reason cheap stuff like this is rare there because people avoid putting extremely cheap stuff on their cars,btohqsg
They'd rather get used stuff over new poor quality stuff,btohqsg
couldn't find chrome S1's in SG  what do you think at first glance?,btohqsg
Why do these look like rep wheels?,btohqsg
The individual spokes look thinner than the normal S1's,btohqsg
they prob are but it's for a shitbox car,btohqsg
You sure you want to install Work Meister S1 2P reps on a shitbox?,btohqsg
shitbox already has Enkei NT03 reps 😭,btohqsg
Your car what diameter wheels atm?,btohqsg
This doesn't look like SG le.,btohqsg
Oh no it isn't   I wasn't joking when I said send home to EU,btohqsg
Tries looking for Rota rims instead?,btohqsg
Even if it is something legit  at least not reps if possible,btohqsg
Will see  but I definitely wanna bring home something either from sg or my   it's an opportunity to have so much variety here,btohqsg
1 corner of the car use different wheel 😂,btohqsg
You say want more variety 😂,btohqsg

completly random question when posting car pics do u block out the license plate especially if u are doing it for professional work and like posting it on social media,btohqsg
When I post on social just the car I block out,btohqsg
I will usually ask the owner if they want their license plate to  be blacked out or not when posting,btohqsg
Because at the end of the day it's up to the owner if they want their license plate to be shown or not,btohqsg
Yes I block out for the owner privacy,btohqsg
Are you sure you know the right there,btohqsg

Ok I tell you if you can push to KL,btohqsg
Can get more options on tyres and more reliable ones,btohqsg
Some places in Malaysia will shave off and put fake manufacturing date on tyres,btohqsg
Then wheels also same  KL will be more options,btohqsg
Singapore also some shops got do before,btohqsg
But it's usually for the used tyres for cheaper stuff,btohqsg
but we pit stop in malacca last night,btohqsg
just to chill there for awhile,btohqsg
You try if got cheap or older tyre,btohqsg
You can slowly run to KL,btohqsg
You will need to stop every r&r fill air,btohqsg
And wheel warped no point repair  you might as well buy new,btohqsg
KL prices lower and more options,btohqsg
Got one newly kitted car coming also,btohqsg
