Yeah but same paper. If you took before you can try to find your year. However there’s 2 different versions per exam cycle presumably for ppl in diff time zones  Singapore only uses one of the 2 for the oct/nov papers. However both versions have some similar qns hence those who took o level Econs will recall that their question paper was quarantined for one week,btohqsg
lol i also just finished my stats midterms.hopefully full marks haha,btohqsg
O level econs —> it is q a lot of content i think similar to geog (?) but the content q easy to understand  and foundation level + the qns wise is more content and less analysisH2 econs —> defo is more in depth into the analysis and the answering technique is also different compared to os where it is mainly content regurgitation. But omo hving that foundation sort of make it easier to understand the higher level stuffBUT my econs cher did mention q a lot of times (tho i cant remember what sort) that O lvl teaches some wrong things so also needa adapt to it,btohqsg
As in a level international vs Singapore  o level doesn’t have a Singapore version but I’m trying to draw some parallels. If hypothetically there was one Singapore version for o level Econs it would be more Singapore oriented,btohqsg
Applies for both o levels and a levels,btohqsg
i can alr tell that for pure bio n h2 bio,btohqsg
My tuition centre tutor once boasted if he went to the UK to provide Econs tuition for a levels  he would be comfortable guaranteeing students who don’t get an A or A* a 100% refund,btohqsg
I mean  it’s o level Econs. If more than 80% get it  so can you,btohqsg
I rmbr for 2020 I took the component 13 23 version,btohqsg
You can check the grade boundaries or other past year paper websites to know what I’m talking about  they would label the version for each paper,btohqsg
12 and 13 are paper 1s (mcq)  22 and 23 are paper are papers 2s (csq+structured/essay),btohqsg
Wait wdf did yt rly get UUUU for alvl retake,btohqsg
No i talking about A levels,btohqsg
He is trolling 90% of the time,btohqsg
I mean ya la it sounds like cap,btohqsg
how are the grades mapped to sg grades tho,btohqsg
My brother did not even get his o level cert yet  can find part time contract 3 months for 2.8k pay,btohqsg
My code did not work  hopefully method marks,btohqsg
I also dk how my brother find his 2.8k job,btohqsg
Oh i always tot it was the same paper for all countries taking the O/N/A level papers,btohqsg
"Then everyday I see him coming home early  ask him why. He say ""Nothing to do at work""",btohqsg
time to go UK to be a tutor,btohqsg
Oh i wouldnt expect a sci to be like that,btohqsg
2.8k pay per month including cpf for someone that does not even have a o level cert. Did he hit the golden spoon of jobs?,btohqsg
Wait how do u know it is 80%  i tot it was just my school,btohqsg
Granted it was available cause of the festive cny,btohqsg
As in you can see the combinations of papers available and the grade threshold for each. Moe probably decides and entirely separate grade boundary  but it might mirror the international one closely (as in if the international version grade threshold is high  moe will also set a high score and vice versa),btohqsg
I dun think they release grade boundaries tho,btohqsg
festive period i can understand for temp job,btohqsg
Bruh most of the rp lecturers have masters,btohqsg
Huh no lol. If not why would our grading system be different  and also ppl won’t be going around saying that they want to take uk a levels cos it’s easier,btohqsg
My sch also 80+% for most years,btohqsg
Not sure about the other 2 schs,btohqsg
i mean depends on the actual job,btohqsg
I’m talking about international grade boundaries,btohqsg
Moe one likely mirrors it closely,btohqsg
I got this internship at raffles hospital via school,btohqsg
My cher always tell us econs O levels is just a competition among ourselves  so i can expect the other 2 schs dun usually do well,btohqsg
Just never thought it was that high,btohqsg
Well it would be only if moe sets the grade boundaries based on student’s performance (making it similar to a bell curve although not exactly),btohqsg
But I think they only look at difficulty,btohqsg
I only remembered 1 p1 30m and 1 p2 (i forgot how many marks),btohqsg
Anyway i dun bother looking up these coz it serves no purpose,btohqsg
One of his colleague was a private diploma holder  also intern but she was paid lesser for the same job scope,btohqsg
There’s one cycle in May/june so every year got 4 versions of o level Econs international paper,btohqsg
But why now there are double??,btohqsg
We only take one of the 2 for Oct/nov,btohqsg
That’s also why I said they quarantine our papers because between both versions there will be a few identical questions,btohqsg
2 versions for ppl in diff time zones,btohqsg
Most of the qns are different but I’m guessing Cambridge doesn’t want questions to be leaked,btohqsg
