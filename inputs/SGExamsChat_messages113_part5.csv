Skool is where you get to have fun learning new things with your friends,btohqsg
Did u purposely make so blurry classic?,btohqsg
How does it feel like? Is it an antisocial kind of feeling,btohqsg
Last seen a long time ago,btohqsg
Wats the point of leaving and rejoining changing name,btohqsg
Damn it is a bad experience but i am currently facing more worst situation than you lmao  I retake o level this year  due to last year few month before I level can't take the stress and dropout halfway  this year I wanted to join school at January but parents ask me join later  end up joining at June for physical lesson.Currently struggle with many subject  really need some help man my subject combination is English  Chinese  math  science combined by/chem and humanities geo/ss.i really just want to get into a poly but left a few months to o level i really dont know how,btohqsg
I suggest you to revise topics you're weaker or to do prelim papers,btohqsg
Yeah and check out SGExams resources,btohqsg
Not enough people are uploading notes to the website!,btohqsg
Since you're back in school  you can buy tys topical at the bookshop,btohqsg
if ur taking olevels this year then yearly,btohqsg
If you're struggling with many subjects  I recommend you to do topical first,btohqsg
Why go with other ppl opinion when you can have one of your own?,btohqsg
U think so much also no use,btohqsg
you can still get to the same place as everyone else,btohqsg
It’s not if it’s bad or not,btohqsg
It’s if it will get you where you want to be,btohqsg
It's whether if you can make full use during that time in whatever institution you're in.,btohqsg
If you want to be a chef for example  going to JC will do you no favours  but going to ITE will,btohqsg
And if you want to be a doctor or something  it would be the other way round,btohqsg
Go to the school that fits you,btohqsg
Y do u think people from ITE who get to uni also get on the news,btohqsg
This also could mean there are far too few ppl who make it to uni,btohqsg
Poly go Mit make it to news,btohqsg
"Yes I do agree that if you heard of ""ite student making it into nus/ntu"" will shock most of us because it's rare. However it brings to this point",btohqsg
That it has to be broadcasted,btohqsg
Sometimes when im hungry i eat,btohqsg
Its small relative to other institutions,btohqsg
The point is that it’s only possible that news would air “ite student makes it to Uni” because it’s an exceptional case,btohqsg
"I do agree that it is an exceptional case and to believe that what I claim is pretty quixotic. However it does not equate to ""ite doing no favour"".",btohqsg
Eh honestly my poly class got 4 ite guys. 2 made it to uni,btohqsg
Don't think really warrant making to news,btohqsg
It’s pretty interesting that you contest me saying that ‘ite does you no favours to enter higher education’ but not the thing I said about jc,btohqsg
I think very hard for ite to go uni one la,btohqsg
But yes  ‘no favour’ is a very strong phrase,btohqsg
It’s certainly easier for ITE student to go uni than secondary school student,btohqsg
I don't really have much contextual knowledge with regards to being a chef haha,btohqsg
Yeah non competitive course ok la... those competitive course like science hard la,btohqsg
Sci recent years became really popular,btohqsg
Depends on which course in sci fac,btohqsg
