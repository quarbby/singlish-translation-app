Anyone uses amazon prime or prime video?,btohqsg
But honestly it’s cheap cos u won’t use it often lol,btohqsg
Before rings of power on Amazon prime  there’s nothing to watch in it,btohqsg
And u don’t really buy stuff from Amazon that much,btohqsg
Ya my dad find it cheap so want subscribe,btohqsg
Nothing much to watch one really. I’ve had it for more than a year and I never watched anything till rings of power,btohqsg
I subbed for it cos the other time I wanted to get free delivery for some computer parts… I signed the trial,btohqsg
Ahahaha my dad say he gonna start using amazon buy stuff so he might as well sub,btohqsg
Then I didn’t unsubscribe and left it there,btohqsg
He can go surf abit first because Amazon carry much lesser products than Lazada or shoppee  and not every item can use prime delivery,btohqsg
He say had been considering awhile alr Hahaha,btohqsg
But if he don’t mind the $3 then go ahead lor. Like u said it’s cheap,btohqsg
That’s why I just left it there also,btohqsg
In case I need to buy stuff,btohqsg
I only have 1 reason for prime video is to watch house MD 😂,btohqsg
Ya he think it's damn cheap,btohqsg
He say $36/year he kinda OK with it 😂,btohqsg
It’s good for buying rarer stuff. I bought computer parts from Amazon cos the prices were good. And some computer peripherals there as well as they have stock from their warehouse which they shipped prior from USA.,btohqsg
Some items Lazada don’t have or much more ex,btohqsg
Cos computer parts in sg  lesser brands / models,btohqsg
They don’t carry everything. And I was building an all-white build. Which is even rarer,btohqsg
So I had to source a lot of components from Amazon,btohqsg
I guess just opening up more choices for buying stuff,btohqsg
My dad is kind of an audiophile and he say he saw some stuff he might buy from amazon in some times,btohqsg
If that’s the case then yes  Amazon good for those stuff,btohqsg
Ya he just ask me to check the pros and cons,btohqsg
It's a win win lol and my dad wants it mah,btohqsg
Not like I'm the 1 paying 😂,btohqsg
ya lor... so cold some more,btohqsg
i still saving money to buy a amp n hd800s,btohqsg
not ex ba.. 5-6k settle everything,btohqsg
If it myself I find it expensive,btohqsg
