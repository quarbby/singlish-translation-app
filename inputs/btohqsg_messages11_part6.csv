I am thinking to convert to bank loan too,btohqsg
but worried their interest rate might be higher than 2.6% in the future,btohqsg
Dun think so 2.6 is super high alr,btohqsg
Even if it goes up to 2% is still cheaper than 2.6,btohqsg
Usually after collect keys  wait abt 2 to 3 mths  then u can change from hdb to bank loan.,btohqsg
I checked alr before collecting key also can just pay additional 10% cpf and 5% cash,btohqsg
And engage a lawyer to inform hdb,btohqsg
I'm the ganjiong type  so I foresee myself to collect keys first instead of delaying the appointment of my keys collection,btohqsg
Usually those who take hdb loan collect keys faster than bank loan,btohqsg
what's the % of CPF to pay? is cash portion 5% only?,btohqsg
Got this info from Singapore bto group,btohqsg
But cpf returns to u. Bank doesnt,btohqsg
After key collect you need to pay min 3 months of HDB loan first then meanwhile you can apply to change to bank loan so when it approved is about 6months from key collection,btohqsg
Bank Loan interests earned by the bank. HDB Loan interests earned by you,btohqsg
I thot accrued interest we got to pay back regardless is hdb loan or bank loan?,btohqsg
Need pay back both. But one is technically pay back yourself,btohqsg
Pay to bankVsPay back into your own OA,btohqsg
My previous house is a bank loan,btohqsg
I still pay back into my own OA for accrued interest,btohqsg
Example hdb loan 2.6% per annum is the interest that hdb earn  the amount of cpf that i withdraw and use for my property which is the accrued interest i have to pay back into my cpf when my property is sold,btohqsg
Same for bank loan : 1.48% per annum for 3 year fixed is the interest that bank earned but the amount of cpf i withdraw to use for my property i will need to pay back to my cpf acct when my property is sold,btohqsg
I asked already. Just need to change to bank loan before key collected. Which means my bto key collection date is Q2 2022  by nov 2021 i need to apply for bank loan and engage a lawyer to inform HDB. I still collect the key on Q2 2022,btohqsg
Yes but you have to pay 5% cash but if you refinance from HDB loan is different,btohqsg
Ya. Cos i want to avoid the 50% cash procceed,btohqsg
I rather pay 5% cash than 50% cash proceed,btohqsg
Shared from ppl in bto groupHi J  its not possible to do it immediately. But i have done with 1 mth repayment before. Its case to case basis  depending on the LTV  credit assessment and profile of customers.However  you cant do low downpayment such as 10% and expect to refinance to banks months later after you collect the key. Although you are not required to pay down any cash but you are required to bring down the LTV (loan to value) to about 80%Take note some banks require 6 to 12 mths hdb loan repayment history before you can refinance to banks.,btohqsg
Ya so is better to change to bank loan if u intended to before key collection,btohqsg
But that is for 1st year rite? Then after that is how many %?,btohqsg
Wah. That is long enough. After that then need to go look for re financial? Possible to pay back the loan within 5 years? Any penalty?,btohqsg
But don't intend to loan long term. Hehe. Hopefully can pay off within a few years. Any suggestions?,btohqsg
so how much do you save in the end?,btohqsg

Got Toa Payoh notðŸ˜… hope donâ€™t have hor  later Toh hdb branch kena then all cannot go unit selection :(,btohqsg
as well as cannot get keys too LOL,btohqsg
thinking of a sweet spot of how much to loan from HDB,btohqsg
what's the max tenure for bank loan?,btohqsg
Loan so high ? every month need pay how much dunno I will go bankrupt not,btohqsg
that's why we have to plan our finances well,btohqsg
what if I want to switch over to bank loan after I have made the final payment upon getting keys? means my OA no $ left,btohqsg
Oh ya I see before article that bank loan got minimum need borrow 200k minimum?,btohqsg
Mine is less than 180k   they still entertain me. So should be ok,btohqsg
one good thing about this covid  the longer it is  the loan we get would be reduced,btohqsg
yeah unless one uses it for investment,btohqsg
If we take bank loan... will they deduct monthly instalment from CPF or is it not possible to use CPF?,btohqsg
Hello  anyone if I have got my 5rm bto unit est key collection in Q4 2022  can I have a chance to change to other 5rm unit if there is a withdraw case. Meaning someone give up the 5rm unit and no taker yet,btohqsg
