Don't even see an article on it. Sound scummy,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there is a difference between uob master vs visa debit card?,btohqsg
Distribution based on declaration date for snack fund,btohqsg
So as long as hold unit 3 working day before month end can get distribution,btohqsg
Snack asian income fund appear to be on uptrend recently,btohqsg
Really unexpected. Thought sure lose money. lol.Buy $14k hold one monthGet back 14 030.Get credit card rewardsGet $70 distributionGet $400 capita vouchersSoon to get $880 capita vouchers,btohqsg
23 is friday so i think u be risking it,btohqsg
Iâ€™m already all out and wonâ€™t touch again unless got a fantastic promo.I would always play safe and buy 15 days earlier due to free look concerns (I know got dp saying free look still get vouchers).,btohqsg
Mine buy 20 feb still pending today,btohqsg
Already reply a lot of time that free look is not free look unless u write in to request free look aiyo,btohqsg
All things being equal. The unit price should drop by dividend payout amount.,btohqsg
Can wait to see if it climb back like end jan to early feb,btohqsg
For the feb normal challenge yes  but lichun have to hold till 5 or 6 of mar,btohqsg
hi all i just learned abt hsbc everyday global account (debit card); as explained in chrisâ€™s video  seems like as long as i transfer in 2k and do 5 transactions every month  iâ€™d get a 1% cashback for 1. paying my other credit cards 2. paying income tax;am i understanding this correctly or am i missing something? cuz this seems too good to be trueâ€¦ hoping to have some double confirmation before i applythanks in advance!,btohqsg
Depends on the MCC that they post with?Anw is there promo?,btohqsg
what's wrong with HSBC for  > $10 ?,btohqsg
No wrong just some people want to use their PPV more often so they use it more while HSBC is to catch smaller amounts,btohqsg
i do see tax payment is excluded here  but in this video IRAS is mentionedhttps://youtu.be/iebYTbH8hYY?si=x72cVbtfxD5KHwOV&t=167,btohqsg
Pay IRAS via debit card =/= Pay IRAS via GIRO,btohqsg
"the ""catch"" is you will only start earning 1% rebate after you completed 2K deposit + 5 transaction. so if you only fulfilled that condition on 29th of the month  you only have 1-2 more days to earn the 1% rebate (eg  fulfilled these 2 conditions on 1st of each mth)",btohqsg
yeap iâ€™ve noticed that in tnc  thanks for replying!,btohqsg
I asked cso  they verbally told me can. But don't dare to commit black and white via email. The end I think think I forgo the small reward from opening promo but focus to meet the criteria for rising dragon saving promo. Moreover I have existing Uniplus account  meaning I'm an existing customer hence I get less rewards. You never know they choose the lower reward for you and stated the tnc that you cannot mix more than one promo. Just my thoughts,btohqsg
this guy taking a dig at us. quite disrespectful imo. is he a property agent or investor?,btohqsg
Any suggestion where is the best place to park 50k cash ? Moomoo cash plus seems to be the best option now,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/_ekERGr_Av8?si=j8yKuV0M0OGd3rqbJust finished watching this video lol,btohqsg
He sounds like he don't know what he's talking about and he did say it from the start he doesn't know what shielding is lol. But it doesn't matter what he says what. You will lose money when he talk meh?,btohqsg
I'm assuming you have already filled up all the high interest savings accounts available?You might want to search the chat for discussions on moomoo for others experience with moomoo before deciding.,btohqsg
Nice explanation  but different view point and believer. Eric is long time in property. And that path has lead him there.The ultimate outcome of investing in cpf can be materialise only after the money become liquid; or when finally we can tap on the money.Until then  the good theory and strategy/plan in place is good still until policy plan changes. Fingers crossed!! ðŸ¤ž,btohqsg
Anyone here uses UOB PPV to pay for Singtel bills here at Singtel kiosk?,btohqsg
How fast does UOB lady card reflect uni$ on the app after a transaction?,btohqsg
What's best card to use for buying SQ flight?Amex Krisflyer  HSBC Revolution  Citi Rewards?,btohqsg
If you see the sms  it ends on the next calendar month. So as long as you do every month you'll always get the 1%. Even if you miss 1 month you can still catch up,btohqsg
Depends on where u plan to buy it n how much.,btohqsg
If you spend more than $5 per transaction  UNI$ display is based on posted date.Bonus UNI$ only will be displayed on following month.,btohqsg
Tiz cost is 561$ directly SQ web,btohqsg
If itâ€™s not reflected  means itâ€™s a MCC not recognized?,btohqsg
Just activated my card on wed and used ytd at a Chinese TCM for massage. Thought would recognize under health and beauty,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Used yesterday  still shown as pending? Must be posted first  not pending,btohqsg

Is iChange down? My app doesnâ€™t show my balances and profile.,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/foreign-currency-foreign-exchange.pagetry this. i think the old consensus is that brokerage like webull has better FX (to verify)  so convert there and bring back SGD to DBS. Or keep it as USD when bringing back to DBS,btohqsg
that dosent rlly help  but thankyou  i use webull to exchange 100k sgd to usd  theres 700 sgd missing somewhere in the transactions,btohqsg
0.7%  could it be some fees or conversion loss?,btohqsg
no idea  I only calculate based on 700 divided by 100k,btohqsg
