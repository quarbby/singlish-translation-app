there are many aerial pics taken of sg..i wonder how they do it,btohqsg
Aerial photograph of Tampines  with Sungei Tampines (bottom right)  surrounding ponds  Jalan Ang Siang Kong (curved road)  Tampines Road and Jalan Guan Choon visible. Aerial photo is oriented with North on the right.  It shows the area between 10Ã‚Â½ milestone and 12 milestone Tampines Road. Tampines Road enters the photo at the top edge  a quarter of the way in from the right edge and runs down to the left quarter of the bottom edge of the photo.  Ten and a half milestone Tampines Road is near the first cross junction from the top edge.,btohqsg
Eleventh milestone is near the centre of the photo  before the road forms a bulge to the right. Twelfth milestone is at the bottom edge of the photo.  These milestones would later change when large sections of the Tampines road were realigned  changing the distances along it from the General Post Office.  The first cross junction from the top of the photo is that of Jalan Sim Pah (running to the lefft  south of Tampines Road) and Jalan Guan Choon (running to the right  north of Tampines Road).  Jalan Sim Pah ran through the rural Ulu Bedok area to join up with Jalan Tiga Ratus leading to Somapah Changi village.  Jalan Guan Choon was named after the company Chop Guan Choon  owned by millionaire plantation owner Teo Kim Eng  who owned much of the land in the area.  Jalan Guan Choon runs under a roofed gateway and bends around a large villa before leading to the mangrove swamps and prawn ponds of the Sungei Tampines  parts of which are visible in the lower right of the photo.  The houses amongst the trees around Jalan Guan Choon are those of Kampong Tampines  also known to the residents as Kampong Dalam (inner kampong)  which was founded by Javanese and Bugis settlers.  The village economy revolved around a cottage industry of making belachan from the shrimps caught at Pasir Ris beach  as well as the produce of the surrounding coconut and rubber plantations. The village was used as a film location for rural scenes in several Malay films of the 1950s and 60s.  Just below the big house that Jalan Guan Choon bends around  a side track branches off it to the right  leading to some houses near a pond on the right edge of the photo.  Just below this pond is a Muslim cemetery that was exhumed in 1985 when the area was being cleared.Further down the Tampines Road near the 11th milestone  where the road forms a bulge to the right  there is a Chinese temple to the left of the road (one of the buildings outlined in red) named Soon Hin Ko Beo or Soon Hin Ancient Temple.Â  This temple started in or before 1851 and was dedicated to a man named Ang Sian Kong  who tamed the tigers that roamed the surrounding forests in those days.Â  Later when this section of Tampines Road was realigned to make it straighter  the old bendy sections were renamed Jalan Ang Sian Kong  after the deity of that temple. To the right of the road near 11th milestone there is a track outlined with a red dashed line  leading to a sand quarry.Â  This sand quarry would later become a couple of big ponds around which the Golden Palace Holiday Resort was built in 1967.Â  The resort closed around 1971 and the site was bought by the Primary Production Department in 1973 to become the Tampines Fisheries Centre  where the PPD conducted research into breeding udang galah freshwater prawns and soon hock fish.Â  When Pasir Ris New Town was built  the ponds became a big fishing pond which still exists in Pasir Ris Town Park as of 2021.Â  To the right (north) of Tampines Road the landscape is characterised by coconut and rubber plantations on the higher ground  and mangrove swamp and prawn ponds around the Tampines river. To the left (south) of Tampines Road  the landscape is mainly vegetable farms on the high ground and fish ponds in the valleys. There are also patches of belukar and forest.,btohqsg
