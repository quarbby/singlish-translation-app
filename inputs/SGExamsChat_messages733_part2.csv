they finally shut down the ip system through fsbb 30 years later,btohqsg
Oh ya talking about PW  how were you exempt from the PW requirements,btohqsg
criteria was color coordination  docummentation and must show symmetrical elements,btohqsg
Auto exempt if u can proof u can't even do it,btohqsg
that submission had none of the 3,btohqsg
Im a bit confused coz they seem to be doing 2 things in opposite directions,btohqsg
Oh I thought IP will still continue to exist in IP/IP and express only schs,btohqsg
there was no color coordination..no color palette,btohqsg
and there was no symmetrical elements anywhere,btohqsg
And someoneâ€™s advice for me â€˜the only way around it is to be an elitist ur ownâ€™,btohqsg
"""we don't want elitism""also government:INTRODUCES THE IP SYSTEM",btohqsg
Yeah sometimes CC speaks the truth even if ppl hate him lol,btohqsg
But I rmbr him ranting about hawkers not accepting non cash payments,btohqsg
nope because he would have failed,btohqsg
It's pretty hard to fail a mod.,btohqsg
Actually i hv been annoyed by the ip thing,btohqsg
i mean if you dont submit anything,btohqsg
you still have a possibility of passing,btohqsg
It was started a year before i p6 i think,btohqsg
he did..just nothing that was wanted,btohqsg
yeah  you can't just give students the easy way out by not taking o lvls ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Then yes but u can submit gibberish and u might still pass with a D-,btohqsg
also  ip affiliation is only to certain jcs,btohqsg
why can't there be affiliation to other jcs like acjc  asr?,btohqsg
I think this makes sense coz the ip wanna just go elite jcs,btohqsg
government is doing the complete opposite of what it's supposed to do,btohqsg
"Another quote""MOE says that they chose the JCs to merge by geographical spread.This is PR spin. But PR spin has to be believable. As many have pointed out Hwa Chong and NJC are right across the road from each other.It is obvious that the JCs chosen were the least popular by cut-off points. There is nothing wrong with that. So just admit it instead of spinning an incredulous story.Note: someone has messaged me to point out that all 8 are non-IP non-mission Government JCs. Which explains inclusion of Anderson.""",btohqsg
No lah. Saint Andrewâ€™s is Christian missionary sch,btohqsg
Cj ac and sa are Christian,btohqsg
"but you see the module was a art module..he submited game screenshots to faci..that had 0% of anything to do with the mod itselfthe faci literally asked him infront of the whole class ""who's game you playing? your dimissal or your time?""",btohqsg
that's why ip stream is stupid,btohqsg
you can only go to elite jcs  which is literally elitism,btohqsg
ive always knew rp or maybe even other poly would give special cases for people with special needs,btohqsg
Bruh it was april my o lvl yesr when moe boomed this bad news,btohqsg
because there is noway 2 known special needs students are now y3 poly students,btohqsg
when they dont even know basics of design..as a y3 design student,btohqsg
But erm ip is ofc to elite jcs?,btohqsg
both dont even know what is a colour palette,btohqsg
but you can't just get free admission into an elite jc just by looking at your psle score,btohqsg
Jesus  Kuro. Listen  if you really wanna do this with your life you have to believe you're necessary and you are. People wanna live like this with their elitism and big fuckin' egos they can't even managed  then you're necessary. The only reason they all get to continue living like cunts is because we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and then the whole world gets really fuckin' fair really fuckin' quickly and nobody actually wants that. They say they do but they don't. They want what we have to give them but they also wanna  you know  play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from. Well  that's more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow  so fuck 'em. Fuck normal people. You know  the funny thing is  tomorrow if all of this goes tits up they're gonna crucify us for being too reckless but if we're wrong  and everything gets back on track? Well then  the same people are gonna laugh till they piss their pants cause we're gonna all look like the biggest pussies God ever let through the door.,btohqsg
you need to separate elitism from meritocracy,btohqsg
How did it make you feel. But at least for 2018 admissions all the COP rose thanks to the merger  so it was easier to get into a better sch,btohqsg
It's too much work to fail a student,btohqsg
Coz i was 12 and asr was 12 and coz i bet on tjc as 1st instead coz i dw go merger,btohqsg
yea im just highlighting there could be favouritism to special needs..but it feels real unfair ngl,btohqsg
The world is hypocritical fuck just look at bedok that little shit,btohqsg
Well with net 12  shouldâ€™ve just gone with asr,btohqsg
what is your main consideration when choosing a jc,btohqsg
At least i hv 1/2 my cert MJC,btohqsg
is it its reputation or its distance,btohqsg
