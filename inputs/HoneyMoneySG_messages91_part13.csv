No. But dp have said buying whole Japan pass directly from website is covered by Uob lady travel category.,btohqsg
Maybe just anything buy from Klook safer.,btohqsg
Klook and Pelago are very safe for Uob lady travel,btohqsg
But if top up suica card with credit card like expensive. Think bring cash better,btohqsg
Wait for fx spend promos to whack into Suica.,btohqsg
Whatever card has fx spend promo and not excluded,btohqsg
Hi all  if I get a UOB lady supplement card for my wife  can I choose and different catagory during application? I just sent in the application but there is no mention of category to choose.,btohqsg
Follows principal card  both categories and shared $3k cap,btohqsg
Yea if can choose everyone will game. Just need 2 supp cards to get all the categories 😜,btohqsg
i dont think its within broker's control. there is a specific time in which mmf distributes the returns.. dd should have be done prior investing into mmfs,btohqsg
the crucial factor is why 9am cutoff?it should be based on trading day cutoff,btohqsg
Same as u  those I paid on 4th they haven’t received. But those I paid on 31 Jan they received. I’ll wait till end of month,btohqsg
have to ask fullerton  cutoff timings are set by distributor,btohqsg
Have someone used both UOB PPV and/or UOB Krisflyer CC+Amaze ?I figured the spending categories to be roughly similar  but earn rate 4mpd/max 1110$ per month on PPV  and 3mpd uncapped if 800$ yearly spend on SIA for the Krisflyer+amaze.Anyone have any feedback/tips on one or both cards ?,btohqsg
Cathay cineleisure and toastbox are uob$ merchant.a) If i paid cathay cineleisure via shopback with uob evol  will i be eligible for uob evol 8% online spending?b) for toastbox  will i be eligible for 6mpd if i paid with amaze-uob lady (selected category: dining)?,btohqsg
If you can wait 14 months for the bonus point to come and also wether if the point are actually accurate on the KF+ amaze 🤔Why not both ? As it best if you are doing a combo of both ?Since just nice PPV don’t reward for travel category 🤔Daily expenses - PPVBus/MRT - UOB KFKris+ - UOB KFTravel related via OTA or SIA group - UOB KFThis 2 can also pretty much cover alot of your daily,btohqsg
Hello! 👋Just want to check if anyone applied for the rising dragons promo for the first qualifying period not gotten the cash credit/earmarked yet?I removed (29dec )and deposit funds and registered (2 Jan ).Not sure if I missed a step and just wanna check if there are any unfortunate folks like me still waiting for their funds to be earmarked.. 😅,btohqsg
Most were earmarked on 14th but UOB's tnc said cut off date for earmarking and crediting is 29 Feb so maybe wait ba.You did receive the registration email right?,btohqsg
You are not alone. Mine is also not earmarked yet. CSO said that earmarking is happening in batches,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply! Was actually thinking of covering travel with a Ladys card (unsure if the 6mpd will extend beyond 31march though). Was just concerned by the 1110$ cap on PPV  since i’ll soon have to buy lots of furnitures and will for sure. But you’re right  might as well get both cards 😅Was actually wondering at what point the KF CC+ amaze at 3mpd without cap would outperform the PPV 4mpd with cap (speaking only about miles)?Do you know if pairing KF CC+amaze negates the UOB$ merchants lower earning rate? (Meaning if you use amaze for a UOB merchant  do you get the lower earning rate or the bonus earning rate ? ),btohqsg
Yes it does amaze will negate the UOB$   there is article by milelion covering this specific topicYou can also add UOB VS to expand your spending up to another $2kYou can simply just take the capLet say$3000 all into PPV(1110 x 4 ) + ( 1900 x 0.4 ) = 5160Comparing to $3000 UOB KF(3000 x 3mpd ) = 9000Clearly can see it already close to 2xI think there are some furniture store in Kris+ if there are and it have what you want then that should be your go toHipvan is one of them 6mpd + 3 mpd with UOB KFhttps://milelion.com/2023/04/30/workarounds-how-to-earn-miles-at-uob-merchants-with-uob-cards/,btohqsg
Credit card gurus  any one knows how to view the breakdown of points earned on the Citi Rewards card? In online banking they used to show by daily combined transactions on the rewards portal but have since removed that functionality. On the Citi app it only shows monthly total but I wanna verify that certain transactions are earning me the bonus 9X points. Thanks!,btohqsg
It’s gone. Gotta use excel to track manually,btohqsg
What are you guys experience with HeyMax app? It seems that it assumes all transactions are in foreign currency and prioritizes those cards...,btohqsg
Thanks a lot ! Will give it a read 😊,btohqsg

Hi can anyone confirm if using ocbc 365 to pay through xnap at hawker etc can still get 5%? Likewise for other fast food payment using ocbc 365. Rmbr there was a nerf for fast food cashback and then it got reversed.,btohqsg
Is there any benefit of booking Airbnb in foreign currency and paying with Maybank Horizon for 3.2mpd promo vs paying with citi premiermiles linked to Amaze? Trying to compare whether bonus miles is worth the FCY,btohqsg
citi rewards give mpd for flight ticket?,btohqsg

Dbs wwmc if under 4k. Altitude is via expedia for certain airline,btohqsg
Yep. Receive the mail from UOB!,btohqsg
Good to know! 😂 at least not alone!,btohqsg
Your Apple/Google Pay also setup already?,btohqsg
ApplePay - It’s set up in my phone. Do I have to activate it in Xnap? I couldn’t find an avenue to have it activated in this app..,btohqsg
Then scan the SGQR with XNAP and pay lor..,btohqsg
That’s what i did but got an error message. ( ok I forgot what it said) so I tried a few times. After that I gave up and paid under Scan and Pay.,btohqsg
Did you check if the SGQR looks like this?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/153211?single,btohqsg
Hey I have a question. If interest in RA does not belong to us and belong to the pool  is it then a better thing to start withdrawing  the cPf payouts at age 65 then to wait until 70 to start withdrawing?,btohqsg
Actually I don't get why ppl keep saying interest in RA does not belong to self.RA and CPF Life are 2 separate things. You can use RA to pay the premium for CPF Life annuity. You can increase your CPF Life payouts if you pay higher premiums from your RA.RA earns it's own interest and credited into RA  after death it'll be distributed alongside all other amounts as stated in your CPF nomination.CPF Life premiums earns it's own interest and credited into CPF Life (pooled with every other CPF Life). Remaining unused premiums will be distributed as above.RA does not magically disappear  unlike SA at 55 (in 2025).,btohqsg
let me call scb tomorrow  because my aia date already passed a weekk,btohqsg
So you are saying it’s ok to still keep money in RA until 70 to earn more interest and use that to pay premiums for CPF life? So meaning as long as you don’t withdraw  whatever interest u earn from 55 to 65 or 70 will still be yours since it will be paid as premiums for the CPF life plan? sorry for the noob question as I am trying to figure out what best for me. :),btohqsg
Yes like that. So I scanned and then there’s an error message. So I tried again. Then I close and relaunch app and tried.The I thought maybe I need to activate something but of course at point of payment I just swiftly pay other ways.,btohqsg
Where did you try to pay,btohqsg
It’s nothing to do with my Apple Pay have multiple cards registered right…after all each time I want to use Apple Pay I kinda can select the card.,btohqsg
No registration required for xnap. Just download the app to use,btohqsg
Jan is tricky because 1 Jan is holiday. so if you put in 100 000 on 2nd Jan  your monthly daily average balance will be less than 100 000 so won't be ear marked,btohqsg
