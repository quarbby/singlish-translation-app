I'm using a Standard Charted Unlimited Credit Card that earns me a 1.5% cashback on all spends. No minimum spend. No cashback cap.I'm considering changing to the OCBC 365 Card that offers a 18% discount at my usual Caletex petrol station.I do like the idea of unlimited cashback as I easily charge more than $900 on my CC every month. Is the switch a wise choice?,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre only spending $900 per month you shouldn‚Äôt be looking too hard at unlimited cashback cards yet  because your spending is very close to the limit of specialised cashback cards (that offer a much higher rate) that you come out behind.For example  if you used UOB EVOL and were able to maximise its benefits with the minimum spending required  you would be able to get $40 cashback with ~$600 spend. Currently your full $900 spend at 1.5% only gets you ~$14 of cashback.,btohqsg
You have to ask yourself - are you looking to maximise your benefits (at the cost of additional effort)  or do you want minimal effort (and give up some potential benefits). Then you will know what is the wisest choice for yourself personally,btohqsg
What's the best method to pay income tax this year?,btohqsg

Anyone just back from South Korea? Would like to check how widely available is payment with Google Pay ... seems to be launched just in Aug 2023,btohqsg
South Korea seems more card insert still.,btohqsg
How about Samsung Pay with international cards?,btohqsg
From feedback from my friends  they say all the contactless payment methods still not widely accepted.90% of credit card transactions are chip insert for Korea  even in Seoul itself.,btohqsg
for Prudential confirm can if you are using ipaymy,btohqsg
Would like to do DCA or setup up RSP for China ETF any idea which trading platform has the lowest fee,btohqsg
Should use cardup liao. Lesser fees,btohqsg
can get how many % cashback after fees deduction if not interested in miles?,btohqsg
If I have redeem for  miles partially  meaning no longer as per 5 years from initial date  will that correct? Assume they use first in first out concept,btohqsg
The main thing is ipaymy charges $1 for every payment. It's literally 0.1% more if the transaction is $1k. Higher % in fees when the transaction is smaller. 0.2% if $500  0.4% if $250.,btohqsg
Hi guys can you advise what is the minimum balance for uob one account please?,btohqsg
My apologies I noticed there was a chat stating min avg daily is $1k but my friend say is min $1k inside so I am a bit confused,btohqsg
Perhaps could contact CSO for further clarification. According to Milelion article  points accumulated 5 years period starting from card approval date  will have 5 yrs + 3 months expiry period.Annoying thing is I seek confirmation from CSO via mobile app chat  they revert requesting me to call in instead. Perhaps it best to track and check every monthly card statement to prevent points expiry going into waste ü§î,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows how we will receive the the balance returns for the 6.8% moo moo promotion?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not quite how citi rewards points expiry works. Suggest you read up a bit more for clarity,btohqsg
I planning to pay $500 to snack to hit the 500 credit/debit spent,btohqsg
Dont think can. Snack payment is likely  considered as insurance mcc  which is under uob exclusion list.,btohqsg
Can. Just for the bonus interest.,btohqsg
Hi everyone. I have participated in the Rising Dragon promo. Had 10k on 31dec  so I topped up to 110k last month. I just noted today my available funds has decreased to 10k +$558.I understand that i am still going to earn interest based on a $110k amount.But.. i am not sure if its ok to withdraw this remaining $10558. (I would like to do so becos anything above 100k is giving only 0.05%p.a.)Anyone knows?,btohqsg
By the same logic as I always have this question in mind  if I have $100k on 31 Dec and I put in another $100k to make $200k for the promo. Once ear mark I can remove $100k n just leave $100k for the earmark. So even if 31 Dec we forget to empty the account we still have a chance,btohqsg
True also.. but then it means if we participate the 2nd round  deposit on 28th feb  and got earmarked on 15th march  means the extra 100k put in will lose around 15days of interest that could otherwise earns around $210 in another 5% uob one acct.This understanding correct?,btohqsg
So the earnings would be effectively $558-$210=$348If this is correct  this would serve as a reference for those still interest to go into the round 3 rising dragon promo,btohqsg
but it's hard to know when they earmark your funds so during the period of waiting time you waste interest,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if I were to use the UOB One Credit card to make payment for a Shopee Pay Later (SPayLater) bill  will I be able to get it to count towards the monthly spend and whether or not this amount will be able to earn the bonus 5-6.67% cashback on Shopee transactions? Thanks!!,btohqsg
I think the earmark takes like half a month to happen,btohqsg
