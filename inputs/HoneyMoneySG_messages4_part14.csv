Revolt can transfer to saving  grab cannot?,btohqsg
Think grab suspended grabpay paynow payments ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
So comfirm cannot use grab to pay anymore ?,btohqsg
from Grab website: Can PayNow payments via GrabPay be made to all merchants with a PayNow QR?Specific PayNow QRs are not supported for PayNow payments via GrabPay. These merchants are:Singtel Dash wallet top upPayments to IRASPayments to CPF Board,btohqsg
So I guess insurance premium can still get cashback?,btohqsg
Amex top up > Grabpay Wallet > Grabpay Mastercard > AXS,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGhow come  recently mapletree reit suddenly drop so many,btohqsg
Because of American add interest? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya that's one of the possible reason,btohqsg
Again  the market is more irrational than the rational reasons presented,btohqsg
MIT this round allow shareholder to Convert their dividend to shares,btohqsg
All the bb like Temasek gic .. sponsor got to support this corp action,btohqsg
But they will make the share price cheap to convert so to their advantage as they r long term,btohqsg
After the 10 days periodâ€¦ they will take the avg price n price the share for u to convert,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGif used moomoo how to use the dividend add in the share price?,btohqsg
But there is a option at grab to transfer to bank account isnt it?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI see the news said  American will add interest not only 1 time  maybe 3 time  like this reit price will drop 3 more time? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Use this way can still top up ?,btohqsg
So cannot  use grabpay to scan cpf QR code anymore ?,btohqsg
Market already knows this  but whether drop 3 more times is anyone's guess,btohqsg
Why need to topup grab first then topup revolt?,btohqsg
I top up grab to hit the 5k.I top from grab to revolut to take out the 5k to pay the bill.,btohqsg
Wow. Nice hack. Dont need to lock the money inside grab pay wallet,btohqsg
But please note there is a limit for grab top-up.,btohqsg
Now for grab  you can paynowQR too. So if you have amex-uob absolute card  and your merchant does not accept credit card but has paynowQR  you can still earn 1.7% cashback indirectly by topping up grab wallet with amex uob absolute and scan the qr to paynow your merchant,btohqsg
can be useful when you are doing house reno  when M&E contractors etc do not accept credit card but have paynowQR,btohqsg
but take note of the 30k annual top up as per Mr Jack message above.,btohqsg
for grab paynowQR payments  no grabrewards tho. but you still get 1.7% cashback from UOB-AMEX absolute top up to your grab wallet at least. better than getting nth from your usual paynow/fund transfer.,btohqsg
Topup revolut 5k direct dont count as hit 5k?,btohqsg
Revolut don't accept amex for now.,btohqsg
Any fees to withdraw from revolut to bank and how many days it takes from revolut to bank?,btohqsg
Noo fees . You will get the next seconds you send.,btohqsg
Hey experts  can I check will I get the 1.5% cash back when I use Amex cash back to top up my Revoult? Since now I canâ€™t top up to Grabpay,btohqsg
HiRevolut don't accept amex card as top up,btohqsg
I just top up my grabpay with my uob absolute amex card this morning. Why can't u do it?,btohqsg
I want to stretch my cash back as my ultimate goal is to top up myCrypto.comcard.,btohqsg
Can use youtrip card to do the top-up tocrypto.com? Any charges incur?,btohqsg
