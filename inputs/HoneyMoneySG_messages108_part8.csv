Should I become priority banking? Can share your experience?,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtI thought that is very easy to get exactly $100k MAB by taking out the base interest $4? Do you want me to teach you the trick n secret? You promise don‚Äôt tell other people ü§´how I did it.,btohqsg
Once you got $$. They will try to ask you to put into funds .. and not fd,btohqsg
Hi all experts out thereI took part in Uob saving promo on April for fresh funds of $20k.This $20k has been earmarked today and I have also received the cash credit of $80.My MAB for March is $50K. My question is do I need to maintain this $50k all the way to Aug? üôèüèª,btohqsg
haha it is ok.. i don't want to be JUST IN TIME or JUST ENOUGH mistress..i always like to add $1 or $10 kind of thing,btohqsg
Be careful not to trust everything the RM say,btohqsg
checking if anyone knows  if i using CPFIA OA to buy Tbill. why it does return back to my OA after mature?,btohqsg
you will need to maintain End March's MAB figure + $20 000 + ideally a buffer of $10. Refer to UOB App for your exact End March MAB figure (shared screenshot above),btohqsg
Can always withdraw out 2 or 4 to accommodate the base interest if it non working day lol,btohqsg
Thank you for your wise advice.,btohqsg
You all ah can become actor/ actress liao,btohqsg
sorry really don't understand.. what u mean 2 or 4because the $4.xx comes in on 1st of the month backdated to 31st of last month.. how u take out,btohqsg
Because just last month the uob RM want to push fixed income fund ..,btohqsg
U know it always credit last day mah if non working day  u count backward,btohqsg
Should I go for fixed income funds?,btohqsg
but you dunno the amount right? later off by 1 cent how?,btohqsg
0.05 base interest  so can still count de roughly,btohqsg
hmmm.. ok i sort of get it.. haha thanks thanks..but i kiasi pattern one.. prefer to have $10 buffer...,btohqsg
Haha ya i know kiasi better mah then wont si üòÇ although eventually death is inevitable,btohqsg
