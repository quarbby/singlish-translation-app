I have applied this and tried to use it at some 7-11 store. Apparently most 7-11 don't accept Amex card and it can't be added into mobile contactless for gpay and applepay. Has anyone tried it and was successful?,btohqsg
If u are able to keep within your good rewards credit card spend limits  amaze is still better.Only when u have to fall back on 2mpd or 1.6% cashback cards then amaze would probably lose to you trip/revolut.,btohqsg
Indeed 7-11 doesn't accept amex  so it's better to use amex card at giant or cold storage,btohqsg
Hmm yeah so amaze plus miles cards?,btohqsg
