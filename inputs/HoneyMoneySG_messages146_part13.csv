Any way to better manage this portion?,btohqsg
Which is why  focus on the 60k combined balance. Not the 20k OA,btohqsg
Please download the OCBC 360 calculator and input your own date and figureshttps://ko-fi.com/s/612320b77a,btohqsg
But you need to also remember that OA transfer is irreversible  you should also take in account your future OA usage. The magic number is 40k combined SA+MA  and let your OA grow for future use.,btohqsg
old scheme mothers still ok.. just that capped by the $80k... also already very angry,btohqsg
What im trying to say is take for example these 2 scenarios:Scenario 1- OA: 10k  SA: 50k  MA: 0Interest= 10k*3.5% + 50k*5% = $2 850Scenario 2- OA: 0  SA: 60k  MA: 0Interest= 60k*5% = $3 000So from maximising interest perspective  one would leave as little balances in OA as possible  because the order prioritise OA before SA/MA.,btohqsg
The country needs to rely on taxes to run ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Why is the magic number 40k for SA+MA? Why is it important to leave 20k in OA?,btohqsg
It all depends on your personal CPF strategy. I personally invest my OA and it has a higher yield than SA. You can only utilise the amounts excess of 20k.If you have absolutely no use for OA till retirement  then you can full force transfer everything to SA. There is no wrong or right.,btohqsg
Oh I see. Im not savvy in investments and my risk appetite is very low. So i prefer to shift my OA to SA for that risk-free 4%.  In addition  i have no plans to buy a house or invest using OA.,btohqsg

If I am not wrong  will receive 0.3% Cashback only,btohqsg
I checked  don't have any cashback if don't meet.,btohqsg
I recall 0  there was a time I missed by a few bucks and the following month I couldn't redeem anything.0.3% only applies to non contactless  non online  eligible spend. Even on t&c it states clearly cashback only awarded if hit $500 min spend  unlike other cards which states will get 0.3% cashback if did not hit min spend.,btohqsg

Maybank Horizon Visa Signature Card or Maybank Visa Infinite Card,btohqsg
Hi  I‚Äôm trying to pay my annual insurance via cardup (using uob privimiles visa). My agent (Prudential) sent me a link where they require giro payments from bank/credit card. But from cardup‚Äôs end it seems to be keying in insurance policy number and payment amount. My agent told me it may be possible to just pay via cardup without their link. If so  it seems like i cannot pay for all insurance policies in a single cardup transaction. Seems like i have to pay separately and key in the insurance policies separately. Anyone experts who paid to prudential previously?,btohqsg
What I do is to setup eGIRO with DBS via Prudential website  then cancel the GIRO arrangement on DBS internet banking (so they can't deduct from my account or card). Then setup CardUp to pay Prudential on due date. Setup each policy individually.,btohqsg

If i understood you correctly  its linking my dbs to prudential via giro. But log in to dbs and cancel it. Then how do i pay via cardup to prudential? Its just payment > prudential > amount + insurance policy?,btohqsg
hi guys  does anyone have an example of UOB credit card statement with giro as the payment method? e.g.  HSBC EGA paying for the billalso  for tax could i confirm  if it's YA2024  does that mean IRAS is looking at your income in year 2023? and if they state tax rebate for YA2024  it's for when we pay our taxes for the income year 2023 in say apr 2024? sorry if this sounds confusing üòÇ,btohqsg
Is the linking to dbs necessary? Because this is my first payment to my new insurance policy,btohqsg
When you select Insurance payment on CardUp  the instructions are pretty clear. Just need to follow that's all. Best if you have the insurance policy number  premium amount and promo code ready on hand.,btohqsg

Yes i do have the details ready. Is it possible to pay multiple insurance policies in 1 payment? Or must i split?,btohqsg
Initial premium then can skip the eGIRO step. Just setup CardUp will do.,btohqsg
