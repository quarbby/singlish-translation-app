pricness cove built by singapore company,btohqsg
Anyone here tested the new MB C class ?,btohqsg
U mean the construction company? Who? Thanks,btohqsg
Princess cove is built by Chinese company r&f. They are defaulting bonds. Bk soon. Beware,btohqsg
Anyway all weak now except Vanke,btohqsg
Worst is resale condo can only sell above 1m to foreigners. How to sell when they keep building? The major source is Chinaman n currently they have no buying power due to lockdown n impending interest rate hike.amen,btohqsg
Malaysian will not buy the condo coz u can buy landed with these prices. Those who bought will only face heart pains,btohqsg
We're being added to a scam group!,btohqsg
He's now called 21  not 24  maybe 3 of the bots died and he got moved up in rank!,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok lah‚Ä¶. They buy what they want and we buy what we want‚Ä¶.:),btohqsg
It's not what I mean. I mean hard luck selling as the pool is so small,btohqsg
developer pacific star that developed opne degree 15,btohqsg
unknowingly. all the time. all the time,btohqsg
Yes‚Ä¶ I also realized I got added to a lot of groups ever since I join sg carmart,btohqsg
this is the one i talked abouthttps://www.putericoveresidences.com/,btohqsg
"singapore company. ""puteri cove"" condo. also means ""princess cove""",btohqsg
I think that one is just beside one is name r&f princess cove another is puteri cove residences,btohqsg
Oh now I realized what u try to say. Sorry bro. I only stayed as princess cove as I can walk under the bridge from custom previously. This time round I drive in,btohqsg
This morning polite wax RM 200 my car damn clean and shiny. Song song. Petrol full tank coming home,btohqsg
the china r&f princess cove aint good at all. i have seen the condo. wherease Puteri Cove by singapore developer modeled after the MBS hotels. truly posh top class lounge is like hotel,btohqsg
Still all resale to foreigner has to be above 1m,btohqsg
Sure lose for sure unless there is a goondoo,btohqsg
Ya not selling one‚Ä¶. Many but to rent out   too ex to buy Pte in SG et etc,btohqsg
also remove all the Bens scammers,btohqsg
that banned Ben says he aint banned. he is so proud of his scamming skills,btohqsg
this is the same one you thought you removed,btohqsg
I will need more than just his display name. Do you have a screenshot of his user profile?,btohqsg
he dint let me see. he is boasting you  didnt actually remove him. he though i dont know IT,btohqsg
well if  a person has multiple accounts using different phone # it becomes difficult to do such ban. only way is for telegram to ban the main one i had encounters with him. then it becomes inconvenience,btohqsg
But we actually removed him from the group already,btohqsg
i know this is removed. but he used another account. and he thinks we are stupid.,btohqsg
you removed him but not telegram. he interacts with me until finally gave him the boot,btohqsg
That‚Äôs good to hear. Glad you are vigilant against scammersüëçüèª,btohqsg
Subsequently if anyone PMs you  pls don‚Äôt entertain his messages. Instead  immediately block and report him as spam,btohqsg
he boasts he is a hacker. i challenegd him go ahead and hack me.,btohqsg
U can‚Äôt stop them‚Ä¶ can only be vigilant‚Ä¶ if things are too good to be true‚Ä¶ most likely it‚Äôs a scam,btohqsg
Buy the performance model   basic model battery and performance lose out a lot for a fraction of the price,btohqsg
this car is cheaper than bezza 100k car,btohqsg

i'm looking for places in msia too,btohqsg
thinking of tesla to park in malaysia to play,btohqsg
Wa Lao‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like that kind of kungfu show that the person can project many imagesIf himself and u cannnot hit the real one,btohqsg
And then they all laugh together at the same time,btohqsg
i have a malaysian simcard prepaid and what do you think? i can also join sgcarmart too.  of course i aint scammer,btohqsg
When they don‚Äôt even have super charger network now,btohqsg
Along New York hotel the street,btohqsg
ooh ok i think i know where,btohqsg

U guys saw those CHr with 2 spoilers? Is it too ‚Äúfussy‚Äù?,btohqsg
