I got this for wpln and i think i kinda flunked it  i forgot everyt abt maths lol,btohqsg
Singapore is going through its own version of Japan's Lost Decade. Discuss.,btohqsg
the only nursing course at ite which was at the college east side will definitely have unlimited acceptanceLOL,btohqsg
even though there may be a lot of nursing or healthcare industry related students studying such specialisations or courses  there's still a dire lack of manpower in healthcare because the number of student intake doesn't simply match anywhere close to the number of local healthcare workers..,btohqsg
even a lot of dcotors in polyclinic & hospitals are being recruited from overseas now,btohqsg
But the enrolled nurses basic salary cnt match my salary now.. im at a loss lol,btohqsg
maybe you can approach a HR on how you can workaround this?,btohqsg
just for reference  my dad has a psle cert from the 1970s  he's also a sec sch dropout and did a he works for a WPLN assessment (because he literally couldn't read a lot of those basic to intermediate english vocabulary words or understand grammar + punctuation rules / formatting )  thought he's worked at a logistics company his 2nd older brother introduced him to work together at the same companyit's been nearly 2 decades and only pretty recently (like maybe 2-3 years ago) did he get a position raise and extra salary increase because my second uncle ( dad's ‰∫åÂì• ) is now considered the Director with no salary  he's just relying on his pension funds and savings ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
a decade where there is a believe that nothing particularly special happened during the decade so much to the point  it could be forgettable,btohqsg
what makes you say so  tho,btohqsg
The Lost Decade in Japanese history was a period starting in the 1990s and only ending arguably in the 2020s  marked by decline of both the Japanese economy and its standing on the world stage,btohqsg
Singapore standing on world stage is always low . to them  just a small island,btohqsg
Japan's Lost Decade was precipitated by the loss of its position a technological leader in an economy with few other star sectors (anime would only rise much later),btohqsg
i meant why do you reference Japan's Lost Decade to Singapore,btohqsg
Our economy and to a lesser degree what influence we have (we used to be regularly known as the country that punches above our weight) was built upon a world order that prized our ability to act as the ultimate neutral go-between between the East  especially China  and the West. That was our killer app  much like how Japanese technical advancement was theirs. The West has lost faith in that  seeing us as getting too close to China or even no different from China.,btohqsg
i mean to a certain extent.. yea,btohqsg
but definitelynot comparable  nowhere close at allwith other nations  city or countries in general that had decades of lost hisotry,btohqsg
Singapore is not the same ...,btohqsg
Even our politicians have become a bit ÊÄÇ in recent years  especially compared with China's more aggressive tone. This was a country that was for a long time famously assertive,btohqsg
don't get me wrong but the peak was during LKY had the reigns,btohqsg
tbf the west loosing faith in us looks like a rouse  considering they still choosing to dock their military ships in singapore ports. while partnering with china in technological fields..We are treading a thin line these last few years,btohqsg
it all fell apart when his kids in the family started having all the weird internal family conflicts,btohqsg
Locations of all the US naval fleet groups as of nov 25,btohqsg
"singapore was always having to thread on thin ice (be careful) with political ties and trying to maintain neutrality or it's ""wait-and-see"" stance before making decisions",btohqsg
no one can change my mind on that,btohqsg
if yall been on cruise ships  you will know this port,btohqsg
because many more countries stirs away from USA?,btohqsg
even MP Gan Siow Huang of PAP who was an ex-bridgadier general in the army  and current Minister of State for Manpower & Education   of Marymount Single-Member Constituency  confirmed this in a Q&A session of a Students Perspective  Dialogue Talk,btohqsg
they have one right in sg,btohqsg
only these few in the whole world?,btohqsg
no if you want the whole world..wait a moment,btohqsg
and want to see army too,btohqsg
"you can't judge political relations or how close political ties are with different nations based on a single idea that ""location of XX companies or army base"" somewhere",btohqsg
these are the only ones in asia,btohqsg
i mean if you are not friendly with a country  you wont plop a naval base there LOL,btohqsg
tbf alot of people think we dont have a US naval base here  alot of people just think they are visiting us,btohqsg
ok i mean to put it out there  this base we have in sg is not a naval base  its a logistic base for the US Navy,btohqsg
"bro  did you forget to consider stuff like land rights authority  the stability of THEIR currency vs OURS ( or basically a currency that can ""sometimes"" go on par almost comparably with those country currencies that have a very high market price )  NATURAL / LOCAL materials +  amenities + resources offered with ease?",btohqsg
a military base isn't some tourist spot for anyone to come and go,btohqsg
idk where you came to the conclusion i thought that,btohqsg
even those logistics services delivering service goods INTO the camps / base  CANNOT drive inside if they don't have a visit pass registered in the system,btohqsg
i mean when i meant visit  its like malaysia's case. where they dock at their commercial port..but there is no actual us navy installation therewhere sg case is significantly different,btohqsg
SG Exams Discord long discussions on wars,btohqsg
not a tom dick harry  just decide to walk into a port,btohqsg
refer to the message i reacted with a ü•¥ emoji,btohqsg
broooo  you're using malaysia as a reference,btohqsg
yea because you were thinking i was talking about civillians,btohqsg
i was considering the wider picture  generally speaking,btohqsg
its the latest port they have visited,btohqsg
your point was how sg no longer has any US military bases here,btohqsg
