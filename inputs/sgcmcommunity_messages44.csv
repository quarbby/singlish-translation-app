Is the SUV era slowly on its way out?What do you think is the next trend in the automotive industry?🤔👉🏻 Let us know what you think!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
just see how popular yaris  corolla cross version can liao,btohqsg
then those X1  GLA all super popular also,btohqsg
Why do you guys think it’s dying down,btohqsg
that said the cupra cross is very nice,btohqsg
i think if anyt MPV is dying,btohqsg
odyssey  estima  c4 all discontinued :/,btohqsg
True dat. And is it me or are MPVs not a conti kind of thing?,btohqsg
in europe the MPVs all japanese maybe apart frm the renault espace  scenic  chrysler grand voyager all,btohqsg
also the bmw tourings  the audi avants  the taycan turismo,btohqsg
I saw a Mercedes R-Class before. Pretty cool! Didn’t get to see its interior tho,btohqsg
R class looks like smaller vellfire / alphard,btohqsg
just have a few more kids and buy a bus,btohqsg
Seems to be pretty rare in SG,btohqsg
I wonder SG have any campervans,btohqsg
i find it insane that toyota sells its granace for like 280k,btohqsg
it’s a literal van with seats and windows,btohqsg
GLA cheap previouslyOlder model127 000 can out,btohqsg
Sell house  buy campervan and survive on a gym membership,btohqsg
Odyssey 2.0 EV still available via PIEstima no more? Maybe because the Toyota Noah/Voxy/ sell better.Vellfire no more left Alphard,btohqsg
🚨LATEST PETROL PRICES🚨Petrol prices at SPC and Sinopec have dropped🥳,btohqsg
The 2.0 is new oneNew engine😅,btohqsg
Government bring in Petronas Petroleum la. Discount 95ron😂👍For building the relationship of twot country Malaysia and Singapore,btohqsg
Yup Honday Odyssey because of Carbon emissions regulation in EuropeDon't think so for Honday Odyssey Hybrid. Meet carbon emissions regulation in Europe,btohqsg
Anyone know JB where can get durian,btohqsg
Can try I’m Musang King Durian,btohqsg
Usually fromt brake pad can last how many years,btohqsg
But they should wear out faster than your rears,btohqsg
Less people need 7 seats these days as nuclear families are on the rise. Smaller crossovers offer the looks of full size SUVs at sedan prices and offers enough space for their day to day haulage,btohqsg
They aren't because most conti brands tend to have crossovers and SUVs,btohqsg
And small vans which don't work well in the Asian market,btohqsg
Can ramp up but 3 cylinders?!,btohqsg
if u drive very little  2 years should change. Ideally about 50-60k shld start to change,btohqsg
unless u drive like a maniac then might be earlier,btohqsg
Some cars 30 to 40k also need to change,btohqsg
So my first answer was good hor?,btohqsg
You hybrid? Hybrid can last very very long😂,btohqsg
During servicing the mechanic never check?,btohqsg
Should have check. They normally would upsell and ask you change pad😂,btohqsg
https://sgsienta.proboards.com/thread/97/when-change-front-brake-padfirst stop I like to check local user forums,btohqsg
Next time I buy you ice cream,btohqsg
learning from #1 VS Angel in Singapore,btohqsg
U Never join SG sienta Facebook group?,btohqsg
Because. Here everyone drive different cars and styles.  Some go for special aftermarket pads some more,btohqsg
My current issues  i change my front pad at yr 2019 and then i change my rear pad in 2022,btohqsg
Yes we all learning from you sir. THE VS Angel in SGCM and some say Batam.,btohqsg
Now morning  i brake got sound coming from the brake,btohqsg
At what mileage did you change fronts?,btohqsg
90% of braking comes from your front. If you change in 2019  about time to change,btohqsg
You go ask workshop about the sound and try to replicate,btohqsg
oh jb cannot already. JB volvos all so fierce,btohqsg
Cause brake sound not only from brake pads,btohqsg
Can be issues with brake lines also,btohqsg
Still can. You will still be Number One. Because you are Volvo Singapore Angel.,btohqsg
And after parking at office  evenings drive off. Also braking got screeching sound,btohqsg
Yes so follow that range 56k to 64k ish,btohqsg
if got issue go mechanic and check again,btohqsg
Ok will go back to the workshop,btohqsg
It is likely that your brake pads never bed in properly,btohqsg
If people ask you put WD40  don’t listen to them 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Or your rotors got uneven wear so a bit,btohqsg
Check before changing pads how much life you have as well,btohqsg
Then need to change rotors or something,btohqsg
imagine ur brakeline burst😂😂look ma  no brakes!,btohqsg
With that mileage likely low life remaining. Like me.,btohqsg
I'm guessing if 45k done alr,btohqsg
Mr ong  if you end up having to change rotors  change brake pads together one shot,btohqsg
Then bed in properly for optimum performance,btohqsg
Don’t worry we all learning too,btohqsg
I got a regular work shop,btohqsg
Everyone learning till they go six feet under,btohqsg
Can repair instead of replace a lot,btohqsg
Old school ones are good for general mechanical wear and tear items for sure!,btohqsg
They told me my front brake pad still can last 2 service,btohqsg
Take a look at it yourself,btohqsg
They dont up sell thats why i go to them,btohqsg
Better than those “screeching sound? Change pads  rotors  calipers and brake line”,btohqsg
The sound is loud  my cabin also can hear,btohqsg
Question: are these original installed from Toyota? If aftermarket  any reason behind the choice?,btohqsg
The workshop recommends this to me,btohqsg
At the point of time my rear pad aready less than 15%,btohqsg
No guru. Just working on being less “gundu” 😁 rest welll too sir!,btohqsg
Got dust? Go petrol station and use the air pump to clear,btohqsg
Anyone know Where to buy skoda kodiaq wiper ?,btohqsg

No wrong answers   I would appreciate your individual opinion,btohqsg

Also considering the global economy  not really the best time to be buying a car,btohqsg

Isnt it more from the rental cos?,btohqsg
Waaa new AMG C43 has 400BHP powered by a Turbo 2.0L stock 😱,btohqsg
more like for the showroom or customer facing roles i believe,btohqsg
They wanna reduce carbon emissions base on EU carbon footprints regulations. Not sure how long can the engine last before Kaboom 😂F1 engine 1 600cc v6 around 1000 bhp,btohqsg

Feels like more of a celeb or ceremonial role 😅,btohqsg
Evo 102 000cc 276-446 BHP😅10yrs ago  engine,btohqsg
Yeah lo. After setting up 2 show room. It's enough😂Small country😅Not like Malaysia.East and West Malaysia 😂,btohqsg
Most large companies still to some extent need such roles but for Tesla not exactly because the automotive market isnt big here,btohqsg
E.g BMW’s Lars Nielsen alone is enough to watch over the APAC market alr.,btohqsg
but also  customer facing roles here also dun need to be too fat  just staff enough to guide the customers to book the cars themselves can alr,btohqsg
in fact can just do at home dun even need to go to showroom,btohqsg
Many still see car purchases as an emotive purchase so like to go to the showroom for a “feel of the product”?,btohqsg
Ya fair. Can just go test drive alr then go home and buy,btohqsg
After all they are not cheap here I guess ..,btohqsg
I think polestar is alr kinda starting to do this alr,btohqsg
Yes that’s true especially given the very limited options available anyway,btohqsg
Well ya it’s again the same topic alr. D2C better or dealership model better,btohqsg
To each of our own I guess,btohqsg
If cutting away middleman fat helps transfer some of the savings to the consumers.,btohqsg
Both models have pros and cons.,btohqsg
Sometimes there is benefit to having large dealer represent interest of brand population here especially in product issues,btohqsg
Though I find dealers in general aft you see the oneMotoring data  are really blood suckers. The margins are eye popping,btohqsg
Evo 9 FQ400 are race focused cars  not sporty sedans ah,btohqsg
So yeah… really pros and cons here but I’m also generally a fan of D2C,btohqsg
Ya no point letting them earn the margins and on top of that  letting the SEs dictate loan and insurance. This is the most ridiculous bit ever,btohqsg
Remember how Dell disrupted the entire home computer market when they do D2C and introduce the $999 desktops of yesteryears haha,btohqsg
Don’t even get me started on their aftermarket margins but not eye popping service levels.,btohqsg
It’s just a uniquely SG thing I feel  the dealership thing.,btohqsg
dealership earn a lot more than the markups... they get so much comms from the massive loans itself,btohqsg
What I understand is  they will take a package from the banks. One fixed sum of loans at a certain rate then “sell” to the people who wanna borrow,btohqsg
Fixed? I thought each buyer the downpayment will be different cannot be all the same,btohqsg
Like they will take say… 500k of loans from banks and they provide these loans to the customers,btohqsg
That’s what I hear la but I could be wrong,btohqsg
Orh... that makes more sense... they take a lump sum of total disbursement and split up the meat to each buyer,btohqsg
Correct and they bring business to the banks. That’s how they earn by “forcing” you to take their loans,btohqsg
43 AMG45 AMG65 AMGAre not race focus engine meh?I tot is street legal race engine? LikeType RSTI??,btohqsg
Ok la not shady  at least is bank loan not those in house kind hahaha,btohqsg
Ya well but if we can take our own loans and insurance is always better la.,btohqsg
I asked before for $0 down for fd2,btohqsg
7 years  1xxx per month 🤪👍🏼,btohqsg
That's always better  even tho i always buy used cars the loans and insurance i always insist to get my own,btohqsg
At least they don’t mind that,btohqsg
You have to be smart and stand your own ground lor,btohqsg
But i always buy my first insurance from them. Easier anyways,btohqsg
Some fix the bank for you also lol hard pass,btohqsg
unless that bank happens to be the bank i use lmao,btohqsg
"They use very nice marketing words""exclusive tied-up""1.99%1.68%Ended up all rejected.Only Accepted by HL bank 2.20% 😂",btohqsg
Reject becoz of the credit rating right of the buyer,btohqsg
No la 😂 they don't even work with those bank or commission too low,btohqsg
If  bad credit  no bank will take. Even Hitachi Capital or Tokyo century will reject😂 only in house loan,btohqsg
In house loan meant higher interest rates also,btohqsg
High risk if the dealer cannot pay finance.Finance company come and toll car even if you paid promptly every mth😂Unless the loan is direct apply through the credit company with you name😅,btohqsg

to be fair you see it is most markets around the world.  given a chance  wouldn't we?,btohqsg
Ya  but hopefully as a whole the automotive industry needs to move away from that model as much as possible,btohqsg
just my personal observation but many local buyers actually don't really (or too rich or too lazy or too trusting in fancy looking dealers) do their own homework and stand up for their own rights - even though they are the customer and it is their hard earned money at the end of the day.,btohqsg
I find many owners actually feel proud they are sending their car back in to the AD workshop and even feel shy bargaining or pushing back on some of the 'recommended' work tasks,btohqsg
some even share happily what free lunch/coffee they are getting in the lounges while they wait for their car serviciing,btohqsg
so... i think whatever rocks one boat ba?,btohqsg

What they don't tell you: The downsides of installing a big brake kitHave you considered these 5 things before installing a BBK?👉🏻 React with 👍🏻 if you have!👉🏻 React with 😁 if you must have your BBK no matter what!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Most important thing about have bbk  is tyres. Tyres are the only point of contact from the road to the car. No point having BBK but bald tyres. I would rather invest in a good set of performance tyres.Also  i feel like most cars in SG have BBK for aesthetic. BBK doesnt decrease the stopping distance but instead creates a more consistent braking distance over a long period of time. Honestly if you are not going to track of go up and down 99 like a lunatic  i dont think you need BBK,btohqsg
"Also  BBK voids AD warranty. There are many shitty BBK in the market that claims to be ""AP Racing"" or ""Brembo"". Yeah so if anybody is considering BBK  do make sure its authentic. Pretty sure no one wants a brake failure on the expressway with a jam ahead",btohqsg

Not sure because I'm thinking of installing some lights for my car roof interior but if too bright  it may distract other drivers so I guess that would be considered illegal😂,btohqsg
TP can’t stop you if they can’t chase you,btohqsg
They can get good pictures of the driver since lighting is so good in the car 🤭,btohqsg
I think don’t blind you can already,btohqsg
I put led strips in my car,btohqsg
Yours look like what from outside😂,btohqsg
Rmb to submit your dashcam footage to us if you do that LOL,btohqsg

Interior okay  exterior dont on while driving. I assume you are having underglow  only on while stationary,btohqsg
technically its a grey area but play safe dont on while driving,btohqsg
I see if I can find pictures,btohqsg
Finish my build then I put,btohqsg
ahaha which one u planning on buying,btohqsg
Personal car not sure will check thoroughly. Standard is Stars 🌟 LED roof. Or two long bar LED like the Alphard/Vellfire. Or console LED strip. During inspection don't on la😂Only Commercial van they check thoroughly,btohqsg
@JCVAGwatching the COE closely to make a decision on your car?,btohqsg
Interior lights can be as bright as you want I believe,btohqsg
A good model I've seen on a few people's cars is the Cardi k3,btohqsg
You can try looking for that one as it is more consistent across the panel and not brighter at the end,btohqsg

i’m looking at the vrs estate,btohqsg

yup! more worth that way for sure,btohqsg

but sometimes waiting time can be quite ridiculous,btohqsg
Gues it rlly depends on luck,btohqsg
in that case can start looking for other options alr,btohqsg
But if you have the capital  you can always go ahead first.,btohqsg
Hmm another option for me is avante,btohqsg
but that capital can be used better if coe drops hehe,btohqsg

nah  he is looking for 2nd hand isn't it,btohqsg
That one is very powerful. Still suck?,btohqsg
having sat between the Kona  Niro and HR-VNiro has the best rear space hands down.However Niro is more of a hatchback ride feel compared to HR-V/Vezel's more prominent SUV so might not fit the bill if you are looking for the SUV feeling,btohqsg
You buy crossover to get the SUV mah. If not you buy estate  stationwagon or hatchback liao,btohqsg
Yeah. Unless first hand cheap enough,btohqsg
Thanks man. Will check it out,btohqsg
