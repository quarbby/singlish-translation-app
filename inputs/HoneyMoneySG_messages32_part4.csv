Hi  is there any way I can charge my CC payment to AMEX through my UOB One debit card? I need to hit $500 min spend. Or is this an excluded transaction?,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm thinking of using Endowus fund smart,btohqsg
What fund would you recommend getting?,btohqsg
Does Citibank cash back+ or Uob one credit card count with physiotherapy payment at hospital?,btohqsg
Hmm I debited fresh funds of more than 2k and spent 5 transactions on my cc - all qualifying  from ntuc etc.,btohqsg
If you do 5 transactions on cc  they won't be counted towards everyday+So experts suggest to use account and do 5 fast transactions instead in order to be maximize cashback from cc,btohqsg
I saw cashback credited and received sms next day only,btohqsg
Like just transfer in and out of my EGa account 5 times?,btohqsg
1 transaction in (2k/5k) and 5 transactions out (can be as small as $1),btohqsg
Actually can use their cc to spend but cause need wait for posting and everything it a bit slow hence why people say use transfer out is faster and instant which better don‚Äôt want to waste cause their 5 transaction by CC don‚Äôt earn 1% hence wasted,btohqsg
Can. But won't get 1% cashback from ega,btohqsg
Yeah that what I meant can but wasteful   I also do transfer method,btohqsg
I think can do it before month end and it will be extended ü§î my is extended until March 31st,btohqsg

any repercussions to cancelling cards after a year? i know some people who sign up for the bonuses and let the card collect dust after and cancel 1 year later,btohqsg
they did not have a pay button,btohqsg
Do you have savings account with CITI? I also don't have pay button  cos I don't have savings acct with  CITI  so I pay from another bank savings account,btohqsg
ahhh I see  thanks. I don‚Äôt as well. What‚Äôs the most preferred payment method? Do I have to call them to ask which bank acct to transfer to?,btohqsg
I pay from my DBS Acct. Under pay & transfer you can key in your Credit card details. I will take few working days for your payment will arrive to your credit card acct,btohqsg
I think expedia is not being fair to me. The cost is $280 and just because they cant reach out to the hotels they conclude it cant be refunded while the payment was only made yesterday. Any advice on what should i do? $280 is too many $.,btohqsg
How come you can‚Äôt get any refund? Has it been over on the refund policy? If not  you could mentioned to bring in the press if issue is not being settled,btohqsg
