📱 A man & woman  aged 23 and 25 respectively  allegedly scammed S$360 000 via iPhone 13 & 14 listings on Carousell.➡️https://bit.ly/3sttJ8jFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
This is the “daily pay jobs” the scammer have been posting in here,btohqsg
Oh the one that they tell people go like the listing or what ah? - E,btohqsg
The one you said bye bye to,btohqsg
is the subject mainly about the driver speeding  or the make of the car ma’am? 🤓🤓,btohqsg
hahahaha the driver la - E,btohqsg
Then got BMW mentioned thrice in the message and the article so many times,btohqsg
With other articles on new outlets and sgrv as well,btohqsg
If it's a BMW/Mercedes or some other Conti brand  they tend to mention the brand enough times that it gets drilled in the readers head,btohqsg
While a similar article for a Japanese or more common car would only say driver of the car,btohqsg
It creates / promotes some… biaseness unintentionally sometimes…,btohqsg
You can say.. subject car was a BMW though,btohqsg
And then refer to driver as driver,btohqsg
What if the incident involves multiple drivers? Should we name them Driver 1  Driver 2  etc? Wouldn't that just be confusing? - E,btohqsg
Ultimately  the biasness comes from yourself. It is not our intention to create any unhappiness for owners of any specific car brands 🤗 - E,btohqsg
In that case sure  use identifying factors,btohqsg
But in this case there's a traffic light  a driver and a rider,btohqsg
And we did address this issue in the entry as well.,btohqsg
What the fudge to that guy,btohqsg
Sauce also come out… I’m really struggling to keep up guys,btohqsg
Exactly my point - which is why i chose to single out this comment to address the branding issue ~ We are not biased towards or against any car brands. Fair for all - we only tekan the drivers hehe - E,btohqsg
Thus why “Driver 1 in the BM  Driver 2 in the Merc  Rider 1 on the Yamaha” should be used at the start the rest of the article is calls them by Driver 1 and 2. Pretty much like all court document.,btohqsg
I think they should revamp the punishment for traffic related offences,btohqsg
If they can up the summon for illegal exhaust,btohqsg
Why not for the rest of the offences,btohqsg
If it was really not biased towards or against any car brands. The drivers should be what they are called. Without the brands,btohqsg
Few years in jail for taking away innocent life is like a slap on the wrist. - E,btohqsg
All those small small offences only,btohqsg
They haven’t change the big ones,btohqsg
