You don't see the same eagerness to do more in their lives as much as how the people before the 2000s went through theirs. Like you could almost see the lives of these people 20-30 years into the future because of how predictable everybody has become,btohqsg
There was a time when self improvement was more of a personal choice than a societal choice. I wonder why that changed,btohqsg
That's not self improvement  the kind of self improvement I'm talking about is picking up more skills rather than wait until shit hits the fan then decide it's time to pick up more skills,btohqsg
ryan why are you active everywhere then,btohqsg
"""picking up more skills"" and how do you do that? You converse with people",btohqsg
go talk to more ppl irl instead of conversing with ppl you barely know online,btohqsg

I mean I got a great example  in the past if people were required to close a store  most would see it like it's a golden once in a lifetime opportunity...nowadays you tell these same aged kids to close a store  they see it as a added chore,btohqsg
There is no idea in that sentence,btohqsg
It's just words put together to form a sentence that has no meaning,btohqsg
Maybe i just have bad reading comprehension bug there's no logic,btohqsg
Eagerness to do something that you could do once in your life  you don't see that anymore.,btohqsg
Or even a basis in reality,btohqsg
Like are u just saying that,btohqsg
People are less eager to chase after once in a lifetime opportunities,btohqsg
What if I give u 10 million now to do smth would u not do it,btohqsg
And this is the only time u will get the 10 million,btohqsg
What is one once in a lifetime opportunity you been thinking of chasing?,btohqsg
