50/50 is the way insurance sign off for each other,btohqsg

We are supposed to drive with road conditions,btohqsg
So if means if road all going 90  u R SUPPOSE TO GO 90 unless u are a heavy veh,btohqsg
Otherwise u are required to keep left,btohqsg
If road conditions is 50 and u gng 90 then yes U ARE THE PROBLEM then,btohqsg
Don't say. Ltr they say U talk only,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ all the sohai. I just damn disgusted with lane 2 and 3 heavy vehicles hogging,btohqsg
In any lane or ? Land 2 also cannot?,btohqsg
No la. Lane 2 is slow lane,btohqsg
If u really need to ask me this qn means u shud surrender ur license and retake BTT lol,btohqsg
But eitherways to guy who got sideswiped,btohqsg
Report police hit n run and claim insurance lo,btohqsg
For all yk he report to his own insurance liao,btohqsg
Problem  is hit n run n side swipe is 2 separate matters,btohqsg
Both insurance will play 50/50 to close case n move on,btohqsg
So lane 2 must go at 90?,btohqsg
Cos I always stay at 60/70,btohqsg
Lane 1 suppose to be empty n used for overtaking only,btohqsg
Lane 2 is for vehicles travelling to the speed limit of expressway,btohqsg
Actually yes. Purpose of lane 1 is solely for overtaking,btohqsg
So lane 1 is used for overtaking slow pokes on lane 2,btohqsg
But when lane 3 n 4 is faster than lane 2  then tht idiot on lane 2 is the problem,btohqsg
So if u wanna cruise  jt shud be left. In other countries where expressway lane only 2 lanes  lane 1 is solely overtaking slower or heavy vehicles w speed limits. Then if u on lane 1 w a faster vehicle coming  u are expected to give way,btohqsg
