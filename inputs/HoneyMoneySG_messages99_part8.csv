Hi  my UOB One account 31 Mar balance was 25.5k. MAB was 10.7k for Mar. I registered for incremental fresh fund of 50k for the savings promo.Therefore  to qualify and get the $250 cash prize  should my maintaining balance be 75.5k or 60.7k?,btohqsg
60.7k  60.8k to be safe.You verified with excel that it's 10.7k?,btohqsg
Yes. I calculated based on my Mar statement. Thanks!,btohqsg
I got sc bonus saver ... So use this to clock 3 of $50 payment of,btohqsg
Hi  just want to check which credit card is best to start out with  with miles as the main focus? (Based on the recent nerf and changes to the point),btohqsg
Can take a look at this: more popular options are citi rewards+amaze for simplicity (exclude travel and public transport)https://youtu.be/ejWZOXCykbg?si=3sgH0wL4oUsTz-Ff,btohqsg
Can we transfer a fixed amount from one bank account to another own account using GIRO especially DBS?unable to find any guide,btohqsg
Under ‚Äúset up standing instruction‚Äù in dbs iBanking,btohqsg
Is Dental also eligible for 3.33% cb? I don‚Äôt see it in exclusion list so just wanna be sure,btohqsg
https://www.lemon8-app.com/flyingalive/7244873140936049153?region=sgCan anyone confirm if this salary bank transfer hack from dbs/posb to uob still works to get higher interest on uob today?,btohqsg
Some places may seemed like restaurants but they actually code as fast food 5814. Eg Sukiya  toast box  isteaks. Be careful to check them before using,btohqsg
I want to cancel two cards which one should I cancel and why??Dbs woman word master cardHSBC revolutionCity rewardsUOB platinum visaUOB signature visa,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt like 5 dollar block üòÖ,btohqsg
Do share why you wanna cancel 2 and what‚Äôs your habit / requirements,btohqsg
I got too many. And I‚Äôm thinking of applying UOB Kris flyer master card instead for no cap spending 3 miles per dollar.Looking at more higher cap..,btohqsg
Consolidate your miles and keep both UOB cards you‚Äôve listed. The rest depends‚Ä¶. WWMC has 12 month expiry only but if you can accumulate enough a year to transfer 10K miles out then no issue  CRMC is quite strong with only travel being excluded  HSBC recently got nerfed but still useful for dining or ride hailing.I would say CRMC covers WWMC and HSBC Rev. The travel that can‚Äôt be covered by CRMC will be covered by UOB KF cardComplement with UOB lady‚Äôs and you can charge dining or travel to it too. 9X points not subjected to $5 blocks for lady‚Äôs so that‚Äôs a good thing,btohqsg
Interesting view.UOB KF has no cap  right? Which is really good.,btohqsg
Any lobang for holding USD accounts in SG?,btohqsg
Ive been told that for SCB usd account - have transaction charges for withdrawals,btohqsg
UserHalifihas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no shopee links,btohqsg

Does anyone know what is the MCC for the below transactions:1. Paying for food at Kopitiam using the Fairprice app2. Paying for groceries at NTUC using the Fairprice appWanna figure out which card to use to maximise miles,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword‚Äúkopitiam mcc‚Äù or ‚Äúgroceries mcc‚Äùto search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
"Basically both are their ""intended MCCs""",btohqsg
1. Fast food2. GroceriesNo harm using the search function the next time üòâ,btohqsg
Do you all pay for UOB krisflyer annual fee? Or is it waivable? From T&C the bonus miles only comes in after annual fee.,btohqsg
Hihi  wanna ask for citi reward  if I purchase something online via shopback that is linked to citi cards.Do i earn both the shopback + 4mpd,btohqsg

Hi all  new here. Wanted to check if UOB Stash at 5% interest for 100K is still the best option if I‚Äôm not looking at salary crediting and spending  just wanna park the funds somewhere.,btohqsg
It is 3% EIR not 5%. It has been discussed in this forum before. You can search for it.,btohqsg
Thanks. Just saw the fine print. Looks like upping to 150K and going for uob one seems like the next best alternative.,btohqsg
if your monthly average balance for Mar in Stash is $0  you can do the uob savings promo to earmark $100k and get additional cashback,btohqsg
New to UOB entirely. Planning to earmark the $150K to get the $1K with the current promotion.,btohqsg
If I deposit $10k  do I need to use all $10k to subscribe to the Cash Plus for the 6.8% or just hold the $10k deposit for 90 days and make 8 $1 subscription is enough?,btohqsg
if I pay shopee using gpay linked to uob one cc  no issues in getting the merchant cashback right?,btohqsg
Seems that it took 6 mths for singsaver to dish out rewards. Just gotten the reward for card I applied last year oct üòÇ,btohqsg
does anyone know if there's a cap to UOB one credit card's cashback?,btohqsg
The cashback is fixed to the tiers. Only additional cashback have cap.,btohqsg
