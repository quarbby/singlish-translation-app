There is cation at the cathode,btohqsg
And also electron reducing the cation at the cathode,btohqsg
Graphite only has mobile electrons.It cant have ions since it is a giant covalent compound.Copper has a giant metallic structure  thus fulfilling what the qn wants.,btohqsg
That's what I thought too. Only metals have both positive ions and mobile electrons,btohqsg
But in the electroysis graphite have positive ions and electrons too isn't it?,btohqsg
Although graphite has delocalised electrons the C atom electron orbitals are hybridised and the C atoms are not ions,btohqsg
Otherwise how is the cations being reduced,btohqsg
Shouldnt this be in the study grp btw,btohqsg
But i thot the electron come from the anion at the anode then down to the cathode?,btohqsg
But ya the electron flows thru the copper wire  enters the graphite cathode thru delocalisation and then gets transferred to the cations at the cathode,btohqsg
So it does have electrons during the process,btohqsg
Or is it my understanding abit weird,btohqsg
Bruh any more papers aft tmr??,btohqsg
Like maybe art paper 2 or smth like that,btohqsg
eh hi got anyone looking for discord nitro,btohqsg
In njc  whats the min requirement to qualify for H2 chem? Is it C6 or B3 in pure chem?,btohqsg
U be my secret buddy lor. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So u tell me in secret,btohqsg
lol now is not the period to be playin,btohqsg
nvm u hv 39 more hours,btohqsg
You wanted to go to some jv right i think,btohqsg
cant relate to ppl who found it easy,btohqsg
rotting in a large local institution,btohqsg
Bedok where do you wanna go btw,btohqsg
IMH is not institution of mental health,btohqsg
Farrer Park not same as farrer road,btohqsg
I ran from farrer road to farrer Park,btohqsg
lookin at ur guessin skills  may end up there at this rate,btohqsg
ya i was saying ME LOL,btohqsg
Is copper carbonate turquoise or green,btohqsg
Hahah i guess for such qns look out for more obvious wrong answers (:,btohqsg
Which is why donâ€™t skip options,btohqsg
I guess the publisher want us to think that CuCO3 is blue,btohqsg
I put the circle when i was doing it,btohqsg
U left mcq right? Then shouldnâ€™t be a concern but somehow therr write its blue LOL,btohqsg
I guess this is out of ur syllabus but apparantly many sources say that ull form basic copper(ii) carbonate,btohqsg
Nvm i shld choose the more correct answer,btohqsg
Basic copper carbonate is prepared by combining aqueous solutions ofcopper(II) sulfateandsodium carbonateatambient temperature and pressure. Basic copper carbonate precipitates from the solution  with release ofcarbon dioxide2 CuSO4 + 2 Na2CO3 + H2O â†’ Cu2(OH)2CO3 + 2 Na2SO4 + CO2,btohqsg
But some info in wiki might not be reliable or biased. Just take note.,btohqsg
Ok  all the best to you!,btohqsg
if u all tried my p3,btohqsg
solubility the ksp basic basic one,btohqsg
got mole calculation v tedious but only like 2 or 3 marks,btohqsg
had to make another equation but not sure if correct,btohqsg
i dont expect cambridge to test Ksp qns on mass of ppt produced,btohqsg
then got basic equation formation based on number of electrons (combine 2 eqn),btohqsg
then got combustion of smtg just form eqn they tell u pdts also,btohqsg
then got find the percentage of Ar thing,btohqsg
then CLT cancelled out 13marks so yay,btohqsg
idk i thought they say 67,btohqsg
