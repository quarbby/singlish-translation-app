I met a Mazda 3 driver the other day who sold in 8 months to get a cla200  said Mazda is crap. I guess everyone has their own preferences and what they are looking for,btohqsg

I once took him in my Alfa blasting to kl. I almost ran off the roads in a fast corner. I got a shock myself too and he Al’s it couldn’t talk. Luckily can pull it back thanks to good Alfa handling.He is typical sinkie who couldn’t believe malaysian highway roads. That made him change his view to a positive one.Eventually he says Mercedes is best!,btohqsg

There should be an issue with the turbocharger or the ignition system.. Mine is always in the forefront of the traffic light dash... 😜😜😜 Beat many hybrid cars and also 2ltr cars,btohqsg
Audi 1.0 is a 3 cylinder engine and the engine is rougher as the balancing is not optimal though they do have a counter-bane shaft to reduce vibration,btohqsg
6 years ago my friend bought a new a4 from ad only 110 k lol,btohqsg
Need to do dsg tune to remove the lag,btohqsg
Then he tell me can do the tuning to increase power,btohqsg
aiya nvm still looks very good haha,btohqsg
Lol thanks bruh.. Ya look only 😂,btohqsg
a wiseman once told me told me. if you cant be fast  look fast.,btohqsg
It's the nut behind the wheel that makes the difference 😅,btohqsg
U don’t laught at me la,btohqsg
At the car wash just now the Indian offered to polish my car for rm300. Worth ti? Soft99 Japanese product,btohqsg
You’re Tesla owner. Any other than Tesla is cheap!,btohqsg
People laughing at tesla is a cheap car and look cheap and lousy interior and made in China,btohqsg
Made in China will surpass Koreans Japanese,btohqsg
Haha it doesn’t bother me hehe,btohqsg
While on bmw a parts guy told me he tested his friend’s Tesla 3 and he says absolutely best feeling.,btohqsg
I asked him if better than bmw driving sensations he says 100%! 😱,btohqsg
Seems that u become tesla fan boy alos,btohqsg
Luckily I’m aint bmw ego maniac. I’ll say what I think is good or bad regardless of brands.  No emotions,btohqsg
I’ve become long ago. As early as 2019. I almost bought in 2021 last year,btohqsg
I was like hoping maybe coe comes down but it decided to go up and up.,btohqsg
Bro I don’t laugh. I admire the product.,btohqsg
Instead I laugh at those who say door gaps don’t fit nicely poor product quality fit finish. They don’t see the bigger picture,btohqsg
okay whats the bigger picture? if a car comes with big panel gaps then quality control is not good.,btohqsg
The bigger picture is the better driving enjoyment and potential for bigger things like Fsd etc,btohqsg
The potential what it can do,btohqsg
Shanghai modeL 3 so far really never got panel gap issue,btohqsg
Maybe those made in Fremont are. Well initially they are like that as techniques get improved these will be non issues,btohqsg
That’s why I want to try out yours. Coffee on me when you’re back.,btohqsg
Can la when I back on the 8 th June afterward,btohqsg
Can kopi and go for a spin,btohqsg
Must be the b8  last year it was sold was late 2015 to 2016. AD was eager to get the units out before the B9 generation landed,btohqsg
I go measure at mw showroom already. Those 2 units also have mah,btohqsg
But if one ignores that and wants the FSD and Tesla hype  good buy 👍,btohqsg
Tesla does have hype  like other brands such as Supreme  Jordan  etc. Tesla does owe a portion of its sales to hype created by Elon and influencers buying and influencing young ones to buy also.,btohqsg
If the product ain’t good hype won’t last. Hype is short term. But the fact is it’s accepted all over the world says they product is good. Even in Germany.,btohqsg
Product is good. But there's better stuff out there :) but I respect if you like it!,btohqsg
