cos i also got the card  but dont use it lol,btohqsg
it basically acts as a bank card la but idrk if u can insert into atm  didnt try,btohqsg
u pay whatever as usual   but they will calculate how much extra it takes to nearest dollar,btohqsg
i like their money pot function oso lor cuz its actual money,btohqsg
helps u make sure u transfer in,btohqsg
they don't actually pay you do they?I cant wrap my head ard it can share more? HAHAH,btohqsg
lets say u have a transaction 10.30,btohqsg
u pay 10.30 they give u 70 cents,btohqsg
even the best cashback card out there I was seeing is like 2-3% on every purchase,btohqsg
This doesn't make sense that its giving u more than thay,btohqsg
Because then everyome would just use this? Hahaha,btohqsg
cuz its round up to nearest dollar,btohqsg
Ok then that makes alot of sense,btohqsg
hugo is not rly for a cashback app,btohqsg
okok i think i gets what ure sayingg,btohqsg
Like the sum of ur daily transactions,btohqsg
hahah bcos the each transaction here makes methink u can get alot of $ haha,btohqsg
i mean if u have like 10 2.10 transactions per day,btohqsg
And from what i am seeing on the site it says the rounded up amount is deducted from yr account though,btohqsg
cuz i oso dk how explain,btohqsg
"they will take the ""cashback"" from your account and place it in the goldpot thing",btohqsg
so in essence  youre not getting cashback,btohqsg
maybe yall can consider DBS Livefresh Credit Card for students,btohqsg
if u dont turn off round up by the end of the day,btohqsg
Hahah the former sounds too good to be truee,btohqsg
my standchart debit use to clock about 10SGD in cashback per mth,btohqsg
Yala so what ahboi say whats right what,btohqsg
i only transf myself 10.60 for the transaction,btohqsg
the roundoff takes frm ur acct,btohqsg
thanks for explainin tho HAHAH appreciate,btohqsg
idk la i see got extra abit i heck care liao,btohqsg
