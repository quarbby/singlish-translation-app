"guys is it me or do i feel like my poly mates are all the ""dont want do work type""",btohqsg
meanwhile I‚Äôm finding my sugar daddy so if u may excuse me,btohqsg
maybe..but half my class has to remod and i dont,btohqsg
i still harping onto that fact lmao,btohqsg
i study bio at o level standard i study physics at poly standard  with no o level background,btohqsg
but that‚Äôs bcz you take that course.. my course is biz,btohqsg
my bio knowledge stopped at sec 2,btohqsg
and my teachers are like u should have learnt this in sec physics,btohqsg
you can't just judge on that based off my gpa tho,btohqsg
because you have no idea how i got those bad grades,btohqsg
OMG IW TAKE PIC OF MY GRIFFLWS,btohqsg
u can take the year 3 stuff of like other diplomas,btohqsg
@disembodiedredflagimagine competing with losers to justify urself,btohqsg
as long as within science sch,btohqsg
my course no elective or specialisation.. too specialised alr.. but I got internship lo,btohqsg
i think im retarded bc i only compare with high fliers,btohqsg
will ur employer judge u based off circumstances?,btohqsg
anyone else isnt worth comparing against,btohqsg
(im not a high flier at all),btohqsg
at least i ord in 272 days,btohqsg
also means I‚Äôm stuck with the same 28 other people for 3 years,btohqsg
nah they dont judge at all,btohqsg
at least i don‚Äôt ns ü•π,btohqsg
are they good or they suck,btohqsg
oh great uw see my class,btohqsg
i did not even got for a interview for my part time work,btohqsg
"i wanted to say ""go"" lmao",btohqsg
are we ignoring the ‚Äúa interview‚Äù,btohqsg
since our dear futureofryan says that employers dont see cert,btohqsg
i apply to in jp morgan now,btohqsg
i think his employer diff case la,btohqsg
nah i think i said my employers,btohqsg
bc employers no look at grades,btohqsg
i mean some don‚Äôt.. but certification is a must.. just the value of it doesn‚Äôt justify which position in the company you‚Äôll get,btohqsg
I forget future of Ryan is like the messiah of knowledge,btohqsg
when u see them in nus law,btohqsg
Bro is so wise and so great,btohqsg
the shit yall keep buying online,btohqsg
bro spawned after a long time,btohqsg
i make sure they dont end up going missing,btohqsg
I thought everyone forgot about me,btohqsg
take it with a grain of salt,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt I take it as it is,btohqsg
You might be the reincarnation of Christ,btohqsg
yes I und that certification is impt.. but Uni drop out brother earns 5 figures a month.. it‚Äôs about experience. ya u must have certification I get it. but experience ranks ur proficiency in the field.. unless you‚Äôre like law or med or engi then god u need cert or else you‚Äôre just going to flex tape airplane,btohqsg
ecommerice..so not only shopee but lazada,btohqsg
yall be buying the wierdest shit online i swear,btohqsg
some shit i did not even know exist to be bought online,btohqsg
eh why r u making fun  he‚Äôs just filling up time doing part time jobs since he rather get on his feet and do smt during the holidays,btohqsg
this is judging on the fact you want to work for someone,btohqsg
he shld spend his time bucking up on his gpa tbf,btohqsg
if i was in his place i wld be panicking rn,btohqsg
people have diff goals...not everyone want to climb the income ladder. If you want to just live a comfortable life and just have enough for daily needs...you dont need to even prove you have the capabilities to get more income (eg. get a better paying job),btohqsg
why settle for blue collar jobs,btohqsg
i put in the work still dont get what i want also,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt that the rifle NSMAN use,btohqsg
sometimes ppl need to fill the bottom spaces,btohqsg
ppl score damn hign also cannot get what they want,btohqsg
like he said  he‚Äôs not interested in studying. he rather just live a simple life. at least he chose to work than let his parents provide him everything right?? not everyone are jc fucks like you guys. not everyone can be as smart as y‚Äôall think u are. so please just stop degrading him. I understand his gpa is concerning but that doesn‚Äôt give you the say to constantly make fun of him and his gpa.,btohqsg
at the end of the day its up to the individual to decided what they wanna do,btohqsg
y‚Äôall think u good good for you. people have different aims in life.,btohqsg
thanks bedok i think it‚Äôs a very useful quote,btohqsg
"ngl..if someone wants to live the ""YOLO"" life...partying and spending their money all in the momment of fun in their prime. There is nothing wrong tbh",btohqsg
i mean its ur own life,btohqsg
lets put this situation like this...If another 2008 financial criss happen next yr...who is the one suffering the most?,btohqsg
Not me and its likely those people that decide to spend their money partying,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not really advocating shitting on someone for leading their life their way but,btohqsg
"if you spend money for ""fun""...its not wrong. But dont blame people for not living the same life as you",btohqsg
i know my gpa is bad..and yall are trying to knock some sense into me.,btohqsg
one of my mods is organic chem,btohqsg
trying to show me that my gpa will bring me no where etc...It dont take a rocket sicentist to realise that,btohqsg
Bro dont talk on other ppl stuff,btohqsg
despite personal circumstances doesn‚Äôt give you the right to judge the way people want to lead their life,btohqsg
might be trying their best alr,btohqsg
you smart lah but there are ppl who work their ass off and still do bad. Nth to do with hardwork/discipline,btohqsg
BEDOK IDC UR OC BRING U DTE,btohqsg
dawgs so happy his oc brought him to dte,btohqsg
being ‚Äúsmart‚Äù only takes you so far too. if you work your ass off and don‚Äôt do well  then you gotta examine other factors too. you can be working hard but in a not great way,btohqsg
oh no Neil coming here to ban,btohqsg
oh it said u were tying,btohqsg
pls don‚Äôt ban a pocoyo thank u,btohqsg
i banned@rumchelafter she took over my tiktok fyp,btohqsg
i mean the issue is when people just think they aren‚Äôt smart enough because they work hard and don‚Äôt get results,btohqsg
guys do u know that siyan made me realise that I‚Äôm smart and bro said ‚ÄòGOOD FUCKING JOB‚Äô when i received my results ü§ûü§û,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ntg to do with studying smart,btohqsg
ik someone who studies smart and during hols before prelims she was on holiday,btohqsg
but off szn she rlly does study consistently + rlly clarify with chers,btohqsg
study smart can mean differently to different people,btohqsg
well  i tot i was. oh right eric cartman dude thinks i am,btohqsg
the way it works best for someone,btohqsg
as long as ur study method works and u‚Äôre scoring well u‚Äôre pretty much set,btohqsg
go back to ur ig reels,btohqsg
some ppl like rand grind at the end do well,btohqsg
some ppl cant memorise things so they find another way out,btohqsg
i can‚Äôt ever advice people to study the way i study,btohqsg
it ‚Äòs called last min club,btohqsg
u can prove self worth and i very appreciate u ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
my way involves not even touching tutorials,btohqsg
i will just cru and hide,btohqsg
I gt grp mates start grp work like 3-4 days bef dateline & still can score,btohqsg
you can try your luck and die,btohqsg
honestly i don‚Äôt rmb anything from o levels,btohqsg
anyone here in SIT cyber or doing cyber sec ?,btohqsg
u can wash them all away,btohqsg
the drain beside the bus stop,btohqsg
I wash u go there uw,btohqsg
don‚Äôt anyhow he bully me a lot,btohqsg
i‚Äôll burn out right after day 1 papers or dum,btohqsg
Thats what they all say and its annoying to hear  but after teaching a while I notice a certain barrier that most students do not cross like being stuck at a certain mark range for long periods of time,btohqsg
what do u do when u burn out?,btohqsg
i mean i‚Äôve also taught for a while and i stand by what i said la,btohqsg
amd its detrimental to students mental well being for teachers to say you never study/ work hard,btohqsg
I js go online again and don‚Äôt care abt what happen,btohqsg
when frankly its their limit and need more time,btohqsg
and ofc some people don‚Äôt work hard enough but i always try to change my approach,btohqsg
But i can say for sure that with enough time anyone can do well,btohqsg
tbf i didnt study at all in sec 1,btohqsg
but they kept saying i can go straigt down to liek uhh nt,btohqsg
bro entered sec sch ‚Äòim going to get As‚Äô wa1: Cs,btohqsg
yea guess which one is me,btohqsg
btw kuro sorry  im just bad at giving reference to things,btohqsg
my chem cher told me ask my friends,btohqsg
However this limit is mostly A2 so no excuses ah,btohqsg
but i realise i cant abdorb anyth at all,btohqsg
You said you messed up üíÄ,btohqsg
how come every time it's the ugly people that talk the most cock üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
just joined the group for studies related stuff,btohqsg
come in to see someone to get cypher bully,btohqsg
nah its called not being a cunt,btohqsg
bro the girl was being rude and shit,btohqsg
how come u don't dare say shit,btohqsg
when a girl is being a cunt,btohqsg
thinking defending a rude girl can get u laid is it,btohqsg
that poor fucking guy working as a packer job,btohqsg
its all good  i know they mean me well...i dont take words to heart.,btohqsg
nah ryan can‚Äôt let ppl do that to u,btohqsg
that gym girl down there making fun of you,btohqsg
i tried  but im just not good at it,btohqsg
brother the aim here is not get canceled üò≠,btohqsg
so what if your studies are well?doesn't mean that you can look down on others solely because you have a better academic background,btohqsg
but when you compare who have more experience..you cant deny i dont have enough,btohqsg
I think certification and experience are impt,btohqsg
yea.. soon enuf you‚Äôre going out for internship.. can‚Äôt let anyone step on u okay,btohqsg
now u trying to be funny and play the good guy,btohqsg
dw  if i need to step up for myself. i will  i think its because of my past anger issues that has really made me reflect on what matters and what does not,btohqsg
but this matters  ur own pride,btohqsg
why u gotta banned someone for speaking facts,btohqsg
wait nah rohit is some other guy it‚Äôs okie,btohqsg
and not banning someone that's making fun of a guy that's trying his hardest,btohqsg
Honestly no beef with anyone  but i strongly disagree with the language used by Vexel,btohqsg
I mean u can feel free to disagree with me la  thats ur personal opinion,btohqsg
this guy is by far the most reasonable guy with values,btohqsg
the rest all don't dare speak up for the poor guy that's trying his hardest to work and study at the same time,btohqsg
meanwhile ppl like vexel dont get the picture lol,btohqsg
I working 2 jobs and doing my degree,btohqsg
for all I know  can just fucking stop making fun of others. like fine we get it you‚Äôre better than whoever but why tf u making fun of the person beyond the issue we‚Äôre discussing here. and it‚Äôs rly not the first time in this chat yk. so pls rly js stop the crap honestly. it‚Äôs straight up bullying,btohqsg
idk who this person is but facts bro,btohqsg

yall got nth to attack no pt one la hor,btohqsg
eh auntie u attack the poor packer guy first,btohqsg
hi hi poly kids  ur opinion,btohqsg
this is why people view poly kids as low life,btohqsg
stand up for yourself also cannot,btohqsg
hope all of get stepped on,btohqsg
u can afford to do smth related to ur dip,btohqsg
upscale vs finding pt jobs to grip on ur life,btohqsg
sorry this chat has no respect for each other,btohqsg
if u from sec 4 waiting for results that i get,btohqsg
When 2 ppl are fighting they will point out each other insecurities. If you happen have that insecurity race religion etcetc dont get pulled into the argument its just for argument,btohqsg
but arguably poly has more skills than us a lvl kids eh yall are specialised,btohqsg
dont come and take some job without leveraging on ur skills pls,btohqsg
like I said. He rather live a simpler life. Just smt he can get by. Good for him  he‚Äôs happy with what he‚Äôs doing. So why r u judging,btohqsg
let him do what he want,btohqsg
why we spending sm time on ryan ah,btohqsg
because u need to fix yourself,btohqsg
I am literally working warehouse now,btohqsg

if he rlly not ok i can chillax no worries,btohqsg
DAWWWWGGG time to hunt kuro alr,btohqsg
u type so much also pointlesssome ppl braindead won't get the point,btohqsg
cannot understand what others are going through,btohqsg
i think ive been watching too many vids,btohqsg
making fun of other people's hard work and their status is what a typical emotionally damaged person does,btohqsg
anyone here doing nus part time degree? how much gpa required for that tho,btohqsg
ya chill  I never said not ok. pocoyo was chill. but if you‚Äôre out here to make a full out of my friend,btohqsg
yall wanna fight go private messages,btohqsg

bullying is fine against bullies bro,btohqsg
dont talk shit about other ppl appearance academics lifestyle,btohqsg
I thought I asked to be quiet simplord,btohqsg
yr  I don‚Äôt care what saga. All I want is attention to be brought on that fact that bullying has taken place in this chat,btohqsg
may i bring back one of the rules,btohqsg
all of you are just typical singaporeans. something happens all keep quiet  just watch. can‚Äôt wait for you to be bullied,btohqsg
i can‚Äôt believe this is still going on,btohqsg
where rachel replied ü§£ü§£ when ryan said he works at SingPost,btohqsg
i thought ppl say chillax still want tag,btohqsg
ya good for u get bullied u deserved it,btohqsg
ok i think all sides have made their points clear right,btohqsg
this all I want to say. ok fine I shut up. but this how pathetic the rest of u are just to watch someone get bullied,btohqsg
i working warehouse for 2 years,btohqsg
i got community work  subcomm  competition  and work experience,btohqsg

I am so sorry but I forgot who u were referring to..is it Chinese Garden,btohqsg
cant rmb he had a chinese name,btohqsg
ok Â∞èÊòé come here  lt is looking for u,btohqsg
EEE tutor as in jun wei? like he teaches physics but he‚Äôs from EEE,btohqsg
cs degree depends on your programming expertise,btohqsg
They dont care after a while for cs,btohqsg
it just shows you‚Äôre able to pick things up in that field,btohqsg
after first job it‚Äôs more about experience,btohqsg
Ur certificate only earns you a place on the interview panel,btohqsg
i think the meta right now is even experience ( internships) over grades for engineering,btohqsg
i mean if you have experience then it‚Äôll take precedence over grades,btohqsg
but grades never hurt until you build enough experience,btohqsg
i need 4 for those sems,btohqsg
well i mean considering ur intelligence i guess its good to be contented,btohqsg
as in? U can mute the chat,btohqsg
im not intelligent either but at least i have aspirations and im willing to sacrifice anything,btohqsg
a person lets say someone comes in says discriminatory stuff,btohqsg
i think admin MIGHT be able to,btohqsg
Is there an internship chat gg now,btohqsg
i also have no idea what AM means,btohqsg
Rand i want a taste of ur meat,btohqsg
bro is feeling some kind of way,btohqsg

brother why u change back to rec,btohqsg
Gude why u say that word,btohqsg
OH FUCK ITS GUDE HI GUDE IM POCOYO,btohqsg
FUCK WE NEED OG GWYN LIM RN,btohqsg
make herself so ez to Foxx,btohqsg
when u start a family...have kids...ur mind will sure change...,btohqsg
i mean if u aim for the moon...u land on the stars if u fail...,btohqsg
The reason why i feel like this is how i want to live my life is because the three biggest role models in my life...my father and two uncles are living this way,btohqsg
but don't forget that.. starting a family is not for eevryone.. and it's ok if u just wanna earn money and mess around,btohqsg
i discovered this part of me... too late,btohqsg
i mean my parents not super rich or anything...average income earners...but they nvr tell me to just settle for a simple life and live pay check to pay check...,btohqsg
like i said earlier.. different people have different goals in life.. i know what you‚Äôre trying to say  aim for the moon but you‚Äôll get less  but maybe some people just want to get by  tend to have luxuries every now and then  but their priority is just living with happiness,btohqsg
its normal..because the last thing they want is you to face stagnation,btohqsg
i mean now have the chance to give it ur best so why not haha...work hard now  enjoy later haha,btohqsg
"yup you do have a point i totally agree on  im just very lost right now on the ""work hard"" portion but slowly im figuring it out",btohqsg
another thing is if u do well...u will have choices...if u dont do well...u will have no choices,btohqsg
yea  i heard this from my father alot growing up,btohqsg
2 years pass very fast one@chemcer,btohqsg
aww look at this couple teasing each other,btohqsg
mhm nothing  thats what i thought,btohqsg
the feeling of wadio is near,btohqsg
Force of rsaf? Where camp has no cookhouse?,btohqsg
Can score if you good at memory work,btohqsg
Uni organic chem turns that upside down coz it's open book at year 3,btohqsg
ie you remember also no use coz if you dunno how to draw things in 3d  dunno which model to use  dunno how see they flip and turn during the reaction then you're fkeddd,btohqsg
AINT no way ppl be taking organic chem at uni,btohqsg
plus more than 1/3 of the platoon gone üíÄ,btohqsg
What do you need from me?,btohqsg
Do I have anything to hide,btohqsg
should we start a YPT group,btohqsg
ik there‚Äôs a few but no one jobs,btohqsg
Ain‚Äôt there alr like 5 for the individual poly‚Äôs,btohqsg
You did not join your own poly‚Äôs ay2023 chat Ah,btohqsg
that‚Äôs for those that enter this yr I think,btohqsg
Yea  but a lot of seniors inside also,btohqsg
Last yr my poly also had but this yr‚Äôs grp more ppl join than last yr,btohqsg
should I go to the other side of school for avocado milkshake,btohqsg
With my pace prob around like 15 mins,btohqsg
Eh why tf girls got so many health problem one,btohqsg
Bruh‚Ä¶to queue for food in my poly alone takes 15mins,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in taekwondo and touch football ü§°,btohqsg
Exception is my school club but have not even gone to a single event,btohqsg
Was telling my mother I got this pain that pain and she‚Äôs like oh shit that‚Äôs a symptom for this very common girls problem,btohqsg
Which I also never heard before,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not going to say or the whole world will know I have this problem,btohqsg
Sounds like your mother is very knowledgeable,btohqsg
cos with taekwondo can still kick ppl,btohqsg
Initially i wanted join touch  but I‚Äôm too lazy seriously after orientation I literally Toh  that‚Äôs when I knew I‚Äôm not gonna sports in poly for sure,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt they push the sports ppl to join like competitions etc,btohqsg
I mean if you can balance good lorh‚Ä¶but for someone that can‚Äôt balance like me it‚Äôs gonna be hell on earth,btohqsg
Usually im a sports person but now..üíÄ,btohqsg
I can legit see you being one of those soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è girls,btohqsg
Oh hell nah I can‚Äôt kick no balls bruh,btohqsg
Nvm but yea I can you see you being a sporty üëß back in sec school of something,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been telling myself gym since start of the year  never happened,btohqsg
ya it‚Äôs ok I alr found another cca,btohqsg
But wats the point of getting cca in poly?,btohqsg
Just to build your portfolio increase chance of getting into Uni,btohqsg
if I‚Äôm not wrong works as a portfolio for internship and university eventually,btohqsg
as much as it boils down to gpa,btohqsg
at least I just choose one cca that helps a lot in portfolio (some event organising),btohqsg
But if gpa low also no use wat,btohqsg
yk very good portfolio worthy opportunities offered in the cca,btohqsg
Ngl I feel like im gonna be the type where if I do somehow get into a Uni‚Ä¶I will forget it after serving my 2 yrs in ns,btohqsg
yeah.. I only take up one cca.. it‚Äôs normal for poly kids to take 2 ccas,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt want to just limit my social circle there  poly is really a time to go around and socialise,btohqsg
Yes indeed  so the moment you turn 18. You gonna go clubbing? Fastest way to socialise I‚Äôm guessing,btohqsg
and also dw to be coming home from sch doing nothing  rather do something fulfilling,btohqsg
no.. im not rly full on club person. occasionally sure but not like many times a month or something,btohqsg
maybe once every three months idk,btohqsg
Well it depends person to person. I dun take cca cos i got not time for it,btohqsg
I mean if you can get to socialise everytime  it‚Äôs give at least benefits even if it‚Äôs a few times a yr,btohqsg
In the end  end up going rmit.....,btohqsg
I think gpa play the whole role comparing to cca as a small part,btohqsg
If gpa cmi i dun see wat the point alr,btohqsg
can be used to show ur well rounded also,btohqsg
allow u get some more awards,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going thru Uni lite‚Ä¶ am I an old fuck,btohqsg
I see my portfolio clean af,btohqsg
U are alr an old fck if u hv to ask that qn,btohqsg
Sorry i dont make the rules,btohqsg
this is the Hermes 450  a UAV,btohqsg
this is the Heron 1  the current UAV used by the RSAF,btohqsg
Birkin sounds less foreign to me,btohqsg
why is there a + 1 atm there,btohqsg
Look at the instrument used bah,btohqsg
The gauge pressure is calibrated against atmospheric pressure,btohqsg
gauge pressure‚Äôs 0 point is 1atm,btohqsg
you need to convert it to absolute pressure,btohqsg
so whenever doing calculation should always be using the absolute pressure,btohqsg
and absolute pressure = guage pressure + 1 atm,btohqsg
i mean in this question you can work either way. just that psia is in absolute pressure,btohqsg
okie will take note of this thankss uuu,btohqsg
u simi say u ORD but got shit ton of reservists here,btohqsg
guys whos taking o‚Äôs this year,btohqsg
