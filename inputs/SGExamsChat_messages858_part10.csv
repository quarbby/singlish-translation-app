I dont think they do but yknow its more trouble if you bring it up ig,btohqsg
I think NTU/NUS had a similar case on a programming course.,btohqsg
Need to meet the person and all that,btohqsg
I nvr hear this except for EVERY. SINGLE. NS REGULAR.,btohqsg
Eventually the teachers uploaded wrong answers to catch students who plagiarized.,btohqsg
i mean the reason i don't is bc we can't technically prove it objectively  but almost all AI reports are full of errors that they may not spot if they're alr that weak in concepts,btohqsg
so even if i don't flag the AI,btohqsg
Mostly cus those ns regular ppl are life pes A to C kind,btohqsg
they're getting marked down for being wrong,btohqsg
like it's actually impossible to fail lab,btohqsg
I mean to be fair i dont rlly tell them to use AI uh,btohqsg
I have a junior who submitted all 5 lab reports on the last day of the semester and still got D so,btohqsg
"But not to ""write out"" lah",btohqsg
bc behind the scenes we place a cap on the max penalty for lateness,btohqsg
I have never seen something so severe before,btohqsg
Wdym wdym  like literally the last day of finals week then he/she chionged all 5 reports,btohqsg
I never seen someone actually do this,btohqsg
Dont ask me why he/she did it,btohqsg
Omg yall are exposing me to the dark side man,btohqsg
Basically absent from attending lab. And have no idea what the hell is the data lol,btohqsg
Meanwhile i had friends who can submit 2/4 reports and cry why they didnt pass,btohqsg
attendance is wtv. it's just the report submission,btohqsg
yea bc of the max penalty we implemented,btohqsg
I mean if it is by accident then yea  is normal,btohqsg
submitting is always better even if late af,btohqsg
wait iestin so did that person even do viva,btohqsg
There is no way submitting 2/4 lab reports is an accident,btohqsg
And even if you were  the lab manager can probably still close one eye and give you D,btohqsg
also lab is actually super lenient with extensions and being late,btohqsg
Yeah for the 2 that he/she submitted,btohqsg
Cus the lab partner rlly dowan submit his shit,btohqsg
as in the one that submitted last min,btohqsg
But something tells me it was a bad viva,btohqsg
So end up the other person had to delay viva,btohqsg
Omg you know what is worse,btohqsg
If the lab partner never even show up,btohqsg
Idk why people think its ever a choice,btohqsg
Like submitting half the reports needed and then thinking youll pass,btohqsg
Like if they told them im advance that they are not coming  sure okay,btohqsg
Person probably thought doing the bare minimum  2/4 reports is a pass,btohqsg
One motherfker just decided to not come school from wk 3 onwards,btohqsg
I feel like i know this person,btohqsg
Like not matriculate same yr as us one,btohqsg
The fact that this person remain uncontactable just made me feel speechless,btohqsg
Ok but ngl idk how I did well for lab,btohqsg
Like i know i am bragging here but,btohqsg
I am legitimately serious. I actually dont know what the hell am I doing,btohqsg
Im not looking forward to individual vivas in y3 lab,btohqsg
Ive always been carried by my partner in y2,btohqsg
What am i gonna say in y3,btohqsg
