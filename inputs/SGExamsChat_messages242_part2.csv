Ever find yourself browsing Buzzfeed and taking personality tests and quizzes defining your future careers/pathways? 📝 But do these personalities (results like ENTP  ISFP and INFJ)  accurately define you as a person? 🧐This month’s Tribute Thursday article aims to shed light on this topic - that you are more than what personality and career tests define about you. Link in bio. 🤩Read the full article on our Medium:medium.com/SGExams.,btohqsg

anyone has h1 physics tutorial qns?,btohqsg
Does eae use prelim exam marks as well  or only mid years,btohqsg
ok urm im not too sure if this is considered deemed to put in the study grp chat but someone please help.. is 0 a natural no or not..in a lecture video it said sequence is a(0) a(1) etc using a(n) where n is a natural number (suggesting that in this case 0 is natural??)but in our lecture  our teacher told us 0 is not a natural number. so someone help..,btohqsg
If you look at the syllabus doc  the list of symbols used does not have the set of natural numbers,btohqsg
They'll say positive integers  or nonnegative integers,btohqsg
This is because natural numbers is a contentious term and half of people thinks it should have 0 and another half doesn't,btohqsg
So u don't have to worry about that,btohqsg
At least not in national exams anyway,btohqsg
In school I think you just follow your teacher,btohqsg
Tbh it's quite bad practice to use the term natural numbers without defining it anyway,btohqsg
he was also confused with what hes saying,btohqsg
"There's ""positive integers"" and ""non negative integers""",btohqsg
hes like urm idk 0 shouldnt be natural but sometimes it is,btohqsg
If he confused then I also dunno what to do already,btohqsg
ehh I wouldn't be worried about it,btohqsg
generally use 0 unless qn states so we planning to do that,btohqsg
just ask him directly what natural numbers are defined to be,btohqsg
then just take what he says,btohqsg
They see Ur achievement and not results,btohqsg
Doesnt mean end of world. Still got chance to flip de,btohqsg
eh my sch said they see MYE ones leh?,btohqsg
If uw link for idk wat,btohqsg

"Usually either(1) It does not matter OR(2) It is implied.If you are not sure  just use ""the set of positive integers"" or ""the set of non-negative integers"" where appropriate.For example  I am currently doing a measure theory module which always excludes 0. But my algebra professor loves to include 0 because 0 is the additive identity. So just look at what it implies.Just ask yourself one question: if I include 0  would it still make sense?Same goes with subset  ⊂ and ⊆ can mean the same thing.I have been dealing with this for years with no issue. So I don't think you will have a major issue.",btohqsg
This is a recent assignment that I did. Had the set of natural numbers include 0  it wouldn't make sense as we would have 1/0 (look at the way I defined E_(k n)).,btohqsg
Too busy with assignments and other work hahaha,btohqsg
tho mine is not thay hahaha im in comp sci,btohqsg
no omg dood im not that pro,btohqsg
I didn't really like the basics of real analysis. But I like measure theory for some reason. Maybe because it's more abstract.,btohqsg
is there anyone that is in NUS CS?,btohqsg

Hi hello! I’m actually interested in joining mass Communication in NP  but I don’t get what’s the different between mass com and mass Com management. Is there anyone who can help me?,btohqsg
is there a mass comm management? or do u mean mass media management in nyp or comms and media management in tp?,btohqsg
Ah yes mass media management in NYP,btohqsg
I think a cursory comparison of the two course modules shows that mass media management has a lot more modules focused on the 'business' aspect of things  while mass comm focuses more on the technical skills of comms,btohqsg
Oh I c  so do you do like banking stuff in management like poa?,btohqsg
not exactly  the only more mathy module I can see is media financial management,btohqsg
agree^ mass comm in np focuses alot of the skills needed to help you become a well rounded individual who is able to write  film  edit  and analyse the media industry although we do have a module called media entrepreneurship in y3 focusing on how to create a media startup,btohqsg
