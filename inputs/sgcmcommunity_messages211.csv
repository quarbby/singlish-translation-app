like up too much demand drop then coe will drop,btohqsg
nothing to do with the quota,btohqsg
only 60 more.  not difference given the overflow each month,btohqsg
It's not abt the absolute number; it's about the cumulative impact over time,btohqsg
Not 60. It is double 106 for cat a,btohqsg
Hi  im interested in honda vezel hybrid. Appreciate any reviews on this? TYIA.,btohqsg
Coming COE bidding next week  prices should drop.Cos buyers will wait for Feb bidding with higher quota,btohqsg
Probably car sharing companies that ask dealers to buy would keep coe there cos they've target to meet,btohqsg
Coe hard to go down as long as phv are not registered in a separate cat,btohqsg
Got ppl order the new Accord Hybrid,btohqsg
there are orders from motorshow. wont drop too much,btohqsg
Are they paying 300k for the accord? If so  COE price is chump change,btohqsg
Maybe 290+ w disc n tradein?,btohqsg
If U have a 100k car to trade in  why not,btohqsg
Yep . Was looking for the legal exhaust to go with it,btohqsg

All new cars can no longer fix aftermarket exhaust,btohqsg
Hate the noise pollution from the after market exhaust. Especially in the middle of the night.,btohqsg
Tune nicely is music to the ears,btohqsg
I believe that it sounds like lullaby at night to babies and people who need to get up early.,btohqsg
Such selflessness to spend money to modify it so that the neighbourhood babies can enjoy 😉,btohqsg

The car’s fastback design looks better than the CN7’s angular design,btohqsg
No leh still can leh as long the exhaust got all the cert/test can still use,btohqsg
Any cars reg after 1 April 2023  has no aftermarket legal exhaust,btohqsg
U want to play aftermarket exhaust  can only play parf cars reg before 1st April 2023,btohqsg
U nvr realise AD seldom bring in performance car alrdy?,btohqsg
And even if  it's downtuned to miserable specs,btohqsg
https://www.fongkim.com.sg/product/hks-exhaust-system-new-honda-vezel-1-5l/If you read properly it does not limit installing aftermarket systems. Just the noise that comes with it. As long as they meet the UN spec for sound and emissions you can. This why still have HKS exhaust for many jap cars still you just need to find and go through the process. Like this newer vezel still have.,btohqsg

Hi anyone had deal with miracle motosport before,btohqsg
as long got ECE approved exhaust lta will approve,btohqsg
but now lta approval is car by car basis,btohqsg
not blanket approval  (eg approved before rest sure approve),btohqsg
Cars after 1 April 2023 don't need to think,btohqsg
not true  my friend 2024 m340i also put remus lta approved,btohqsg
yr car no approved exhaust doesnt mean other cars dont have,btohqsg
So a Remus on a M340i can pass sound test but a HKS super silent on Vezel RV3 cannot pass sound test,btohqsg
I'm very sure the dB is louder on e Remus,btohqsg

I looking to buy a 2nd hand merc  any recommendations for pre-purchase inspections ah,btohqsg
what full size SUV do we have in sg?,btohqsg
most of them are mid size crossover SUV,btohqsg
only ones i can think of are Toyota Land Cruiser  Range Rover  and GLS,btohqsg
Sg No need buy suv 1,btohqsg
The ppi thing look like a scam. They just look see outside only but cannot give guarantee.,btohqsg
So you know the 'answers' but still ask.. Such a pete thing to do.,btohqsg
Damn I was just wondering what other full size suv there are in sg,btohqsg
Genuine qn dk why u gotta be rude about it,btohqsg
I googled it already and it was not helpful hence I asked in here because Google is not always right,btohqsg
Maybe he’s hurt by Pete b4,btohqsg
Can go for the 300 one  they mri your car,btohqsg
"Hahaha I've watched so much drama from this pete. He is a running meme for this group. Meh that man and his ""Lexus"" has never affected me in any way.",btohqsg
They use thermal scanner. I think I use a hand held 1 same,btohqsg
But what he say here is partially right. You would not need a full size SUV in SG.,btohqsg
How to check inside engine? Open up ah?,btohqsg
I see  then pre purchase what is the recommendation to check?,btohqsg
They just use eye power conduct surface level check. See where got leak n wear only.,btohqsg
Would sending to STA to evaluate be a better?,btohqsg
U can request for engine compression teat and smoke test see if got lwak,btohqsg
Purpose of PPI is to ensure that the car u buying over is at it ish of when u view also,btohqsg
So during PPI take pics n stuff,btohqsg
I usually send to own wa. Some say STA and Vicom only bare minimum.,btohqsg
How abt this? U take many pics then ask AI to check first. It’s free,btohqsg
Palisade  santa fe  carnival  cx60  cx80 ,btohqsg
From the pics  AI will give u many advice,btohqsg
If u buy the AI plan  can even live video the car n AI will inspect,btohqsg

How is used car market now? Slow or fast? Next week coe biding,btohqsg
I feel coe gonna go high due to recent car show.,btohqsg
Yeah fairly likely though the good thing is that Govt is going to start introducing part of the new 20 000 COE quota,btohqsg
Cus my fren say during the recent car show  at the used car all damn slow,btohqsg
So now we experiencing high coe but ppl not willing to pay high depre for a low paper value car liao💀💀 i saw some 1.4 cars depre 15k now dipping alr,btohqsg
He works at one of the dealers,btohqsg
I sell myself nobody even offer 15k,btohqsg
10k they offer u wait long long,btohqsg
15k might as well buy new car they said,btohqsg
I see all the 1.4 golf drop to 13k le,btohqsg
The key is not the drop the highlight is Singaporean is cash rich,btohqsg
What’s wrong with used cars that cost $10K depre?,btohqsg
10k depre for used car is reasonable,btohqsg
1 IDP. It applies for both.,btohqsg
So now people mentally changed  can fork out the big sums on new cars but spend lesser on used car?,btohqsg
It’s more of a “might as well” mindset,btohqsg
I would too  becoz of the “worry free” mindset.,btohqsg
Just get new  and then be done with it.,btohqsg
And the entire motorshow was all about EVs.,btohqsg
Yes lta is going to next phrase ev world,btohqsg
This BYD also changed a lot of buyers mindset. They are so affordable price with lots of good features. Buyer really don’t mind paying abit more to get BYD,btohqsg
BYD M6 is 170k17k depreThe closed Toyota wish is 12-14k depre nowWho wants wish? Haha,btohqsg
Truth however the drive experience isn’t great,btohqsg
It’s the technology and QOL that makes BYD stand out,btohqsg
They are a “pseudo” Tesla   some people draw this comparison,btohqsg
I feel that its about changing of mindset. Ppl used to get toyota cause its less trouble due to less tech. But now ppl buying full tech car. How the paradigm has shift,btohqsg
Not all and u didn’t realise there are so many used EV car in the used market also.,btohqsg
So ya. ICE will be in our hearts but embrace EV with open mind.,btohqsg
I really hope that there’s less “misinformation”,btohqsg
Ya actually I won’t mind to get EV also but to me 1st priority is convenience which I mean charging station is like anytime readily available and do not have worries that I need to plug out after full charge. If I stay in landed house definitely no brainer to get an EV car.,btohqsg
True.. Ya my hdb open carpark till now still no charging station yet. Maybe next time when readily available then I will consider changing. My working place the number of EV cars which I can see is less than my 1 🤚 also..,btohqsg
One can liao. Ur IDP will say which country can use,btohqsg
Actually I’m an owner myself with no landed charging. I don’t feel it’s that much of an issue actually.It’s just a routine change.,btohqsg
It’ll come eventually. Just need moreTime.,btohqsg
Waiting... my carpark still dh despite the surronding areas starting to have bluesg,btohqsg
Yes just need more time. EV in Sg still need lots of improvement.. Eventually all will changed.,btohqsg

Racer boy maybe  left foot braking 😂,btohqsg
Auto USE ONE FEET GOD DAM,btohqsg
Means hit optimum speed liao then leg to brake then drop to slow liao accelerate again,btohqsg
U nvr see meh? Some drivers can hold e brake for like 100m then leg off brake then leg go back brake again,btohqsg
Or when near front car  brake till 3-4 car length then go near front car again,btohqsg
Well that’s not nice for the drivetrain,btohqsg
Left foot braking also right foot release first,btohqsg
Idk but having to make the car fight itself like that. Got nothing to say,btohqsg
Anyways  driven the RU just this evening. Not a bad car and I probably might consider it as my second option for my next car (my dad gets to own it first),btohqsg
I'd be questioning which privateautocar instructor taught to use both feet to their learner.. 😒,btohqsg
Very difficult to on cc or just hold ur car there meh,btohqsg

I think if tp tester see 2 feet also scared,btohqsg
Bro  I think if they see two feet on both pedals*,btohqsg
The way you phrased it made it seem like the tp tester will freak out seeing everyone with 2 feet attached to their legs as if they didn't have 2 themselves,btohqsg
If no legs and floating.. then you run or drive away.. FAST,btohqsg

Dealer likely will just use your top up. They absorb for you = they forgo their margin.What’s the deal,btohqsg
If they say top up for guaranteed  I’d CoE 95k means whatever they need to make the shortfall they willl absorb,btohqsg

Actually  I don't understand this point. CoE loan is probably the safest loan. Motor value is 0. So it is a pure COE cost. Backed by government. Anytime can scrap and get back unused COE. Loan tenor can be less than 10 years. Wonder why interest rates are so high for COE,btohqsg
Next time. When the third-gen swift becomes a COE car or Used 4th Gen Swifts are on the resale market. That would be the time I will ask my dad to sell his future next car if I don’t like it,btohqsg

Any1 recall the Korea plane crash after hitting head on with the concrete barrier?,btohqsg
If the plane hit the concrete at a angle instead of 90 deg  will more ppl survive? The pilots can land earlier n at a angle. more distance travelled n more brake force.,btohqsg
Did you see the crash reports? The landing gear never even deployed.. how you expect braking when flaps deployed but then there is no brakes from the landing gears at all,btohqsg
And the aircraft can only angle so much before the tail strikes the runway,btohqsg
U don’t understand what I say,btohqsg
You expecting like this is it?,btohqsg
If smaller aircraft probably can but heavier like that Jeju Air 737-800 (41 tons empty).. difficult to execute because of the total weight incl passengers and luggage  if consider human factors and FAA emergency checklist.,btohqsg
It is like a bus and a car. Car can brake and change direction faster than a fully loaded bus.,btohqsg
Before land can adjust angle alr. Anw I asked ai it’s possible. If pilots skilled  can land earlier also. Can save ard 10-20% lives,btohqsg
AI is not human. Have you considered the human aspect in aviation.. it is not just autopilot and then that's it the pilot hands-off.,btohqsg
Common sense . If u can land at 90%   why not other angle,btohqsg

It's the explosions and fire that killed everyone  not the impact of the crash against the barrier...aircraft fuel ignites,btohqsg
While explosions n fire r critical hazards in aircraft crashes  impact forces against barriers is the primary cause of death. Ur claim oversimplifies the complex dynamics of crashes n ignore the fact that many victims succumb to collision before explosion even occur,btohqsg

for purchase of used cars  is it the standard to pay deposit then send to my own workshop for inspection. possible to send to workshop first? i dont mind paying some cash to cover their logistics.,btohqsg
Have to place deposit first 😊.,btohqsg
can write down in black and white  if engine/gearbox problem you reserve the right to cancel and get a refund for your deposit. If have wear and tear repairs needed  seller and buyer to split 50:50,btohqsg
If they don't agree just walk,btohqsg
High chance selling you a lemon,btohqsg
"i just thought their terms of ""A full deposit refund will be done in an event if the vehicle is found to have engine/gearbox/chassis damage"" a little too vague. and i dont really know how to check before even paying the deposit haha 🥲",btohqsg
At the rate u r going  U r better off buying a new car,btohqsg
🥺🥺🥺 but i get what u mean,btohqsg
Ignore him. He’s a weirdo. Just take ur time to investigate,btohqsg
Deposit don’t pay. Once u pay Liao  u r arguing from a  disadvantage. Basically it’s v hard to prove engine or gearbox problem. It becomes ur duty to open it up n show them exactly where n why is it considered spoilt. Btw oil leaking   shaking or weird noise does not mean spoilt - just observations.,btohqsg
Dealers mostly are good at twisting to their own advantage,btohqsg
Buyers will always lose to sellers,btohqsg
So what do you suggest to be the agreement when buying from second hand dealers? I also read engine and gear box problems will be difficult to find and prove.,btohqsg
Research n buy tools to do ur own inspection. The experience n tools will be v beneficial in future.,btohqsg
Okay. What kind of tools are available to test the engine and gearbox. I believe these two are the most expensive parts to service if they are a problem,btohqsg
Universal obd2 scanner. Inspection mirror sets. Endoscope. Stethoscope. Smoke leak tester. Magnet detector. Portable jack. Most impt is research to gain experience. Make a checklist of all parts needed to inspect. Another checklist for test drive. Take pics n send to ai to inspect.,btohqsg
Thanks this seems to be a heavy undertaking though 😂. Some dealers offer 1year warranty on engine and gearbox. For a few extra dollars this would be a safer deal right.,btohqsg
I heard stories of dealers delaying repair until warranty expire,btohqsg
Da fck. These guys.. Seriously 😒,btohqsg
Next time buy 2nd hand  bring Pete along w you,btohqsg
Confirm get a used brand new car,btohqsg
Can start first with the obd2 scanner. It’s the easiest. Cold start check for error codes. Warm up n check. Whack the car n check for codes again.,btohqsg
Yeah I also thought OBD2 seems the easiest one of the lot. And a long term investment for maintaining a car.,btohqsg
Get a good obd2 scanner. Can plot n analyse graphs of all the impt sensors. Check if it’s within normal range,btohqsg
The mechanic won’t do until so detailed. They got many cars to settle. I bet they can’t tell u what should be the normal range of the sensors. The brake mechanic don’t even know what is the correct torque for tightening my wheel nuts. If u don’t tell them  they just use impact gun to tighten to the max. Next time u will cry if nut break n get stuck in the wheel when trying to unbolt,btohqsg
These mechanics r usually lowly educated bengs who donno n can’t be bothered with official range of values of impt components n sensors n importance of using correct torque on bolts. They will say “kid  I been repairing cars for 20 years”,btohqsg
Big names not necessarily means reliable e.g. cartimes,btohqsg
Talk ez. Most of the time  the best deal is not from reputable places. On the contrary  worst deal from reputable places is more common,btohqsg
Hahahaha I never buy from reputable shops. The cars they sell I can do a engine n gearbox overhaul n still cheaper when I buy from other dealer,btohqsg
after so long pete still never change pattern... a leopard never changes its spots one la,btohqsg
If you want to reduce your risk of getting a lemon  avoid profiles such as >1 owner  mileage not too high  serviced regularly etc  go for reliable models e.g. Toyota etc.,btohqsg

Read your insurance coverage and check with your insurance agent for procedures,btohqsg
Normal road side no need tow also ok,btohqsg
Like one year a limited time.,btohqsg
No all wrong. Prevention better than cure. Install tpms that can also read battery volts,btohqsg
Just called ntuc. Their roadside assistance and wellness cover  allows u to submit expenses incurred due to non accident event  up to 200 per year. Need to ownself find separate provider for the flat tyre  flat battery  towing service etc.,btohqsg
E.g. >2 owners >3 yrs old yet yearly mileage not even 10k is a big red flag,btohqsg
Depends on what is wrong.. if I not wrong  service change is 50 or 80,btohqsg

Haha nothing to claim one. But if e.g. you buang wall and you claim your own insurance  your ncd affected  so dun anyhow claim 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Call emas but they tow to safe location only,btohqsg
Yah that's their gam force 😂  gam=> orange,btohqsg
They said the expenses incurred e.g. change tyre  battery etc.  can be reimbursed up to 200 per year. This one will also affect my ncd?,btohqsg
No la..gam force is only for accident,btohqsg
Usually no but best is read carefully if it will affect. If they say is reimburse then usually no.,btohqsg
"Lol sorry missed the ""non accident""",btohqsg
Usually roadside assistance in insurance only cover accident,btohqsg
No problem...now I need to find non accident service provider  just in case...,btohqsg
Anyways guys I plan to go to jb.Any good workshop for Volkswagen?,btohqsg
No. just buy third party insurance n tpms. The savings can tow 10 times+ n still have change for many Big Mac meals,btohqsg
yup  they are like a supplement to your car insurance. But in my experience with new car and old especially coe cars  AA is best if you buy coe cars lol cos higher chances of breakdown,btohqsg
@cy go read up (sgcarmart articles  not some chatgpt s) on differences between comprehensive  or is it standard and 3rd party insurance to understand what suits your car and your needs.,btohqsg
I’m using Deepseek. It’s more powerful than chatgpt,btohqsg
So far it can diagnose with 100% accuracy when I describe my car symptoms in detail,btohqsg
But both still way better than unreliable mechanics. Mostly they r lowly educated n hv low iq if not they won’t be mechanics also. They r only good at guessing n can’t give definitive answers. Some even compare themselves with doctors n say that doctors can be wrong also.,btohqsg
Knowing mechanics r not bright n they don’t hv the required tools  I will diagnose the problem by myself. I Buy my own specialised tools n get all the related info n procedures. Then I will find the cheapest n most obedient mechanic n instruct him to repair step by step. I want them to do it my way not their way.,btohqsg
Is there any article I can read up on how to use AI to diagnose car.,btohqsg
How did you get the deepseek model to work with this,btohqsg
Deepseek is different model. V good too.,btohqsg
Until you ask it about Tiananmen Square and Taiwan.,btohqsg
Yeah. I read about it. But you need some interface to send the prompts to it right. Chatgpt uses gpt model only right?,btohqsg
