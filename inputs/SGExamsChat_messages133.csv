Anyone knows how to set up python on visual code?,btohqsg
brb learning how to code so i can answer your qn üöóüöó,btohqsg
And why even use visual studio,btohqsg
They kept telling me to modify python,btohqsg
Uninstall python... reinstall python then install the extension from vs marketplace,btohqsg
Then u have to select the python interpretor,btohqsg
Unless ur sch using python 1++ then u can ask this boomer@junhengggggg,btohqsg
No idea what this means  but generically your Python should be in your PATH regardless of VS(C)What is PATH:https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them,btohqsg
Send a screenshot? Meanwhile you can try thishttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments,btohqsg

Do you know the current H2 Computing syllabus?The difference between H2 Computing and Undergrad CS is very far  so take note.,btohqsg
i have seen the syllabus pdf from moe website. most topics are covered in various mods in uni. i guess need to adjust to A level's way of answering,btohqsg
Well actually I think they are still developing the syllabus.I think the direction is that it is moving towards more CS (it was more SWE-ish),btohqsg
By 'very far' I don't mean the topics per se by the way  I just mean that any Uni com sci programme would be quite a lot more advanced,btohqsg
Hi does anyone have a level clb compre tips,btohqsg

Hellooo! Remember the survey you did on universities' taster courses a few months back? Well  TasterCourseSG (TaCo) is back! ü§òüèΩOver the past few months  we have been curating different university taster courses by working with university seniors and trailing these content with our own team of volunteers. We are still at the beginning of this journey  looking at the feasibility and effectiveness of taster courses and hence we will be slowly trialing these content over the next few months. üìù Anyone looking to find out more about the course is welcome to join :D And this will be the first of many taster courses that we are looking to launch! üöÄEver wanted to sit in on mock lectures üë©‚Äçüè´ and seminars to get a feel of the content and materials  you will engage in at University? Well  Taster courses aim to do just that! If you are interested to find out more about Political Science we will be hosting an online üë©‚Äçüíª taster course on Political Science on the 16th of August 2020  0300-0500pm.If you are interested in attending this particular taster course  please sign up here at :https://forms.gle/iF6bSgShowGiEdbf8Signups will close when we have hit the maximum number of attendees and attendees will be selected on a first-come-first-serve basis.Thank you and we look forward to seeing you soon ü§©üôåüèº,btohqsg
