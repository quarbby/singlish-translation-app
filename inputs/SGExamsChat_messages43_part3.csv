Ok obviously you can go out to do essential things,btohqsg
Ya im just saying that im going out for that,btohqsg
Govt puts it on the list of exceptions,btohqsg
Since gyms and swimming pools out of bounds now,btohqsg
what about running away from responsibilities.....,btohqsg
running towards groups of 9 people to make them 10....,btohqsg
who let kevin out of his mancave,btohqsg
Its now all gatherings/meetings of all sizes of ppl u dont live with as prohibited  not just 10 peeps,btohqsg
Wanted to just go grocery shopping with 1 neighbour friend but nopes  I think i can't do that too,btohqsg
the entire park is cordoned off,btohqsg
Even if the friend is so close,btohqsg
I thought 'public parks' are on the list of places u can go to,btohqsg
And idg the shared facilities of condos,btohqsg
Like gyms and pools also not open,btohqsg
was at JP just now and it's so empty inside,btohqsg
Pull up bar is the entire park,btohqsg
do you think we will have 0 cases at the end of cb,btohqsg
community spread is still quite serious,btohqsg
Time to order some pull bar to just fix at ur door there,btohqsg
I think cb will end when the rise in cases is not so high,btohqsg
but theoretically 1 month of staying at home should kill the virus spread right,btohqsg
Hopefully if we all abide that should be super few cases,btohqsg
1 month means beyond the 14 days incubation,btohqsg
actually general onset of symptoms appear mostly on day 5,btohqsg
So can tell who has and not and resolve most of it,btohqsg
Theoretically all virus carriers should be detected or healed,btohqsg
lets hope 0 cases end apr,btohqsg
will take a while for the economy to get back up once we tide through this period,btohqsg

waiting for the button to be pressed,btohqsg
worst is those working in govt sectors,btohqsg
Idk whats worse  being extra busy or being extra slack,btohqsg
Tbh now is a good period to be a student or in NS,btohqsg
Sporeans are a bit workaholic in general  to suddenly put a pause in that,btohqsg
Student I don't think so  cause live teaching is better to learn than HBL,btohqsg
work life balance in Singapore? error 404,btohqsg
At least i had things to do when im studying for finals,btohqsg

NS is using Zoom to teach us lessons,btohqsg
