so most chinese chinese students in sg,btohqsg
or maybe what i saw was proportion of each race that made it to uni,btohqsg
ns i feel like if u ask this qn u also have some level of privilege,btohqsg

i think itâ€™s more of the trend over the years thatâ€™s interesting ba,btohqsg
Wah I feel like that reminded me of econs non material SOL and material SOL,btohqsg
like malay proportion that made it to uni is still very low compared to chinese or indian,btohqsg
which can be attributed to a lot of factors,btohqsg
including the dynamics and values a lot of their families have,btohqsg
local U only got 1 criteria to get in for citizens tho just do well and can get in,btohqsg
if cant get in means skill issue,btohqsg
If u think that u are better than other people without knowing what privilege looks like then you would also be enjoying some level of privilege what,btohqsg

But the thing abt IRL is that if i wanna disengage i just walk away,btohqsg
like its blown out of proportion,btohqsg
"theres also the interesting debate on ""are sap schs racist""",btohqsg
But i would say that systemic racism in SG is very different from systemic racism in US,btohqsg
And this all stems from the fact that from a SG perspective there is no clear understanding on what racial harmony is,btohqsg
Racial harmony vs racial acceptance vs racial tolerance,btohqsg
Even if u go to IPS and see there is no clear definition of RH which they use in their studies,btohqsg
I hav Special Multi Split Personality is Real,btohqsg
