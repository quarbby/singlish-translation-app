4 wheel steering at 420nm of torque,btohqsg
Did u pass by Sengkang? 20 mins ago?:),btohqsg
They do have a clutch paddle actually,btohqsg
On the back of the steering wheel,btohqsg
They need to use it at lower speeds only though  higher speeds can do clutchless shifts,btohqsg
I pick the Megane RS too! I indicated my choice in the Telegram post tooðŸ˜Š-R,btohqsg
too much fun packed in one small hatch,btohqsg
they still require the clutch paddle to pull away,btohqsg
and its actually very hard to module the clutch paddle,btohqsg
sequential gearbox are also much faster shifting  much more efficient and much lighter,btohqsg
Itâ€™s semi auto la. Still auto,btohqsg
auto is the computer change gear for you leh,btohqsg
woah sir i think you got it wrong leh,btohqsg
its not like a auto car with paddle shifter,btohqsg
its a manual car that uses hydraulic to change gear upon input by the driver,btohqsg
Which is still classified as auto,btohqsg
it still require the driver to use the clutch,btohqsg
does your auto car require you to depress the clutch?,btohqsg
okay so motorbikes with autoblipper and quickshifter is auto,btohqsg
All f1 cars r auto. They just have paddles shifters,btohqsg
no bro... Cars do not have sequential gears,btohqsg
sequential gearbox is alm impossible to get leh,btohqsg
okay so are rally cars automatic too?,btohqsg
1st time got ppl tell me f1 car is manual,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ i have no idea which part is auto,btohqsg
F1 driver must move the paddle shift? Right?,btohqsg
auto cars can do it too,btohqsg
but they have completely different style of gearbox,btohqsg
Why are F1 Cars Automatic?The simplest answer as to why F1 cars are automatic is due to efficiency. It is easier to shift gears via the steering wheel only  not having to move your hand off the wheel to grab the shifter or use your foot to operate a clutch pedal.,btohqsg
they have no clutch to shift gears...,btohqsg
If dun use hand  cannot move   must be a manualRight?,btohqsg
"Along with using paddles for gear up and down. They do have to use a clutch paddle as well when moving off. Hence the launch speeds are different. Alongside that  if it was ""conventional auto""  there would be no way to stall it during a race as the computer would take over. Yet  many drivers have stalled their cars during races before  albeit they do have a clever anti stall system built in",btohqsg
then their fingers move for tiktok dance ah,btohqsg
No point explaining sequential and dog boxes to Mr Pete @Jingxunn,btohqsg
Have F1 Cars Always Been Automatic?F1 cars used to employ manual transmissions in their vehicles. However  they have been using automatics since 1989.,btohqsg
Not sure why the admins so favourable to trollers like this,btohqsg
Even f1 website say it is auto u donâ€™t come n troll,btohqsg
Mr Pete  why dont we set up a day we travel to sepang for some sequential gearbox racing,btohqsg
"u can try out the ""f1 style gb""",btohqsg
Sry I don do useless things.,btohqsg
first time i hear people say F1 is automatic tbh,btohqsg
is F1 is automatic the clutch burn before the race even start,btohqsg
cant even handle the power output,btohqsg
they are set upto explain in a simplistic manner,btohqsg
you can go to their media team and ask them to explain how it works i bet they dont even know,btohqsg
F1 website say already f1 cars r auto u still want to say manual,btohqsg
Speechless but titi gong titi gong,btohqsg
