Last time 2018 Mazda 3 with all the accessories only 80k 😂,btohqsg
Haha even if coe drop to same levels also wont see this prices le,btohqsg
Yes ..with inflation maybe around 100k++ .. but not like 170k 😂 but with rental company bidding …hard to go back to 2018 COE price. 2018 COE price cheap is because Uber exit SG during that year.,btohqsg

Hi guys  any idea why Skoda Octavia getting more and more popular? Been seeing it frequently on the road recently and also more and more zhng the car. Is it a new trend?,btohqsg
Many Features loaded as compared to some features are optional in its brother brands..Good drive. Spacious with its big boot. Auto tailgate function is available too. Matrix headlights.Pickup is helped with mild hybrid technology as well. Overall quite satisfied except the after sales svc have to improve more. My MU died 3 mths into the new car. That's just my bad luck I guess. But overall the car gives me a premium feel,btohqsg
Nowadays see more of it on the road  seems like a good drive,btohqsg
Got my vrs at 17k depre last year,btohqsg
Good and feels premium  comfort value for money!,btohqsg
