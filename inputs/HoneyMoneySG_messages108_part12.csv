Both my shifu say not good  so I need to follow them,btohqsg
There is no bad cards  just how it suit your lifestyle,btohqsg
by ranked of importance  PPV prob on 5th of my list.,btohqsg
That's why some use ezlink card üëçüèª,btohqsg
You go to youtube search under chris .. you will know... bro.. because in the end whatever he mention. It really makes sense,btohqsg
If they think it is better why not  each to their own,btohqsg
Quite funny. But it will eventually become like max chat lol,btohqsg
i love the UOB Trio. Ladys   PPV   VS,btohqsg
Ya too much is not fun  it‚Äôs terror,btohqsg
Might need to lock him up in that group chat again,btohqsg
oh so u know the tale ü§°,btohqsg
There is no good/bad card.Only suitable/non-suitable card according to your lifestyle.I think you have to learn to live and let-live,btohqsg
Alright bro.. I will listen to the guys and ladies advise also.I will keep quiet .. or else later like other group got ban.. I be quiet.,btohqsg
Just behave yourself and don't cross the line to disturb others or admin will come in,btohqsg
Ok bro.. I listen to you,btohqsg
Hi experts  I am new to Tbills and I wanna ask if I were to apply for Tbills via my CDP account number using the OCBC app  will the interest earned be credited to my bank or will it be going elsewhere?,btohqsg
Credit to the CDP link bank acc,btohqsg
At CDP page can input your crediting bank acc,btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies. Need your advise on this.  Singlife saving account at 3%. Can advise on any risk involved  or capital guaranteed.  Thanks,btohqsg
The link you sent has all the answers to your question,btohqsg
How about the invested amount after maturity?,btohqsg
I saw it .. bro.What I worry is whether principal protect. Capital guarantees.. it is a insurance saving   whenever they put insurance I fear of capital whether protected .,btohqsg
Did you actually read the link you send?,btohqsg
Because it is something like a syfe management account  which is different from a bank saving account .. I have intention to put $$ in.. I have a bit of fear  any bros have put in this singlife account before. Any review.,btohqsg
This product has been around for a while. The biggest problem is $10k only. A bit waste time.But it‚Äôs safe.,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs capital guaranteed and sdic insured  what are you worried about?,btohqsg
10k at 3% isn‚Äôt even worth it,btohqsg
Scared don't put Put don't scared,btohqsg
Bros. Because I have put in about 20k at stash uob account at about 2% plus per annum.. now I looking for something higher than 2%++,btohqsg
Uob one  ocbc 360  maribank  tbills  SSB? All gives you more than 2% at a higher than 10k cap. Why even bother with uob stash in the first place,btohqsg
With all the salary loopholes  you can have 150k in uob one  100k each in ocbc 360  dbs multiplier. Still got excess? Dump them into hsbc ega. All of the above provides more than 3%... Why bother with anything less with such a low cap?,btohqsg
You want something safe and capital guaranteed  tbills loh. Easily more than 3%,btohqsg
Now  the 5 eligible transaction cannot transfer money to another account 5 times? Need to use the credit card?,btohqsg
Spore saving bonds already invested also...,btohqsg
Just that the saving Stash account uob per annum is low,btohqsg
We have given you so many other options  yet you still hung up on the SSB and stash. I mean if you want to go for singlife go ahead ah  it‚Äôs your money,btohqsg
i think even if you ask meta AI  im sure meta ai can recommend many more than 2%.just need to do some reading some watching of youtube videos.,btohqsg
I think he watch but don‚Äôt comprehend,btohqsg
Alright bros. Thanks for your advise.,btohqsg
spend some time watching videos and doing some reading. I am sure you will get more returns rather than asking here.there is a search button here also  im sure if you spend the time to search  there's definitely more returns,btohqsg
Assuming 200k SSB  150k UOBone  100k OCBC. Got alot of place to put for safe fund liao. If need or want more can get RM to 'recommend' liao. All more than 2%.,btohqsg
Is there a data point on what constitutes into the 500 spending for ocbc 360? Not sure if insurance counts since it‚Äôs counted for uob one,btohqsg
yea but i think i saw insurance premiums not counted,btohqsg
He deposit in Singapore pools maybe more than 2%,btohqsg
As usual read up tnc on ocbc website to be 100 percent confirm,btohqsg
i also know but seeing if anyone tried before,btohqsg
Follow the tnc and u wont be wrong. Have never heard of ppl say paying insurance work for ocbc card,btohqsg
Does anyone know if buying ntuc vouchers count towards eligible spend for Citibank cashback+?,btohqsg
