Yes youâ€™re right honest and truthful drivers canâ€™t get jobs because of her,btohqsg

If tips shown in receipt (say payable by customer). Restaurant staff told me they will pay me once I drop the 2 orders.Is it correct?,btohqsg
Once u complete  don't swipe cash collected,btohqsg
By right when u cfm order n bill  they will pay the tips over St their end when they see order completed,btohqsg
Wah power sio car or bike?,btohqsg
So I donâ€™t press cash collected ??,btohqsg
how do we get the missions arz,btohqsg
Anyone near concourse / golden mile wanna meet dinner?,btohqsg
Restaurants mostly will pay via credit. Once u complete the job they can see on their side then will pay tips. Leave the cash collected unswiped. When they credit the tips  u will see the cash collected disappear and the tip will be shown in ur wallet.,btohqsg
U can press cash collected if u collect the cash tips,btohqsg
I will always call the customer after I complete if there's tips to be collected  to remind them. Although llm say now don't need call liao,btohqsg
