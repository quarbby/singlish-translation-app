OK i dun want to go into tricky territory with this but at least don't discriminate them like that?,btohqsg
even the gay community is against this,btohqsg
u read what this girl say,btohqsg
do yk how many detransitioners are suing the medical practicioners for psychoing them into transitioning,btohqsg
Idk why they want to focus on stuff like that when they have bigger problems to worry about but sure,btohqsg
like from w = -p (v2-v1),btohqsg
to - mR ( T2 - T1),btohqsg
Eh all I see is news on that so I was like this a bad thing or not??,btohqsg
where r u when i need backup,btohqsg
OHHH OK NOW I SEE IT THANKSS UU,btohqsg
its not in my nature to ignore sia,btohqsg
Idk why they suddenly thought I mean that trans kids shld choose whether they wanna transition,btohqsg
dont say so fast i only studying cfa level 1,btohqsg
so u think kids can choose,btohqsg
kids shudnt transition  they dont even know whats gg on,btohqsg
and they have the maturity and insight to choose to transition,btohqsg
i hope u never have kids for their own sake,btohqsg
No I didn't say that I meant that it's kinda dumb that American politicians choose to focus on this matter when there are more concerning things like gun control,btohqsg
but if u go by that line of argument wouldnt any other legislations be irrelevant? wouldnt any other bill enforced on things like gun lgbt and women’s rights be irrelevant since theres bigger issues at hand like the environment,btohqsg
I didn't say kids shld choose,btohqsg
and by that line of argument wouldnt what u consider to be pertinent become senseless to another?,btohqsg
say u consider that the environment is impt for eg,btohqsg
but why shld the environment matter to me if im concerned about pushing poverty out? instead i wld rather dig more oil just so i can support my economy better and disregard the damages to environment entirely,btohqsg
u should be more concern about the recession coming ahead rather then all this lgbt issue lol,btohqsg
and to u lgbt may be impt,btohqsg
Then now TikTok’s American security person step down,btohqsg
to me i care more abt gun control that idh time to care for lgbt,btohqsg
Eh they wanna ban tiktok in USA tho right,btohqsg
since in my perspective lgbt and gender equality has alr made a far way p since the beginning,btohqsg
why ppl care so much abt american gun control and lgbt issue when we live on SG haha,btohqsg
Funny they say that tiktok collecting data when their own companies do it lmfaooo,btohqsg
want to be concern at least concern about job security and housing,btohqsg
now gender equality and womens rights are being subverted by the woke cult,btohqsg
nabei u concern lgbt and gun control on US got what use,btohqsg
sportswoman of the year? a biological man,btohqsg
white house woman of the year?,btohqsg
Everything already hella gray at this point,btohqsg
why the fuck u changing the subject literally nobodys talking abt tiktok,btohqsg
Tbh   at least they don’t blatantly flaunt ships with massive ass satellites,btohqsg
anyone using the latest windows updates  my font fuckign weird,btohqsg
anna why we jumping around topics rn,btohqsg
i mean the tiktok attack is obviously political but who the fuck brought that up,btohqsg
the train of thought going brrrrr,btohqsg
the point of this is that anna here is in favour of mutilitating kids,btohqsg
letting a kid transition when he doesnt know better,btohqsg
tbvh everytime i hear i read until,btohqsg
i cant decide where u wld place urself ss,btohqsg
wan le wan le wan le,btohqsg
lgbt stuff should be kept out of schools tbh,btohqsg
bc i dont think he has the mental capacity to be aware of politics,btohqsg
