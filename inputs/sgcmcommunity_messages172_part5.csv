Is not a safe vehicle too. Try press the car door and you will know the reason. Lol.,btohqsg
Damn. I was thinking to change my Altis to a cross over SUV when Coe drop next time. I thought Yaris cross is a good alternative to the corolla cross,btohqsg
Dun change if you are comfortable with the car. For me  the car has too many shortcoming,btohqsg
Is it for new driver  the car insurance will be more expensive since prior no track records to prove safety and no claim?,btohqsg
Wife say cabin very squeezy with baby chair. Then asking if good opportunity to change,btohqsg
For CAT A cross over Vezel is popular  but the size different when I see online like not much different. Unless you willing to change to a cat B suv with a lesser lease then I think got worth. If change to another cat A cross over like not much changes in the space,btohqsg
You changing to new or used car?,btohqsg
I wld choose a Mazda6 over Camry,btohqsg
Space wise when I sit in at the back of cross,btohqsg
Current market  better buy used car. Next time coe drop  you will loss alot.,btohqsg
Or new vezel it's definitely feel shorter n smaller,btohqsg
To me car is cheap expensive is that paper or right to use,btohqsg
If really want space  Honda Shuttle,btohqsg
I feel its a super underrated car,btohqsg
Cost 20k more compared to a Mazda 6,btohqsg
I think toyota is just overpriced now,btohqsg
Can cut cost for something similar w size n boot,btohqsg
I think you meant COE. (lol),btohqsg
Okay lah same same but even before coe hike i feel its abit overpriced,btohqsg
But Mazda 6 has no hybrid....I think...,btohqsg

Just stick with ur current car until one more baby comes out,btohqsg
I assume now is only one child based on what u say ah,btohqsg
Felt it look better thn current Camry,btohqsg
Hybrid is gonna hurt your wallet,btohqsg
I mean when u drive until u need replace the hybrid battery,btohqsg
Feels like its gna cost more than ur,btohqsg
Imagine you need to change battery and overhaul,btohqsg
Batteries they dont change the entire thing,btohqsg
Now they scan n replace or repair the affected cell,btohqsg
Full petrol is the way to go,btohqsg
Yes correct. Wife say if 1 more baby the car seat put where if stick with Yaris cross ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

I saw receipts from servicing and they were rather expensive. Lots of small things to fix. Not just the usual oil change.,btohqsg
So the sceptic in me is thinking if I buy this car I will also end up forking out $$$$ to maintain,btohqsg
Service history usually good  but I've never seen such a long list of fixes on a parf car before,btohqsg
The signs all there. Usually first few years warranty when they do servicing  got errors will fix for you the parts that are faulty.,btohqsg
