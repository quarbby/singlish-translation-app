I think rating would be of use on future.. llm is tech company. They will make carrot and stick out of anything.,btohqsg
Look at the benefit of putting sticker...Think the carrot of priority is foc to lalamove.,btohqsg

But if you cannot call. They already warn you  otherwise the kick you out of llm,btohqsg
Just to defend myself. This was due to initial driver cancel. I was replacement driver... Then give funny2 direction.,btohqsg

U go confront. Mean intentional...u out of llm bro,btohqsg

This Yum Cha Orders had been a scammer order.,btohqsg
I take 5 times  they always last mins or hours cancellation,btohqsg
I had posted up last Sunday to reminder lala delivery ppl to take note this order. Try not to take unless you really need it.,btohqsg
I guess may be Lalamove give credits for restaurants who hit the min. orders  then Yum Cha creates orders and cancel orders inordet to get the benefits without the needs to pay llm commission.,btohqsg
Then bad luck on me :(,btohqsg
May be use LIVE EXPRESS RIDERS app,btohqsg
That y I kick Yum Cha out of our group list,btohqsg

Maybe trying to flush out excessive riders,btohqsg
Now motorcycle multi stop trip becomes $4+ per stopUsed to be $6,btohqsg
