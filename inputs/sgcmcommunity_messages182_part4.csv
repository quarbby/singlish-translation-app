If you're in open carpark  drive out and floor hard to gantry? That's also a possibility,btohqsg
And then jam brake for gantry,btohqsg

How long is long enough to warm up?  My father in law always warm up for 15 min. He always scold me when I only warm up for 1 minute 😂,btohqsg
Old Volkswagen beetles do not require you to warm up to go. But like many member said  inch off slowly is ok  dont race the engine.,btohqsg
15 min warm up time is complete madness. You'd only need a minute or so from absolute cold to start driving  then just take it easy until the engine oil reaches operating temp,btohqsg
Netizens everywhere bemoan insurance policies after camcar gets rear ended by Malaysian vehicleYou can do everything right and things will still go wrong...➡️ Read the full storyHERE!👉🏻 React with 🤬 if you have had a similar situation before!,btohqsg
To be fair  diesel engine are the ones that require warm up  not petrol.Petrol usually you move off slowly can le.,btohqsg
The issue with the Old Beatles cars is that it relies on the wind generated when being driven to keep cool  rather then the current models that has a radiator fan. My dad used to have one and when it was a very bad traffic jam (causeway)  he would start worrying about the heat generated.,btohqsg
When the engine is absolutely cold  the oil has mostly drained from the top end where the valvetrain is. You allow about a minute for that area to be well soaked with oil before moving off. Do you have to do it? No. But i definitely will,btohqsg
Yes  it was counter-intuitive for older aircooled beetles instead. cool quirk. 🤣,btohqsg
1 min also allows the cold start routine to complete which gets your cats up to temp  making them more effecient,btohqsg
Once you put your car in drive you automatically cancel cold start,btohqsg
All my cars no cats lol,btohqsg
Well thats not legal and doesnt apply to 99.999% of drivers on the road,btohqsg
"Neither my car can put to ""Drive"". lolHas 3 pedals lol",btohqsg
you should always warm up by redlining the engine,btohqsg
So further confirm your advice does not apply to 99.999% of drivers thus its not useful,btohqsg
Not trying to give you a hard time. But guys with regular cars need different recommendations,btohqsg
What I am saying is  there is no need to start and wait for a minute. Just move off slowly is ok. Don't trash can le. It is true about cold  but Singapore isn't a cold place. In Winter  yes that is recommended.,btohqsg
Cold is not referring to ambient. Its referring to the engine. If the engine is not at operating temp  it is considered cold,btohqsg
No issues  sir. You are on point. 👍,btohqsg
SG's winter would be our monsoon season. lol,btohqsg
