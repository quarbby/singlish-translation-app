lol then thats actually messed up,btohqsg
meanwhile there is tm where i think the top scorer for h1 math is full marks,btohqsg
h2 math probably has some genius but i dunno their score,btohqsg
"So when they applied to PhDs elsewhere they need a special explanatory note to explain that their ""fail"" 40% is actually top in their uni",btohqsg
to be expected since its iit,btohqsg
meanwhile the highest in h1 physics is 79,btohqsg
uk i was an asshole inj2,btohqsg
i think everyone will know IIT is prestigous enough though,btohqsg
coz right at j2 prelims  there was this guy in my class who tied with me at 78,btohqsg
but i was lucky my paper got calculation error,btohqsg
Reminds me of what my friends did to me,btohqsg
then the next day in school  i was so eager to get it corrected,btohqsg
They took my paper and argued why I should not have gotten the mark for one qn,btohqsg
So I won't be first in cohort lol,btohqsg
and i cant imagine mr bryan leong was actually fast in changing the list lmao,btohqsg
welcome to sg i guess  ppl will do anyth to pull others down and push themselves up,btohqsg
then ask her study harder omo,btohqsg
Eh they were just salty of me,btohqsg
Cuz I didn't study and got 180/180,btohqsg
there was no one that was even close to my grades in my class except econs,btohqsg
So they tried to lower my score?,btohqsg
So idk how u argue if someone deserves the mark or nit,btohqsg
wah then there is really nth to be salty about,btohqsg
not everyone and prestige won’t matter compared to what’s on the transcript if it’s a fail,btohqsg
it is a skills issue alr,btohqsg
meanwhile mine was not about people being salty,btohqsg
for a lot of unis in US or Europe  unis in other parts of the world are pretty unknown,btohqsg
but they always act surprised at my marks  especially chem,btohqsg
mine is they know i study but act surprised,btohqsg
wah and ur cher is sleeping?,btohqsg
it is better than my classmates who never finish work,btohqsg
Josh when he realizes yt didn't fail a levels,btohqsg
i want him here just for a short while,btohqsg
my chem chat full of cher chasing for hw submission,btohqsg
He joining back on April's fool,btohqsg
uk something im really surprised about is my physics cher saying the trend has been that the top scorer is from the arts class taking physics,btohqsg
My most useful skill i took away from ns,btohqsg
Is looking busy when I'm actually not,btohqsg
For my batch I think all the arts subject was topped by science students,btohqsg
my batch the people are no where near the top of the list lmao,btohqsg
wait…so they never take math at all ah,btohqsg
my class dominated but there is only like 3-4 As (that is the highest omo),btohqsg
i think my year physcics paper had to draw 20 marks of graphs,btohqsg
2018 a level phy p3 q1  all sketching,btohqsg
Shit my superiors like to dump work on me,btohqsg
Because to them higher rank = more work,btohqsg
then there was a class where there was only 1-2As????,btohqsg
iestin did you have to draw spacetime diagram for nelly,btohqsg
Given how fucking bad my graph drawing is im surprised i survived it,btohqsg
there is 1 arts class taking physics i think,btohqsg
