On 14th June 2020  Amos international founder Danny Lien sold 61 million shares at approx. $0.0227.So who bought from him ?Can retailers absorbed that much ?Food for thought üí≠This one just getting started in my opinion.FYI  during its heyday several years back  it was called Gaylin before they merged with Amos International  they were trading. At $0.60x range.Nevertheless they have been heavily diluted since then with issuance of new shares and the recents rights too.Added some chips and collect with smart money $0.022.DYODD.,btohqsg
