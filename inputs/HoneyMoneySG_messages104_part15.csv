Also better to check Mar MAB from the app. Make sure you top-up at least 100k above the Mar MAB shown on the app.,btohqsg
He means Mar $50k  add Apr $50k  add May $100k,btohqsg
I know but why. But he also explained after ü§£,btohqsg
Thank you for this tip will go online and make sure I fulfill the full 50K topup,btohqsg
He want $100k above Mar MAB (around $50k),btohqsg
Even 1 cent can determine whether you get earmarked or not. For maintaining 150k MAB in May to get 4% p.a.  assuming it's currently 100k  do make sure it's 152k tomorrow till end of month.,btohqsg
Can I ask why 152K and not 150?,btohqsg
Your MAB will only be 148k. If you don't mind losing $10 interest can ignore.,btohqsg
I see...Does the amount already earmarked for rising dragon still count as part of the incremental fund?,btohqsg
You still have earmarked fund? When does it get released? I assume it's the 50k that you clocked MAB in Mar.,btohqsg
It is earmarked earlier than the promotion period then it may not be counted as fresh fund,btohqsg
Anyone know how to maximise the UOB one account interest? I have spend 500 and salary credit‚Ä¶ but the month end interest does not seems to show,btohqsg
Earmarked funds will never be fresh funds since it never left your account.Also you can try to register this month but your 100k incremental funds may not get earmarked. At most try registering again in Jun or wait for Jul promo (if have).,btohqsg
Bonus interest only comes in on 2nd business day of the month.,btohqsg
oh! I had no idea that earmarked fund will not be part of incremental - thank you for the info. will keep in mind,btohqsg
Hopefully you can get the 100k earmarked  then it'll be a new data point.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn! I try and see :),btohqsg
Today is public holiday. Bank staffs are not working. You have a good rest. Please check again tomorrow.,btohqsg
Anyone can see this promo on Webull for existing clients? Because I can‚Äôt see it  not sure why not,btohqsg

#dpUsed ShopBack Pay at Gain City transaction classified as 5814 Fast Food,btohqsg
I split the payment between WWMC and Revo  and used ShopBack Pay. Both classified as 5814. Mind blown ü§Ø,btohqsg
Shopback can be quite crazy with mcc at time,btohqsg
At least got data point that allocate fastfood to gain city now haha,btohqsg
I thought so too until I saw these,btohqsg
guess need to check mcc if charge direct  lol,btohqsg
No. ShopBack. Fave. Kris+. Changipay.All can change mcc albeit ShopBack is rare to change mcc.,btohqsg
Shopback + Citi Cashback = 6% at Gain City üòÇ,btohqsg
Need to factor in Fcy risk n Fcy conversion loss of about 3.26%. Actual return may be lower after the Fcy loss.,btohqsg
Try to bite into your electronics.. maybe it's cake ü§£,btohqsg
Haha‚Ä¶ my teeth might be falling off after that,btohqsg
Lower or higher I guess.Still all in all I can‚Äôt see anything else more attractive than this  can you ?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see it attractive because of 3.26% loss. I personally will prefer moomoo 6.8% if want to choose between the two.,btohqsg
Question for Stash doing the promo.Since Stash is only 3%.And the promo likely end somewhere say Mid May when UOB release the earmark $100k back to you.Still have to tahan the $100k at 3% all the way until end of month right? 3% is lower than many other such as EGA/eSaver.So Stash is a very bad account to do the UOB Promo IMO.,btohqsg
3 percent to hold till the end for earmark promo is not that bad as u percieve since i am only going to all out for hsbc ega in jun,btohqsg

Hello is there any promotion to sign up for UOB credit cards now?,btohqsg
If u are new to uob credit card sign up   u can refer to singsaver,btohqsg
Did you participate Webull promo before n withdraw money when promo ended?,btohqsg
I only participate in the welcome bonus in April,btohqsg
I‚Äôm even going so far as to skip the Uob one account until I have a $1000 account to do Plunging Chicken on.$100k existing + $50k earmark is not worth it to me for 4.5 months lock-in. Only approx 4.4% pa.I rather put in HSBC EGA and play musical chairs. Also about 4.5% pa and no lock in.,btohqsg
Hi   can I check does using cardup to pay for my car insurance premiums counts as the qualifying reward for first time Amex krisflyer credit card? Minimum spend $500 to get 27000 krisflyer points.Thanks,btohqsg
