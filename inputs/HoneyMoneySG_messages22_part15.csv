Hi all regarding the trust card  after reading through the chats  still quite confused. freebies aside  I‚Äôm a union member ($9 a month subscription) and also uob lady‚Äôs card (dining and groceries) Considering to switch the lady‚Äôs card to categories to dining and entertainment(bars  KTV) next quarter then use trust for NTUC although I will miss out on Donki/Giant etc spends.Monthly spend ~$500 for groceries  entertainment ~$500 or more varies.I always miss out on the entertainment side of spending as some places like Izakayas and restaurant bar are considered entertainment spends. Ending up earning lousy uni$.Trying to cover the entertainment  F&B and grocery spend portion.Any thoughts ?,btohqsg

its citi. years ago in 2015 i had the same issue.,btohqsg
their processes   probably your application was lost somewhere. cause i did mine at a roadshow at amk hub,btohqsg
Just applied uob account and evol card. Unfortunately not instant approval unlike SC account and credit card..,btohqsg
Have anyone tried to withdraw from amaze card via atm when travelling overseas? Work fine?I did similar with wise before.,btohqsg
In general  should be able to call customer service to waive annual fee. No harm trying. If cannot waive then cancel the card,btohqsg
Uob acc. Is almost instant. No longer than 1 day,btohqsg
Ocbc is quite strict about wavier. If u dont meet their spending requirement  they will not waive.,btohqsg
Do you spend more than 12k in a year?,btohqsg
Existing customers would be super fast,btohqsg
Am PR so only my spouse have cpf account now,btohqsg
If u self employed. Then can top up until the max cap. If employed. I not too sure.,btohqsg
No I don't spend more than 12k per year on ocbc 365.,btohqsg
amaze will charge for overseas withdrawal though  i think better to use wise,btohqsg
Will I be able to earn 4mpd if I use installment plan for my UOB platinum visa ?,btohqsg
I spent below their required amount  and my annual fee waiver through the app got rejected. Was calling their hotline to try appealing (and ready to cancel my card if appeal fails)  and they end up accepting my appeal. Maybe cos I have several other OCBC accounts (360  CPFIA)  and they want to retain me? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Probably you spend close to 12k? I even have priority banking   srs  cpf is  unit trust  and still rejected üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Different experiences for me  I don‚Äôt use their frank card due to poor service and card benefits back then compared to EVOL. Wanted to cancelled but customer svc officer begged me to keep card and offer waiver for me (no questions asked) üòÇ,btohqsg
