hi guysss I have a problem :<<,btohqsg
Chemistry is actually physics but very complicated physics,btohqsg
Like chemicals reactions has roots in quantum mechanics,btohqsg
Philosophy is behind the math guy,btohqsg
"omgggg helppp is it okay if I edited my application for about 2 times? I mean will the process and chances of being accepted be affected?okay so the first time that I edited my application was when I added something then the other one was when the MOE Singapore emailed me saying  ""You have taken the first step and started your application for the ASEAN Scholarship. blah blah blah... Seize the opportunity and complete your application now using the link below:""so I was confused when I saw the title saying  ""Complete your submission for ASEAN Scholarship"" so does it mean that I still haven't finished my application or what? because from what I know I already finished and submitted my application a month ago then after I saw the title I immediately clicked edit on my application and edited it because I really thought that I was lacking something but i find out that my application was actually complete.so now I'm feeling so anxious and overthinking that editing my application might affect the chances of getting myself accepted for the scholarship and the deadline is in 2 weeks 😭😭😭",btohqsg
Guess my genshin main difficulty level: extreme,btohqsg
errrr oh i think it might be,btohqsg
al haitham? but im not sure,btohqsg
I wanna ask uh SAT seemed to be o level difficulty ? Is there any USA exam that is A level difficulty ?,btohqsg
SAT is not comparable to o or a levels,btohqsg
the closest to our standardised testing would be the AP ones,btohqsg
I mean either ways the British and American system is fundamentally different AP or SAT all are supplements to your High School Diploma whereas Alevelsisyour High school Diploma,btohqsg
Any1 got tips to study for noi as a j1,btohqsg
Maybe can compare A levels to IB,btohqsg
pay attention to every science practical lesson  they are very helpful for practicing practical and basically the closest time to using the equipment.,btohqsg
ouh that one idk anything abt naational olympiad,btohqsg
i am also studying for noi!,btohqsg
you should look thru competitive programming algorithms,btohqsg
as well as familarize yourself with etc. dynamic programming,btohqsg
Can I compare Wyatt to Lestin,btohqsg
Need start from ground up lol,btohqsg
i am more likely to object,btohqsg
more like he is copying me 😮,btohqsg
Are you saying there is a world in which you would accept?,btohqsg
I am fat so he is fat,btohqsg
I am short so he is short,btohqsg
I have glasses so he has glasses,btohqsg
this year we don’t have for some reason,btohqsg
instead it’s conducted at sch field,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Are you a J1 in TJ? Actually I think company and friends matter way more than the venue (:,btohqsg
Cool. Hope you are enjoying Solstice!,btohqsg
Erms. Was. I’m a really old person. J25 … no typo 🦖,btohqsg
ya the school alw use that,btohqsg
this year suddenly got a lot people take bio chem,btohqsg
Physics in the decline cuz Wyatt and Lestin taking it,btohqsg
Would say it more towards those interested in the Maths side,btohqsg
this year bio until class 18/19 i think,btohqsg
Guys I was thinking if anyone here have experiences with subject they don't like but the subject they dislike ultimately saved them for final exams like O levels,btohqsg
not too sure eh i’ll check and get back to you if i remember to,btohqsg
Ahhh that means 5-6 classes. Anyway  don’t bother about it. Enjoy the rest of Solstice and O’Fest!,btohqsg
did you just call me fat and short,btohqsg
i am calling US fat and short,btohqsg
around 170 ppl from the looks of it,btohqsg
Thanks for remembering to update. Do you know how the number compare with phy+chem students?,btohqsg
hi guys!! does anyone here know how to do transient to dynamic switching on pscad?,btohqsg
A Level 2024 Results To Be Released On 21 February 2025,btohqsg
dates not confirmed but should be sometime in March,btohqsg
lol. MultiSIM Maybe can do dynamic.,btohqsg
depends your testbench setup and what you're doing tbh.,btohqsg
is it a power system things?,btohqsg
just googled PSCad. Apparently it is for Power System lol,btohqsg
If you need a crash course on Power Electronics -https://www.youtube.com/@ryanchan8583/videos,btohqsg
Power System lectures I used to have recordings  but in my personal hard disk. My lecturer used to show us on the System in a Loop kind of feedback mechanisms to tune a plant,btohqsg
just curious  isn't the only Singapore Government Unis is only NUS/NTU right?,btohqsg
Someone told me SMU is the 3rd gov. uni.,btohqsg
NUS NTU SMU SUTD SIT SUSS UAS,btohqsg
I feel like uas one a bit iffy,btohqsg
Actly wat happen to yale nus thing,btohqsg
But then i think uas is like idk if it is a public or private one,btohqsg
In a sense it got dissolved with usp to form nus college,btohqsg
I rmb i saw news of it,btohqsg
It's a public institution that has private sub colleges,btohqsg
It's not a new thing tbh SIM uni was smth similar,btohqsg
Actually UAS is literally nothing changed from status quo. Both alr where exceptions to the norm which could use Tutiton grant,btohqsg
What I get from Wiki:- TheSingapore Management University(SMU) is a publicly-funded private university in Singapore. Founded in 2000- TheSingapore University of Social Sciences(SUSS) is apublicautonomous universityinSingapore- TheSingapore Institute of Technology(SITorSingaporetech) is apublicautonomous universityinSingapore- TheSingapore University of Technology and Design(SUTD) is apublicautonomous universityinSingapore.-The University of the Arts Singapore[1](UAS) isSingapore's first public-funded private university of the arts. It was formally announced in 2021.,btohqsg
NUS Yale is a constituent of NUS,btohqsg
So doesn't count as independent or Autonomous,btohqsg
so SMU is still classify as Private?,btohqsg
ah so misleading the Wiki lol,btohqsg
nus ntu smu sutd sit suss,btohqsg
It's government funded not government sch,btohqsg
U wanna get technical all are only government funded,btohqsg
only 6 are recognized by the government as public university,btohqsg
Bodoh they haven't updated yet la,btohqsg
UAS only started their first intake in late 2024,btohqsg
Anyways argue for what. For all intends and purposes its 7,btohqsg
aiya more public sch and more uni student = harder to find job + sch reputation decrease,btohqsg
I think is still 6 tho,btohqsg
U apply and as a student of NAFA or Laselle there isn't any difference vs in SIT anyways,btohqsg
Arts either waysall become unemployed 0 vs 0 got diff meh,btohqsg
Hey guys I just applied to NusWhat should I do after this like I have seen some people say to keep in contact with admission officer how should I do it ??,btohqsg
im making a short film but the script lowkey corny,btohqsg
What kind of mood r u gg for in ur video? Nostalgia?,btohqsg
NUS applicants can keep in contact with the admissions officer?😵‍💫,btohqsg
Later u give ppl shoot 🔫 🤣,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  Naomi I think she did study in laselle,btohqsg
I have a friend she graduated from laselle .. got a job i think in Charles and Keith now,btohqsg
Not all cannot find job. It's just the $$ issue how much is enough for them,btohqsg
Unisim also 1/2 govt 1/2 private?,btohqsg
any tips on how to write faster,btohqsg
i feel the video it is like gonna propose to a guy/girl you like vibes lol,btohqsg
Slow-panning; zoom out view: first person POV walks maybe.Use few words to elaborate the scene  just let the scene do the ‘talking’.,btohqsg
Honestly  skim through and plan first for 10 mins. Mostly for source based ones  find out if the sources agree of disagree with the main topic sentence,btohqsg
💤...lmao i thought the riot ended in Seoul..,btohqsg
But no..they're having the riot after the Marshall law..,btohqsg
But they're very civilised in crowd control and etc. The supporters are been ferried with buses..so is the policeman too.,btohqsg
If anyone here need it   my friend upload to grail too btw,btohqsg
Just pending approval from the page operator,btohqsg
News was reported. Unhappy with the current korea president,btohqsg
Lmao..it's all over the area. Like the city area,btohqsg
the difference is a riot is violent,btohqsg
It is..just that they handle it well..doesn't look so bad,btohqsg
Is it that ez to bite off more than u can chew in j1,btohqsg
Technically j1 is a transitional period,btohqsg
So it is quite usual to experience difficulty during first year.,btohqsg
Especially with like cca commitments and projects,btohqsg
Ye trying to sign up for alot of things,btohqsg
wa just got my jc timetable,btohqsg
is it normal for it to be packed till 6pm daily,btohqsg
Well even in Poly  schedule can be as packed too. I have friends from game design course and the schedule sometimes is until 9pm because the project cannot be done at home !,btohqsg
So jc students ain't unique in this situation,btohqsg
wow pingu beat me to it,btohqsg
brah my house is 15 mins walk to Tianjin University,btohqsg
the one im going for exchange,btohqsg
i have a trigo wa tmr i think im gonna die 😭,btohqsg
just remember d/dx sin(x) = cos(x) and d/dx cos(x) = -sin(x),btohqsg
you have the formula sheet  so don't worry!,btohqsg
i think this is not tested yet but thx,btohqsg
Chinese Uni the hostel price is cheap af anyways,btohqsg
Although u gotta live with 6 ppl in 1 room la,btohqsg
should drop out from art school hor  heard got one cmi art school become leader of country  quite famous,btohqsg
That one is not dropout that one is reject,btohqsg
Oh ya they all either 4 or 6 person a room,btohqsg
Yeah is cheap relative to sg or other countries,btohqsg
So what  company here rather employ cheaper foreigners. Dk what uni cert legit or not also hire. Only hire a few sporeans to hit foreign employee quota,btohqsg
Guys  can help me do survey on purchasing jewellery for my school project?https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVGOQQ5yccx2XGw1ZE-noFlJQ7AqpU1dLBqUi1qR8gxAcSqw/viewform?usp=dialog,btohqsg
Weird request but I got no friends that are between 25-34 years old,btohqsg

You mean in school or life in general ?,btohqsg

Anyone who purchase jewelry before?I ran out of options so pls help to do,btohqsg
You want get a partner or friend group?,btohqsg
I haven't uh ... but can post surveys in r/sgexams?,btohqsg
Like if it is for school,btohqsg
hmm i might be unsure of what i want to pursue in future but i believe in figuring out along the way. even if i don’t find my course relevant to what i want in future  i can still pursue them along with the new course i might be taking. my interests will prob change but my knowledge in learning new things will increase,btohqsg
For me volunteering help me steer the way in right direction uh,btohqsg
Like I know what kind of materials to produce and how to improve the materials for community use,btohqsg
It may not apply to you but I think you need guidance perhaps from someone ？,btohqsg
Maybe a counselling team can help uh ?,btohqsg
perhaps i should go see the counsellor,btohqsg
The reason why I tell you meet counselling team is prevent you from getting unwise advice from random ppl uh,btohqsg
This bro has no chill 🤣 so optimisedhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/DF-JbfBTGjw/?igsh=MWdvbHlxNGJ4cWxmdA==,btohqsg
Anything removed from new h2 phys syllabus?,btohqsg
put old and new into chatgpt and find out the diff,btohqsg
Summarize the learning outcome changes between 2024 to 2025 to 2026 for a-level physics:https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2024/9749_y24_sy.pdfhttps://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2025/9749_y25_sy.pdfhttps://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2026/9749_y26_sy.pdf,btohqsg
not sure this prompt works. I ran out of tokens for today. lol,btohqsg
Weird the number reduce tho lol,btohqsg
oh interesting means people sitting two syllabus in 2026?,btohqsg
I shld be studying 9478 while my seniors doing 9479,btohqsg
oh  there's a syllabus code for9749_y26_sy.pdf.,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/a-first-look-inside-hume-mrt-station-before-feb-28-openingHow do you pronounce this station - Hume?Hue-em? Hue-mee? Who-me?,btohqsg
P=hpgupthrust formulasremoved.But tricky thing... removed doesn't mean it won't be tested. Exams frequently gives the formulas in the question and expect students to still solve it,btohqsg
for J1s  continuation of idea of energy stores from O levelMajor rearrangement of concept flow. That's about it,btohqsg
Are you sure H2 Maths has not tested Poisson distribution before?In fact  t-distribution appeared in H2 Mathematics before.,btohqsg
Not now uh  I.e. they removed it from h2 Math,btohqsg
Can check seab syllabus for 2026 for more info,btohqsg
Note that what I am replying to.I know they are no longer in current syllabus.,btohqsg
sec 4 e math this year paper 1 no calculator? mentioned on the specimen paper,btohqsg
Good that you are aware  I am just showing concern,btohqsg
ooo i see wrong paper den,btohqsg
"It would be good that you ""learn"" how to read ""reply"". 😭",btohqsg
I want to ask the holy grail operator questions   what materials requirements qualify for uploads and display in grail  ?,btohqsg
Is there a guide of sort ?,btohqsg
H2 Math did not test Poisson distribution at all,btohqsg
The only distributions they taught us were Normal and Binomial,btohqsg
Hello  how does NS disruption work? I have an offer for SMU Computing and Law. I enlisted in 2024 Jan batch. But I really want to siam my remaining foreign exercises LOL.(+) I save 1 year(-) no post-NS 9 month break(-) have to spend my first year holiday in NS(+) probably doing other stuff because my unit is going defunct,btohqsg
Btw I did sec 5 and MI so I incurred 2 years of studying vs an IP/express student who did A Levels/IB too! So I have this pressure to keep up lol,btohqsg
Oh a fellow sec 5 and MI student,btohqsg
Great to see you actually did well enough to get a double degree in SMU,btohqsg
Most MI students dont even qualify for a degree,btohqsg
Sigh I feel that I have to keep up in this rat race,btohqsg
but I just fundamentally want to Siam my upcoming foreign exercises LOL,btohqsg
stupid nga they want me to sail during NDP,btohqsg
technically have seen someone do that if he had 1 yr and 10 mnths of NS,btohqsg
Im not sure how long before uni they allow you to disrupt though,btohqsg
Im sure theres a set duration,btohqsg
havent seen someone do that for 2 years of ns tho,btohqsg
I am pes B1 and I did tekong BMT haha,btohqsg
But he need serve his 3 months back some time,btohqsg
Doesnt have to be 1st year uni holiday,btohqsg
Even after graduate you can serve,btohqsg
Speaking of MI I want ask sth since they are unique in 3 year a levels course so 1. Will conventional jc materials work for them? 2. Is it an advantage or disadvantage given 3 years of course  like one year more time?,btohqsg
Nah Idw to wait to finish my NS liability so long  NS is a fking liability,btohqsg
1) work or not  they still gotta go through it. But success stories are a few only2) on paper its an advantage  real results wise we are no better than yijc,btohqsg
tbh i forgot much about my nsf asa stuff alr,btohqsg
It really depends on how soon you wanna disrupt,btohqsg
1. Yes it’s still a lvls2. Up to you  it was an advantage for me because I didn’t study O Level Literature  I really don’t know how to do literature in my y1 of MI  plus it was my H2,btohqsg
And I was getting used to the difficulty of H2 geography and econs,btohqsg
Back in my year  only 50% of A level students got >67.5 for As,btohqsg
I wasnt even in the 50% btw lmao,btohqsg
^closest wld be this  mostly for those who serving for 1 year and 10 mnths of ns,btohqsg
Yaa i remember its 1 week before sch starts,btohqsg
i feel like there is some missing info,btohqsg
The 3 year programme gave me more time to condition myself for the A level workload from a sec 5 workload  even tho we do only 3 H2s and GP in our graduation year which is honestly quite noob vs those who did 4h2s  h3s etc in JC lol,btohqsg
i have heard some mi ppl talk to me before abt how some of their classmate retain but idk what is the percentage,btohqsg
As far as i remember  retain rate was like 50% per year for me lmao,btohqsg
Each year the class gets cut in half,btohqsg
i think the mi principal did change some stuff about the promotion criteria,btohqsg
like cannot get S or smth like that,btohqsg
i forgot what was the rule,btohqsg
The contrasting was really what killed people,btohqsg
i feel like yall could have survived yi's promotion criteria tho ngl,btohqsg
Even people who got 3h2 pass and failed their contrast was a CONDITIONAL promotion,btohqsg
"cus if i am not wrong  our standard is ""no U grade can alr""",btohqsg
so technically mi promotion criteria is a lot harsher,btohqsg
My principal was pretty dogass back then,btohqsg
Eg y2 to y3 its 2h2 pass,btohqsg
If your other h2 was 44,btohqsg
oh for us  we just prefer the previous principal  not the current one,btohqsg
You call your mom dad come down to cry for you also no point,btohqsg
oh actually we had one person whose parents came to our school,btohqsg
Yeah she was ruthless 🥲Luckily I nvr retain at all,btohqsg
and then he miraculously got promoted even though he retained,btohqsg
(of course  yall know how he fare for A levels in the end),btohqsg
Seeing how well you did for As,btohqsg
But she encouraged me on grad day say arts stream students usually do well,btohqsg
You must be a regular wings award achiever,btohqsg
Nah never got one at all,btohqsg
I did GEL and essays are painful to write,btohqsg
Always puts a smile on my face when i hear an MI student do well,btohqsg
Haha so I think I can disrupt if I want to? Tempted to to siam the upcoming foreign exercises in the second half of the year,btohqsg
As long as your foreign exercises are after uni starts,btohqsg
You can only disrupt 1 week prior to orientation i think,btohqsg
i think can try asking like your superiors about it if not maybe the manpower asas?,btohqsg
And you need a letter from the smu stating that,btohqsg
cus i think the manpower clerk ppl may roughly know the conditions for disruption,btohqsg
Haha seeing the manpower they cfm won’t let me,btohqsg
Like you need a letter from them stating the exact school starting date i think,btohqsg
they just want to milk me dry,btohqsg
So you needa email smu hr and whatnot,btohqsg
But dont quote me on this  please go ask your ASAs,btohqsg
Not sure what are ASAs cuz I’m in navy,btohqsg
heard of them but since most tekong guys continue on to army after BMT,btohqsg
But I was posted to navy after BMT,btohqsg
Office workers that deal with this,btohqsg
My math teacher who taught me in fact now teacher in MI 😂😂 I am fascinated and definitely curious actually,btohqsg
Teaching MI students is a new kind of patience,btohqsg
I’d rather teach than sign on,btohqsg
I’d teach A Level literature  knowledge and inquiry etc,btohqsg
tbh i had thoughts abt teaching before,btohqsg
but yea teaching ppl is quite hard,btohqsg
I in fact volunteer for teaching duty in Poly cca days,btohqsg
Too bad inplace no internship for HR work..,btohqsg
I wanna sit my ass down in front of a computer...,btohqsg
Im too old to be moving around,btohqsg
Have seen a na student who went to poly teach a level chinese because he took hcl,btohqsg
OMG MAYBE THAT IS WHY TV SHOWS SHOW THEM BEING IN OFFICE,btohqsg
Unfortunately theres no internship for that so im sad,btohqsg
Ok tbh i wldnt say crash,btohqsg
But like it keeps disconnecting my internet network,btohqsg
And it takes like hours and then it disconnects,btohqsg
I did not start my lab report the day before,btohqsg
I now start it 2 days before!,btohqsg
Just need to bloody plot the graph in origin,btohqsg
The me last year would create the document wednesday night,btohqsg
No but i feel like hor,btohqsg
The problem with me now is my lab report end up being 20 pages,btohqsg
Well i needed to explain how parameter change in comsol,btohqsg
And also like how mesh sizes affect,btohqsg
I think i may have an outdated or corrupted driver :0,btohqsg
I thought to be teachers need to go through NTU NIE?,btohqsg
Wait I want ask sth about ti calculator,btohqsg
How to get Rom images like legally 😅😅 ?,btohqsg
I want official method to get it,btohqsg
Okay nvm I think I have to buy physical calc or sth 😂😁since nothing is free. I see If can get the budget. I want to feed it into emulator and demo stats for a levels students.,btohqsg
One critical issue with my materials which I had enough of is lack of support for gc users,btohqsg
I think I will get it fixed,btohqsg
sounds like a tech job. lol,btohqsg
Yea but tbh i kinda wld prefer they added it inside,btohqsg
It wld be quite beneficial for my stats mod,btohqsg
Anyone have recommendations for locations in SG that have an 80s/90s looking aesthetic?,btohqsg
last remaining active kampong in sg,btohqsg
I'm looking more for an 80s aesthetic  not a 60s aesthetic,btohqsg
Koon Seng Road in Katong  Singapore Nyonya houses i like,btohqsg
i think pagoda st  people park centre,btohqsg
I suspect that might be my best shot. It's a shame  because no one with influence really thinks about preserving that aesthetic here,btohqsg
I want ask jc students sth,btohqsg
When your graphing calculator breaks down where do you buy extra ？ as in gc totally not working that kind uh,btohqsg
Or find any graduated Seniors and ask,btohqsg
actually got a few i rmbr passing by some malls,btohqsg
it happened to me  I bought my replacement off carousell,btohqsg
beauty world plaza  upper serangoon centre ( ghib ojisan yt vid)  far east plaza  queensway shopping centre  katong shopping centre  bukit timah shopping centre  etc,btohqsg
Ohh ty for the detailed response from all who responded,btohqsg
I interested to get one and extract the rom,btohqsg
To be emulated on computer to demo Probability Distribution,btohqsg
Goddam deepseek 671b model goes crazy,btohqsg
That's a bit random but I was at my friend's house trying to work on projects on new Math materials and he shared this with me.,btohqsg
Don't sleep lol  you will feel nausea and have a tendency to vomit the following morning,btohqsg
i wish i had that but i somehow never fell sick by not sleeping 🫠,btohqsg
😂😂😂😂 I am so sorry for laughing this loud,btohqsg
Lol never fell sick by not sleeping 😅😅,btohqsg
When I upload video to website   same uh .... it demands my attention overnight,btohqsg
So I end up not sleeping,btohqsg
when i was in JC  I was so afraid to fall sick cuz I know each lecture i missed is a lot to catch up. Back then no online lectures.I kept looking at the mirror and tell myself cannot fall sick everyday for more than half a year during J2.,btohqsg
Oddly enough   rarely fell sick coz of this,btohqsg
but ya  to fall sick fast  don't drink water for a day + eat lots of chillisore throat + tonsillitis,btohqsg
dumb cuz it's a break that can't do any studying also.,btohqsg
Do JC like accept PL too? PL = parents letter,btohqsg
not sure. But the attitude of the post not right for JC student,btohqsg
The relatives mentally ill or sth,btohqsg
oh i forgot to mention  you have to do workouts as well throughout the night,btohqsg
welp. no recorded lectures back then in College.I still die die need to go to classes back in my KL College even thought know most of my lecturers can't save me.A-levels in Malaysia is basically 8am to 5pm  with no breaks sometimes. 😢 Even got break only do textbook questions and past year questions day in and day out.Thank god University was much more relaxed.,btohqsg
feels like straight out of Alabama.,btohqsg
You meant the Malaysian version? STPM,btohqsg
I heard not easy too ....,btohqsg
ah nope. I did Cambridge A-level lol,btohqsg
because STPM I'm forced to take GP in Malay  which was accounted for my CGPA lol,btohqsg
just spent $1.2k on milk powder,btohqsg
just received a set of latest Term 3 actual paper. I was kinda surprise question looks much easier now.,btohqsg
waiting for govt to give me my $1k for ages 1 to 6 babies 😂,btohqsg
SG Gov* no give u more financial support?,btohqsg
i thought macam many benefits having more than 3 children now,btohqsg
relationships with your siblings / cousin kind of vibes.,btohqsg
no  is for the 3rd child born after 18 Feb 2025,btohqsg
so basically don't have the extra 5k for medisave  don't have for the CDA.Even for those just born on 17 Feb 2025  also don't have.,btohqsg
should be abit more inclusive. lol,btohqsg
it's to push birth ratenot give money to those already gave birth,btohqsg
Honestly   I think at this point the government should welcome every childbirth equally,btohqsg
The government claims that we are struggling to replacement levels ....  what a policy then,btohqsg
I thought they should at least give for 1 Jan 2025 onwards.Though I won't qualify also.,btohqsg
the 5k for mum medisave would have covered the hospital bill,btohqsg
oof how expensive is natural birth in Singapore tho,btohqsg
your wife did C section? why sound so expensive?,btohqsg
they will welcome future birthpast birth already into statistics.welcome to the real world,btohqsg
I mean single moms don't get baby bonus I think uh,btohqsg
Natural birth gynae fee near to 3khospital bill I forgot,btohqsg
C section starts at 5k plus for gynae feeEach additional kid C section  my gynae says more dangerous  so +$500so 4th kid is +$1.5k,btohqsg
overall gynae fee before birth adds up to nearly 20k,btohqsg
well as long your pockets able to pay up. lol,btohqsg
I wonder how the local Singapore Malays be like in Singapore then.,btohqsg
of course cheap way is to go public hospital gynae.But cuz C section  I prefer a super experienced one in case of 后遗症,btohqsg
ohhh you went private one is it.,btohqsg
that explains the sky high bills.,btohqsg
5k into medisave would have been usefulbut in grand scheme of things not much,btohqsg
I think hosp bills might have risen further,btohqsg
but it could have come earlier during SG50 or SG55  then i would have benefited.,btohqsg
need to ask LHL edi why he didn't push that initiative lol,btohqsg
I still get the LIFESG credits for the kids  so ok la. Enough to go short trip,btohqsg
PM Lawrene 1st/2nd year  need give candy kot.,btohqsg
normally election budget kind of things is at the first and last year of a term lol.,btohqsg
I just feel kinda weird Singapore needs a Nuclear Research facility only,btohqsg
Wait ？do we need nuclear power plants?,btohqsg
Heard news of nuclear power studies....,btohqsg
"""The government also rolled out schemes to make green technologies  service and products such as electric vehicles economically viable for businesses operating in Singapore  while also signalling an openness to explore new sustainable sources of energy such asnuclear power.""",btohqsg
ah good la for research  as long don't have some intern go nuke the facility accidentally ok la,btohqsg
but I doubt it would be connected officially on the grid,btohqsg
I mean tbh I have somewhat heard a professor saying that somehow they are interested in nuclear energy and fusion energy,btohqsg
But i nvr rlly expected it,btohqsg
"I thought they just wanted ""consultants""",btohqsg
Fusion ? You mean smashing hydrogen atoms into helium that kind ?,btohqsg
Something like that? I mean he kinda was refering to both nuclear and fusion at the same time,btohqsg
Like that's why there is a need for consultants,btohqsg
Coz we need more energy to fuse atom than we obtained in the end,btohqsg
To assess if it is feasible or not to even have nuclear energy in the first place,btohqsg
But fission is already showing promise,btohqsg
I would prefer if they look into safety as priority 😂😂😂,btohqsg
My guess is that it wld be at the west,btohqsg
I mean to be fair tuas seems more for  industrial and chemical stuff,btohqsg
Well true that nuclear power is less toxic than standard coal and gas power plant,btohqsg
The radiation level risk is pretty high if sth goes wrong,btohqsg
If i am not wrong they have like rods to ensure it doesnt go haywire or smth loke that,btohqsg
But tbh as a physics student  I actually more concerned abt like just what happens if a flood occurs,btohqsg
Cus singapore is quite floody among monsoon season,btohqsg
So if like a flood does happen and it is damaged from there,btohqsg
That one probably need ask Japan,btohqsg
Like how they deal with flood,btohqsg
"Their prime minister ate the fish from its ""cleaned up"" water so I guess it is somewhat safe",btohqsg
Their past lessons can be valuable for us,btohqsg
Like what they learnt   Japan deal with typhoons every now and then,btohqsg
So I assume the flood mitigation they have do work,btohqsg
fast slap on ur madder face la,btohqsg
@pen_guiniiJust so you know  there's a quote that says greed takes away the life of its owners  and money earned in haste flies away equally fast,btohqsg
Hello 👋 Btw for airtag 1..and 2 any difference,btohqsg

So putting airtag seems the best choice,btohqsg
Hmmm true. MacBook's doesn't have built in cellular. lol.,btohqsg
outside of Singapore like Europe. That's more likely the case you get it stolen.,btohqsg
The new C1 modem maybe give some hope  that Apple finally wanna add a built in modem inside the laptop and charge an extra $100-200,btohqsg
Wait apple computer has in built modem ?,btohqsg
Ah for now nope. But Apple start building their own Modems now.,btohqsg
just released C1 5G modem on the new iPhone 16e.,btohqsg
typically they just get the Qualcomm's 5G chip,btohqsg
Apple bought over Intel's Mobile Communication Unit . Better be revolutionary 😂,btohqsg
6 years finally bear an actual fruit.,btohqsg
The new laptop hasn't hit the stores right?,btohqsg
then you in Uni/JC/Poly. just remember go buy with student discount with unidays.,btohqsg
You need present student card I think,btohqsg
uni year 1 time I very kiam  didn't want to buy laptop. Want to save $$.Don't know how I still managed to get A+ for programming,btohqsg
Or some kind of students proofs,btohqsg
Student Edu Email  should be fine.,btohqsg

MacBook can last more than 10 years as long you don't kill the hardware lol.,btohqsg
🤣 define how u murder the laptop,btohqsg
Netflix too much on laptop will also kill🤣 Isn't it,btohqsg
ahhh typical kill ah : Water / Coffee / Drops / Screen dead.,btohqsg
like what my mum did many years ago  put all my books on the laptop which was on the floor. She didn't know cannot stack things on top.So stacked almost 0.8 m height of books on top of laptop,btohqsg
Not to mention pushing a computer beyond limits on what it is capable of,btohqsg
don't test effects of gravity with it,btohqsg
ah  i tihnk my uni  the same  got students blank sit lecture hear teacher doing and explaining code lol. then I can see people doze off. who lazy bring a laptop to class and try to compile haha,btohqsg
Like example running games on poorly equipped hardware can also cause laptop to die faster I think,btohqsg
current modern day MacBook's screen are very fragile lol.,btohqsg
heard people left biscuit crumbs on the keyboard,btohqsg
Will just get a cheap thinkpad,btohqsg

uni time  when doing FYP  you will be needing a lot of typing. Lots and lots of stuff,btohqsg
lots of reading  lots of typing your thesis,btohqsg
I only go sch for 3hrs,btohqsg
Also kinda crazy hist and lit A lvl oso switching to typing,btohqsg
That's why bringing a laptop seems like😑,btohqsg
Guys I want ask sth since we talking about electronics now : how long (typically) does it take for device bought on amazon to reach your door step ?,btohqsg
using iPad for reading ok  but using iPad for typing  then connecting to printer to print... Maybe can  I don't know,btohqsg
😂 depends how old you want your kids to start using the Computers  and start connecting to the internet.,btohqsg
I started using Dail Up internet at the age of 4. lol.,btohqsg
from Japan? Heng suay. Thrice I bought from Amazon Japan  it somehow got returned to seller after that,btohqsg
need include proper annotations  need design in terms of the format of a technical paper,btohqsg
usa shipment i thought is like 2 weeks,btohqsg
taobao shipment usually take 2 weeks from china,btohqsg
Amazon 1 weeks is for those products that they ship from their warehouse,btohqsg
So 1 to 2 weeks reasonable,btohqsg
Taobao is by the sellers  so sellers send to warehouse  then warehouse send to SG.,btohqsg
Coz I looking into buying school related electronic supplies online,btohqsg
Like computer keyboard with foreign language markers,btohqsg
Any MJ Fans here cuz I made a playlist on spotify of his best songs:https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3T6odXlXhGp4jzMUkp9slq?si=53ec2646908c47ff,btohqsg

I dun go this kind of place,btohqsg
Ooh u mean the lobster ramen?,btohqsg
Lol I am grown up btw lol,btohqsg
I was asked by my friends though..I'm not a clubber either,btohqsg
Clubbing is not sth I would do though I think I am okay with having communication with Russian people,btohqsg
If they can tolerate my duolingo learnt standard Russian,btohqsg
But i kind of lost contacts with my Russian friends though,btohqsg
I think getting a good gf is difficult in clubs in that kind of environment,btohqsg
ahhh all the good girls at mostly after high school not that innocent anymore.,btohqsg
"alot of my primary school friends girls hot ones all jadi influencers or models  otherwise ""strong financially independent women"".",btohqsg
Uhh so no hope for me I think haha 😅,btohqsg
That one uh I dm I just want stability in relationship. Many years ago I managed to stop an infatuation from further development: the girl I initially interested in lack proper boundaries that differentiate between  bf and other guys,btohqsg
ah  as long she doesn't treat you as a spare tire. ok la,btohqsg
Looks like  I joined the wrong group  idk.😭,btohqsg
ah this is the chat group with all random topics.,btohqsg
I love how you guys can use quite deep vocabulary. than most folks. haha,btohqsg
So  it only has ppl who are studying in SG? is that it?,btohqsg
nope. so far seen some random Indians asking JEETs questions before.But main focus group is Singapore people.,btohqsg
really what. you tell any random malaysian  within that sentense  alot of people need to guess what that term even means. lol.,btohqsg
Indians and their obsession with JEE. (I'm Indian too lol),btohqsg
JEE Math is difficult I heard,btohqsg
JEE advance is quite difficult  jee mains is just fine. I gave it a few weeks ago  it was easy acc to me.,btohqsg
Although  I'm applying to singapore unis,btohqsg
Then welcome and this group is for you,btohqsg
"oh then it must be you  who posted it. 😂And I can tell you are from India/Pakistan   because you folks say ""gave"" instead of ""sat"" the paper/exam.Anyhow welcome.",btohqsg
"I didn't post it. I just joined this gc. Also  will try to use ""sat"" instead of ""gave"" in future.Don't call me out like that.",btohqsg
JEE advanced math even Oxford University students some find it really difficult to do,btohqsg
Like what they typically learn in year 1 is examined,btohqsg
It is indeed. And not just math  physics is equally hard.,btohqsg
what's your current age  how you technically plan to get admitted to NTU/NUS?,btohqsg
I'm 17 and I've already applied for NUS  however I'm still working on my application for NTU  I've decent grades apart from extracurriculars  and a cs project.,btohqsg
I've applied with my predicted scores  and SAT.,btohqsg
good luck on entrance. heard it's highly competitive to join their CS nowadays.,btohqsg
also CS not really employable also right now haha,btohqsg
with the current US job market.,btohqsg
I wonder why so many people want to go in CS lol,btohqsg
I remember when being a doctor or lawyer was the boomer way,btohqsg
Always --> Doctor  Engineer  Lawyer  Accounting.,btohqsg
ah mostly  I feel because software dev. earns more,btohqsg
I think CS can easily earn $5k-6k entry in Singapore. if they didn't get low balled.,btohqsg
hire fast fire fast for most of them,btohqsg
Ikr  and then you see accountant being outsourced,btohqsg
in Intel culture  you will hear old folks waiting for VSS application.,btohqsg
5k - 6k tbh a bit hard,btohqsg
Even my friend got only 4.8k at best,btohqsg
A cousin was in this line. Mid of last yr kenna retrenched  till now cannot find job.Employers will prefer younger grads with no kids,btohqsg
my brother used to work for KPMG in Singapore.Damn $6.5k associate position you want work die him from 8am to 3am/5am the next day....,btohqsg
tech is changing fast  always need retraining,btohqsg
Big 4 always no life one I heard,btohqsg
Back in army I hear people breaking down,btohqsg
yes. my brother broke down  quit his job last year.,btohqsg
atleast he gotten his PR status already.,btohqsg
and left Singapore back to Malaysia la.,btohqsg
not sure when he plans to revisit Singapore or what,btohqsg
I hope your brother is doing better now,btohqsg
I work mostly as a laptop technican so my stress level is low,btohqsg
But quite fun to collect free SSDs,btohqsg
but $6.5k - $2k expenses * 12 months. I think convert back to MYR x 3.3 multiplier   I think should be comfy for atleast 1-2 years. lol,btohqsg
sadly I didn't work as a Validation Engineer anymore after my Intel Trainee program.,btohqsg
It's all fun and games until you open an Alienware,btohqsg
Then you wonder why got missing screws,btohqsg
ah  those are nothing  cracked hinge and screw mounts are the nightmares lol,btohqsg
The best part is shorting a person's laptop,btohqsg
When he got deadline the next day,btohqsg
should added an A4 paper beneath before screwing back everything. 😂,btohqsg
It's mor funny when the cat go and knock off my stuff,btohqsg
Or go and sit on the keyboard,btohqsg
So fun playing with end users' pets,btohqsg
But business or law students salary gd?,btohqsg
ahhh if personal advice  if you have money earning from Uni times.Better learn how to invest money.,btohqsg
I tot entering law gg alrdy with chatgpt,btohqsg
Day tradings earns more than your University Tuition Fees. lol,btohqsg
I have university friend  started day trading during Uni.,btohqsg
enters the same Intel company as me for 4 years.,btohqsg
other day told me he reached financial freedom with $150k USD in his trading account,btohqsg
and he just wait Intel offer him Voluntary Separation Package then he can go retire.,btohqsg
From my understanding both business and law is good salary. But ppl wld recommend business more,btohqsg
Plus law is quite stressful from my understanding,btohqsg
But tbh business side you deal woth snakes more uh,btohqsg
So rlly is a pick your poison kind of scenario,btohqsg
Mmm probably like just snake ppl in general,btohqsg
red eyed people who see you more successful than them I guess,btohqsg
if you want to describe snakes,btohqsg
Esp with the emphasis that you need to work with them,btohqsg
But both r quite interesting tbh,btohqsg
But starting $ have 6k? Based on record?,btohqsg
depends whether comapny wanna low ball you or not.,btohqsg
Should be accurate coming from NUS Stats reporting to SG MOE .,btohqsg
median seems that Lawyer still highest lol,btohqsg
but career growth i tak tau la,btohqsg
Seems like serving people in court can earn alot,btohqsg
Even harder to get in now tho,btohqsg

Well that's good! Glad he made it,btohqsg
but the things he had to endure...reaching home at 11pm+ was considered early.,btohqsg
frequently past midnight. Next day early morning report workThat's Big 4,btohqsg
It's like how I heard some people work at Tiktok in order to plan their retirement,btohqsg
I like it that people are starting to plan for retirement at a younger age,btohqsg
I heard he planned to stay there at least 10 years and life frugally,btohqsg
Lol ... see this kind of similar question in the subreddit often especially prior to Poly admission,btohqsg
ah  plan for retirement in this economy? 😂Malaysia no RM 1.5mil in EPF (Sg's equivalent of CPF) no need think to retire.,btohqsg
think and plan for retirement earlier in life,btohqsg
it's easier when you have a longer term,btohqsg
also I feel that retire so early better be fruitful/productive/meaningful retirement lo. Or atleast have money vehicle bring in passive income la.,btohqsg
do things you wanna clear within your bucket list. Go on vacation with your family (if they still exists). or stay to go some form of community work of sorts la,btohqsg
