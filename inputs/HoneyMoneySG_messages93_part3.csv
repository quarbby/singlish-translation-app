Hi gurus  am a noob invester here. any feedback on my syfe core growth portfolio. Started in 2021 and have been dca-ing monthly and this is the first time I see green after almost 3 years. First time posting here. Pls be nice. =),btohqsg
Stay on course with your monthly DCA plan. My syfe equity100 (DCA weekly since 2021) has been positive since Nov 2023. It will be more green eventually as there are some China ETFs in the portfolio. China/Hang Seng markets are recovering well since early Feb 2024.,btohqsg
Hi  my HSBC bank has been restricted 3 times within 6 months after being reactivated without giving any valid reasons. It has been restricted by CDD team even I have updated my particulars at their branch. The recent restriction might hinder me to earn 1% cashback. Has anyone encountered this previously or lately? If yes  how did you resolve the matter to prevent the similar incident to happen again? Or should I just close the account?,btohqsg
What about the amount I gain  should I leave it or withdraw that amount? I mean what usually ppl do about it. Sorry noob question ha üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone know how to track which UOB transactions give me the qualifying UNI$ for the Lady‚Äôs solitaire credit card? Seems like I‚Äôm short of UNI$,btohqsg
Does anyone know a good application that tracks your spending monthly with the least amount of manual efforts (keying in  categorizing  etc) that can also provide simple insights of cashflow  etc?,btohqsg
You have to ask yourself if your syfe core growth portfolio is going to be for your long term goals like for retirement  housing  monetary gains etc. A long term investor should never be emotional no matter how the market behaves i.e. up or down. Staying invested in the market is the best course of action. One should stay disciplined and stick to your DCA plan whether you see red or green. But having said that  it is your money  so the choice is yours to decide.,btohqsg
Hi  am i able to add UOB card into googlepay before receiving the physical card?,btohqsg
Thank you so much for your insight bro üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
This one damn sian haha I wonder if it‚Äôs still worth to continue with the UOB One cc   or should I change to Uob lady‚Äôs. But Uob lady‚Äôs will be restricted to one category,btohqsg
"if you manage to hit 500 every month and spend mostly on shopees / the bonus cashback category   why not ?for uob lady   with the expiry date so close  i will not even considering applying for it UNLESS you are a big spender in that category you are selecting OR Uob Solitare ( which gives you 2 categories for more leeway )""Your earned UNI$ expires 2 years from the last day of each periodic quarter""",btohqsg
Can I ask where do I find this ?,btohqsg
Wah  Didn‚Äôt know the expiry date  thanks a lot!,btohqsg
i personally use evol as i usually can control between 300$ online and 300$ contactless. If more than 600$ i am getting new CC or using CRMC because miles expiry is 5 YEARS from the starting date of card creation. then after that is another 5 years block,btohqsg
For the Citi rewards card  how to redeem for miles? I see the website say redeem points by paying with points  cash rebate or Citi thank you rewards,btohqsg
i have not yet redeem  just started using CRMC so cant advise on that,btohqsg
go to the thankyou rewards page and choose miles,btohqsg
Thanks  will look into applying for it,btohqsg
Hi  Standard chartered just credited $500 for the promotion. Wise to empty out the account?,btohqsg
Can use Citi rewards to pay for dental visits?,btohqsg
Will there be signup bonus for ocbc 365  I don't see it on moneysmart and sing saver. Should I just wait for the promotion then sign up,btohqsg
We are unsure too  see if march have any offers,btohqsg
with amaze for 4mpd  but pay 1%,btohqsg
UOB can be slower than other banks,btohqsg
Hi all  if my salary credited on 28 Feb  this month Feb have 29days. Is it enough time to meet the UOB salary credit criteria? Understand the system need 1-2days to update.,btohqsg
Sorry   another question. Anyone using Citi rewards to pay for kids childcare fees? Or which card is better,btohqsg
mine this month updated with 4 hours...lol...duno why so fast,btohqsg
‚¨áÔ∏è UOB Lady‚Äôs Solitaire cap dropped to S$2 000 from 1 Apr 2024Along with reduction from 6 mpd to 4 mpd after the promotional period.No change in cap for normal UOB Lady‚Äôs Pink Cardüí≥ UOB Ladyhttps://hmsg.link/uobladySource:https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdfüëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüó£Ô∏èüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocodeüì¢,btohqsg
4mpd with restricted spend category is quite a shitty card  esp one with 120k salary requirement. They sld remove the categories to atleast align with other 4mpd cards,btohqsg
Just received SMS from UOBUOB Lady's Solitaire Card: With effect from 1 Apr'24  the maximum aggregated amount of Bonus UNI$ you can earn in a calendar month will be capped at 3 600 UNI$ (equiv. to S$2 000 spent). Please also be reminded that the accelerated earn rate of 15X UNI$ per S$5 spent on your preferred rewards category(ies) will end 31 Mar'24. After which  you will continue to earn 10X UNI$ per S$5 spend on your preferred rewards category(ies). Visit UOB Lady's Card website for details and stay tuned for more exciting benefits launching on 1 Apr'24.,btohqsg
Think the next best would be dbs world woman card,btohqsg
DBS woman‚Äôs world mc monthly earn cap has been deducted to 1500 sgdüò¢,btohqsg
yea... am aware dbs is nerfing alot of its cards like live fresh as well.,btohqsg
Banks saw that many are hooked to earning miles  so they try to strategies and reduce. üòû,btohqsg
I‚Äôll happily take the restricted categories to have a higher cap. Not every card is for everyone,btohqsg
Not many cards for travel related spend anymore. Lady‚Äôs and wwmc still have their use although have to split the charges now,btohqsg
UOB Privimiles has 6mpd uncapped for certain airlines like Qatar and uncapped for hotel bookings like Agoda and Expedia so for me the Ladys card is mainly for low cost travel and activity bookings through Pelago,btohqsg
Personally I‚Äôve found lady‚Äôs super useful to absorb upcoming wedding banquet payments rather than using up the cap on VS or PPV. And also a big plus point that remains is that it contributes to uob one spending requirement  unlike ppv or vs,btohqsg
how do you absorb wedding banquet payments ? the payments are usually way over 1k right?,btohqsg
But definitely with all the banks tightening restrictions we're going to have to work harder for the rewards. But nothing good ever comes easy üòâ,btohqsg
I found those bookings to be higher in prices than if we didn‚Äôt use the UOB links,btohqsg
I go to the hotel to make advance monthly payments,btohqsg
unlikely though  i have used and compared multiple hotels over multiple trips and they are cheaper or in fact same price,btohqsg
I see  so it can be done in an 'installment' way,btohqsg
