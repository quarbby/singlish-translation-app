you never post onto SGRV right  you post i assure you kena hantam one confirm,btohqsg
No lah  just be more defensive lor. If have to wait  just wait bro,btohqsg
No la but kena hamtam by you guys I sad liao  cannot understand perspective of faster car one,btohqsg
yup  heavy vehicles full of blind spots  and their inertia is way more than yours,btohqsg
If you pete  we don’t care one,btohqsg
onus is on you to give way  your safety is more important than any kind of right of way,btohqsg
Me different leh  if kena whack then whack can upgrade car mah. Somemore no need go work still can get paid,btohqsg
2 income stream while not working  buey shiok meh,btohqsg
My car kena scratch I heart pain already,btohqsg
if the truck never see you change lane too fast is not about winning claim or not already... your family burn you a porsche GT3RS for you to use,btohqsg
no accidents  whether you at fault or not is worth getting into,btohqsg
not say won't happen but if you ask for it... definitely not worth,btohqsg
Volvo driver tests the brand's reputation for safety with haphazard drivingA safe car doesn't mean a safe driver➡️ Read the full storyHERE!,btohqsg
you also test in civic right,btohqsg
obv not…. im not retarded like pete 😂😂,btohqsg
Wakakaka. Correct . 👌🏻 don’t worry we don’t hate u,btohqsg
u shld know@iamnotypistgis my nominee for worst driver in sg… can start the tv show liao,btohqsg
If I worst driver u would be dead,btohqsg
You: “Eh this car got abs?”Me: “You wan try”,btohqsg
They 3 series has touring version Ah. Non m3. With the same window opening,btohqsg
Can share which company? I thought phv insurance is typically 2-3k,btohqsg
Just get the custom one. One set I think about $50-80. Usually the shop already have the pre measured sets. If not they probably can make for u also,btohqsg
Share the video leh. I also want to debate,btohqsg
I interested to know what is fast car perspective,btohqsg
Dm if you are interested in meeting up with sugar mummy that will make you rich within a week,btohqsg
Thanks bro  yes Nano Ionization is beneficial for all engines. Our unique nano fuel saver and performance booster product comes in the form of a nano ionizer material (flexible variant) from Germany that is specifically formulated to help with the molecular fragmentation and ionization of air + fuel + stabilized enhancement of spark firing power & electricity supply to electronics & components.Nano Ionization helps fuel combustion process to be naturally cleaner and more efficient which is found to improve the power and fuel efficiency based on the usual air and fuel mixture as originally determined by the ECU settings which does not compromise fuel consumption even when driving faster.Results are immediate (right after installation) and is safe for warranty and is LTA compliant as there are no modifications or replacement of any parts done. Installation is done by custom sizing and securely pasting the nano ionizer material to fit the existing components related to fuel combustion process.You can check out our Facebook reviews section to have a better idea of the effects as shared by some of our customers who took time to post their results@gewinnensingaporeFor more of our stories on the challenging journey of Nano Ionization since 2019  you can check out our website atgewinnen.sgWe actually started in 2018 with cars owned by our friends😊 It was really tough to market a first ever product that can generate more horsepower without modifications or tuning while being able to reduce fuel consumption 😅There are a total of 4 major points where we can install the nano ionizer material such as the air intake system  ignition coil pack  fuel supply line and electrical cables.Each point helps to contribute towards a cleaner and more efficient fuel combustion process for better power and fuel efficiency results.🔵Stage 1 is the nano ionization of the air intake system to breakdown and ionise air molecules before the throttle body so that more mass of oxygen molecules can be packed in the same volumetric air flow to help with more efficient ignition and combustion of fuel to reduce performance lag or hesitation. It helps to improve throttle response and acceleration too.🔵Stage 1+2 includes nano ionization of the ignition coil pack for the stabilized enhancement of the direct electric flow to the spark plugs beneath for more efficient firing power so that all chambers will be able to combust fuel more efficiently and consistently to improve the power and fuel efficiency further.🔵Stage 1+2+3 includes nano ionization of the high pressure fuel supply line to breakdown and ionise fuel molecules to improve the combustion state to be cleaner and more efficient which helps to improve power and fuel efficiency further from 1+2.🔵Stage 1+2+3+4 includes nano ionization of the power supply cables and connecting points to enhance electrical flow to electronics  mechanic hardwares and grounding to improve the overall functions and fuel combustion efficiency.🔵Stage 5 custom add on to concentrate more nano ionizing power for preferred components (depending on available space)You can install one or more points at a time or all points at once according to your preference.⭐Promo $150/stage to install (while stocks last for this promo batch)Effects can last for 10 years according to the warranty given to us by our supplier. I have used it for 4 years+ already and the OBDII readings and results are still consistent.The stages help to burn fuel cleaner to cleanest accordingly to produce additional power and torque from the usual fuel injection volume and air mixture as originally determined by the ECU to push the distance further or arrive at destinations faster without consuming as much fuel as before.The Nano Ionizer material is custom sized and securely pasted to fit the mentioned components related to fuel combustion process. It is safe for both warranty and Vicom/STA inspection as no modifications and replacement of any parts are done.,btohqsg
Hows the performance? Especially for old cars,btohqsg
if that stuff worked  i no need exercise to lose weight liao,btohqsg
just paste those slimming patch all day,btohqsg
Tiagong u upbadge ur own car got 10hp boost,btohqsg
Sound like a 2.0 with a 1.4 engine,btohqsg

Eh dont associate me with this car leh,btohqsg
your ride too boring right need some excitement,btohqsg
well if i sell my miata i might just join you hahahaha,btohqsg
I feel ur current car dont suit ur needs alr,btohqsg
If the boot so small cant put stuff,btohqsg
Thats just me lah cus I always put stuff in my boot one,btohqsg
i just wish stinger was cheaper though,btohqsg
U wait this month 2nd round coe bidding,btohqsg
Prices shud be coming down soon,btohqsg
you dreamt it last night ah,btohqsg
but i had a good uninterrupted sleep for,btohqsg
its been awhile since i slept this long,btohqsg
Why? Keep boot clean so that reduce unnecessary weight. FC 🆙 wooohooo!!!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
go on diet lose some driver weight better,btohqsg
Shud I buy this grille or just spray over my current grille,btohqsg
Spray and change pretty much the same price?,btohqsg
kns this one really ownself poison,btohqsg
lol if cyclists do this in sg imagine the fallout,btohqsg
