as for uni  I'm mostly tempted by UOW and UOL,btohqsg
Half my hw collection  what hobbies do y'all have?,btohqsg
UOW I think is group work more than individual work,btohqsg
UOL I think is individual work more than group work,btohqsg
yeah  for CS UOW offers what is probably Singapore's last decent dedicated game dev degree at the uni level  but UOL also offers International Relations and Politics and Economics  but I'm not sure whether the exam-heavy weightage of UOL will work against me,btohqsg
what is your previous achievement for project based and exam based? good or bad,btohqsg
all other courses for UOL is 100% exam based,btohqsg
exam based worse than project based  but both not great,btohqsg
one of my best grades EVER in NUSH was for the prose section of my creative writing portfolio project,btohqsg

I can't tell whether they're still active or not based on their social media,btohqsg
I suggest you can visit during SIM IT Day | Saturday 18 May | 10am - 3pm or email them to ask about it,btohqsg
