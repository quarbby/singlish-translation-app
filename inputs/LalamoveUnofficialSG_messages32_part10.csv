Wtf  why need to provide services for this type of AssO... No basic respect... üò°,btohqsg
Obviously many drivers and riders have shown that kind of lousy behaviour towards them first,btohqsg
It can also be their attitude towards riders or drivers.,btohqsg
The way the remarks are written describes something that has happened... If its jus their own attitude it would be worded differently,btohqsg
"It would be stated as some kind of ""terms & conditions""  eg ""No negotation""  ""No detour"" ""Do not xxxx""",btohqsg
You may not be that kind of driver and find it ridiculous that any driver might behave that way  but it's actually quite common and i can totally imagine drivers going there complaining abt the job even tho they accepted it,btohqsg
It also might be the item or the job isn't what they describe so drivers say cannot do?  Yes something may happen but that doesn't give them the right to say that's kind of words in the description,btohqsg
If they scare drivers cannot send. Then send it themself. Then they won't be piss off when driver accept the job but cannot do,btohqsg
the size and weight limits are clearly stated for each vehicle type. quite sure the complaints are bcoz the job is clearly over limit.,btohqsg

üì£ WARNING TO ALL LALAMOVE DRIVERSWhat is MOD?MOD is a third-party application for filtering orders with certain criteria (for example  high value orders) and delivering those orders faster to the shipping partner who uses them.  This will affect your income as a Lalamove shipping partner.What action will Lalamove take?We will take decisive action by constantly monitoring fellow shoppers suspected of using the MOD every week and they will be blacklisted from serving with Lalamove if found guilty.  Blackout friends who have been blacklisted will not be able to withdraw their cash in Lalamove wallets.  These efforts will continue to combat the use of MOD and ensure equal order taking opportunities for all Lalamove shipping partners.  If you have any information about MOD users  please share detailed information about suspects using MOD  such as name  phone number  vehicle number  etc. by filling out this form,btohqsg
Its an app that would modify the original app  like some people would buy a modified llm app to make them fasterTechnically it is still lalamove app but it is changed,btohqsg

also means 700+ riders will have this week's earnings absorbed by LLM  since it takes 1 week to cash out.,btohqsg
How come so many using it üòÇ,btohqsg
confess i was tempted coz the llm interface is so bad. no filters  no pause  nothing. but the helper asked for password so i decided too risky.,btohqsg

Still doable if nothing comes along or within same area.,btohqsg
For me once I hit my target I rest liao.,btohqsg

The job was opened at $31  user even added the priority fee herself,btohqsg
Reaching the pizza place  collected food  when I wanted to take picture  realised user cancelled,btohqsg
If lalamove didn't have the take loading picture  I would have driven to destination without knowing I did for free,btohqsg
