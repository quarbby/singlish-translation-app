If people do the book alr,btohqsg
What is ‚Äútortoise dont laugh at turtle‚Äù,btohqsg
If u know what I mean,btohqsg
What in the fuck does this mean,btohqsg
Technically they can don‚Äôt ask a bilateral Q  but knowledge of bilateral rs is needed for a higher level answer in other kinds of Qn still,btohqsg
if they remove eg crime and punishment then it 100% won't show up,btohqsg
They are removing topics not modifying papers,btohqsg
Proofs in plane geometry not in syllabus  does it mean I can start spamming about plane geometry in this group.,btohqsg
Why they nvr remove IH  and only SEA for H2 Hist,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no fixed topic for GP,btohqsg
Dear all members  to avoid spams we have temporarily set a time limit of 1 hour to messages. We will lift restrictions once the situation has stabilised. Thank you.,btohqsg
Do u learn IH or SEA first,btohqsg
"But they alr know the qns set so they can be like ""no crime n punishment"" this year",btohqsg
I just see whatever the syllabus doc give for those I dun take,btohqsg
I had no trouble doing at all,btohqsg
But humanities I not so sure for JC,btohqsg
Cheh not all subj they list chronological order,btohqsg
Coz the history syllabus doc does it by paper,btohqsg
H1 math has all H2 math stats,btohqsg
H1 has all the boring stuff,btohqsg
FM stats is where it is at,btohqsg
If you say lit cannot take away a whole book  CSE also cannot take away anything,btohqsg
Idk how CSE will work tho,btohqsg
CSE is like China GP LOL,btohqsg
Coz H1 is non-research so that is fine,btohqsg
China GP =/= GP in Chinese,btohqsg
But to get higher marks need skill,btohqsg
But idk how it work anyways,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a glass ceiling for those that don‚Äôt exhibit the skill,btohqsg
Their definition of skilled based is those subjects with like no topics,btohqsg
H3 math idk what they‚Äôll remove haha,btohqsg
If they don‚Äôt remove anything no one will notice,btohqsg
Honestly number theory they can test almost anything,btohqsg
Change H3 to 'H3 Mathematical Education',btohqsg
The last thing I learn was sequences and series,btohqsg
'Start a project to research and communicate a single mathematical idea concisely',btohqsg
‚ÄòLearn‚Äô coz it‚Äôs just using H2 math sequences and series,btohqsg
But then the sad thing for CSE  they can say remove yes  but teacher still have to test  coz you lose out if you don‚Äôt use the content to link to other chapter Qn  using content from another chapter to create higher order answer for the main asked chapter is an explicit req for new syllabus,btohqsg
Tbh that‚Äôs also true for econs,btohqsg
H1 econs is pretty much u remove one economic goal,btohqsg
"""Valued Contributor"" alert  from that other group.",btohqsg
Hi Yuxiang let‚Äôs have a fruitful discussion here üòÉ,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs nothing we can do but ban on sight,btohqsg
Example possible H3 Mathematics topics:1. Cosets2. Almost functions3. Stable Cohomotopy4. Etale schemes,btohqsg
MT exam move means they have to like go MT exams after lesson,btohqsg
H7 mod 4 is H3. ez,btohqsg
But if they remove Impact of Climate Change it‚Äôs a huge irony for our current situation tho,btohqsg
Well the geog topic for Os they removing is how to deal with infectious disease,btohqsg
And then another topic they can remove for bio is also infectious disease,btohqsg
Reading cobid blogs online will be sufficient education for this,btohqsg
