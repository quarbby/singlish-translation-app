OK ok. So it's still better to withdraw just in case got promo again. Tks so much all...,btohqsg
I have a UOB Stash account (not UOB one account). If I withdraw today for safety precautions  and let's say the account states that $25 000 is required to top up to earn bonus interest  what does it mean? Will I still receive bonus interest until this date  or will I not receive it at all if I don‚Äôt top up?,btohqsg
anyway can topup now and empty before saturday10.30pm to get as close to 100k MAB as possible,btohqsg
not receive bonus interest for the month if mab this month is not at least equal or higher than that last month,btohqsg
OK cool. Just to make sure I understand  Top up another 100k today  withdraw on Sat  then MAB remains 100k. Got it. Tks Trazora.,btohqsg
After the withdrawal if this is showing like no topup required then will get bonus interest right?,btohqsg
Read someone said to empty by today as it is holiday and weekend for the next few days?,btohqsg
transfer in saturday before 10.30pm should be reflected as saturday,btohqsg
5 min to SingSaver Simply Cash dealhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183290,btohqsg
You taking your chance to lose a few day interest but in return you can get $588 from $100k account. But note that you can‚Äôt touch the $100k for the next 4 months,btohqsg
I cant verify this if my source is valid‚Ä¶ but from last quarter my friend called UOB service officer hotline and they mentioned that if didnt take out on 29th Dec (30th is sat  31st is sun). Balance counted for 31st dec will be as of 29th Dec end balance. which was what was reflected for him (he took out on 30th dec) but his ‚Äúas of 31st balance‚Äù was taken from 29th Dec,btohqsg
As it's not worth it to spend overseas  you can clock $500 by buying Giant/Cold Storage vouchers at their stores.,btohqsg
Asking a noob question on miles. For the miles earned through any credit cards  is it that it can only be used for krisflyer miles? Any other channels to redeem the miles?,btohqsg
He transfer out 30 Dec what time?,btohqsg
differs from bank to bank   as the miles are partnership of the bank with the airlines,btohqsg
Is this deal good? And the card?,btohqsg
Deal is the best for now. Card depends on your usage pattern.Here is my review on SC Simply Cashhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGOzl0RnR9w,btohqsg
Depends on bank platform. Usually also offer Asia Miles (e.g. for Cathay),btohqsg
Sorry just to check.If in the event there is new promo cut off from 31/03/24.1) we must register within these few days? or wait till there is a new promo then register via the link. (current is still from 31st Dec 2023)2) If above not done  even we trf out to become $0 is not valid?3) Heard must received the reply mail approval then considered as entering into the promo?,btohqsg
UOB one card can get the additional cashback if spend to buy giant / cold storage vouchers ?,btohqsg
Yes  transaction looks the same on my statement compared to normal groceries.,btohqsg
This action is in anticipation of another rising dragon. Irregardless whether there is promotion or not  the 100k will put back on 1st Apr to earn the 5%.,btohqsg
1. You want you can do now or wait for next promo that may or may not happen.2. Yes  still based on 31 Dec.3. There will not be an approval email. Only registration  whether approved or not will depend if they earmark your amount and cash credit or not.,btohqsg
Meaning i do now the following.1) Remove the $100k and put back on 01/04/24.2) In the event there is new Rising Dragon promo: I can then register from the new window since I have already done the emptying by 31/03/24.3) Then wait for them to earmark,btohqsg
If you maintained 100k from 1 Mar till today  and wish to withdraw completely on 30 Mar for next promo  but still want to maintain MAB for 5% EIR bonus interest  you can deposit 100k today  and withdraw 200k on 30 Mar.,btohqsg
Ah understood. Haha. No lah  no need to go until so all out. Lol,btohqsg
At most lose few bucks haha.,btohqsg
ya precisely.Can close eyes about it. Thanks.,btohqsg
Early morning sir. 9am or so? Before noon definitely,btohqsg
Maybe can double check again. See on bank statement if transfer is shown as 2 Jan or 30 Dec. Maybe his early morning is 31 Dec early morning?,btohqsg
Surprisingly no frenzy here about uob lady savings account....,btohqsg
Haha you can start the frenzy.. can rally the other ladies with the account also,btohqsg
TLDR: my recommendation for ladies is to open UOB Lady Savings account and put $10 001 inside. And make sure you choose 2 Lady categories that you can confidently hit $2k a month. You will benefit more overall compared to not opening the UOB Lady Savings account.LOSE $33 interest monthlyGAIN $60 value in miles monthly,btohqsg
Up to 10mpd when combined with UOB Lady's Card.,btohqsg
this is thrash marketing.. the sweet spot is $10 001 for 2mpd bonus,btohqsg
It's always trash marketing.. just like PoWeR dUo with UOB One and stash account..,btohqsg
https://invest.sg.moomoo.com/luckyshare20232?channel=2300&subchannel=2Moomoo giving out free grab share,btohqsg
I was withdrawing cash out from moo moo and it prompt me to redeem ü´®,btohqsg
What about vs UOB one account. Provided I hit the 2k ladies spending. Also can I stack them? Hit both the 500 min spending for one and also additional 2mpd for ladies account.,btohqsg
Think 6 mpd is very power already,btohqsg
The bigger qn is  with these new changes  will they allow UOB Lady's card series spending to still be eligible for UOB One account bonus interest criteria?,btohqsg
As above  if can stack  ladies will probably benefit overall. But if they can't stack  then have to think again.,btohqsg
Uob max transfer limit is $200k only. Any way on how to bypass this? I have slightly over 200k and wish to withdraw all of them out into another bank acc,btohqsg
2 separate things in my opinion.UOB One savings account is to earn the 5% p.a. interest on $100k cash. Super charged by ear mark promos now and then.UOB Lady savings account is to help you earn extra 2mpd on your UOB Lady card if you willing to lock up $10k in a useless savings account.,btohqsg
UOB ONE credit card FTW!ok jokes aside.. then have to use UOB Evol liao loh if you cannot use UOB One credit card.MY GUESS IS.. IT WILL NOT CHANGE... UOB Lady still can contribute to the $500 min spend.It is afterall 2 different things.One is spend counter.One is earn bonus miles by locking up cash.,btohqsg
have a joint account.. and use human B to transfer out another $200k.Although i am rather surprised.. is there any reason to keep more than $100k in UOB,btohqsg
My acc was empty for half of the month,btohqsg
Guess we'll know in Apr. But I'll be surprised if UOB removes Lady as an eligible card for One account since it's currently the only miles card for One account's spend criterion.,btohqsg
So i topped up more to get the max MAB,btohqsg
yeah but only need to empty UOB one mah,btohqsg
