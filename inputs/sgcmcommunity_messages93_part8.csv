cos more households regardless of where they live utilise more then 1 car,btohqsg
Just like property  2nd car should pay progressive coe and also higher tax.,btohqsg
Many many COEs lying around big rental company üòÇ ahem ahemAlso car dealer carparküòÇ,btohqsg
Parking cost for 2nd car or 3rd car in hdb parking already progressive and that doesn‚Äôt reduce car growth but become more of a showcase of rich  might as well have them pay more to bring down public transport cost.,btohqsg
It was discussed on parliament  a few years back.absd on COEs.Get thrown out.Ship has saleüòÇ,btohqsg
I feel this is the most reasonable,btohqsg
Well we all know the vested interests for those households having the need for one car for father  one for mother  one for adult children  one for grandparents. üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe also to prevent schools to overload with parents fetching their children.,btohqsg
Exper will debates  there is many GetGo  Shariot  bluesg available for rental.50 000 taxis and PHVsOrOur transportation landwork is very efficient,btohqsg
Rental biz very good these days. So the key thing is don‚Äôt need to own lor.,btohqsg
The only way to control this is recession. Many people lose their jobs  have to sell their carsüòÖBusiness fail  big bosses have to sell their cars,btohqsg
The last suggestion is very good,btohqsg
Remove the luxury cars from Cat B,btohqsg
Many sufferingüòÖBulim many car collecting dust,btohqsg
Doesn't matter.Just keep alot of cash and wait for fire salesüëçüëçhttps://mothership.sg/2018/05/lion-city-rental-uber-cars/Happen before and will happen againüëç,btohqsg
Buy a regular MX-5 ND instead,btohqsg
If you're ok with 2 seats,btohqsg
Any convertible you buy  friends will not be the happiest unless it's a phantom drophead or a dawn,btohqsg
E-class  e93 3 series  f33 4 series etc. have decent room but still gonna get complaints if your friends are full size adults,btohqsg
Buy vert to fetch 2 people and bags :),btohqsg
But it's not gonna change anything mah,btohqsg
The point of COE is total cars on the road,btohqsg
enjoy while u can  buy buy buy,btohqsg
You put in separate phv COE the total COE quota for cars will still stay the same,btohqsg
Cars were never meant to be affordable or accessible in Singapore like other countries because cars are really not a necessity,btohqsg
To many of us they might be since we travel a lot or are just used to them,btohqsg
But as a general member of the public  you can get by with public transport just fine,btohqsg
Just that it takes more effort and time,btohqsg
One car pee household doesn't solve anything  what if the household has 3 working adults that all have different schedules and different locations to travel to in a day?,btohqsg
Can buy then buy  cannot buy must work harder! Use it as motivation!,btohqsg
But don't fall into debt trap,btohqsg
Sorry for the harsh statement here but the truth is bitter,btohqsg
2023-2024 is when most of LCR Uber cars will be scrapped,btohqsg
But they are using a ladder approach to scrapping cars by scrapping some early so that they don't crash the COE prices down too much,btohqsg
Because having a higher COE only benefits them by keeping market for car sharing and PHV alive,btohqsg
Especially with grabs being as expensive as they are already  a heavy crash in COE price can result in them losing a sizeable chunk of their market of customers who might be spending the same amount of money on grabs in a month that they can spend on paying monthlies for a decent car nowadays,btohqsg
Will crash.November Feb gonna raise interest rate 0.75 - 1.00%,btohqsg
I still want to get a new sss,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSRpCSwrX/must take notes of unEmployment rates,btohqsg
It won't be a crash  rather a correction in the market. I doubt a very significant correction will take place,btohqsg

Anyone wanna do a survey on how sexy J is? winner will get a kiss from the man himself,btohqsg
if anyone else wants just drop me a dm! im a cs student in nus,btohqsg
Interesting   i never thought of that. I have always been strong believer that phv and commercial have their own category. I never thought it made sense if they are making money through their vehicles so bidding high just means slightly less profits for them whereas people who genuinely needs a car cant afford cos its so damn high.But since quota is the same  it may not make such a difference  except create more demand in cat b and price will eventually go up anyway,btohqsg
filling up a survey on EVs and plug in hybrids,btohqsg
