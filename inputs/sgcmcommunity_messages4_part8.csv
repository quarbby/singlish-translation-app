I only used Honda Dirac (can‚Äôt rem the spelling) then it got converted to carclub,btohqsg
Not the cheapest for an A-A car,btohqsg
Ya like no spouse. Parents allowance only.,btohqsg
Ya I think there are more available cars at least in the fleet,btohqsg
I believe still have other hidden cost etc to deal with other than allowance,btohqsg
Oh so that's what happened to Honda diraccThe civic 1.3 hybrid is flooding the market now üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
1.2k is okAnd if we calculate the rest in Season parking 110Insurance 250Road tax 50Petrol 300ERP/parking/etc 100Total around 2k+-?,btohqsg
Does caltex techron's additive really contains properties that cleans your engine? Any other recommended petrol?,btohqsg
There car grooming cost   accessories cost   modding cost   downtime cost   and  accident cost,btohqsg
Not forgetting maintenance cost fixed lol. Or Sudden Attack Cost. Alot of Hidden cost lol,btohqsg
We lucky we not 4 seasons if not tyres also need alot of types,btohqsg
Hidden cost is like   striking kerbs   tyre puncture  accident   drink spill in car and grooming,btohqsg
Like I recently just strike kerb and do up the rims for $70,btohqsg
I strike kerb and paid for new tyres too,btohqsg
cause the tyre got cancer bump lol kns,btohqsg
You do these on a monthly basis?All these should be from another wallet,btohqsg
Of course no but just to share that there are hidden cost like such that ppl usually ignore,btohqsg
Not say ignore i guess is without knowing or have not factored in the in case,btohqsg
Hmm.. Good Question. Forget which one liao LOL. But was quite a bad hit lol raining cant see kerb LOL,btohqsg
No problem bro. Happens. I just changed all 4 of mine to Falken ZE310R. Mighty decent for its price,btohqsg
"16""? Or ? Hmmm hahaha cause the bump might happen to become explosive lol so better to change lol",btohqsg
"Legit =D Good Enough. Haha. I am using Dunlop now i think Hahah good for both dry and wet weather =D on 15"" Hahaha",btohqsg
Errant cyclist learns the hard way that when there's a stop sign  you have to obey even if you're a cyclistEven the bicycle wanted to 'knock' some sense into the cyclistReact with...ü§¨: If you think the cyclist got what he deserves!üò¢: If you empathise with the Toyota driverüòûRead the full storyüëâüèªhttps://bit.ly/3Dol8sd,btohqsg
This is purely forget to bring Brain out. LOL. Ridiculous.,btohqsg
his head turn and saw the car already but refuse to stop hahaha,btohqsg
Precisely Who in da right mind will do that? I mean Not even right of way. The car machiam Hollywood movie. Go so slow He lucky If not Bye. Probably trying to claim accident claim ? LOL now have to private settle with car LOL.,btohqsg
I think he turned his head left and right just for the sake of it leh. Its almost impossible not to spot an oncoming car....,btohqsg
Lets just say He cant Multi Task.,btohqsg
So not to curse him but he better dun ride on the road. Haha Potential Hazzard,btohqsg
yup  no helmet + protective gear also. Best is to just cycle on the sidewalk or park connector,btohqsg
at the end of the day the driver lugi,btohqsg
He probably dun give a flying fish about our law. Just like other arrogant cyclist still on the road. I am ok if they pose a hazzard to themself but please not to us hahaa,btohqsg
Got no way to make the cyclist take some responsibility for this accident?,btohqsg
Why? The driver lucky got this footage ahha if not police case,btohqsg
want bet at the end of the day court will say both parties wrong  cannot claim,btohqsg
Police case i believe got car cam. Sure working (Not working if its his fault) LOL,btohqsg
Im curious tho. What are the appropriate steps to take in such a situation?,btohqsg
No bet on such stuff sometimes all the driver need is luck but the rider really no follow law. So eventually polis will say Private settlement. LOL,btohqsg
they confirm say car see cyclist but never stop,btohqsg
For me1. Dun Panic2. Car cam3. Onlookers or Passing by car cam to help4. PolisCall insurance and ask if not sure,btohqsg
i kenna before someone run red light in the end they try push to me lol,btohqsg
'why u never slow down enough at junction?',btohqsg
No worries the car moving like lol. Actually looking at the footage even the car stop the cyclist also will hit the car,btohqsg
then what happen in the end?,btohqsg
you will still 'win' the case but the settlement alot lower,btohqsg
But I guess its better than nothing!,btohqsg
Actually in such situation just be reasonable on the amount of Private settlement,btohqsg
that incident i hospitalized for 3 months hahaha,btohqsg
If its just bump no dent nth lol i guess maybe a general amount should be ok. (Ex. $150/=),btohqsg
This is different liao. Need polis case and all.,btohqsg
