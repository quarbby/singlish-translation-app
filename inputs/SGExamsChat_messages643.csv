Once they start going down that path  it's hard to get back up,btohqsg
It’s sad la but at least it lasted for a good while,btohqsg
5 stages of grief for those 6 nett arts ppl who want to switch lol,btohqsg
Hopefully  they don’t take too long to come to the acceptance stage,btohqsg
Tbh I feel like even if they got in  they'd be like EH I GOT THIS X PT AND I STILL GOT IN SIA,btohqsg
It’s easier to switch from science to arts ig,btohqsg
Wait nyjc dun allow them to switch anymore?,btohqsg
Cus they also put nyjc arts in their 5th choice or smtg,btohqsg
They got 2nd choice tho so good for them,btohqsg
Y so many ppl in mi wanna do arts and commerce 😭,btohqsg
I got it within my first few pulls,btohqsg
Not alot of ppl do sci,btohqsg
just don't get influenced or discouraged or wtv,btohqsg
If you find the company isn't gfu,btohqsg
Idl how the new batch in mi talk tho like my grp,btohqsg
Got in science? Or managed to exploit the loophole?,btohqsg
Oya my whole sch was Chinese,btohqsg
So this my first other race interaction in 4 yrs,btohqsg
I can't believe u made me re read,btohqsg
Then later they still gonna regret it when they forced to do half arts,btohqsg
I just realised when talked about alumni,btohqsg
Isn't mr president of sgexams also mi,btohqsg
Ya sia iced Milo is it,btohqsg
because nearly all the time science cop is lower than arts for the same sch,btohqsg
TM used to be same but now 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
So ppl who want to switch would’ve definitely met the arts cop,btohqsg
Oya tdy they show the successful ppl in mi and they show like a master barista then ppl were like “making coffee is successful meh”,btohqsg
I remember he did an MI AMA on reddit and I just volunteer to answer science stream questions,btohqsg
Rip the nett 13 ppl trying to appeal to sci,btohqsg
Did they talk about this handicapped dude,btohqsg
Help the pause b4 sending this,btohqsg
I only know got one who became pregnant and took 1 gap year,btohqsg
Came back to MI to continue studies,btohqsg
Yea the prev principal say it one,btohqsg
Weird there is this one dude in wheelchair who was from mi arts  literally tan wan yu milks his accomplishments every year,btohqsg
Lol in 2018  MJC (just before the merger) had a lower arts cut off than science. Arts 13 and science 14,btohqsg
Think not possible at all  unless the principal is willing to grant an exception,btohqsg
2019 one girl was the first ever mi grad who went into nus med,btohqsg
I don't recall anyone from that batch went to nus med leh,btohqsg
Or is that not the yr,btohqsg
Oh wait omg that's what you meant,btohqsg
I thought you meant 2019 grad not 2019 enlist,btohqsg
This naming convention is so much nicer sia,btohqsg
Now yall got some bs class naming,btohqsg
Oh fuck almost exposed my clsss,btohqsg
Sorry after GP I haven't touched a newspaper since,btohqsg
Did GP hurt u that bad,btohqsg
So much more easier to fking deduce what combi people take,btohqsg
Ya TM got that style sia,btohqsg
Sorry I dipped after getting my A,btohqsg
S1 PCME/PFMES2 PCMxS3 BCMxS4 P/CMXxS5 1 H2 arts that's not econs lol,btohqsg
TEACH ME YO WAYS MASTER SHIFU,btohqsg
GP is actually really not hard tho  there's a very structured way to go about it,btohqsg
This is so much nicer to look at,btohqsg
Don't know what MI was cooking with their new naming methology,btohqsg
Eh I hard a lot people retain j1 in MJC?,btohqsg
You ask me retake GP now,btohqsg
I heard was bad enough that,btohqsg
I got a cca mate who retained,btohqsg
No you can't even combine certs unless h1,btohqsg
The principal just let people promote to j2,btohqsg
A lvl is the main game here,btohqsg
I low-key considered that during ns,btohqsg
But I was dead sure my GP ain't getting A again,btohqsg
Eh is there still conditional now,btohqsg
Tan wan yu removed it during my yesr,btohqsg
My friend got pass 1h2 and his other h2 was 44,btohqsg
She emphasized on it last yr before she retired basically yapped ABT it,btohqsg
since alot of ppl keep finding her to be promoted to y2,btohqsg
Then she had to address at the centre stage,btohqsg
Just because of 1 mark my friend had to spend an extra year in school like bro,btohqsg
Like ok onus was on him to study but,btohqsg
She say alot of moderation alrd 38.5 -> 39 ? Then she's like we help y'all round up,btohqsg
Then what what not fair to the rest if bla bla bla,btohqsg
If not fair for the rest then do it for the rest,btohqsg
i mean i alr know like 4 ppl in my og,btohqsg
What's wrong with keeping promotional numbers up,btohqsg
At the end of the day not like MI A level grades gonna change,btohqsg
She got round up for everyone lol  she's like if everyone were to go up then what the pt of promo criteria,btohqsg
We're still gonna be just 50% >67.5,btohqsg
""" so don't go ard begging your chers for more marks""",btohqsg
I mean if people fall very short of the promo criteria then ya la,btohqsg
""" idw anyone outside my office waiting for me cause I'll be on a holiday also """,btohqsg
But like if you get 1h2 pass and 1 h2 maybe 40,btohqsg
"""just don't be the bottom 5-10% of the cohort""",btohqsg
I only hear like ppl force to retain if it's like,btohqsg
Or at least maybe an option to redo a make up exam,btohqsg
But u have a valid pt lah,btohqsg
No clue  I wasn’t from there,btohqsg
It's not fair but if you offer it to everyone why not,btohqsg
She's like if y'all y1 cnnt promote means your Os content is lacking,btohqsg
Need more time to brush up,btohqsg
Tbh I barely scrapped through y1,btohqsg
So idk what point she trying to make,btohqsg
I'm so finding u if u come back for a talk,btohqsg
I don't think I'm ever coming back HAHHA,btohqsg
All my Y3 teachers left MI already,btohqsg
Back when they were still there I would come back every year,btohqsg
For cca fairs and open house,btohqsg
Yeah probably too afraid of that  that's why can't administer this,btohqsg
They be like we have btr shit to do,btohqsg
Come ntu ah  si yan be your tour guide,btohqsg
I planning go open hses this yr lol,btohqsg
Honestly that's more fruitful than whatever I had to do in NS lmao,btohqsg
I be typing essays why we need to replace ceiling boards,btohqsg
Supposed to be AFT but they deploy me to support service lmao,btohqsg
because im literally an air force tech thrown into SSB lmao,btohqsg
owning an ISAC card is a curse,btohqsg
sorry Idt I'm worthy enough to even appear in front of him,btohqsg
no worries im not worthy either,btohqsg
i havent seen him at all,btohqsg
despite being in the same school for 2 years,btohqsg
No need I can speak for him on his behalf since he's busy,btohqsg
I'll leak his linkedin for u,btohqsg
I tot is 2019 grad but ig its enlist,btohqsg
You can one day go hey si yan,btohqsg
im p sure i didnt LOL because once he revealed he invigilated one of my mid terms  i dont think i've ever seen him before,btohqsg
oh no worries i do know his linkedin,btohqsg
and he probably can tell i stalk his linkedin with the _ has viewed your profile thing,btohqsg
thinking shld i skip tuition tday lol,btohqsg
Ok now I’m even more concerned cus she grad in 2021 so the first nus med is from 2021 😭,btohqsg
i dont even care anymore HAHAH i just read people's linkedin whenever i want,btohqsg
nah whats there to be concerned about,btohqsg
How can a digital primate say he's stalked ppl before,btohqsg
just because not many people do it  doesnt mean you cant,btohqsg
Cus it’s only recently that ther was someone gg to med,btohqsg
Was your time like after the merger or before,btohqsg
there are a few number of science students who do get >85rp,btohqsg
they just choose not to go to med,btohqsg
because they rather do something thats less taxing and more money making,btohqsg
my senior from 14' batch also got >85rp,btohqsg
Iw go med cause I'm suicidal 😎😎😎💪💪,btohqsg
"""because fk med"" - his words",btohqsg
But eh idt I can 90rp also,btohqsg
Cuz I think that's what I do best,btohqsg
i took some crazy ass geog mod in y1s1,btohqsg
just because oh the first person in MI who went to medicine is only very recently,btohqsg
doesnt mean people dont do well in MI,btohqsg
HAHAH they really just choose not to go med,btohqsg
so dont be too concerned la,btohqsg
just focus on yourself can already,btohqsg
my geog cher in sec sch told me this:No need reach for the sky  just reach the celling,btohqsg
Basically u no need legit 90rp (unless UW med law but that one no shit hor)  just make sure U do well enuf to get whr UW to be,btohqsg
And honestly I think she's right heh,btohqsg
"my FT always tells me "" Dont say try  because you're giving yourself a way out if you fail. Say I will""",btohqsg
clearly that did not wake me up because i still did badly for As but yknow maybe that advice will better suit you,btohqsg
I was gonna say I’ll try again 💀,btohqsg
I’ll try to not say try 😇,btohqsg
I took o lvl in 17,btohqsg
HAHAHHA i dont talk to him already sia but he looks like he's living a happy life,btohqsg
got house got car got wife got dog,btohqsg
What Jc you went to then?,btohqsg
2019 was the year the mergers occured but 2018 they started to take in students in only one of the 2 pre merged schools that are to be merged together (eg. For MJC and TPJC  only MJC had a 2018 intake),btohqsg
Yeah ijc was the one that had no intake in 2018. But the J2 IJC students in 2018 stayed at IJC right?,btohqsg
Like they didn’t share campus with yjc students,btohqsg
i need it to appeal to a jc,btohqsg
U could ask the JC U r appealing to to double check?,btohqsg
i miss the cop by 1,btohqsg
i think the chances are like,btohqsg
i got a lot of cca and via and academic award stuff to put,btohqsg
cause if ur l1r5 is higher than the cop,btohqsg
its unfair to ppl who have hit cop,btohqsg
Wouldn’t the queue be the same then,btohqsg
But also idk why moe still wants to reuse the ijc campus instead of building a completely new one. They’re just gonna refurbish the ijc campus and shift yijc to that place.,btohqsg
Tjc moving to tpjc old site is,btohqsg
All the other JCs with PRIME upgrading are getting completely new campuses,btohqsg
They’re still getting a completely rebuilt campus,btohqsg
Yijc is the only one of the 4 in the 2019 batch to not get a rebuilt campus,btohqsg
rip merge until mostly single dogit,btohqsg
Just like what it was pre merger,btohqsg
See 2017 jc cop vs 2018,btohqsg
2018 every Jc increased their intake,btohqsg
ye i guess mostly the meh ones still meh,btohqsg
merge wld have lesser intake i tot?,btohqsg
It was just temporary. In 2018 with fewer schools  moe made each school increase their intake but when the birth rate and hence JC intake falls  each Jc will gradually shrink their intake,btohqsg
That’s why cop for nearly all the schs have been falling since 2018,btohqsg
But ofc  there are many other factors affecting cop besides intake,btohqsg
actually is there a statistic on % of cohort that get single digit?,btohqsg
but then do you think any ip schs will be increasing sec sch intake and decrease jc intake and vice versa,btohqsg
Moe used to release the number of students in each school with 4 A level distinctions  but stopped sometime around when the OA system was abolished,btohqsg
i heard some schs are increasing ip intake,btohqsg
then my batch has lesser sec sch classes than my senpais,btohqsg
No clue honestly  what I saw was from the news,btohqsg
Cause we needed to make space for jaes,btohqsg
We were previously full ip so almost 100% of our intake is from jh,btohqsg
so we could have more ppl now,btohqsg
GGWP AGAIN 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
huh i heard sji got 1 more ip class,btohqsg
I thought you mean that they reduce the number of JH students  so there’s more space for JAE SH students,btohqsg
i think thats what happened for my school,btohqsg
Then IP students are the JH students,btohqsg
Like cos they enter in sec 1,btohqsg
but i supposedly heard that other school like sji open a new ip class,btohqsg
That’s why I thought you meant decrease IP intake,btohqsg
my sch and rvhs did i think,btohqsg
but we are still majority ip,btohqsg
So IP intake decrease  JAE increase intake for some Ip schs,btohqsg
But I guess as a whole JAE intake per sch is falling,btohqsg
cause i heard more ppl want poly now,btohqsg
The ej guy said jae intake increase but I’m guessing ip probably didn’t rly change yet for them,btohqsg
i’m just gonna try my luck,btohqsg
Idk though  but I’m guessing they didn’t decrease the ip intake in the 3 schs. They just crammed more JAE students in ej,btohqsg
5 Ip Classes 5 O lvl classes,btohqsg
just needa not succumb to my laziness,btohqsg
we came at the right time 💀 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
if a jc accepts my appeal will my poly spot be withdrawn,btohqsg
or must i accept the appeal,btohqsg
Can I chk about private candidate application?,btohqsg
Can I apply for jus 1 subject as Pte candidate and combined the other subjects frm previous yr for JAE?,btohqsg
hi i js got into cbp in tp with 12 l1r5 after cca points  can i still appeal into diploma business?,btohqsg
up to 2 results  not limited to just 1 subject,btohqsg
hm since ur l1r5 is 12 then cop is 13 should be ok. but since it is poly wont it be l1r4 or elr2b2? so ur score should be way better than cop. so yea you can appeal,btohqsg
r ur guys schools bb cca more lax than ncc or npcc?,btohqsg
i swear ncc ppl are fully into it lol,btohqsg
i assume cus over the years o level grades mean is getting ever slightly better?,btohqsg
but at the end of the day top schools will still take the top X% even if 10 somehow becomes the norm maybe?,btohqsg
even if the mean is better  the top percentile will move along with it  wldnt necessarily mean its easier?,btohqsg
AI thing i cant rmb which jc 3-10,btohqsg
dropping means the score is lower,btohqsg
omg old channel 5 logo 😭,btohqsg
they changed it but still got the original 5,btohqsg
so ure saying a level results are getting worse?,btohqsg
crazy to think abt it u r studying with probly the next minister,btohqsg
Mhm  not completely demolish and rebuilt,btohqsg
They said it’s cos IJC campus not very old so can reuse  but it doesn’t make sense that TMJC will likely get the 2nd batch of PRIME upgrading in the near future but MJC campus is like only 2 years older than IJC,btohqsg
70ish hard to go for competitive uni right?,btohqsg
If I rmbr correctly  TMJC will shift to TPJC campus once TJC moves back to their old site,btohqsg
Then existing MJC campus will be rebuilt,btohqsg
But not much details yet since haven’t officially announce. So far it’s just the 3 other merged JCs plus TJC,btohqsg
Maybe they’re doing most of the works later,btohqsg
want to go engineering so pretty tuff lol,btohqsg
For yijc they should’ve just used IJC as the holding site and completely rebuild yjc campus  but it’ll cost more money,btohqsg
havent looked that far ahead lol,btohqsg
Idk why moe willing to spend more on the other JCs then,btohqsg
At this point  moe might as well just spend more money on yijc but convert it to a 3 year a level course lol,btohqsg
Everyone. Moving to the eunoia style,btohqsg
shld have went combine sci lol,btohqsg
Even jpjc getting a completely rebuilt campus at the former jjc site,btohqsg
I think eventually will upgrade like asrjc,btohqsg
Like the first 90 rp in 2022,btohqsg
is Millenia institute worse than yijc,btohqsg
actually when was the last time a new jc was built,btohqsg
Damn. Basically all the merged schs became worse after the merger,btohqsg
Ajc used to be very good but now not rly,btohqsg
then how did eunoia get so low so fast?,btohqsg
I think pjc was quite good  now jpjc is worse than that,btohqsg
I should say  worse than the better of the 2 schs at least,btohqsg
But I know pjc’s performance was improving in the lead up to the merger,btohqsg
dam eunoia first year already 9,btohqsg
wait then how did orientation start in eunoia lol?,btohqsg
chers also dk each other lol,btohqsg
goddam ri 2013 was cop was a 3,btohqsg
The first 3 years (2017-2019) they were at the former RJC campus holding site since the new campus couldn’t be completed on time. In 2018 moe made all schools increase the intake  so ejc cop was the highest then  with science rising by 1 point and arts by 2 points. Both streams decreased by one point in 2019 as was the case with most other JCs that year when I assume the intake per sch shrank. But in 2020  the new campus was ready and both streams fell by 2 points each. Then ejc has just been getting more popular since then  and both streams fell by 1 compared to 2020.,btohqsg
The new campus is the main factor I guess,btohqsg
wld cldnt i be born 5 years earlier fr,btohqsg
Feels more like a poly right,btohqsg
Welp  would probably take decades for all JCs to get a campus that nice,btohqsg
I’m not even sure if asr and tj new campus would have a budget as high as ej’s,btohqsg
wld be nice if i cld experience the new campus,btohqsg
born too late for 2019 cop increase and born too early to enjoy new campus fr,btohqsg
my friends are going to asrjc,btohqsg
So you aiming for ejc sci now?,btohqsg
Oh wait so you alr in jc ah,btohqsg
his fine is 50 mil rm right,btohqsg
Then aim a bit higher I guess,btohqsg
i taking o level this ye,btohqsg
Unless you’re setting your expectations low so that you won’t be disappointed,btohqsg
as long as my laziness dont fk me up,btohqsg
Or asr is rly your favourite sch then sure lol,btohqsg
bro got a slap on the wrist,btohqsg
its literally down the road for me,btohqsg
but the a level mean is 75,btohqsg
So proud of our heritage. Boys,btohqsg
I hope y’all made the right decision,btohqsg
To put asrjc as your first choice,btohqsg
I always thought you from vj,btohqsg
"i go thru ""single digit is ez  just need work hard"" and ""can i even make it to asr"" every few days fr",btohqsg
you thought means you dont know  you dont know means you dont care,btohqsg
I rmbr you saying that last time then saying it was a joke. I don’t buy it,btohqsg
I'm thinking of mastering out every alternate day,btohqsg
i’m 26 and i go through imposter syndrome every day,btohqsg
it doesn’t get better but just deal with it,btohqsg
Ok ill settle for 2nd choice,btohqsg
you would have known if you were around during yt's and my a level days,btohqsg
