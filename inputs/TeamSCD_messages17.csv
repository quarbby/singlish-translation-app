the savings from road tax is NIL compared to amount spent on petrol haha,btohqsg
in terms of necessary car expenses  you will spend most on petrol. assuming your car not garage queen.,btohqsg
rx8 will make a good garage queen car,btohqsg
dont forget rx-8 necessary cost must include rebuild engine. HAHA jk,btohqsg
i already spending $300/mth for petrol,btohqsg
for sure. tho you can rev to infinite,btohqsg
heard they need to always rev high so that it works properly,btohqsg
ya. to prevent carbon build up  need to keep the engine at higher temps to burn off the excess oil,btohqsg
start car cannot turn off immediately. later engine flood.,btohqsg
the moral of the story  rx8 is not for us,btohqsg
i really like the car  just that when i sat inside  something told me to walk away,btohqsg
so after that i walk around turf city and saw a fn2r,btohqsg

Hoi. Don't anyhow change my car name.,btohqsg
I gave up on mine ü•≤,btohqsg
I just smack I back in everytime it pops out,btohqsg
one reason I put that clip on my bumper is that my bumper screw in liao but not sitting flush with the body.,btohqsg

Why this part always come out  my car also,btohqsg
Damn irritating to keep smacking it back,btohqsg
ouch  reminds me of 2 times that happened in my mscp :(,btohqsg
Alot of parameters cannot be read n display,btohqsg
Carpark gettung tighter so hve to careful when turning,btohqsg
Lancer glx cs2 cedia or whatever,btohqsg
it only releases for 2 or 3 years only. limited sold,btohqsg
Me more of a honda man than a mitsubishi manüòÇ,btohqsg
Car still same size.. The carpark getting smaller,btohqsg
Parking space between cars so tight..Sometimes i cant even squeese out haha,btohqsg
ya  because cs3 and cs5 are the facelifted version of my lancer,btohqsg
Throttle body needs cleaning. Not sure yours work same like mine. I had the same issues,btohqsg
I'll bring to workshop to do it. how much it cost usually?,btohqsg
@misterljyü§≠ boss not in grp right?ü§£,btohqsg
I know cs go quite popular,btohqsg
On Honda there's this thing called ivac  I don't know if yours has it,btohqsg
It gets stuck from carbon over time.,btohqsg
ya he not in group HAHAHA,btohqsg
So use throttle body cleaner to spray and slowly clean out,btohqsg
Check out 'Throttle body porting and polishing w204 w207 w212 x156 Audi A1 1.0 1.2 a4 b8 a5 b8 a3 8p mk5 mk6 mk7 golf scirocco gti roc polo passat tiguan touran cc f10 f30 w117 w176 w246'  available at S$250 on#Carousellhttps://carousell.app.link/5Z3fzshDuobI was looking at this ws. More for tuning la haha but he do alot TB stuff too,btohqsg
But your cs2 I got no idea if it's the same,btohqsg
Hahah long time no see him also ü§£,btohqsg
What's the engine name? Then can search if it has something similar,btohqsg
cannot bro ltr go up SGRV,btohqsg
Don't know if can take out and clean,btohqsg
Different engine from mine so can't advice you more. But my suspect will be throttle body,btohqsg
hahaha nvm  I'll bring to workshop and let them find out,btohqsg
High idle will drink petrol even faster,btohqsg
high idle then dont really have ah,btohqsg
When I was having problems  my car drink same like rx8,btohqsg
only just today I start engine the Rev like static at 2,btohqsg
then up and down  up and down,btohqsg
My guess is this iacv jam,btohqsg
P and N gear only will happen,btohqsg
It's called idle assist control valve,btohqsg
But let your workshop have a look,btohqsg
then after a drive  I put at P or N gear the idling Rev become normal. 1.1 or lesser,btohqsg
At where? i see if i free ltr,btohqsg
But we will go to stadium to meet the photographer first,btohqsg
will drag until 1am or later??,btohqsg
That's why I suspect that üòÇ,btohqsg
For mine how it works is  when throttle body is closed  there's a small motor that opens and closes a valve so air goes in,btohqsg
If it's stuck open  get high idle,btohqsg
But Honda we can dismantle and clean. Yours ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
My First and last car also Honda Haha,btohqsg
So I can sit inside üòÇ,btohqsg
you just want to sit inside only ah,btohqsg
But I legit wanted to buy,btohqsg
Until my mom was like don't buy 2 door. Wait like that tiong baru crash,btohqsg
So automatic became Cl7r or fd2r,btohqsg
In a crash...4 door or 2 door same de la,btohqsg
But also my friends all tell me don't buy the fn2r,btohqsg
But at the same time it's not really a type r lol,btohqsg
Because you get the k20z engine. Where else euro r and fd2r is k20a,btohqsg
it's like I'm a Japanese by ethnicity but I eat fish and chips and drink tea with the queen everyday. that's fn2r,btohqsg
All running k20  but their not the same,btohqsg
any type r kor kor here?,btohqsg
Euro r and type r runing on same engine,btohqsg
