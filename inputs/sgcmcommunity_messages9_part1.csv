Or you may go to Malaysian Watson to be a watson member  the membership card is a touch and go card,btohqsg
not guarantee. out of stock on certain days.,btohqsg
not guarantee too. most watsons near woodlands checkpoint have sold out all tng cards.,btohqsg
Then maybe can use the card of the car behind to cross first,btohqsg

Since which year? Coz I've the m'sian Watson card but it isn't tng card ... ü§£,btohqsg

So yours should be touch and go,btohqsg
Gotcha .. I do not journal so I gotta start  at least by year so that I know what happened which year :D As I grow older  the years just blur tog,btohqsg
Toothbrush and toothpick is cheap in there,btohqsg
The validity of the card is 10 years  so by going back 10 years from the expiry date,btohqsg
You will know  what year is your card,btohqsg
Remember that once you top up money into the card  the validity is 1 year from your last use,btohqsg
So the card is still useless although it have not been expired,btohqsg
When you do not use it for 1 year,btohqsg

people want tesla and not others. why? because it is not just EVs people are seeing but much bigger things than just electric cars. the software system by tesla is better and ha better potential in autonomous driving  where others are lacking.,btohqsg
Yeah its abt their add ons. But if money is not an issue,btohqsg
it is not just that. it has greater potential in capability. and that must go to tesla. anybody can make EVs. but to make a great one with more capabilities is about the software around it. and germans software is terrible,btohqsg
A tale of two fuel policies: Our obsession with Malaysia's RON95 and why Singapore's pumps will never go as lowIwould still pump RON98 than RON95 in Malaysia (even if pumping RON95 was legal)‚úåüèªüëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you are Team RON98!üëâüèª React with üòÅ if you are Team RON95!‚û°Ô∏è Click here to find outmore,btohqsg

Just went to SPC. The uncle strongly encouraged me to pump full tank saying that the other petrol firms had increased price already. Left theirs unchanged.,btohqsg
