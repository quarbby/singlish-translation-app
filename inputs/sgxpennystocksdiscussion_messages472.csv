Breaking Update: All eyes on PPI data and Uncle Powell's statement tonightUncle Powell will begin his journey to appear before Congress  particularly the House Financial Services Committee today. His mission is the same: calm the inflation fear and sustain market stability.It will be a tough sell on transitory inflation storyThe latest round of inflation blew past Wall Street’s expectations  and investors are re-thinking if price pressures are indeed fleeting. The CPI data suggested broad-based inflation and spending categories such as food  haircuts  and rent had increased 0.9% in June  compared to May 2021.This is contrary to the expected cooling price pressure. As a result  the narrative of transitory inflation is becoming an uphill story to sell. In contrast  officials had warned that inflation would remain elevated  and in Pika World’s case  we see an inflation inflection point within the next quarter.Inflation pressure is buildingA review of the inflation data shows some unsettling trends. For example  when we remove the volatile components such as food and energy categories and zoom into core inflation  they appear to have surpassed 0.7% for 3 months consecutively.Despite the underlying trend  Pika World expects Uncle Powell to remain consistent in his communication on the inflation topic as he testifies before Congress. He could also stress the unsustainable rise in used car and truck prices  which ran up another 10.5% in June compared to May. This rise accounts for more than one-third of the overall CPI’s increase. If we take out this component  the total price increase could have been up by only 0.5%.This will paint gentler mellowing inflation rather than a beast run-off mode.Stickiness in inflation is a downside riskAt Pika World  we are concerned with some price pressure  particularly the shelter component with mounting pressure. The shelter is no doubt a significant component of the CPI  and it is often the stickest. However  the nature of rents is such that they do not move abruptly  and once it starts to shift gear  either up or down  it tends to have a persistent effect.If there is any comfort from the market  it will be possible from Uncle Powell statement tonight.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us build a resilient ecosystem.,btohqsg

Special Edition July 15  2021The meme stocks had a pull back and has fallen from its high. In this release  let’s have a change of flavour and walked through an express memory lane of the Meme Journey.When the first spark happensIn January  the blockbuster stocks GameStop and BlackBerry came to life. Since then  the clock is ticking as the countdown to when the crash will happen is the ultimate question. It has been more than half a year  and the Meme stocks are still trading at elevated levels. In addition  there are newcomers such as Clover Health Investments and Newegg Commerce  which have added to the Reddit board.No sign of business turnover  but fever is hotIf any  there is no sign that these businesses have shown business transformation plans or even profits to justify the valuation. Take BlackBerry as an example; the company burnt huge cash in its latest quarter with a warning that the cybersecurity division is likely to hit the low end of its revenue guidance.Retail investors appear unconcern. While trading volume has come down from the peak seen in Feb  the average shares traded in AMC reached $13.1 billion in June. This is more than Apple’s $9.5 billion level or even Amazon’s $10.3 billion.The fading of the Covid-19 effect did not cause the adrenaline rush of trading to stop. Instead  some survey suggests that 58% of the day traders had plans to increase their trade volume. Thus  the “buy the dip” sentiment remains vital and alive for this sector.Like a horse driving a cart  the sudden price spikes attract new investors  and the further spike in volatility continued to attract another level of investors. Likewise  there is no short survey indicating that millions of people downloaded investing apps in late January.In Stonks We TrustThe new investors have given their gems a new name  Stonks. These investors or traders in the Reddit forum have pushed supersized gains in AMC and GameStop this year  and BlackBerry is a beneficiary in the background  although the prices moderate these few weeks.Robinhood is a prominent player in the investing platform world as it added 5.5 million funded accounts within the first quarter. Fidelity also stated that they had attracted 1.6 million new customers. Surprisingly  they are under 35 years of age  and it is all within the first quarter  which is a splendid jump of 223% compared to a year ago.Commission-free trade has provided greater access to investors and opened the floodgates of a new category of investors who may not have sizeable disposable income to invests.Rock on  Retail ArmyWhile ETF investing has gain momentum  single stock picking has also grown in strength. Its roaring back can be evident from the fact that retail trading accounts for about 24% of the equity volume  up 15% from 2019. Moreover  the trend gives birth to new YouTubers who take on new videos and stream stock analysis several hours a day.As big investors open their market to learn and develop more time tracking social sentiments  we could see possibly the next “Alpha” in the game. But  till then  Pika World is here to navigate the investing and trading journey.What’s on the menu today?Back to reality now! It is another critical data day.At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Initial Jobless Claims. We are expecting 360K  which is a moderation from 373K in the prior period.At the same time  the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for July is expected to ease to 28.0 from 30.7 in the prior period.At 9.30 pm  Uncle Powell will continue his testimonial before congress.It is July 15  Thursday  at 7.36 am in Singapore. To everyone on the road or working from home  Pika World wishes you a safe and fruitful investing journey.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will be a great motivation.,btohqsg

Your Afternoon Quick Read – 15 July 2021The cool guy is hereUncle Powell displayed his usual calming presence despite two-day hot inflation numbers. As expected  he deflected inflation concerns as temporary pressures and reiterated his stance to keep the current policies in place until there is “substantial further progress”.Re-opening of the economyThe intense debate can be seen in Congress over the nature of inflation despite Powell’s assurance. However  he did mention that while the longer-term inflation expectations have moved north. they are still “broadly consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal”.Russell 2000 takes a big hitMarkets take comfort in his words after a choppy trading early session. The three major indices were relatively flat  while Pika World’s favourite Russell 2000 had an outsized reaction.The Russell 2000 is considered a bellwether index of the US economy due to its focus on smaller companies. However  its bigger brother is often referred to as S&P 500  which covers large-cap stocks.For investors  Russell 2000 is helpful as an investment opportunity since it encompasses a broad-based representation of the entire market than an otherwise narrower index that could have more bias towards stock-specific risk.Within the Russell 2000  you can also see sub-categories. For example  the Russell 2000 Value Index is helpful to track companies with lower Price-to-Book ratios. This indicator reveals the market price of the company in relation to its balance sheet. On the other hand  the Russell 2000 Growth Index focuses on a group of companies with higher Price-to-Book ratios  or simply those with high growth potential in the future.As growth appears peaking  the worry of tapering and Covid variants suggests that growth is likely to moderate. This could put pressure on Russell 2000 Index and Pika Nat’s portfolio in this shift.The road aheadUncle Powell provides some update to the Congress that is critical to put into our political diary dates. First  he stated that there is likely to be further discussion on the tapering talk during the Fed’s meeting on July 27-28  where we can have more visibility on the timeline.Until then  Pika World is in mild accumulation mode  given that Pika Nat’s portfolio has seen a moderation in this mid-cycle transition. The ride will become more volatile as the dust of uncertainty settles on new ground.Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will be a great motivation to us.,btohqsg
