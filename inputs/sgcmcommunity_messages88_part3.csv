Just sharing here cause I thought itâ€™s quite funny heh - E,btohqsg
What car do you drive Miss E?,btohqsg
Honda Civic FD also? Or RX7?,btohqsg
This is fairly accurate HAHAHAHAA - E,btohqsg
I currently don't own a car cause I have a family car ~ But am looking at purchasing a second-hand,btohqsg
Wait ah I send the listings here. Yall help me see HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Yes yes. Their songs and dance routine very good.,btohqsg
Cause I am a noob at these kind of stuff. I still have more to learn hehe - E,btohqsg

I see youâ€™re a fan of verts,btohqsg
Yes I am heh - E,btohqsg
This one need as some other bro/sis,btohqsg
I used to own a Copen but after that I swore never to drive a 2-seater. So inconvenient - E,btohqsg
Iâ€™m more of a japan car guy,btohqsg
But from what I heard the E250 not bad,btohqsg
Jap cars dont have a lot of verts. If have  it will be expensive haha - E,btohqsg
Yeah ikr HAHAHA Not ideal for me cause I would want to drive my family or friends around ~ - E,btohqsg
Any continental car gurus here can help? ðŸ¥¹ - E,btohqsg
Oooo so the Mercs then? - E,btohqsg
Anyone parked >24 hrs at MBS before? Can advise the charges? $27.4  then 25th hour isit $12 again or $1 per 30mins,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s a max. Then after that depends on what time your 24hrs hit,btohqsg
Cos first hr $12â€¦ idk 25 th hour is $12 or $1.1 per 30 mins,btohqsg
For those who have yet to RSVP  you have until 2pm today and we will do a redraw.Potentially 5 spots open for now - J,btohqsg
i would recommend the lexus is250C instead. reliable  appeal to younger crowd  hard top.,btohqsg
i worry coz he sells rice...,btohqsg
though interior leaves much to be desired. but not like the merc interior is exactly modern too,btohqsg
and the lexus has a much nicer exhaust note,btohqsg
Would you recommend a hard top or soft top? - E,btohqsg
And what's the diff in maintaining the both of them? - E,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1041581&DL=10001 owner and nice sporty red seats. but the wood trim,btohqsg
i would reccomend a hard top. in sg you dont really open it often  so u get better heat and sound insulation. and the soft top fabric may degrade due to time and weather,btohqsg
i believe the hard top mechanism is a little more exp to replace  but if you dont use it that often  it should be fine,btohqsg
and i fully agree with this haha  the v6 is extremely smooth as well,btohqsg
agreed. lexus would be less racey/ricey,btohqsg
i was so impressed the 1st time i sat in one,btohqsg
Budget wise you all recommend the Lexus also? - E,btohqsg
and i was driving a IL6 at that time. the v6 is totally different,btohqsg
slight more exp road tax  but thats about it. NA engine  less moving parts  less maintenance,btohqsg
and i cannot emphasise how smooth that 2.5 v6 is,btohqsg
So it'll be Lexus > Mercs in your opinion? HAHAHA - E,btohqsg
yeah depre in the same range as the merc anyway,btohqsg
might want to send it for PPI though just to be sure,btohqsg
Cause from what I know  my friends who drive a Merc has never complained about maintenance and all - E,btohqsg
they are reliable for sure  but maintenance when u do need it or wear and tear will cfm me more expensive then jap counterparts,btohqsg
Just not that Gen A3 hahah so in your lineup  yes.,btohqsg
yes  merc engines are pretty damn reliable. but lexus is on par,btohqsg
and honestly if u looking for e250 cab  go for the w212 facelift one not the pre facelift,btohqsg
If you're going for a cabriolet  go for the newer A3 or a 2 series!!!,btohqsg
