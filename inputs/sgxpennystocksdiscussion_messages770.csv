Strategies that worked in low interest environment will fail badly during increasing interest period. If cannot unwind  will get burnt deep deep.,btohqsg
For 20 years  loan is king. Going forward  cash is god,btohqsg
You declares more . You loan out the money . Make sure you able to service the debt situation.. I kanna almost bankruptcy once when I was 23..  learn for people go lend money from bank to buy property.. I kanna margin call to top up 300k  for the property that I bought .. cos I remember that time market suddenly down alot .. Lucky my mother save me ..,btohqsg
Margin call is no joke. Your whole world crashing around you. Like drowning in quick sand,btohqsg
no wonder u cautious but margin calls i would say were for those days  not completely impossible but with those safety nets in place nw  gov can easily remove them to spur the market,btohqsg
Every call  every letter also scare to get,btohqsg
Think long liao  jump from top floor,btohqsg
tsdr n msr not ther for show  in a way also filter out though not 100% esp for those self employed,btohqsg
anyway u experience lao jiao  nxt time after ns muz look for u,btohqsg
I have 6 friend kanna bankruptcy .. 2 jump down .. 4 still around .. I witnessed this all .. don play with fire .. buy property no as easy as we seem .. there is alot of term and conditions,btohqsg
true but nowadays diff from ur days earlier.. nt easy but dont complicate it,btohqsg
Government policy can only help so much... Those oneself chiong extreme  gov see liao also will not help one,btohqsg
Now safety net also not use if your back grounds not Much spare cash to support ..,btohqsg
ya eod  not envocating to go all out  still within own limits,btohqsg
Actually is the same .. things get expensive .. alot of people now still getting high loan .. 30 percent down payment the most,btohqsg
personally feel tat fed will only increase for this yr  followin 1-2 yrs at least will maintain n start tone down,btohqsg
High inflation actually good for young people just starting work. Bad for retiring folks,btohqsg
actuali thers still alot cash rich.. ec 1st buyers easily earn 6 digits for 1st buyers,btohqsg
If alot of people feel this and there .. thing won't get so difficult Liao 😂,btohqsg
Market not crash  will not stop,btohqsg
Cash rich of course ok .. if those average working class .. 😂,btohqsg
He is ready to press the button.. to me I believe property have a cycles . Of course will not go down alot ..,btohqsg
Got case just put FD  risk free 4-5%  don't need to bother with all the market turbulence,btohqsg
jus go do a deep search on the debt usa holdin,btohqsg
SVB collapse brought another risk to the financial system due to high interest environment,btohqsg
Fed doesn't care the debt. For past 100 years never see them pay,btohqsg
Yes .. look at all the salary or the past few here till now .. how many percent increase .,btohqsg
Can see the end of USD era liao  just like how GBP was dethroned,btohqsg
infact mayb cos came across alot average ppl earning 6 figure frm their bto or ec sales haha ,btohqsg
n when i say average  its reaali average,btohqsg
Wait for more and more companies to tighten wallets... Until hit the common class population  then everything also crash,btohqsg
If they have 2 property ..yes they earning .. but sell high buy high .. end of the day you still own 1 property. . with higher debt ..,btohqsg
the key thing is 1st buyer.. not resales in a normal market,btohqsg
For example .. for my case .  I have 1 HDB and 1 condo only .. if I sell my HDB now .. yes I earn 6 figure hard cash in my pocket .. then I move to my condo stay ..,btohqsg
til the max u can afford  then time to downgrade n free up e cash,btohqsg
Now still good price  should consider offloading to keep cash,btohqsg
If only 1 property .. sell and buy again .. they not your hard cash in your pocket .. to me ..,btohqsg
Still have many still able and willing to buy at high price,btohqsg
Until now .. I still have 2 chance to get bto .. I still can get government Grant too .. but I choose not too ..,btohqsg
6 months later  situation may change drastically,btohqsg
Don offload .. rent it out .. I all fully pay .. if sell .. money will get smaller ..,btohqsg
should go hoot a big ocr unit n hold,btohqsg
All the cash 5% FD  shiok,btohqsg
Property cycle is 7-10 years  next peak maybe too old liao,btohqsg

Alot of agent in my shop keep talking to me about this .. I don't want debt anymore . Plus I want to retire early without so much stree,btohqsg
finally someone understand money getting smaller in tis environment lol,btohqsg

Cos when you sell you buy again .. no point .. this is my thinking ..,btohqsg
can extract out e cash for ur private,btohqsg
sell only if u gg buy bigger ones,btohqsg
To me debt is stress .. of course provides you able to be peaceful service the debt situation for the next 10 or 20 year ...  But .. 花无百日红,btohqsg
No more low interest environment  different ball game  different rules,btohqsg

Hold as much cash as possible now.Whack blue chips when crashOffload blue chips when recoverBuy property at cheaper price with profit + cashBetter than holding property tight throughout the cycle,btohqsg

Their salary 400k per year .. can lar .. easy ..,btohqsg
How likely is it for OCR properties to kena margin call? Say the loan is less than 900k,btohqsg
But 3rm nowadays oso quite high,btohqsg
He bought the older house .. leases left about 53 year balance,btohqsg
If bank very fast.. They sell oso fast.. Throw to buyers any amount,btohqsg
Poor people like me can paid up HDB n free of debt. Already very happy. Y must make ownself so stress,btohqsg
Margin call meaning your down payment is not more enough so your property values had drop . You have to top up,btohqsg
I got one friend husband kana declared bankruptcy then sold condo  go squeeze w parent in hdb,btohqsg
Yes . Bank sell very fast .. the balance ask the seller top up till bankruptcy,btohqsg
Nice .. debt free .. now can spend anything within your mean to no stress 👍,btohqsg
This is normal .. I am surrounded friend also 2 year ago during COVID period kanna bankruptcy,btohqsg
Bankruptcy if still have HDB. Is the best  no ppl can touch this,btohqsg
Ok maybe I should rephrase the question.How likely is it for ocr properties to kena margin call  compared to CCR?,btohqsg
HDB can slowly slowly pay . Can ask MP for help .. condo.. bank give your 3 month max .. no pay .. bye bye.,btohqsg
Avoid property at all cost this is penny stock discussion,btohqsg
Usually kanna margin call mean your property value drop too much,btohqsg
Yes .. then have to top up Liao ... Unless your downpayment more than 40 to 50 percent .. then the risk of margin call will be very very less,btohqsg
My friend bot his landed property 2m+..kana  sold by bank direct to buyers 800k,btohqsg
SVB collapsed contagion within US89 per cent of the bank's US$175 billion in deposits were uninsured as of the end of 2022  according to the FDIC  and their fate remains to be determined.,btohqsg
400k a year buy landed? I'm surprised,btohqsg
You then become a slave to your job. The moment your job is threatened you are fked. So gotta be so protective of the income. I definitely wouldn't go for a 5mil + place.,btohqsg
Wow . Y never tell me ? I buy from him 1million also can,btohqsg

My customer just bought a 3 storey Terrace at Loyang 6 month ago .. he bought 1.8 million plus only .. balance lease left about 52 year ..,btohqsg
Ok fair enough but that's pretty out of the way,btohqsg
This guy wants near MRT probably won't want so out of the way,btohqsg
Btw 1.8mil is damn cheap wtf. Not freehold?,btohqsg
But yeah it's hitting the loan issue age soon I think,btohqsg

Cos loan issue soon. They can buy with loan but if they stay 10 years the property 50 yrs old hard to sell. There is limited loan capability due to age.,btohqsg
So those who buy usually really wanna stay there long term,btohqsg
Less than 60yrs I think hard to get loan,btohqsg
Thus the price already start to factor this in as it approaches the age,btohqsg
Becos malay not allowed to buy tats why difficult to sell good price,btohqsg

#Financial#Fed(Bloomberg) --US stock futures surged and the dollar retreated after US financial regulators took steps to shore up the financial sector with a new lending program in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s failure.Futures on the S&P 500 jumped more than 1.5% and the greenback slid versus major peers after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the her office would protect “all depositors” at the bank  whose demise Friday marked the biggest such event since 2008.The government actions will also include a program offered by the Federal Reserve with funds from the Treasury.Government bond yields fell heavily in Australia and New Zealand  reflecting recent moves in Treasuries  and as traders globally reassess the path of interest rate hikes and the economic cost the tightening cycle has taken already.The problems at SVB Financial Group’s bank were caused in large part by the fallout from higher US interest rates.Monday’s moves in markets come after risk assets got pummeled last week  with the US stock benchmark suffering its worst week since September.Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” spiked  with the Cboe Volatility Index hitting the highest this year. Treasury two-year yields plummeted 28 basis points to 4.59%.“This will bring confidence back to the markets. But from the Fed’s point of view  there are additional dangers that need to be reviewed  which will take some time ” Carol Pepper of Pepper International said on Bloomberg TV. “So I’m hoping that this will help them to have a good reason to pause because frankly creating financial stability is the number one job at the Fed.”Elsewhere in markets  oil and gold rose. Bitcoin also climbed  reflecting the relief among investors.Anxiety is also running high ahead of this week’s consumer price index report  especially after Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently emphasized that a move to a faster pace of tightening would be based on the “totality of the data.”“Tightening monetary cycles often end abruptly when ‘something breaks’ and a financial crisis is triggered ” Ed Yardeni  the founder of Yardeni Research  said in a note. “If the Silicon Valley Bank run is that something  it could mean tightening ends sooner and bond yields have peaked. We can’t say for sure that’s the case but can say the debacle should keep the tech sector mired in its rolling recession for longer.”https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-futures-rise-dollar-falls-220258722.html,btohqsg
