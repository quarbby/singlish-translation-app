Risk of sgx...can win but can also die,btohqsg
US market like seldom see suspension or delisting,btohqsg
Even if yes usually forecasted quite in advance,btohqsg
That time during the gme first started,btohqsg
Got like 10 circuit break up and down,btohqsg
Just curious this kind od suspension usually how long,btohqsg
Is it similar to v2y?  Dispose whole business?,btohqsg
but all cash biz means there will be a payout on delisting right? Like Accordia Golf Trust? Assuming no debts of course.,btohqsg

"Their shares like toilet paper. 2.5b shares just for directors/key mgt. And then the so feared ""convertibles""",btohqsg
