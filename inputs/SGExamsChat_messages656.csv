tdy is apparently the first day of cny for hokkien's,btohqsg

@Polarbearnextdoori have decided to permanently stay at the medical centre,btohqsg
"not part of MMI (I'm 8SIR) but im gonna be a 5in 2 out ""MMI Medic""",btohqsg
I posted on my insta  but I just thought he was pretty awesome,btohqsg
He actually played professionally in the NFL(which is a super violent sport that led to tons of brain injuries in the long term),btohqsg
Oh  also  SUTD's open house is from Feb 24-25  I am graduating from the first batch of their Design and AI major; so if SUTD is a school you are interested in  feel free to PM me!,btohqsg
how it feels like being a guinea pig batch,btohqsg
You get a ton of resources; like there are servers set up for you to use for your projects(to train ML models etc)  and nice  new workspaces.Also your opinions are always wanted since they want to finetune for future batches.The bad stuff would be  it's a little more messy  curriculum isn't always the most streamlined  you might realise certain modules are not what you thought you signed up for.,btohqsg
For what its worth  I was in NTU for a bit before dropping out  and one thing I liked about SUTD is the gender ratio.NTU gender ratio for STEM majors was like 1:7 or 1:10,btohqsg
need finish my Os first kekw,btohqsg
depends on the STEM side also,btohqsg
do u bring it everywhere lol,btohqsg
Feels like it was there all along,btohqsg
it's been there since last CNY,btohqsg
when it was actually rabbit year,btohqsg
no wonder u got kicked yt,btohqsg
ns made him too keesiao alr,btohqsg
idk i nt in the sge disc,btohqsg
Coz the mo and medic aren't part of battalion and don't even need go outfield,btohqsg
i was in for awhile then i left,btohqsg
Day in day out just report to medical center  do normal medic stuff  occasionally do IPPT duty and that's kind of it,btohqsg
lets just say that while it can be quite interesting  it can also lead to some negative emotions if you spend too much time there,btohqsg
I have like 100+ discord servers kek,btohqsg
ah i meant the sge disc,btohqsg
goddam why do i keep trying to spearhead stupid projects,btohqsg
actually maybe the most annoying part,btohqsg
Is that why you’re no longer an admin here?,btohqsg
2nd is VIA  decided to be program planner,btohqsg
It’s just that without YT no one left who will quickly ban the bots,btohqsg
cos people are busy with their lives and who want to do free work of managing a chat grp with thousands of random ppl inside. u want u volunteer lo,btohqsg
wld rather fight fires then this,btohqsg
Nah bro the course dam shag,btohqsg
U take over me then u will know the pain,btohqsg
I also dunno why I nothing better to do help out with questions sometimes in the homework chat,btohqsg
ik the lore but@chemceris it okay if i say or you rather not,btohqsg
"long story short the lore is that this guy who used to be active here called josh is also active in the sge discord (he is a key character) another key character is ntu cs student tatabusaever since young  i have always wanted to be a teacher  so that day we were discussing about it (cant rmb) and then tatabusa asked if i saw 5k as a fresh grad as a high pay. I said that I didnt think it was a very high pay and tatabusa then encouraged me to explore career options that yielded more than 5k.  Then josh  who thought 5k was a high pay  started to argue with tatabusa and it was quite messy.  the reason being josh is idealistic and more of a ""chase your dreams"" person while tatabusa is more money minded and places emphasis on financial gains. However  josh is quite unrealistic and fails to consider practicality at times when making certain comments.Josh also said some stuff to me that I felt was very ... So I shared what he said in Sge server in this chat since he is quite well known here  as I wanted to hear opinions of my friends such as kuro  rand and ytSome users here incl yt and@juicecogenswere unhappy with his remarks as they felt that he was too idealistic. I can't clearly remember what exactly happened but i think yt went to talk to tatabusa and josh on discord.  rand also joined the discord and made some comments to josh  which resulted in josh getting angry and posted the comment ""juicecogens can (perform sexual act )"" which has since been made into a sticker here. rand got banned from the discord for calling josh a circus animal.after that incident  the sge discord was in a mess so the admin decided to mute tatabusa and yt. If im not wrong  this led to yt losing his admin perms because of some stuff he said (which im not too sure of)Shortly after that incident  I had left the Sgexam discord and so did josh (he strongly dislikes Tatabusa and yt  and uses derogatory terms to refer to yt quite often  which makes me quite uncomfortable since i am friends with yt).I think the reason why Yt was banned in the sge discord was because of some remarks he made but im not too sure cause i was not in the discord server when he was banned",btohqsg
Bruh  why can’t some people act like adults,btohqsg
Want to make a mountain out of a molehill,btohqsg
you're expecting too much from a group of people that are quite literally kids,btohqsg
like it's not even an exaggeration,btohqsg
the general demographic of the discord is a lot younger,btohqsg
I can volunteer but just to ban bots that’s it,btohqsg
I don’t want to be responsible for anything else,btohqsg
most of them are my age,btohqsg
I didn’t even know sge had a discord until recently,btohqsg
yea i can add that. thanks for letting me know,btohqsg
But I guess I’m not joining it,btohqsg
Yeah esp after what yall said,btohqsg
I should just stick to helping ppl with Econs in the other chat and if I’m bored see what yall are discussing here,btohqsg
At least I would think the ppl here are more civilised than discord? I hope,btohqsg
i joined to try and see what's up,btohqsg
i am right no matter what,btohqsg
and actually tried to interact with them like normal people,btohqsg
i was gonna leave then i stayed because of you,btohqsg
majority of the chat is copypasta spamming,btohqsg
If rand likes drama he probably would’ve wanted to see the whole thing unfold lol,btohqsg
That’s the most dramatic thing I’ve heard of here,btohqsg
that drama is too stupid for even him,btohqsg
he can't control himself to just be an observer,btohqsg
I mean if U ignore general the server is pretty dead otherwise,btohqsg
it was the most ok when i was chatting in the channel about uni stuff lol,btohqsg
Well yeah sometimes it’s better to see less,btohqsg
at least i have direct contact with yomo now instead of him coming here to find me,btohqsg
Adults but still act like kids,btohqsg
Wtf u mean bro he is a boomer,btohqsg
@chemcer  at first he was a fledgling but ever since he said that,btohqsg
The exam time peak not here yet,btohqsg
"Help did that contribute to your low self-esteem back then and this "" IM IN LOVE WITH A EMO GIRLLLL"" vibe",btohqsg
I mean I wld disagree cos,btohqsg
Ppl can get influenced super easily,btohqsg
It's like keyboard warrior except irl,btohqsg
Were u that innocent back then,btohqsg
Oh mayushi dropped on the activity from December,btohqsg
"I learnt how to say ""eat shit"" in malay when I was in p2",btohqsg
Who would do such a thing?!,btohqsg
Fuck why does this sound like you're gonna rape maths,btohqsg
a girl in my fm class,btohqsg
@whatisgrassyou know any J1s yet or not,btohqsg
I heard my prev sch cca,btohqsg
basically during ori got this girl always come up on stage for whatever reason,btohqsg
Felt like U got mention b4,btohqsg
yeah this is the same girl,btohqsg
P3 was chao ji Bai and funny we learnt it during chi class  and everyone starting whispering to one another and some class clowns starting talking to their friends tryna include those three words in their conversation   one class clown in particular approached the teacher asking what is chao ji bai,btohqsg
i don't plan to tell him who i am,btohqsg
i learnt the f word in p2 but didnt rly start saying it untill sec1,btohqsg
Cuz my econs test on tues,btohqsg
bruh first lecture i alr feeling lost,btohqsg
Meh the real kicker is prolly DdSs for u,btohqsg
Talking about that in my old sec sch there was some old senior teacher by the name of Ms Chee  then some students would walk up to her and say “hi miss chee bye miss chee”,btohqsg
actl just don't say my name from now on,btohqsg
huh? oh i tot he talking bout the other guy,btohqsg
wah uk yest tht jenson guy similar to futureofryan sia,btohqsg
its just idk wat to come up with,btohqsg
I'm surprised y'all had a filter for swears I cldnt be bothered for sec schl,btohqsg
its a VIA visit to a NGO about mental health,btohqsg
nah sec sch i was unfiltered. now ite even worse,btohqsg
I think I js mellowed down in sec 4 and now starting j1,btohqsg
Cos Im pretty sure I ruined a lot of frenships with how like rash I was back then,btohqsg
like got new ppl become active ?,btohqsg
are there new ppl active in general chat of sge discord,btohqsg
Nice you completed the peel format,btohqsg
Nah didnt YT get banned cos he used a censor word lol,btohqsg
i thought is because he kept playing with fire for too long,btohqsg
I forgot whether he got muted or banned when he said that,btohqsg
another fella a week or two after had the same treatment happening to him lol,btohqsg
except his was that he left while muted so it counted as an evade  so ban 💀,btohqsg
are you in the 200s already,btohqsg
you can say because you have been through the high and low numbers days,btohqsg
why does it feel like you been in NS forever,btohqsg
like even im in my 260s,btohqsg
I'm not the type of person to be rcc,btohqsg

lucky in 8SIR i only support (part of HQ  not any of the coy) so dunnid go outfield,btohqsg
only when they indent for cover medic,btohqsg
but i don't do the outfield shit,btohqsg
Ah so it's slightly different for army,btohqsg
For us the ground logs & supply  transport & medical are all under one squadron,btohqsg
The squadron is purely for air base sustainment,btohqsg
So they will never touch a gun,btohqsg
I go out and pump petrol and so many complain messages,btohqsg
Josh is the sperm his mum should have swallowed,btohqsg
I said that to some teacher accidentally,btohqsg
FR blud the real physics god,btohqsg

"""You are the cumshot your mum should have swallowed""",btohqsg
last time I ever talked to a tutor who decided not to pursue lawHis perspective was interesting,btohqsg
dam 5k for fresh grad not high meh,btohqsg
he said he saw his friend  high flyer lawyer. Earn really a lot  buy very nice condo with nice view  but work really hardHe felt that the person who enjoyed the condo the most was the maid,btohqsg
maybe long term not but fresh ehh,btohqsg
5k is median salary for 2023,btohqsg
yet govt label 3k and below as low wage 😭,btohqsg
actually my cher has mentioned he makes 5.5k,btohqsg
that's about my passive  courtesy of my in laws allowing us to bunk in to take care of them,btohqsg
he says if you really count it by the hour  the pay is worse than mac,btohqsg
it's not wrong. I ever counted for sch teachers  about $12 to $15 per hr if included all the hidden OTs,btohqsg
dont understand the in laws allowing you yo bunk in hmm,btohqsg
their house big  so move in with them,btohqsg
dayum. last time my chi cher was hod. i think she said she made arnd 8k a mth iirc.,btohqsg
that should be a newly promoted HOD,btohqsg
but the amt of work tchers min do  10k maybe more,btohqsg
10k is comfortable plus iron rice bowl,btohqsg
It's almost impossible to refute that,btohqsg
I say this when the other guy is arguing with me on the grounds of fallacies,btohqsg
well wif the rising cost of living nowadays alot of ppl will go into poverty soon wif the salary they r bringing home,btohqsg
my dream is to write a book with jun wei next time,btohqsg
oh probly cus he not hod,btohqsg
It has potential to be added into R's  sticker pack,btohqsg

like a 90rp student applying for ntu engineering or some shit,btohqsg
Oh so application results are staggered?,btohqsg
i suppose so  they will just go from highest to lowest rp for all their applications?,btohqsg
Ok tq! Now I don’t need to be kiasu and bring laptop to sch HAHA,btohqsg

⚠️ Parents  take note of these popular online games which can become a hotbed for bullying.About 1 in 5 gamers aged 13 to 18 feels bullied in video games  a survey found. ​https://str.sg/5N6R,btohqsg
they act like this is news,btohqsg
tldr they cited discord  minecraft  roblox and genshin,btohqsg
he said he left cause the nsfs are unbearable,btohqsg
but imo its just him being overly idealistic and cant take it when people have realistic considerations ? 🤯,btohqsg
he say yall keep talking about money and ns,btohqsg
im inclined to think that the money part is not even that much,btohqsg
"oh ya when yt was banned he made his nickname ""bedok is banned from sge""",btohqsg
yea i would prob just lurk and let rand showcase his talents,btohqsg
"but the thing is josh is like "" omg rand is always talking about money his only priority is money why cant he get a life?"" bro rand is studying business ???",btohqsg
Ngl kuro ur being too kind. If it was@juicecogenshe will wish for josh to not get any scholarship,btohqsg
Yea but you arent actl affected right,btohqsg
Im weeks behind of my own work,btohqsg
"the jae gp bridging is ""difference between o level el and a level gp""",btohqsg
If dhs ip students actually wrote decent gp essays,btohqsg
Then I won't be so critical of it,btohqsg
Tbf most ppl dont actl care about gp,btohqsg
Thrs literally no difference apart from1. Everything is argumentative2. You have more passages for compre,btohqsg
Ya cuz last time it didn't matter whether u got an A for GP or a C for gp,btohqsg
Now it matters more lol cuz the range of ur scores are shrunk,btohqsg
Nah trust me all schs make gp too complicated cuz they dk wtf to teach also cuz gp is just writing,btohqsg
Bro thinks that everyone who doesn't agree with his worldview is unbearable,btohqsg
Its not even a nsf issue anymore,btohqsg
This is why I heavily believe that people going to psych are those who need help the most and expect psych to give them the support they need,btohqsg
from the model essay book my teacher gave i realised that most ppl in my sch who do well for gp (aka have their essays published) are those who alr have very good foundations in el (and maybe lit) since jhlike some of them eds chair  top cohort for el  debate champion etc,btohqsg
It's cause some schs mark gp essays based off the quality of bombastic language,btohqsg
Cuz its the most objective way to mark,btohqsg
but ofc those ppl are minority since tbf dhs population quite stem oriented also,btohqsg
Which is why naturally people who have good foundations in English would do btr,btohqsg
actl not rly the essays i see arent that bombastic is quite easy for someone like me to understand (for my sch),btohqsg
Singaporean chers cannot delink the penalisation between contact and language,btohqsg
also damn clown in y1 they ask for fun fact then idk what to say i said idl maths and sci then now 💀💀💀,btohqsg
some arguments dont even make sense,btohqsg
Ok tbf what did you expect,btohqsg
tbh most sg students for gp they js whack cause,btohqsg
the way i define good language ability which is very different from good writing ability is1. Your writing does not sound like a robot (which somehow 70% of essays I read cannot meet)2.  There is consideration of your overall essay at both a local and global structure,btohqsg
smth more interesting and complex that actually makes me think,btohqsg
theres not much emphasis on like writing,btohqsg
"within sg  a lot of people that are ""good at english"" only know how to use it in specific ways",btohqsg
ngl when yall say this about hci and ri i wonder alot,btohqsg
cause the jc cohorts of hci and ri are perceived to be like the cream of the crop in sg,btohqsg
but then theres also ppl like me who promoted with shitty grades leh,btohqsg
Well I would expect them to be the cream of the crop,btohqsg
cuz they keep saying they the best,btohqsg
english is just something we learn at a basic level and only bother with the rules and shit,btohqsg
but prose is left out of the syllabus,btohqsg
"idk some RI/HCI students i meet them and im like""So tell me what you have done successfully and impressively"" cuz idk man",btohqsg
we're taught how to make arguments but end up sounding rigid bc we dk how to convey them otherwise,btohqsg
PEEL is a general structure but it's not like a step by step process,btohqsg
teachers teach PEEL as if ur supposed to follow it methodologically,btohqsg
no because i think its a sample size problem but then i dont agree when ppl say all ri/hci jc students have the best grades,btohqsg
i write gp essays like how I text my friends,btohqsg
because i know ppl from those schs who barely promoted,btohqsg
you have the insanely high flyers and the people left behind,btohqsg
Its just extrapolated based on the fact that they have the highest median in Singapore so generally at least 50% of them do better than most of SG,btohqsg
people also will retain in those schs,btohqsg
oh today ur kouhais got scolded by teacher for inappropriate behaviours,btohqsg
ok there was this group of guys,btohqsg
they kept being disruptive in h2 hist lecture,btohqsg
why everyone looking for female tutors,btohqsg
then the teacher raised her voice multiple times,btohqsg
anyway when i tried talking to my mentee about GP i'm like always conflicted bc i perceive it a certain way but A levels mark it a diff way,btohqsg
so i end up just telling her to listen to her teacher,btohqsg
wat wld be considered crazy tho,btohqsg
i mean representing in olympiad nationally is pretty craxy,btohqsg
I had a friend who rejected Imperial and Cambridge,btohqsg
representing anything at a national level is a feat,btohqsg
cuz he had commitments in SG,btohqsg
i think those are like the extreme opposite of josh,btohqsg
that is not keeping the status quo,btohqsg
need to be more intune with local politics lol,btohqsg
okay idk man i feel like lawrence wong unironically has no plan for the future,btohqsg
hes just reacting in real time,btohqsg
i feel like his main idea is to maintain status quo,btohqsg
yes we maintain status quo when world dying,btohqsg
not to be a hater on pap but the logic isnt logicking,btohqsg
thats why PAP is still up there  *i think*,btohqsg
I think Singapore will be one of the last few countries to die,btohqsg
ur not wrong in a sense,btohqsg
i will retain faith in SG government when they finally stop eliding shit and actually tell people wtf is happening,btohqsg
i hope to die once i get my phd,btohqsg
we always make fun of tiananmen square in china,btohqsg
but never acknowledge Singapore's version of it,btohqsg
finish one goal and clock out of life,btohqsg
idt majority of the population thinks like josh,btohqsg
So backlash > doing the right thing,btohqsg
but ALOT of genz think like josh,btohqsg
josh was the 1 thinking more or less about money,btohqsg
I just think that they need to be honest abt their shit,btohqsg
if everyone was 10 times more direct and honest with each other the world will be a bette rplae,btohqsg
but if we want to unfuck ourselves,btohqsg
need to get fucked to be unfucked,btohqsg
which i feel they still keep actively ignoring,btohqsg
theres actually historical evidence to suggest that this has happened before,btohqsg
why wld pap being more transparent lead to them losing dominance?,btohqsg
just curious cus i blur lol,btohqsg
then the whole singapore was like heehee pap useless,btohqsg
Guys Guys Guys Guess 2day 19 January 2024(Monday)Which Wrestling Spirits?🤔,btohqsg
Wait but why transparency lead to this,btohqsg
Why does being transparent abt why they do things the way they do things,btohqsg
how does being in secondary school excuse putting a dead cockroach in someone’s sandwich knowing they will unknowingly eat it and get sick/traumatised?There’s a difference between being immature and being malicious/having lack of common sense.,btohqsg
damn that person held that grudge for 20 years LOL,btohqsg
i think it's hilarious and cathartic to read about but anyone that is bitter about this for 20 years needs to get themselves sorted out,btohqsg
that reminds me a classmate caught 2 grasshopper while we were out in a park for learning journey,btohqsg
I have also caught live grasshoppers before,btohqsg
like the prank sucks and i think what the person did for payback is about equal scale,btohqsg
but i still think it's petty and unhealthy to hold it for 20 years,btohqsg
unless you give me more context that this classmate has done a ton of other equally bad stuff  mentioning other people that can be sadistic and whatnot is just projecting,btohqsg
well i mean if the person eat the sandwich without knowing theres a dead cockroach they are probably gonna get sick  but then if there's dog poop in the bag with fish the person would wash the fish before cooking it no?  so its intent to hurt someone vs intent to inconvenience someone,btohqsg
I doubt washing a fish that is contaminated with poop would be enough to keep someone from getting sick from eating it.,btohqsg
The story seems a bit fake but eh,btohqsg
wouldn't be surprised but it's not the usual stuff people would fake,btohqsg
ngl alot of stories on aita front page seem faked,btohqsg

Hey  kinda need some advice;So im doing this group project in school  and we’re supposed to make a presentation. So far  we’re pretty much done   but when I showed my mom ( who’s pretty experienced with presentations and stuff)   she said it sucks and wants me to redo everything; but when I showed the teacher the work we had done  she said it looked good; and now i feel super pressured from all sides because my mom keeps getting mad and screaming that its bad  but my teacher said it looked good  and I don’t wanna just replace all my groupmates work with my own cuz it’s not very nice,btohqsg
Its due tmr  what should I do?,btohqsg
If your teacher is the one grading the presentation  you should know better who to listen to,btohqsg
Im also scared to lose marks cuz this is 25% of my grade,btohqsg
go with what ur tcher wants and not what ur mum wants. after all ur tcher is the one grading u and not ur mum,btohqsg
if your teacher says it's fine then it's fine,btohqsg
ok so you said to make an extra copy and then show your mum that it fits her criteria  meaning that you prob change it a bit so that your mum is happy,btohqsg
so what i'm arguing is that there's no point making and editing a backup copy when it's due tmr,btohqsg
is rachael pronounce like raphael but rachael or rachel,btohqsg
have you ever thought about it,btohqsg
because if it's due tmr and you present or submit it it's not like she can ask you to change anything after that if you don't listen to her,btohqsg
so she won't be after your ass,btohqsg
you're better off spending time that you take to edit your presentation on other stuff more worthwhile,btohqsg
Honestly y does blud care. Your mom giving you them grades?? Hell nah blud,btohqsg
It’s good to listen to your mom but not now buddy,btohqsg
15h to the start of school tmr  where 8h would probably be spent sleeping assuming he's that kind of person and more than half of the remaining 7h isn't gonna be spent listening to his mum talk anyway,btohqsg
might as well just deal with it,btohqsg
as someone who had a groupmate with a mom like that... Do ur team a favour and ignore your mom. And since ur teacher said its okay leave it,btohqsg

Going back reservice  I met a Major who left service and had to serve the remaining years as reservice.But when I was in NS  he was an OC  a captain. He left a few years ago to join the private sector and requested to be posted back to the unit he was OC in.And he does nothing but strut around. He's not OC or PC or anything in the reservice unit(orbat alr fixed). He just goes around talking about duty and stuff.I still remember in Brunei  he made the whole company go up  then he took out a ground sheet  put his field chair on it then sat on it.Like wtf. Sit on the ground like the rest of us dirty and tired people.,btohqsg
I dunno  I think it takes a special kind of person to decide they need to sign on (unless it's cause of scholarship/financial circumstances  which are very valid),btohqsg
idk if this is bad but i actl like the pace of lessons now,btohqsg
i always felt that my y4 bio teacher was kinda slow in his pacing or maybe its my class issue,btohqsg

a fair number are younger peeps like T05-T08 shoplifting from shops like H&M  Shein  Sephora  etc.,btohqsg
