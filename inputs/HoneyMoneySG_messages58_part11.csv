Hi all! I'll be heading to Japan and will be using my Amaze card wherever possible. In the case I need to withdraw money in Japan  should I withdraw with Amaze or YouTrip? Which is better for withdrawals?,btohqsg
Hi all! if I were to use my Amaze Card overseas  other than Citi Rewards card  are there other card recommendations that would be worth it compared to Trust/Youtrip?,btohqsg
Chris. Seen your videos on amaze vs trust. I think it‚Äôs really a use case problem.If you are stacking to redeem sq suites with cmrc then the forex bank fees and online category more than offset the 2% amaze fee.If for general use outside of cmrc then it‚Äôs a problem. In isolation when compared to trust YouTrip the fee is essentially 2% more but you get card points and cash back benefits. So for example the 1.5% cash back cards like sc you actually lose 0.5% compared to trust.,btohqsg

Like in your video if you‚Äôve a 5% cashback card you gain 3%. But not really. Cos if you use that card without amaze you only gain 3.2% forex fee minus 2% amaze fee  so only 1% ish?,btohqsg
No  the tier is 300 spend per month for the quarter or 1k spend per month for the quarter. If u spend in between for any month  u only get 30,btohqsg
Appreciate your comment. But what is the point you're trying to bring across?,btohqsg
There is amaze card paired with amaze wallet,btohqsg
or Youtrip 5% surprise if you qualify  before 14 aug,btohqsg
I think that it‚Äôs benefit is a specific use case stacking to maximise sq redemption with cmrc. If you use blindly with say a pure cashback 1.5% card you actually lose money.,btohqsg
Of course  no denying that. Use amaze with at least 4 mpd/5% cashback card,btohqsg
But even then use without amaze you only lose 1% forex fees?,btohqsg
Cos bank charge 3%. Vs amaze 2#,btohqsg
In other words all the effort only benefit 1% at the end of the day.,btohqsg
You have to include 0.5% instapoints + ability to convert to online for amaze,btohqsg
My six mth t-bill matured on 22 Aug. Which is the next closest auction I can bid?1) 17 auction date  22 issue date2) 31 auction date  5 sep issue date.I suppose it‚Äôs option 2 as the money need to be available before auction date?,btohqsg
beside tbill  where else can i invest in?,btohqsg
Of course. Also cmrc 1k limit and other 5% cards all have tricky mcc minimum spends etc. one mistake you give 2% donation to amaze for no benefit.,btohqsg

Hi guys! If I change my UOB lady's credit card billing cycle to be calendar month  does the 1k cap for bonus miles get prorated? (It will be changed to 13 July-31 August),btohqsg
The student version is 5% but no need minimum spend,btohqsg
To clarify  it means changing my billing cycle wouldn't change the $1k cap?,btohqsg
Sorry  is the video on Moomoo already available?  Is Moomoo considered safe?  Sorry  newbie and still trying to find out and learn.  Tq,btohqsg

"hi everyone  i'm new to the miles game so wanted to seek some opinions on signing up for my first miles card. i understand that at 6mpd for selected categories  the uob lady's card has been touted as the best miles card in singapore at least until the 6mpd promotion ends in feb next year. i saw that Chris mentioned in his uob lady's card video a few weeks ago that for new-to-uob customers (like myself)  we should apply for the uob privi miles card first instead to make use of the free miles they are giving away if the conditions are met (from the website  looks like 45 200 miles if can spend 1k per month for 2 consecutive months + pay the first year annual fee payment of S$240+8% gst).i'm considering just going to sign up for the uob lady's solitaire card straightaway as this has a $350 cash credit sign-up bonus if i fulfil the same 1k per month spending criteria for 2 consecutive months. was just doing the calculations and if i value the miles at 1.25cents per mile  the 45 200 miles from the privi miles card sign-up bonus is worth about $565. but considering i have to pay the $240 annual fee + forgo the $350 cash bonus from the uob lady's card (total about $590)  the case to get the 45 200 miles doesn't seem as strong?i also have some travel expenses to pay off soon for a year-end trip (but not super alot  probably just under 2k) so i thought good to rack up the miles with the 6mpd uob lady's card first / as soon as i can? assuming i choose the ""travel"" category for the enhanced miles accrual for the uob lady's card.do let me know if i am missing something here or if there's something i should be aware of. thank you very much!!",btohqsg
"Yes  the big IF is are you ""the first 200 new-to-UOB credit card customers who successfully apply and spend a min. of S$1 000 for 2 consecutive months.""You won't know",btohqsg
Hey guys  crypto question for you.Does anyone know if any exchange available in Singapore that able to transfer usdt without any address verification etc ?,btohqsg
hmm i see. the only way to find out whether you're the first 200 is after the end of the 2 month period?,btohqsg
Hi Chris not sure u have this credit card uob absolute amex. But how to use this credit card is a question to me   last time was for grab wallet top up.,btohqsg

Can use for amex promotions like Shopsmall,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I‚Äôve just applied for the UOB krisflyer miles card as they are giving welcome miles for signups. Part of the criteria to get the miles is that I have to spend $2000 within 60 days. May I ask if payment for insurance premiums can make up for this $2000 spending requirement?,btohqsg
