Ah alternate make sense yea. Means may in hsbc  Jun in scb  July hsbc? Because when in May programme it covers May and jun,btohqsg
Isn't the campaign for April&May   Now June July ?,btohqsg
Yeah I thought two months too where in the second month u put more than previous month,btohqsg
Ok thanks let me check out stashaway. I cannot use both hsbc ega and esaver for july as im kept out from the promotion due to the increamental of previous month,btohqsg
Its may  june. Then june  july. Only can sign 1,btohqsg
Hi everyone just to check for EGA June promo if you put incremental 10K in June and then keep the same in July - will you get the additional 3.4% only for June (I understand Everyday+ will definitely just give 1% pa for June only).,btohqsg
so if I have 0 in May  10K in June  10K in 3 July (all totals) - I ll receive 4.45% is June on the 10K (assume I qualify for Everyday+ too) and 3.45 % for July(just no Everyday+ bonus) on the 10K too?,btohqsg
If you don't mind 1% less for the 2nd month then sure,btohqsg
oh  that is nice - thank you @TW,btohqsg
Hmm Melvyn based on the T&Cs isn't it 4.45% and 3.45% respectively?,btohqsg
Based on t&c  10k is 3.30% bonus interest.,btohqsg
This link that Chris shared earlier says 3.45%  no?https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/terms-and-conditions-lny-ega-promotion.pdf,btohqsg
Oh wait you're referring to Jun's promo. For@MarwenBenMessaoudit's 3.30% bonus interest because he registered in May.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn ‚ô° coffee on me if u wanna meet,btohqsg
Oh really may lower. Gosh. I have rolled into the April programme  kept 2 months. Shifting to another human hsbc ega for June and July programmeTrying to recall why didn't shift it in may because 1 the may programme was based on incremental over March adb (I could be wrong),btohqsg
Yup no tiered promo in Jun.Can compare with May's promo here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/194170,btohqsg
Melvyn can open coffee shop already. So many fans,btohqsg
Just something that occured to me - for those who didn't register May HSBC EGA  it is a good opportunity to empty your UOB accounts (leave 1K I suppose) into EGA  sign up for June to get 4.45% on that amount. And then shift back to UOB in July if and when the new UOB promo comes out,btohqsg
Interesting. I still got my earmarks locked in uob though so happy to stay there but let me check maybe it's gonna release 2h jun,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. If you are travelling do buy travel insurance,btohqsg
@AdrainHoado not post irrelevant news  or at least summarise it if you feel the need to share,btohqsg

Scb online banking setup is the worst ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
"Just signed up for UOB Priv Miles card  but not able to SMS register ""PMAF"". Anyone faced this issue as well? Or issit need fulfill the spending criteria + pay annual fee first?",btohqsg
nah is for June-July 2 month cycle for SCB eSaver,btohqsg
3.55 percent for two months only?,btohqsg
Yes. The banks will announce new rates after July. Been always like that,btohqsg
yes then u merry go round with another high saving bank account,btohqsg
Does ega need those spending  giro etc etc or just need fresh funds?,btohqsg
Sure u can withdraw anytime anyway,btohqsg
If 50k deposit balance today in esaver  need to increase deposit next month to get 3.55?,btohqsg
I mean like to fulfil the high interest criteria,btohqsg
It's up to u to leave for higher return yes,btohqsg
My understanding is u didn't had any deposit with them earlier then ur 50k is fresh for 3.55% these 2 months.,btohqsg
Dont understand what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm asking when can we withdraw but still fulfil the criteria for high interest,btohqsg
CIMB for existing user 3.5% also for Fastsaver,btohqsg
Second month still have 3.55? As the fund is not fresh anymore from first month?,btohqsg
I thought important to share need to have travel insurance.. also some able to get miles reward,btohqsg
You didn't share about travel insurance. You just copy and pasted a wall of text from the news.,btohqsg
Okk...next time I don't share about SQ accident news,btohqsg
Meaning for ur HSBC EGA's interest in July  u will give up and just move all fund back to UOB in July?,btohqsg
Upto the point where UOB interest can be greater than 3.45%,btohqsg
Earn a flat interest rate of 3.50%** p.a. by simply topping up a minimum of S$5 000 incremental fresh funds# (compared to month-end balance of 31 May 2024) into your account from 1 June to 31 July 2024.,btohqsg
Hi HY  is this flat 3.5% promo for CIMB Starsavers account too vs 31/5/2024 end balance?,btohqsg
3.5 I think is very good...,btohqsg
Can I use UOB KF+Amaze to convert contactless payment (for Nam Ho Travel) and still earn 3MPD?,btohqsg
Does SC works with daily average for Esaver ?,btohqsg
if their MCC falls in UOBKF's whitelist yes,btohqsg
Min balance 5k maintain. And open by 31 July,btohqsg
quick question - for HSBC Everyday+ Rewards  it used to be every other month move in 2k + 5 txn  has it now changed to every month need to move in 2k + 5 txn?,btohqsg
