singlife im paying for  how about citi payall ? previously been paying via giro  and missing out on all the cashback/points,btohqsg
If using Citipayall  mean you are paying Citi admin fee to buy miles not earn miles.,btohqsg
Guys  if CRMC+XNAP to scan for hawker foods  is it eligible for 10X points?,btohqsg
No  you need CRMC+amaze as Xnap goes through mobile wallet (gpay)CRMC direct excludes mobile wallet transactions,btohqsg
If using ApplePay  can I use Amaze card inside to scan?,btohqsg
I don't think ApplePay supports Amaze atm,btohqsg
In other words  I need to manually tap Amaze card to recognize 10x points for CRMC?,btohqsg
Means there is no way for Apple users to earn 10x CRMC pts via Xnap atm,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the next best card after HSBC Revolution?,btohqsg

Hi  can you convert kris pay mile to krisflyer mile?,btohqsg

Hi anyone have faced issue with UOB One spending refund before? I hit the 500 min spend for this month but one of my txn from May got refunded which caused my spending to drop below 500. As today is last day and I can't post anymore txn in time any recommendation?,btohqsg

Guys is it just me or did something happen to Syfe?,btohqsg
If u have little amt then do krispay  if you are transfering a big sum krisflyer direct is still worth it with the 27 dollar conversion fee,btohqsg
Only miles earned within kris+ can be transferred out,btohqsg
If you have an account  go take a look  some other people have also pmed me saying their funds turned 0,btohqsg
How many point then will it be worth the 27 fees,btohqsg
It is up to u to be honest. Transfering to krispay not as worthy. Every 750 krispay is $5,btohqsg
Could be just something wrong with their performance chart UIIf you are worried ping the cust service ~,btohqsg
U can work out the calculatio  yourself. I only do convert during krispay transfer promotion,btohqsg
Checked with the customer service agent. They say it‚Äôs something to do with their UI,btohqsg
Cultural revolution v2 under Xidada. Got digital xiaohongshu and now they are culling the intellectual industries. I wonder what next?,btohqsg
I wish India had a cultural revolution  it would solve many problems,btohqsg
Do you know how harmful cultural revolution was?,btohqsg
There is good and bad. Bad that many people died. Good that old habits and cultural norms were completely turned upside down. Today many academics have a more nuanced view of the Cultural revolution.,btohqsg
Just remove the caste system then India would be improved. The cultural revolution removed the intellectuals. All fled to Taiwan which is why TSMC is there and not in China,btohqsg
When I look at India  we all know something has to change with the caste system  social stratification and behavioural norms. But its impossible to administer any change with the current system. Given the size of the population now(thanks  gangetic plains!) probably 600-800 million will perish if it was to happen,btohqsg
I am all for culling of masses. World is already overpopulated. When Genghis Khan killed like 10s of millions the earth cooled down by several degrees,btohqsg
From time to time  life has to begin on a clean slate again,btohqsg
Caste discrimination is  officially illegal in India  but u can‚Äôt legislate away what is in people‚Äôs hearts and minds.,btohqsg
you can't cull the masses like that unless an asteroid hits the earth just there,btohqsg
but then again suppose an asteroid does hit it won't be that accurate an aim to hit just once place that's over populated,btohqsg
Let's move on and stick to positive personal finance topics,btohqsg
It shows fare only doesnt show fare details,btohqsg
Download simplygo apps and register your card,btohqsg
Will XNAP transactions (transacted via ApplePay) still count towards the minimum spend for new card member gifts?,btohqsg
Understand such transactions will not be eligible for 10x points but will it still count towards the min spend?,btohqsg
does the sign up promo excludes mobile waller in-app? If not should be eligible.,btohqsg
I see  mobile wallet in-app still get 1x for CRMC right?,btohqsg
Experts  the best high interest account for Aug 2023 is what? SCB eSAVER at 3.40%?,btohqsg

(yes i know time taken to travel is more valuable  but if cannot even afford rent then no choice)can anyone confirm as well if you daily travel and stay in msia using MACS 2.0 (the auto clear) on just regular social visit visa  will the auto clear flag you? i've seen people say they got caught because they were under the scrutiny of the customs officer through the normal chopping counters. wonder if the auto clear avoids this issue?,btohqsg
