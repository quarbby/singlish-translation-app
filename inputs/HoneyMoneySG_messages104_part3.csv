Hello  may I ask if I were to withdraw all my funds from UOB now.. will I still get my bonus interest on the 2nd?,btohqsg
Oh great. So I can withdraw everything now ya?,btohqsg
No qualification? Later he expect full 5% pa woh.,btohqsg
Depends on how much interest you want to get based on your MAB in Apr. If you withdraw now  you will lose interest $21.37 calculated based on 7.8% pa if you have $100k between 1-29 April.,btohqsg
When should I withdraw to get the full 5%? Is it before 10.30pm or after 10.30pm on 30/4/24?Currently I have 3 UOB one account under different family member each $100k. 1 of UOB one need to withdraw to top up 50k to the other 2 UOB one. Please advise. Thanks,btohqsg
Too late Liao.The right way is to make it such that account A withdraw till $1000 on 30th April will still have $100 000 mab.,btohqsg
Lol you should have asked this a month ago.If you don't intend to register for earmark for the other 2 accounts then transfer after 1030pm for all 3 to get 5% p.a. You'll also won't get full 4% p.a. unless you keep it at 151.7k until end of May.If you don't mind losing some interest for that 1 account  then transfer before 1030pm. You can make it up with the full 4% p.a. for the 2 accounts and cash credits from earmark promo.,btohqsg
Oh no  too late. So what should i do now üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Yes i am ok losing some interest for 1 of the account to get full 4% for the 2 accounts  but the cash credits promo only base on 50k top up which is $250 üò≠  right?,btohqsg
Yes. I just realised there is at cash credit promo. Too late now to get the $1k right?Or can i try to join in may end withdraw all n put back $150k?,btohqsg
Can i open new uob one account under another person name n put  my 150k in that new acc n join this cash credit tomorrow to get 1k?,btohqsg
how to reach out to standard chartered credit card support? is there any chat option?,btohqsg
"""Tomorrow"" refers to today right? It's 30 Apr",btohqsg

If the account opens by today and the promo registration goes through then sure. But remember to reoptimise the rest of the money,btohqsg
Ok thanks for all the useful info.I will try to go to UOB tomorrow then üëçüèª,btohqsg

to get $150k mab in may either have $150k on 30 Apr or $155k from 1may/2May  might as well register for the promo now and deposit today by 10.30pm,btohqsg
I did‚Ä¶. So far so good,btohqsg
If you cannot open the new account by today  you can always register the new account for the promo in May for earmarking in Jun with 150k.Are you referring to the account with 100k already? If you can register with the new account  no point to register with your account for less.,btohqsg
If you don't mind returning the cash credit  you can call in the request withdrawal.,btohqsg
Yes immediate  on the business day. Else the following business day  with the funds available immediately.,btohqsg

So far ‚Ä¶ yesThough i put in for 2 weeks only ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Yep but from my side  funds will be in early may for top up. So as long as i am able to attain 150K for the MAB in May  i can earmarked once my funds are in early may and still get 4.5% ?,btohqsg
