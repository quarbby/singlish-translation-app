"Hahaha ya when Equanimity first joined he claimed he had a sibling with mental issues  due to his parents idk what lah and that he hates them blablabla. This story was repeated quite a few times by different usernames leh... Maybe he is the non existent ""sibling"". Quite scary tbh",btohqsg
This year all got experience liao  wont be chaos like last yr,btohqsg
Any bro vested in biolidics? Any tp?,btohqsg
My opinion it might retrace abit back to 350-360 range before trying to break 400 I am in at 310 and out at 380... Looking at Monday direction before deciding to reenter... Dyodd,btohqsg
Lol bag holder.. waiting to de-freeze,btohqsg
Alser like suddenly up so much,btohqsg
Dk will retrace back abit anot,btohqsg
Thanks bro for the opinion. I enter abit late stuck at 0.39,btohqsg
Any change up to 0.40 and above?,btohqsg
@emilymoore55U pm me but don‚Äôt offer ad $,btohqsg
Results announcement: Asian Healthcare revenue and profit increased . They have announced dividends $0.0015. (Low but for small company which is growing) Quite okay. This week I think they should push back to over $0.20 range where it is more liquid.,btohqsg
@furion07I think furion might have a higher target for bio haha,btohqsg
I buy 385 not far from u,btohqsg
Ya mayb your analysis might suit him better haha,btohqsg
Amplefield profitable. NAV increase slightly from approx. 0.073 to $0.075. Should go to $0.035/$0.036. This one gotta be patient. If play   need to hold. Once it can convincingly close at $0.037   it should head to 4 series. But overall counter is very undervalued  just a little slow.,btohqsg
Cause imo the Indonesia news kind like fully reflected in current price,btohqsg
Anyways  this week . My focus will be on VIVIDTHREE  I believe tomorrow might just rally since they flushed and recovered strong. Just started w3.Also  spotted BBs interest 2 fridays back when it made a 56% run.They should be coming in this Week.,btohqsg
I thought joysbio news even earlier,btohqsg
isdn weekly chart (1 week = 1 bar )  according to the chart   we can see a pattern on MACD indcator shown bottom of the chart .. once MACD histogram turn green from red   stock price will go up quite significantly   now currently turn to green bar .. will pattern / history repeat ? .. DYODD ..,btohqsg
üßê Isit the coming soon in your post for the joysbio testkit?,btohqsg
Nice. Good luck to all ISDN. Unfortunately I was stopped out of this trade. Too tight a SL this time .Can ask your view on Vicplas too. Appreciates,btohqsg
Hmm I wonder why sia still issuing bonds to save itself wanna go buy air india,btohqsg
I worry they already factor in all these news which it jump 7c... Mayb another announcement might help it go over 40.. As of now I will stay at sideline for bio first...,btohqsg
BTW that's just my opinion... It might go up further despite my thoughts.. Haha,btohqsg
Understood. Is human natureHope to be buying at low or selling at high no worries,btohqsg
I expect more upside so I added. Praying hard too,btohqsg
Dbs wanna swallow india bank lvb...approved le...,btohqsg
Ya... Everyone should consolidate the analysis and make their own call... Cannot blame on anyone call... Cause the person that call did not press buy on your account for u..,btohqsg
I think sia and dbs will still go up,btohqsg
On one hand need gov bailout for SIA citing how important it isOn the other they bailout othersWhen modi put it out for auction,btohqsg
Why when they are dying they scream for $When want shopping tell u good opportunity,btohqsg

Actually tata is rich enough to save air india...,btohqsg
Tata sell IT  sells cars...it's a giant Indian mnc,btohqsg
Need bring someone with expertiseSo the heavy liftingTata earns the bulk. Use their Indian name to smoothen red tapes,btohqsg
"""good asset"" will not fall into foreign hands...those that nobody want  people all ""siam"" far far then will be offered to ""innocent"" buyer...so far only 1 in the Q and guess who?",btohqsg
It‚Äôs a bad ride they can‚Äôt wait to get on,btohqsg
All investments made during GFC ended in disasters,btohqsg
dax  from chart u can see vicaplas got 2 gaps ... and is a bearish gap down ... as long as the gap is not filled.. i will not touch .. if first gap is filled.. i also will not touch .. i rather wait for 44cts gap .. once filled   i will wait for retracement ... then find good set up and enter long .. for now .. i will not touch it,btohqsg
Thanks for your view üëç I think you spot patterns really well,btohqsg
no problem bro .. share share .. exchange pointers,btohqsg
Well noted too. Will watch closely and decide on next course of action . Appreciates.,btohqsg
hopefully they can announce that the disinfectant has been approved to be used here  especially for the schools  hospitals/polyclinics  workers dorms etc...will boost their revenue for next year..,btohqsg
Seems like not easy to close the gap to 44c üòÇ,btohqsg
One gap at a time  I do feel that have found new bottom $0.23 and working it way up from there.If it doesn‚Äôt fill the 29-30 gap soon  then will cut first but I do believe it will  somehow.Nvm  let‚Äôs see how it goes.I feel the BBs will do a big candle to get people interest back in as now clearly see that interest in this very popular counter has dwindled,btohqsg
But my short term target is only 35c,btohqsg
