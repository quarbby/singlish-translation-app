"You remind me of ppl who couldn't go to such jcs and are nicknamed as  "" ( JC name)  rejects"" lol",btohqsg
Hi the roles are purely voluntary,btohqsg
Like those who couldn't go tjc go TM or smth then they call themselves TJ rejects LOL,btohqsg

She said it's slut shaming if i sue her,btohqsg

she gave you essentially a death sentence and you're worried about slut shaming her?,btohqsg
Uk what   She is entitled to her opinion but she doesn't have personal responsibility in a rs   be it serious/for fun,btohqsg
She wasn't honest from the start..  isn't that's why u kenna hiv,btohqsg
It's kinda hard to have kids in the future also,btohqsg
Cause the kid might inherit hiv,btohqsg
Idgi  why would u purposely transmit STD to someone   not to mention your loved one whose supposedly in a committed rs with u,btohqsg

She's using no brainer logic cause she's in her own world,btohqsg
I mean he did appear before and based on the story he told before  it's kinda hard to lie,btohqsg

IB use the HL SL system,btohqsg
CCB I SO LONG NVR SAY ANYTH IN HINDI FORGET WHAT THIS MEANSbut iinw it's probably your mother's sisterfucker or smth 💀and nope unlikely cuz anyone of any race uses swear words in any language  hindi isn't an exception,btohqsg
The indian racist guy is from vj,btohqsg
My friend was flexing the fact that he got 70RP and got into aerospace engineering,btohqsg
Not knowing that the IGP dropped,btohqsg
It's the racist Indian guy btw,btohqsg
i didn't know aerospace needed q high rp for last year,btohqsg
The one who said that speaking in Chinese to a chinese guy is racist,btohqsg

Erm I wanted to buy MC just to finish hw at home b4 I pass up,btohqsg
I have to wake up at 5am nia,btohqsg
Are there alot of MI students here,btohqsg
Waking up at 5am and getting dismissed at 5pm is so crazy,btohqsg
Siyan and i are from Mi,btohqsg
We transferred from DHS to MI because we heard that MI is only $6/month and has higher chance of going local uni,btohqsg
I never knew where MI was until last yr,btohqsg
The 2 schs which don't rly value add to student performance,btohqsg
Siyan and I are from MI,btohqsg
Like they're made up of mostly IP students but they don't do as well as RJ  HC  EJ,btohqsg
My goodness some joker made MI a meme now,btohqsg
Wait idk why I thought u were from EJ,btohqsg
more so because i knew poly wldnt work out for my aspirations,btohqsg
i didnt want to pursue ur typical dip kinda fields,btohqsg
altho percentage of students going to local u tho….,btohqsg
I need do programming tmr also,btohqsg

Some troll prob used his name and stuff to troll,btohqsg
hows the new principal @ mi kids now,btohqsg
but how does the year 6 perform  not counting JAEs ?,btohqsg
Isnt DHS and RVHS both majority IP schs,btohqsg
So if theyre mean is alr skewed,btohqsg
but my fren was a TA at DHS,btohqsg
thats why he knows the stats,btohqsg
always felt like twy was looking down on us for not making it to jc,btohqsg
Idk but when Mrs Tan made that announcement  the acs boys gave each other bombastic sideeye,btohqsg
Probably is some  salty teen that hates his tuition teacher,btohqsg
Eh but if u cannot go ri or hci u are failure,btohqsg
How to use manadr get MC fast,btohqsg
Oh ya normally is how much,btohqsg
my era long gone and tbf,btohqsg
i wouldn’t value add no matter where i go,btohqsg
mid tier and semi high tier jcs have produced nicer ppl than some of those i met from those two schs,btohqsg
Im sorry for being a failure,btohqsg
See u on the another side my guy,btohqsg
sry i'm in middle of exciting mahjong match i'll console you later,btohqsg

yeah it has $6/month school fees,btohqsg
i didnt know i paid sch fees,btohqsg
Ya sia cause discord got some fella named Caleb soh trolling saying those stuff abt MI,btohqsg
i swear not all ntu physics people are like caleb soh and chan ric,btohqsg
chan ric also has the most artificially inflated linkedin i’ve ever seen,btohqsg
I know nth about my prev principals anw,btohqsg
u tell me that isnt a troll acc meh,btohqsg
Also I hear our sch got budget one but Mrs Tan dw use,btohqsg
bluntly put  a linkedin like that is horrendous to look through,btohqsg
shame us for not being able to study in a jc,btohqsg
shout out to my fellow EAGLEs( my sch new motto),btohqsg
and paint mi as a sabing grace for ppl who supposed to go ite,btohqsg
didnt u get the vibes from twy,btohqsg
Man I only wished I give enough fks,btohqsg
if you’ve nothing else to add sure but like there’s a point it becomes just artificially inflating,btohqsg
esp if you just put there to fill space,btohqsg
She keep comparing us to JC ppl,btohqsg
cant be as bad as those uni boys that have nth on their sch stuff and js chuck loads of ns experience in,btohqsg
Don't complain y'all end at such timing   uk JC ppl end way later,btohqsg
didn’t your principal or who say youre lucky for your schedule bc other jc is worse but,btohqsg
im complaining abt the half an hr brk every single lesson,btohqsg
no one asked for sm brks,btohqsg
having trouble deciding which is worse,btohqsg
they want me eat what when canteen is closed after three ch,btohqsg

js get it ofer and done with,btohqsg

ppl in uni ask me why i 21 i telling them im a male i went to ns,btohqsg
as long as not pri sch in mi,btohqsg
I'll flex to you if I end up in phy Olympiad master shifu,btohqsg
I have had MI student  scored B for H2 Phy for A lvl even though he didn't complete his practical and paper 2,btohqsg
from the pov of someone who gets involved in drama and disciplinary cases almost every yr,btohqsg
becoming reclusive is ur best bet,btohqsg
if you get a prize for olympiad i’ll treat you idk what,btohqsg
tbh I taught MI Phy Olympiad before. I actually sort of gave up 😭,btohqsg
Omg do uk one guy in my class is hated by 3 entire classes,btohqsg
in a few years i’m gonna be like,btohqsg
hi i have a PhD in Physics from NTU and i want to retake A levels for H2 Math,btohqsg
feels like mi kids take 3 yrs for granted,btohqsg
Imma one time flex to all the phy gods if I end up in phy Olympiad,btohqsg
i got a B back in 2015,btohqsg
so they spend majority of their time gossiping,btohqsg
I like chem but somehow I do btr for phy,btohqsg
thats why i didnt go poly,btohqsg
i’ll get you new rosin or smth idk,btohqsg
Trust me  when I was writing notes for my students  I realised how much I sucked in Physics during A levels,btohqsg
it shows that physics conceptual knowledge  while important  isn't the main component to scoring,btohqsg
me suffering through writing essays after essays now,btohqsg
the amount i didn’t actually understand from young and freedman when i read it in y1,btohqsg
vs reading it for olympiad in jc,btohqsg
I kinda partially even more motivated to ace physics,btohqsg
got a few gens of physics lovers alr,btohqsg
why everywhere i go everyonems doing sci,btohqsg
Doing physics sometimes make me feel like my own logic ain't logicing,btohqsg
how was uni sem 1 btw,btohqsg
Like I thought I was logically logical until I found out I wasnt,btohqsg
the more physics you learn  sometimes it becomes very counterintuitive,btohqsg
piled with sci mods next sem,btohqsg
they asked  then I think ok lor  try try jc version,btohqsg
but really tough. I decided not to focus on jc olympiad,btohqsg
oh yeah i’m kinda technically allowed to take on some non ntu jobs now,btohqsg
didn’t i suggest the book to you,btohqsg
I thought we just fking ard,btohqsg
if you can get through the book right,btohqsg
Were we not on the same page wtf,btohqsg
y1 uni physics stuff you got it,btohqsg
Or is it my rizz u can't take,btohqsg
Idt I can skip GTA mission tho,btohqsg
You are well qualified. And I need ideas and help.,btohqsg
Funny my friend not even good in phy but cause he got selected for sec sch one he ended up getting selected for jc one,btohqsg
JC version needs to be very good in maths,btohqsg
Ngl I kinda happy Im able to help abit of the As pcme stuff in the other chat,btohqsg
it's the maths part that's hard to teach because I thought the students would know but they don't,btohqsg
tbh smth i’ve been wanting to explore as a long term project is taking a leaf from minutephysics on youtube or 3blue1brown,btohqsg
Idg what's with the comp sci hype tho,btohqsg
jc one is like even if you know the physics you can’t translate it to steps,btohqsg
I need someone to push me on this also. Just procrastinating 😭,btohqsg
I thought engineering is the one,btohqsg
i too don’t wanna get bitches,btohqsg
not wrong. New year new me. Going to be new dad again in June 🙊,btohqsg
finish it before you’re a new dad,btohqsg
or you won’t have time at all,btohqsg
I need to update 2 books before that. But procrastination to the max lol,btohqsg
even if he did that’s still a new child LOL,btohqsg
Dude we all can address him as an official uncle,btohqsg
draft copy for the A lvl students last year only,btohqsg

F MathsC MathsPhyEconsS paper MathsS paper PhysicsChineseGPOnly my GP didn't get distinction,btohqsg
o level results in 4 days,btohqsg
Mf for Os I was dying,btohqsg

stup rubbing it my face dawg,btohqsg
dont quite a few in ri end up there,btohqsg
didnt we just talk about this last night or sth,btohqsg
I was thinking of maybe foreign languages,btohqsg
Meant to reply to this msg,btohqsg
there’s AP physics 1  AP physics 2  AP physics C: mechanics  AP physics C: e and m,btohqsg
just like how there’s AP calculus AB  calculus BC  pre calculus  statistics,btohqsg
Imagine if Ur eng and chi good alr,btohqsg
If they gd in learning lang,btohqsg
Some ppl have a natural talent to it idk,btohqsg
you take those in addition to your other classes tho,btohqsg
plus their system is GPA based at high school,btohqsg
ik of someone who read sources from other languages and then translated it himself,btohqsg
their unis almost all have essays too for apps,btohqsg
If u go for sch  overseas exchange trip,btohqsg
oh yea but SAT becoming more and more optional,btohqsg
mi dont teach u these shit until a few days before a’s,btohqsg
u’re better off knowing from seniors here,btohqsg
like more and more schools are making it optional,btohqsg
just like how for postgrad the GRE is doing that too,btohqsg
by then its too late to farm “im an all rounder” points in ur apps,btohqsg
thats why u ended up in mi,btohqsg
it's not testimonials like sec sch kinda right,btohqsg
i give pity story abt how i had no goal and aim,btohqsg
how i was a disastrous xmm behavior,btohqsg
end up in mi meet ppl,btohqsg
the GRE physics is way worse,btohqsg
It's like writing a personal recount,btohqsg
ik sm guys who do that,btohqsg
i spammed referals and befged it from literally anyone,btohqsg
tests in classical mechanics  quantum mechanics  thermodynamics  electromagnetism then special topics like atomic and particle physics etc that not everyone knows (but there’s a variety so most won’t know everything),btohqsg
meanwhile GRE math you can solve 90% using H2 knowledge,btohqsg
Im kinda tempted to practice violin at 5am ltr,btohqsg
the efficiency that lingling would be proud of,btohqsg
under the achievements  can put how many years back,btohqsg
i think like mid july to end aug,btohqsg
Is it Ur first time applying uni tho,btohqsg
Must u write a new one every time u apply uni,btohqsg
Like if let's say u first time cmi,btohqsg
i feel so insufficient after looking at the nus website,btohqsg
How would they know u copy paste anw,btohqsg
I wouldn't have the guts to irl actually,btohqsg
