Does anyone know if the NTUC vouchers on ShopBack work the same as those that you buy in the app? That is it works like a store value card don’t need to use the entire value in one transaction?,btohqsg
Good morning to all Si Fu..I just bought a Great Eastern insurance plan and it doesn't accept credit card payment for premium. Any recommendations on those ipaymy  cardup kind of services?,btohqsg
If I use CRMC to pay for a big ticket item on cardup then I opt to pay my Citi bill in instalment plan  will I still recd any Citi rewards? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
Yes ipaymy or cardup are fine or you can also consider citi payall if you have a good rewards earning citi credit card,btohqsg
thanks ... but i thought city payall only gives the base rewards?eg: if i pair it with CRMC i will only get 1 pt for every single dollar spent instead of 10x pts?,btohqsg
Yes correct  so have to use citi cards with better base earn rates,btohqsg
May i ask  for those whom collect miles. Do you only transfer when you about to use the miles or you transfer and keep in the airlines miles?,btohqsg
I transfer when I need or when my credit card points are going to expire. Some cards have points that don't expire like dbs altitude so might as well just keep there until you need to use it.,btohqsg
usually i keep till i need to use the miles  as some cards charge you for the transfer of miles  but you have to be mindful fo the individual expiry dates for the miles on each card.,btohqsg
I have a question. Take HSBC revo for example. The points expire 3 years after card approval so the points of the 36th month will instantly expire after being credited ?,btohqsg
Hi  can i know which credit card best for clinic payments?,btohqsg
Hello all  I'm abit confused on the UOB PPV. Do I earn rewards points if I make payment via apple pay/atome on flight tickets (let say fromtrip.com),btohqsg
No. The card to use is Visa Signature. Spend 1K and up to 2K  you get 4 mpd for reasonable FCY spend,btohqsg
interested to know this as well,btohqsg
hi guys! can check if I pay travel insurance using my lady solitaire card  does that count into the min credit card spend of $500 for the uob one 7.85% interest promo? I tried asking uob chat assist but they don't know and but will arrange for a call back which never happen!,btohqsg
😭Cannot use amaze on taobao anymore....,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to ask if ntuc membership fee is considered eligible spend for credit cards?,btohqsg
how do you even select RMB as payment currency on taobao? haha. I've been trying to but my only currency available are 'foreign currency' so i had to choose SGD and let taobao auto-convert from RMB.,btohqsg
If I use CRMC to pay for a big ticket item on cardup then I opt to pay my Citi bill in instalment plan  will I still recd any Citi rewards? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
have been using mobile all these while and couldn't get it to work in RMB. oh wells 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
but I'm just playing around with payment options  it seems like paying in SGD does not have a fee now,btohqsg
when you pay in SGD did you have processing fee previously?,btohqsg
yes  processing fee is levied to payment through overseas credit card actually rather than for currency conversion per se. Although the conversion rate is thrash as well. I'm sure they take a cut too.,btohqsg
Did u try paying via axs?,btohqsg
U check yr statement.some points expire later,btohqsg
Can be done but i wont earn any miles/cashback.,btohqsg
I think the processing fee is a 1 time waver only. boo boo...,btohqsg
Citi payall..which Citi card can get the max cashback?,btohqsg

Oh thanks  was trying to see if anyone had issue with their withdrawal taking significantly longer time than usual,btohqsg

Yeah for me the withdrawal I made yesterday morning was only reflected after midnight,btohqsg
But the issue should be fixed now,btohqsg

Which banks offer secured credit card?,btohqsg
all should offer  just that some more experience than others.. for citibank i last heard only can applied at parkway parade. hsbc took me 3months cause they never send in my application  have to head down again to applied  1 month for that.,btohqsg
most card excludes topup from rewards  hence method 1 dont give you any rewards. method 2 is paying straight to the merchant  thats why you dont get rewards on the app  but is eligible for card rewards,btohqsg
Couldn't find any info on Maybank  as I offered it for my sis who can't meet min income requirement  but would be very good to pay school fees,btohqsg
