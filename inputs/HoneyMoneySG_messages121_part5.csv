You got banned from amex plat chat  so fast forget liao?,btohqsg
Why I need to remember those people...,btohqsg
They are not forgiving.. if you are wrong .. they should pm me  then I apologise.  Not ban me without know what's wrong,btohqsg
That's why I back here.. anything don't know. Ask admin is the best..,btohqsg
To me what's the point .. you force yourself to hit 8k just to get amex points. But end up u in amex debts...,btohqsg
Hi all  i am new here. I have a qn on  chocolate finance. How to ensure the security feature on logging into the app? I am android user. I have enabled my biometrics so when i closed the app and login   it will prompt me for my biometrics but if i don't put in  i click the back button  it will show welcome back xxxx with my mobile no. And if i lose my phone  then how..any idea how to keep the acct secure?,btohqsg
You‚Äôre using android and afraid of security ü§îEven if they see your phone number they can‚Äôt exactly login without going through hoops. Else if you are really that worried  get a spare phone and install that app and don‚Äôt bring that phone out,btohqsg
Come here take ideas for your group chat?,btohqsg
Which mobile app should I download for poems?,btohqsg
Poems mobile 3 or mobile 2?,btohqsg
When was the last time you got approved for another bank's card?,btohqsg
Hi guys‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve just applied for the HSBC T1 card and gotten email that it‚Äôs been approved. How do I pay for the annual fee so that I can qualify for the sign up bonus?,btohqsg
If I remember correctly the AF should be charged after 1Month or so.Just remember to clock the spendings within the period to qualify for the bonus,btohqsg
For me it is charge on the 3rd month,btohqsg
Boss  I advice to buy 8K venchi   he say he doesn‚Äôt understand üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi Experts! Sorry to ask for advise again.i am trying to work out how i can maximise the ega account across two humans.Since we cant transfer more than 200k in a single day  its not quite possible to adjust the ADB at day1. Can effectively put more than 360k on most days to eventually get the 360k ADB at the end?Can this example work?Day 1 200kDay 2 to 370k (29days)ADB = 364k.Next month transfer on day1 to human B account (via outside bank acct)  im same fashion and also get 364k ADB for that month? And human A acct would be ~5k ADB becos of 170k on day1?,btohqsg
Just use excel to calculate on a daily basis. Better than using your current calculation. Because there will always be days u have movement in/out. I‚Äôm sure u have giro too.As long as your excel ends up with approx $360k adb is fine.And I‚Äôll start moving out on second last day and last day.,btohqsg
Hi  I juz sign up for dobin . After checking for my next purchase on sia   I realize it doesn't reflect on the app that uob ladies is giving 4 mpd when I already selected travel as my selected category. Any idea if I have to select travel again on the app ?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know how the calculation for HSBC ADB? What's the difference for MAB and ADB? Will be same method?,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing so nicely! Learnt something hereüëçüëçMind sharing also which bank to park for the last 2 days and 1st day? Scb?,btohqsg
Yes I‚Äôm using scb saver which also has 3.x% bonus interest so there is minimal interest loss on transfer days.Just watch your esaver terms properly.I‚Äôm using the ones on special invite which pay on entire balance without caring about incremental.,btohqsg
for overseas spend in Malaysia (not driving)  For MasterCards  i have HSBC TravelOne (just got it last week) and UOB KrisFlyer.Which is better to link Amaze with?per milelion review of the cardThere is also the option of pairing the HSBC TravelOne Card with Amaze in order to enjoy better conversion rates  but you‚Äôll earn 1.2 mpd instead of 2.4 mpd in that case since transactions will be converted into SGD.,btohqsg
U may want to consider using Maybank family and friends naked in Malaysia. 8% cashback on ringgit spend.,btohqsg
i'm leaving this Sunday for co. trip and i don't visit Malaysia frequentlyi do have DCS Ultimate Platinum MasterCard,btohqsg
If you have to choose between the two  then UOB KF. You will get some 3mpd for dining  shopping  taxi  etc. while the rest is 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
Probably close to 1 year ago. But I did just open a new maybank acc for refinance purposes. I believe they gave me a debit card not a credit one,btohqsg
Hi All  i'm new here. May i ask what is the best cashback card for wedding expenses? (photo shoot  bridal gown rental  banquet/wedding buffet  car rental  home reno),btohqsg
Uob lady and platinum visa. Which card is good for dinning?,btohqsg
Does that mean that I need to fund $1500 and complete 7 buy trades to get both grab and alibaba shares?,btohqsg
You can try doing a search first but not sure if there's an answer for you,btohqsg
If the amount is big you may want to consider going for miles imho,btohqsg
Ya there is a mix view between cash rebate n miles. Sum of expense I‚Äôm looking at would likely be 20-40k in the next 6mths,btohqsg
For that amount  cashback cards may not be able to fully maximize rewards. UOB one is the standout one. There are more 4mpd cards that can be used for wedding expenses.,btohqsg
Bro admin.What's your opinion on amex platinum charge card.If I had max out 1k for citi rewards out . Should I use remaining let's say 800$  for amex platinum charge card.,btohqsg
Ok thanks I will do some research on that card,btohqsg
I think probably can get business class tickets liao for,btohqsg
Oh. I‚Äôm not a frequent credit card user haha but because of this big cash layout so decided to see what I can get.,btohqsg
Uob one I think max is like 1k or is it 2k per month for one quarter. Still super short of your expected spending.,btohqsg
Only $200 per quarter for 6k spending. However I am just as noob.,btohqsg
This is more realistic than amex platinum charge card.  Spend 6000 to 8000 depends on monthly promotions must be paid within 2 months . Or else interest be charge.,btohqsg
I guess some things never change,btohqsg
Hello  can I ask what‚Äôs the current credit card that has the best perk for pumping petrol @ shell?,btohqsg
Ya uob one needs to spend consistently on a quarter. Max is 2k and you have 2 players so 4k a month. Meanwhile  miles card have like UOB lady dining/travel (1-2k) UOB preferred PV (1.1k) and UOB visa sig (2k). And another set of cards from your wife.,btohqsg
Still cashback is better if u dont intend to play miles game after this 1 time spend.,btohqsg
