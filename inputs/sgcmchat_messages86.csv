wow you know u guys can apologize right,btohqsg
instead of saying nice car to hazel,btohqsg

SG has almost 9k Porsches regged and on the roads,btohqsg
I think as many as there are Cayennes,btohqsg
bro ffs i go away for simply 2h,btohqsg
Including cayenne  macan  panamera  taycan  718  older 911  older boxster and cayman,btohqsg
There are actually more 911s than cayennes I believe,btohqsg
But maybe just as many 911s as Cayennes?,btohqsg
@qurnlsif i put a poll can u voye,btohqsg
Man has to talk in online sign language,btohqsg
More 911s than cayennes I believe,btohqsg
i gna stop poll at 12 55,btohqsg
U do know u need a car license in order to go for lorry right,btohqsg
You've only got 958.1 and 958.2s and the new cayennes,btohqsg
sometimes NS u nid drive lorry right,btohqsg
bro this chat is supposed to be car gc related for car fans tgt  but what happened? yall fking dk talk abt some fking bowling then bash on each other like dogs then keep sending fking NSFW   im literally looking thru the recent actions rn and holy fucking shit i dont know where to start.,btohqsg
That counts as learning for your license,btohqsg
You are literally doing a driving course during NS that way,btohqsg
And if you clock XYZ hours,btohqsg
Pls go do the als ice bucket challenge to chill out,btohqsg
But if taking motorcycle and car and lorry  effective way is 2B  3  2A  4  2  5,btohqsg
look at the recent actions bro this chat is doomed üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Cus between 2B  2A and 2 got 1 yr probation each,btohqsg
@k4gesi think u should take a sleep,btohqsg
Jus need to look past it,btohqsg

im gna jst make a sandwich and go sleep,btohqsg
speaking of f1  anyone going the new grandstands this year,btohqsg
Taking it yourself is different. He was referring to those on driver vocation for the lorry license.,btohqsg
FINAL REMINDER ! DON'T ABUSE THE REPORT COMMAND,btohqsg

i think u shld let it go,btohqsg
I think above 160cm alr difficult,btohqsg
In the most  unique green u‚Äôll ever see,btohqsg
Unique until not on official merc website,btohqsg
Because the SL is only AMG....,btohqsg
So you're not gonna share your mom's supposed SL?,btohqsg
It's a GT car positioned more towards being sporty,btohqsg
Essentially a 1290 super duke r,btohqsg
Would be nice to see it tho,btohqsg
Ok  so still imaginary because SLs of this generation are only AMG,btohqsg
bro u can‚Äôt expect a 1.3k grp chat to be all silent,btohqsg
this isn‚Äôt ur pri sch chat,btohqsg
js let ppl talk and chat,btohqsg
bring back/unmute those u did jn,btohqsg
"Then why'd you say she has ""non AMG""",btohqsg
Fun factBicycles are slower than cars,btohqsg
bro i muted cos he was harassing other people   i don‚Äôt know about you but even if its not a ‚Äúpri scch groupchat‚Äù shldnt be like that?,btohqsg
because he was harassing others to the furthest extent,btohqsg
sending NSFW doesnt work out too kan,btohqsg
this chat alr got so many kids not even a car chat,btohqsg
u might as well let them talk,btohqsg
u restrict like macam pri sch chat,btohqsg
u can‚Äôt have it all bro,btohqsg
Nah jk it was me sorry,btohqsg
what to do mah? i know i cannot handle all lah but yall shd know to have basic chat decency what,btohqsg
joke is joke can   but limit it to somrwhere else la,btohqsg
u don‚Äôt have to handle it,btohqsg
u are expecting the control of a small class chat within a setting of 1.3k ppl,btohqsg
im not expecting like that  but like i said its common sense not to send NSFW or say stuff completely unrelated to the chatroom no? you yourself say alr that the place here alr not becoming like car gc so i was trying to limit it a little,btohqsg
ok no real car chats have talk,btohqsg
i banned literally no one  i just muted temporarily because OUT OF CONTEXT it seems wrong alr   since its kids would you really want to expose them to this kinda shit? yes i know eventually theyll see it but its still good etiquette to keep it out kan,btohqsg
Sir you had no context like you mentioned,btohqsg
But in that case mute everyone who was taking part in the convo,btohqsg
u read thru all 900msgs ah,btohqsg
And speaking about stuff on the same lines,btohqsg
and that ur admins also did the same,btohqsg
ill remove their admin and mute them while im at it. equal punishment right?,btohqsg
Ok now everyone r being kids  the group info said to be civil  so let's be civil minded for the ppl sleeping  so let's all stop this nonsense and go to sleep ffs is 1am,btohqsg
genuinely here  im just following what you guys suggested,btohqsg
Sleeping would be a solid idea,btohqsg
im 17 that's not a kid  that's a young man buddy,btohqsg
But not a complete kid too,btohqsg
Your messages lean more towards this üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i‚Äôll try to keep it civil,btohqsg
i apologise on my behalf if i did anything wrong  and i wont micro manage yall at this rate.,btohqsg
i too apologise for what happened,btohqsg
How does that have anything to do with your messages being childish?,btohqsg
I really love the company in this group  but we got to know our limits  at this point  no more NSFW. We can still bully each other and play bowling  but NSFW is a no no,btohqsg
any come up just use the report command,btohqsg
hope yall understand on my behalf my perspective la  i know it seems very unreasonable but i just felt that i as the main founder of this chat had to take action. i apologise if my behaviours were childish and irrational  and hope you guys can guide me on. though  i also do hope you guys can do be more etiquette focused too despite there being alot of people here  you guys are the ones that are active.,btohqsg
The tomica or the Forza one?,btohqsg
But say real verts are the best,btohqsg
U take the top off she does the same,btohqsg
And srsly we nid to draw line,btohqsg
On wat is nsfw and wats not,btohqsg
