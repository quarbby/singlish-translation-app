One polling station has about 2k+ voters,btohqsg
Each polling station  you can only trace the for and against votes,btohqsg
Nope  you can trace individual   rememeber each card have your particulars and a serial no. It to see what u have voted,btohqsg
They wanna see who vote for who and remember why there is Punggol East and etc   they will merge if the vote is against them   and spilt if they vote they have high vote,btohqsg
Listen to a Liar  Good luck.,btohqsg
Now I know why so many people got trick in scam  so many liars and naïve people.,btohqsg
No. It goes against the rules of election.,btohqsg
When u register at counter  show ic and they search for your name. Your name has an index number and they will issue that vote from the list... so is it traceable?,btohqsg
Lie for what   no need to lie,btohqsg
Just curious  no matter who u voted. Is there a reason why it is a concern even if they electorial team knws who u voted? If u vote for pap  u get extra benefits? Ig u voted for oppo  u will b deprive of benefits??,btohqsg
This is very highly classified info to say... we don’t know if it’s real or not,btohqsg
Most importantly if checking ur identity is breaking law or not  if not  if I’m government I would like to know my supporters as well as non supporters  common sense,btohqsg
U then naive  u see why those election area are being merge and separate again   is for a reason,btohqsg
I dont think voting for pap will give u extra edge in anything. Or voting for oppo will lose any govt benefits. Just think true and go ahead n vote who u think is good.,btohqsg
The election area   if a lot of people vote opp  they will merge the area will more vote for pap to neutralise it out  and if a lot of people vote pop  they will seperate to make it more evenly spread . Just look at Punggol u will know,btohqsg
See HK and other many party country  you will know.,btohqsg
No need to listen to people telling u voting for oppo will get punish or anything. Its not possible.Or u shd also ignore people telling u voting for pap u will personally gain alot benefits.Listen to their rally speech. Whoever is good. Go for him,btohqsg
