U can talk to ev driver,btohqsg
talk to you can liao  but everyone will stan their own car what,btohqsg
it's easy now cos there ain't no many EV now,btohqsg
so...when this becomes a norm  queue up,btohqsg
but i'm not against EV  just thinking of the options currently,btohqsg
To me unless u go Malaysia very often   ev is way better in sg   that my opinion la,btohqsg
To me now I drive ice car I feel that it is very inefficient  slow and troublesome,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve driven to Chiang Rai Mae Saiâ€¦ what problem will we have in Malaysia?Today pagoh fast charger just open up too,btohqsg
Unless you all donâ€™t need to pee every 2-3 hours. Maybe diesel car that can travel 1000km per thank is the best,btohqsg
Pump one time  can reach penang. Without going to toilet,btohqsg
Or Prius hybrid also another amazing car,btohqsg
At Pedas Linggi  I reach with 2% left  12mins it charged near 200km and I proceed to KL.This is provided your car can charge at higher speed.,btohqsg
Thks all... Pardon my ignorance. How long is a charge from like almost zero percent to 100 percent?,btohqsg
It depends on charger. But you donâ€™t focus on charging once youâ€™re driving EV.You focus on what to do during charging. Do more things while charging.,btohqsg
And it depends on car. EV do not need to be full,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve driving more than 200k KM mileage in EV for past 3.5-4 years,btohqsg
Oh I see. So it's like parking your car at the charging station and run errands when car is being charged?,btohqsg
And if you talk about battery degradation. Unless you drive as much as taxi lah. If not donâ€™t talk about battery degradation.Above video shows 700+k KM taxi in China.,btohqsg
Usually is monkey say monkey listen.Dont ev let other ppl guinea pig first.Ev battery ez spoil  and ex.,btohqsg
Prove what? Prove of monkey or what,btohqsg
These usually happen at CNY meeting among family members,btohqsg
My Kona did had a battery recall  thatâ€™s due manufacturer issue.,btohqsg
And after change till now itâ€™s fine,btohqsg
Itâ€™s as though normal engine car doesnâ€™t have engine and gearbox issue?,btohqsg
The people telling others to change EV are driving EVs  I don't care for EVs because I rather have fun,btohqsg
When ICEs go extinct I have all the time to go EV,btohqsg
But before ev  90% of them also drove ice.,btohqsg
Surely there is a pro into going ev. Its just matter of when,btohqsg
Cant 100% say ev no fun althought there is lack of aural and raw pleasure,btohqsg
as long as it doesn't remind me of field camp,btohqsg
To me  70% of the time i enjoy driving ice. But 30% of the time sometimes i wished i bought an ev,btohqsg
I agree. I do like petrol but manual now,btohqsg
I dont think it would be that quiet on the inside  certainly not much quieter than regular ice on the outside,btohqsg
normal cars same as EV  i've sat in tesla,btohqsg
but you cannot replace the sound in a tuner car,btohqsg
Yes  the dream would be a petrol manual and a daily ev,btohqsg
Yes u cant. Thats why im also trying to preserve or keep my ice for as long a possible,btohqsg
buy tesla and install maxhaust maybe,btohqsg
Dual clutch petrol and manual petrol sounds best,btohqsg
But im sure thats a good reason why ev drivers ask people change ev too,btohqsg
Only thing with daily drive  I think EV is nice,btohqsg
Could be even lower if the road tax structure is changed,btohqsg
Just like many supercar owners bought EV as daily drive now.,btohqsg
Weekend they enjoy supercar. Weekday they enjoy EV.,btohqsg
But for me I donâ€™t have deep pocket. I can only have my Kona,btohqsg
Even a kona can outgun a regular ice at the traffic light,btohqsg
I dotn even dare move off first if got ev next to me,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ canâ€™t say the same beyond that though,btohqsg
but m3p insane la i think sub 4 to 100,btohqsg
dragy leaderboard got all these aliens now ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
