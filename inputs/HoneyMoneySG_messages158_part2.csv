Yes. Make use of signup bonus if you are new to any of the bank.,btohqsg
Okay what about Prvi Miles? Would it work too?,btohqsg
Yes. If you are new to UOB  get PRVI and pay 2k per month for 2 months. Remember to get Prvi approved first before getting other uob cards.,btohqsg
Icic  maybe my card still new. But able to purchase other things  v weird. Thanks tho!,btohqsg
You using the digital card? You can use it at most merchants except those that do not request for CVV check or something like that. You can read the TnC on OCBC website for the digital card.,btohqsg
Is there foreign currency transaction fee if use CIMB card in Malaysia?Their exchange rate good or not?Or better off just using Trust card,btohqsg
Any reason u choose CIMB card?,btohqsg
use maybank family and friends for 8% rebate,btohqsg
But also subject to foreign currency transaction fee? And the rate not as good ?,btohqsg
Move your spent to dbs wwmc first since citi rewards has longer span up to 5 years.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s very decent with the 8% cb. I use mbff for MYR transactions all the time,btohqsg
hello  can I check if double dipping in Maribank still works?,btohqsg
standard 3.25% fx fee and mastercard exchange rate,btohqsg
R u thinking 8% less 3.25% FX fee  still got 4.75% rebate ?,btohqsg
Yes. How much is your expected spend? MBFF 8% cb is cap at $313 spend. Even if exR is poor also wont move the needle much for smaller spendsâ€¦ no need to be too particular with exR  the cashback would have more than offset,btohqsg
I just got this card and need to spend SGD 1300 to get sgd 200 cashback I'm gg ipoh over the weekend,btohqsg
wouldnt it be better to link to amaze to reduce the fx fees?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check for CIMB CC welcome promo  does buying fairprice vouchers count as qualifying spend?,btohqsg
I got my money from CF. Anyone else?,btohqsg
Wah ya now u mentioned  I notice the cvv I using is for digital haha. Now can le thanks!! ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya I withdraw on Monday. Just got it in my DBS. Heng ah. Lol. Still got like a tiny bit of interest sia,btohqsg
As they mentioned 8 days ?,btohqsg
Hi guys I'm checking UOB PPV or UOB lady card when linked to Disney app for Disney Premier Access at Tokyo Disneysea. Any transactions that goes through can get 4mpd ?,btohqsg
3-10 days. People withdrawing on Monday started to receive today,btohqsg
If mcc is right. Better test before making payment.,btohqsg
Hi can i check when using uob kf. Does paying for seats and airport taxes included in the min $800 spend?,btohqsg
yes if pay SQ or scoot,btohqsg
i have the UOB One card and just curious  if i miss the minimum spend for 1 of the months in my quarter  will that reset my quarters? eg. quarter is jan to mar  missed feb min spend  will my quarter change to mar to may instead? or is it the same? if it is the same will i get pro-rated cashback?will i still get cashback from the additional cashback? even for the month that didnt meet min spend?,btohqsg
No reset  statement quarter is fixed.If you spend below $500 for one statement month  then you have to wait for next statement quarter already.If you spend below $1000 for one statement momth  the remaining months in that statement quarter can just spend $500 to clock that tier cashback.Additional cashback is based on tier also  below $500 for any statement month then no more additional cashback.Exception is first statement quarter  they will pro-rate to the statement months that hit at least $500 if you have one statement month that did not hit $500.,btohqsg
so assuming i usually just spend $500 and in the quarter i miss 1 of the months. i will not get any cashback at all  including additional cashback?so if example my usual is jan to mar and if i miss feb  the quarter will not reset but i will not get any cashback for spending on mar too?is this understanding correct?,btohqsg
same gotten my money back from cf,btohqsg
Yes and you will also not get cashback for Jan.,btohqsg
so basically the whole quarter if i miss 1 month will not any cashback including additional cashback for the whole quarter uh?,btohqsg
damn thats quite punishing hope my transactions gets posted tmr  because i was overseas and didnt spend on this card for abt 2 weeks,btohqsg
Faster than my by 1 sec ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
When was your transaction made? And which merchant?,btohqsg
15th but my transactions over the past weekend up to today not posted yetðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
I have not. Applied on 10 Mar.,btohqsg
Wait awhile bah. I just gonna keep using cf. Just as a spending acc instead of saving,btohqsg
from sunday till today still not posted  merchants are all eligible de i check alr. most of my spending on this card are eligible just have 1or 2 that i used wrong card,btohqsg
Are you in SG now  and do you have access to 7-11 or cold storage or giant nearby?,btohqsg
Not about eligible spend. What merchant?,btohqsg
if posted until ystd will be enough alr,btohqsg
yes now in SG i just spent $20 at 7-11 which if its posted by tmr will be enough alr,btohqsg
This is with or without the transactions from Sunday?,btohqsg
why specifically these 3 merchants? they get posted faster?,btohqsg
i am literally just abt $10 short after adding all the eligible spend that are alr posted,btohqsg
They usually post same day. Not all but some  especially those that are non 24/7  cuz they will do closing on that day.,btohqsg
Then you might be in time with the $20 spent at 7-11. Tomorrow you can check the app to see if posted.,btohqsg
oh icic  does it matter what time the transaction is made? or whenever they do their closing it will get posted alr?,btohqsg
