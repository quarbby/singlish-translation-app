As best as they can  they really want to reduce wastage,btohqsg
It is actually something they want to do,btohqsg
And then comparing to having a 50% loss and a 100% loss  they would rather take the 50% loss,btohqsg
I rmbr only in Japan saying the true part of Japan is in the countryside,btohqsg
But city life looks way more happening than Singapore,btohqsg
But because there are way more tourists here now,btohqsg
Japan life hor very simple one,btohqsg
Its cafe hopping  karaoke  watching movies,btohqsg
Ah I see. I wish it were a more common practice here  but I can also see why some stalls don’t want to adopt this practice. It might appear to devalue their food and some people may prefer to just hold out and buy at a cheaper price instead of buying at the regular price,btohqsg
The arcades also seem very fun,btohqsg
Actually it also depends on the shelf life,btohqsg
Let say the stuff is going to expire in today's time,btohqsg
So probably there will be discount there to encourage people buying the stuff so they can clear the stock,btohqsg
Yeah those perishables that only last one day most likely they will just give the discounts right before closing,btohqsg
Singapore actually has that practice ngl,btohqsg
In Singapore at least we have one thing which Japan doesn’t have which is Treatsure,btohqsg
Just that they are on some other sections,btohqsg
Like if its going to expire bread,btohqsg
You won't see it in the bread section,btohqsg
It appears in one small corner,btohqsg
Plus Japan has way more perishables,btohqsg
Like you buy today expire today type,btohqsg
So you tend to see way more of such discounts compared to in SG,btohqsg
So its not like you don't see it,btohqsg
And some more it’s from some random supermarket bakery,btohqsg
Japan stuff feels more high quality in general,btohqsg
It is more of such perishables won't be very common anyway,btohqsg
dont they focus high emphasis on keeping things neat or clean,btohqsg
Also sandwiches in Japan are crazy,btohqsg
I find all sorts of random stuff in there,btohqsg
Who tf can't read a course outline lmao,btohqsg
Yea lor Japan supermarkets also have more sandwich compared to at Singapore,btohqsg
There’s one with custard pudding  another one with orange,btohqsg
I wish we have such variety,btohqsg
finding a dirty vehicle is near impossible in japan..in sg  you just spent 5 mins and you see a 100k bmw with road dust,btohqsg
Actually there are dirty places in Japan as well,btohqsg
You all just never go to such places,btohqsg
Yeah I guess so but I feel like Japanese take pride in their profession and what they do,btohqsg
A lot of people also thought Singapore is clean,btohqsg
Bruh moment I just had an announcement from one of mods saying pls submit in the submission folder,btohqsg
You go to other places in Singapore also can be dirty,btohqsg
Bruh moment apparently some ppl dk how to do that in NTUlearn,btohqsg
I mean I guess every country has their own dirty places but I just don’t know where to find in Japan,btohqsg
Actually every time I go to Shibuya,btohqsg
other country borrow money from sg then cannot pay back so we import trash to their country,btohqsg
In Tokyo can you find them?,btohqsg
The sewage smell is super bad,btohqsg
The floor is made of floor,btohqsg
but in southeast asia and certain european countries..yea,btohqsg
I also miss my go go curry,btohqsg
