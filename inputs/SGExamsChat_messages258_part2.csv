text,group
then at the end of ur presentation you entertain questions from ur classmates and lecturers,btohqsg
Oh yeah btw if just asking if u get 3.78 this sem right for example  do u have chance to get Director list,btohqsg
also people are incentivised to ask questions in order to earn their daily participation grade,btohqsg
Them go home do rj right,btohqsg
director list is usually for top 10% of the cohort,btohqsg
My friend say a lot of ppl get C grade bro,btohqsg
usually most people do RJ straight away on the spot,btohqsg
HAHA i go count lor if 1 C+ the rest i can get A,btohqsg
cus we dowan to go home and worry about it,btohqsg
reflecting on what you learnt in the lesson,btohqsg
I saw some memes abt rp. Where ppl get C grades all day ah,btohqsg
So is C grade rly that common,btohqsg
for all u know the top 10% in ur cohort could be very zai,btohqsg
HiI'm a RP studentSo  for RJ  it depends on what question the lecturer will give youSometimes lecturers will ask you about your lifeSometimes they will ask you to critique the other teams regarding the presentationSometimes they will ask you to solve a problem,btohqsg
then u wont make it to director list,btohqsg
"anyway  after everyone has presented  the lecturer will present their ""6P"" which is called the 6th presentation  since there are usually 5 groups in each class",btohqsg
they usually preface their 6P by saying that this is not the perfect answer for the problem statement  but it's a good solution for the problem,btohqsg
Ah i see so thats what 6P is,btohqsg
but usually everyone takes the 6P as the right answer,btohqsg
since it's the module chair who came up with it,btohqsg
and the module chair is gonna be the one making the exam,btohqsg
Daily grade make up how many %,btohqsg
6P will later be made downloadable for everyone in .PPT or .PDF,btohqsg
here's the best part about RP,btohqsg
which means all the 6P you've downloaded can be referred to during the examination,btohqsg
But if cannot apply concepts toh,btohqsg
and answers can be copy pasted / rephrased,btohqsg
Open bk come and kill only,btohqsg
the best part is that most of the questions test on giving correct answers,btohqsg
only a few test on applying concepts,btohqsg
Uk our open bk slides are those  thick science journal,btohqsg
so your 6P is very powerful,btohqsg
"This is for PBL lessons (Problem-Based Learning)There's another type of lesson called ""IS"" (Interactive Seminar)This lesson is quite relaxing as usually no problem statement for the students to solve. Just listen to lecturer's explanation. However  sometimes the students are required to participate for trying some questions that are inside the notes to get the grade for participating",btohqsg
Then prof throw u 100 pages and lecture notes,btohqsg
ahhh okay i still in upper sec :),btohqsg
they keep changing the weightage arnd tho,btohqsg
daily grade favours the more talkative kinda people,btohqsg
Oh yeah do yall think that lecturer's opinion abt ur sch work is vv impt,btohqsg
It dependsIf there are both MSA and ESE  daily grades is 40% and exams is 60% (where MSA is 40% and ESE is 60%)If there's only ESE or graded assignment  daily grades is 60% and ESE is 40%,btohqsg
I feel that my confidence mostly come from there cause i lack confidence sometimes ah,btohqsg
since the exam is done on ur laptop  you can compile all the 6Ps into 1 slide. When a question comes up with a certain keyword  you can ctrl+f on ur PPT and find the exact chapter talking about it and extract the correct answer,btohqsg
in the case of my diploma Game Design  we have a lot of that,btohqsg
Wah if the game is good yall can market it,btohqsg
WahGood for youI also want ehðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
work in a team over the course for a few weeks and submit the game to LEO 2.0,btohqsg
For ppl doing ur course yall need those high end laptops right,btohqsg
then they grade based on how u apply the theory in the game and your work process,btohqsg
the games we make aren't that big to require so much processing power hahaha,btohqsg
although slow laptops will annoy u ah,btohqsg
in the case of graded assignments  yes,btohqsg
