open book doesnâ€™t mean it will be easy,btohqsg

yes it is  the QA sheet is behind your paper,btohqsg
however  teachers generally advise students to sort of â€˜memoriseâ€™ bcz trust me you wonâ€™t have enuf time flipping back and forth,btohqsg
you can actually practise practical without doing it,btohqsg
bruh if only I didnâ€™t throw my practical book,btohqsg
Don't need memorize the cations & anions with Naoh etc? The observations results?,btohqsg

fml time to dig out my chem brain,btohqsg
wah brain lag alr shouldnâ€™t have thrown away my notes ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥² i want to teach comb chem freelance js 1/2 students but,btohqsg
do you have the practical book?,btohqsg
okay letâ€™s just say  you must memorise your acid and basesso letâ€™s say they sayadd hcl to calcium carbonateso u identify  hcl is the acid   calcium carbonate is a base (a metal carbonate to be specific)hence when acid + metal carbonate reacts what do you get ?the salt itself  co2 and water.so your product will be calcium chloride  co2 and water.but in practical  you can just identify what you observe. eg. effervescence observed which is the bubbles you see when it produces gas which would be co2 in this case (I think  send help neko ),btohqsg
and you see i did all these without even adding the substances itself. so it is possible,btohqsg
r u doing pure or combined?,btohqsg
not sure if this is the one in line with your syllabus but should be ba,btohqsg
if uw  you can purchase an extra book in case ur sch uses it in class,btohqsg
in my case  my sch barely touched on it so i just self practised with this,btohqsg
however i donâ€™t suggest practising it until prolly 1 month before the real exam,btohqsg

The circle of life. Now kill that bird to show them that humans are the top of the pyramid,btohqsg
shld be the other way round cuz you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain,btohqsg
There's no need to be hero in the JC system all of them are losers no matter what,btohqsg
