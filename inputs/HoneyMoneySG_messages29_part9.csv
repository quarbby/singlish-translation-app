at counter only get 4mpd for those shopping MCC. Online get 4mpd so long MCC not excluded.If citi rewards mastercard  can link to Amaze  use Amaze card to convert everything to online and get 4mpd so long MCC not excluded,btohqsg
Do anyone knows which hospital accept amex payment? Jus visited tan tock seng hospital and payment cannot use amex. Was so upset,btohqsg
So is the only way to hit for others category is through spending with physical card in store?,btohqsg
Healthhub don't accept my amex payment,btohqsg
or those uob$ merchants. Anywhere no need to bother so much just for $0.30,btohqsg
can get 4mpd on dbs wwmc  citi rewards  5-8% on uob evo  citi smrt  dbs livefresh,btohqsg
Citi rewards exclude hospital bills bah,btohqsg
hospital mcc 8062 and healthhub mcc 8099 not excluded from 4mpd for online spend. Can use Amaze+citi rewards mastercard at the hospital or citi rewards via/master on healthhub,btohqsg
Noted  just wondering how to hit the $100 max spend for others only cos it’s my first few days,btohqsg
Sorry for late reply  it’s only applicable for grab food vouchers and order in Malaysia.,btohqsg
You can pay by anything any way so long as it earns at least the basic 0.3% cashback. As long as it’s at least 250 by Google Pay or something (mobile contactless) and 250 online  you get $40 cashback plus a wee bit,btohqsg
Thanks! But it's min spend $600 right? Would you be able to get $40 cashback even if its only $500 total?,btohqsg
Unable to apply using singpass  only apply without,btohqsg
No. You need to spend 600.,btohqsg
So only without amaze then entitle 10x reward points,btohqsg
So essentially  could I just say 300 mobile contactless 300 online to get max cashback?,btohqsg
If apply for HSBC Revolution now and couldn't get approval by tomorrow promotion end date  will I still be qualify for the prize?,btohqsg
Yes  this is one of the way,btohqsg
"so am i right to say there is technically no specific ""others"" category  would the transactions auto count as others once you've hit 250 for each category  despite using contactless/online transaction for the remaining 100?",btohqsg
250 mobile contactless250 online100 anything that earns 0.3%,btohqsg
This is one of the way to interpret it but it is actually more broad than that. Eg. if you use your card to pay utility bills like Internet bill  which is not online or contactless  it would still count towards the 600.,btohqsg
thanks for helping to clarify! are you able to see which transactions count under each category on the UOB TMRW app? feels like i may encounter a scenario where i've hit the $600 spend but still won't qualify for the cashback  or would need to spend above to ensure it hits,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I use liquid pay and ShopBack  and pair it with hsbc revolution card . Do I earn 4 miles per dollar ?,btohqsg
I assume yes? Since it’s an online payment ?,btohqsg
yes if the MCC is under the whitelist for 10x points in the TnC,btohqsg
Is the Kris plus + feb 2023 spend n win coming back ? Or did I just forget to spin the wheel in jan ?,btohqsg
Any existing HSBC customers managed to open EGA recently  how long was your processing time ah,btohqsg

maybe i should go down branch and try again tmr last attempt lol,btohqsg
Does the debit card takes a while to be delivered for hsbc ega?,btohqsg
Did you manage to get a answer from someone?,btohqsg
Are there anyway to still earn while paying off citibank CC monthly statement bill?,btohqsg
I thought the promo is based on when the application was submitted,btohqsg
You have to check the UOB evol tnc and see which MCC is excluded. Except for those usual transactions eg. hospital/insurance/quasi-cash transactions  I believe most transactions would qualify as part of the 600 dollars minimum spend. The UOB tmrw app will not track the qualifying spend. You would have to call customer service to verify the mcc of each transaction,btohqsg
i meant the saving interest promo. need to sms by 31st January to lock in 4%+,btohqsg
