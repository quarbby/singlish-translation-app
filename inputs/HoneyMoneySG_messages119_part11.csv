Yeah... My current cat is on dining,btohqsg
Why not wait for OP to share more on the product before jumping to conclusions?In any case  Capital guaranteed here does not refer to SDIC. It‚Äôs just another way of saying premature surrendering the policy will result in principal loss  which is typically the case for endowments.Also to add  endowments are actually covered by SDIC under Policy Owners‚Äô Protection Scheme. Though obviously if one is putting in $300k it won‚Äôt be fully covered due to the PPS cap.,btohqsg
You can double check using uob chat assist function.,btohqsg
Does any know what's the MCC for Shell or Petronas fuel station in JB?,btohqsg
Searched the chat it seems that if paired CC with Amaze  need to tap at the counter instead of petrol kiosk?,btohqsg
Amaze not working at kiosk  need pay at the counter,btohqsg
Tell staff you want to pump first  after pump finish  go in counter pay 1 shot.I kenna BBQ few times because I use the kiosk. Will regret it. Amaze charged me 10%+ instead of 2%+.,btohqsg
Will vomit blood and die on the spot.My friend who paid $2k+ hotel also kenna. And no way amaze will recognise why it happened. üòÇSuay lo. Lucky mine is pump petrol for motorbike ü§£Wanted to find out what happened but no way amaze gonna tell.Don‚Äôt use at kiosk insert card  die die pay at the counter inside so there is no reversal or refund.Oh amaze a lot effort  called me 10-20times to ask me close case and explain from their script for 10-20times. Just totally avoided my question why 10% ü§Øü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Question :Got Amex krisflyer Classic ( Blue) and I applied for Egiro with HSBC EGA   got an SMS confirming the addition of Amex to Giro into HSBC  I have a bill for 12th July  how I ll know it will be deducted by Giro ? The Bill doesn't say anything a part from the date of paying,btohqsg
dun use apple pay in-app  it is excluded from 10x points on crmc. Likely considered online if use crmc directly on the restaurant app,btohqsg
if bill dun indicated payment via giro  then start next statement,btohqsg
hi  pls can someone explain to me how HSBC ega works? there‚Äôs a promo now that offers bonus 3.55% on the incremental ADB  so for a new acct my month of July will earn total 3.60%  but then in Aug the EIR on whole sum will be less alr right?,btohqsg
For me. I submitted to DBS.1 letter to inform they have initiated the process of giro.1 more letter later on to confirm that giro is in effect & accepted.,btohqsg
also  without the promo  what int rates does ega give?,btohqsg
That makes zero sense. All they gave were boilerplate replies.Probably too late for you Feb24 case  but if it ever happens again  use the rates shown in Mastercard FX calculator to dispute them.,btohqsg
They just said at that moment  it‚Äôs the best rates. And said they are the best in market. And keep repeating.,btohqsg
And when I complaint to my friends. A few of them swear to never use amaze lol üòÇMine was quite small issue. But theirs was much much bigger issue and cannot solve it.Yes I‚Äôm still using amaze  but very careful.,btohqsg
Hmmm. My personal experience with Amaze usage is ok so far  though I agree their customer service is CMI most of the time üòÖ,btohqsg
I pray everything smooth smooth only. Lucky no more big transactions with amaze liao after lady card got nerf.,btohqsg
Yup  main use case for me is local spend on CRMC üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes for adding DBS altitude into HSBC I got the letter from DBS  but for AMEX I got only SMS   but I often chose full bill   I see that they show min 50 dollar so maybe it is not added into HSBC   although the SMS confirm that,btohqsg
Update  amaze can link back to UOB masters  working now,btohqsg
Hi guys does anyone know what‚Äôs the difference in the 5XUNI$ and the UNI$? Dining is my selected category for the UOB Lady‚Äôs card.I realised that most months I just get the normal UNI$ but some months have the 5XUNI$,btohqsg
Best card to book flights worth $3000 ?,btohqsg
Had signed up for the chocolate finance waitlist 2 days ago. Anyone received the referral code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
[Assuming you are new-to-bank]$3000 qualifies you for the signup bonuses for:1) DBS Altitude (Visa or AMEX)2) SCB Journey Visa3) UOB Krisflyer Mastercard (first 100 each calendar month)$3000 on SQ/Scoot is best spent on UOB Krisflyer Mastercard.,btohqsg
This is the old 6mpd of uob lady. Now you should only see one entry at the beginning of the month. And 1 more on 27th if you have lady saving acct.,btohqsg
Yes  signed up via the link. But was indicated that the offer is via invitation only. Subsequently was directed to join a waitlist.,btohqsg
Ya since u mention it i think i got saw it once also when i spend in malaysia for small amt,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone knows if my UOB lady‚Äôs solitaire CC category is dining.And I do a ShopBack linked with UOB lady‚Äôs solitaire payment and I do the scan in a restaurant.Do I get to earn the MPD for that category?,btohqsg
Planning to apply for UOB PRV to start with   any preference between Visa or Master card ? Maybe the latter can be paired with Amaze ( I guess for FX optimisation  not sure about offline to online Transaction conversion)   what u guys recommend ?,btohqsg
yes i think so..it is tracked for mine,btohqsg
Visa is preferred. Keep amaze for your 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
they gave me a lump sum  so unsure about this :(,btohqsg
WAO? The bonus is credited immediately?,btohqsg
Only specific airline thru expedia get 6 mpd thru the special landing page right,btohqsg
What card to use for overseas spend in Europe?,btohqsg
Hi anyone tried withdraw USD from Moomoo to DBS multi currency account? Is there any charges? As I‚Äôm planned to shift the money to Webull,btohqsg
Hi  i am trying to play the miles games  since now EVOL and One account is nerfed.Is OCBC rewards + amaze with OCBC 360 account a better alternative? Or any other suggestions feel free to share too. sorry for noob questions üòÖ,btohqsg
Ocbc rewards is worse to clock the spend thou. Have you checked this video?https://youtu.be/jJSYE4lPIGM,btohqsg
Thanks I will check it out,btohqsg
Unlikely to be endowment. More like structured deposits  which is an more like an investment plan. 100% not covered by SDIC.,btohqsg
What gave u the impression that this is a structured deposit?,btohqsg
Does CIMB offer short term endowments?,btohqsg
Bancassurance is quite common i.e. banks using its sales channel to sell policies for insurance firms that it partners with. I recall CIMB promoted Singlife endowments previously. Not sure if it still does.Again  I'm curious why so many felt it's a structured deposit rather than an endowment.,btohqsg
Maybe you are right. Sounds like Singlife Flexi Life Income II. Bit like Endowment/Annuity plan  and there are others who received similar calls/texts from CIMB.Which will 100% be covered be SDIC.,btohqsg
"I'm pretty new hereI paid USD 25.50 with amaze linked to credit card  and the charge on my  credit card is sgd35.36Is this exchange rate ""reasonable""?",btohqsg
It is subjective. First you need to calculate the spread between your transaction's rate and the spot rate. Then you use the spread to minus against the rewards you earn from you credit card. If you end up with a positive return  there ya go,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the transaction date? Typically Amaze should be around Mastercard FX rate + 1.9%.,btohqsg
