any way to set the amaze tracking period same as the crmc statement period? currently its track via whole month whereas crmc its via the statement e.g. 17 jun - 17 jul,btohqsg
Why not the other way round?,btohqsg
any idea how to do it for citi?,btohqsg
didnt know it can be done  will try and update here :),btohqsg
Uob card replace before and they will send a letter that they will put the same giro arrangement on the replacement card but it will take time. I think citi just put reset giro on the replacement card as well when mine got replace,btohqsg
Anyone encounter problems adding this card to simplygo to view trip details?,btohqsg
Would anyone here recommend OCBC rewards card?,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSG Hi gurus I recently noticed that one of comments from YouTube video mentions as below:‚ÄúThe catch for CPF SA Cash Top Up is untouchable at all. Eg. If u top 20k and reached 230k and say u reach 55yo now  with FRS of 200k  u can only allow to withdraw 10k.The 20k + the interest it compounded over the yrs are locked and is not considered part of FRS. Do think twice again or check thoroughly with CPF. I-only discovered it is not part of FRS at 55yo.‚ÄùNot sure if above mentioned comment is true ?May any Gurus here can clarify on it ?Thanks üôè,btohqsg
True  my dad enquired about this. Need to hit FRS less the accrued interest generated  meaning the base amount need to hit then can withdraw,btohqsg
Omg! Top up money + accrued interest are not consider part of FRS sum ?,btohqsg
The interest generated is not part of FRS sum to withdraw  top-up is ok,btohqsg
Someone can double check and confirm if possible?,btohqsg
How do we know how much is the base of our account currently ?,btohqsg
Untouchable as in reserved amount is not investable  doesn't mean it cannot be withdrawn. I've talked about it herehttps://youtu.be/LFw5xsHcdkU?si=lo3GciaIAq7nvFI5,btohqsg
last year 6k members  now 16k. nice,btohqsg
Refer to this post  i'll make a review of HSBC Live+ soonhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/211158,btohqsg
good days when cpf shielding was still a thing. now is just a distant memory,btohqsg
with the hsbc nerfing  whats the best fuss free miles credit card?,btohqsg
"I think the part on ""RSTU and its top-ups don't count"" is referring to this:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/187150Based on the commenter's 200k in mandatory contributions (and its interests)  he can definitely withdraw 20% from RA (see above link).Your RSTU and its interest will 100% be part of FRS  and it will 100% be used first to form your RA (unless you managed to do RSTU amounts above FRS  which is not possible since the cap for top-up to SA is FRS  including existing monies from mandatory contributions).Whether how much is withdrawable afterwards is a totally different conversation.The commenter has absolutely no idea what he's talking about.",btohqsg
Ok... Probably the 5th person sending this already..,btohqsg
Just to confirm ocbc infinty and n90 can use to pay zym right ? I can't find it in their tnc,btohqsg

Hi there  quick check does online payment qualify as eligible spend for HSBC T1 card? Any exceptions? Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm been using Citi+amaze as my main spending card and if I spent over 1K  I use HSBC revolution as a backup.Im planing not to use revolution card. Should I change to UOB platinum visa or Citi premier miles?,btohqsg
UOB Preferred Platinum Visa and Citi Premiere Miles are 2 very different card.  One is 4mpd on contactless while the other one is 1.2mpd  general spending card.,btohqsg
Unable to advise on card as your qn is too generic. So many considerations. Eg. Card for what kind of spending etc ?,btohqsg
Which online payment? Cardup n ipaymy cant be used for hsbc t1 btw,btohqsg
For me  i using dbs wwmc for all online spending and the rest crcm + amaze.My spending abt 1.5-2k p/m. So i kinda of plan it. Usually use crcm til it reaches 700. Then i switch all online spending to dbs wwmc.,btohqsg
Do u use contactless alot? If yes  uob ppv is a good card to consider.,btohqsg
icic cause i realised amaze 1k limit refresh every 1st of the month but my crmc refresh every mid of the month,btohqsg
I have used ocbc Frank  dbs livefresh to buy taobao but only HSBC revolution charges DCC. Any ideas? Can this be waived?,btohqsg
Cant be waive  it just mean the payment is process overseas,btohqsg
OCBC Frank and DBS Live Fresh probably incorporated the fees in the final charge. You shouldn't pay FX directly using these cards anyway.,btohqsg
For taobao there‚Äôs no way to pay in other ccy now  only can pay in SGD  and the amount shown is the same as deducted on ocbc/dbs (no extra DCC)  dono why is it different for HSBC‚Ä¶,btohqsg
The company might have process different bank cc differently  i got charge for dcc for agoda on citi but not dbs,btohqsg
hi does anyone know which card is the best card for cashback/miles or any sort of benefit when it comes to paying for google play services?Like in-app purchases in mobile games. Currently I am just using Citi premier or UOB EVOL card.,btohqsg
