3 Simple Mother's Day Ideas: Dine Out   Spa and Earn 5% cashback*!URL:https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/article/view/rcms270806Hi  anyone has experience with the FX spread for FSMone debit card? Card is issued by Nium (which also issues the Amaze card). There is current promotion for 5% cashback on local and overseas dining and spa  which I may consider to use for upcoming trip. But cashback promo is limited to first 200 customers and capped at $40.,btohqsg
If you have Amaze card  you could use Amaze card linked to Citibank Cashback Master.Get 1% Amaze cashback + 6% Citibank cashback. No need to worry about first XX customers.,btohqsg
Nium is the issuer for both Amaze and FSMone debit card. I haven't used the latter  but I would expect similar about 2.5% markup from Interbank FX rates.,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion. The thing with Amaze is that 2000 pts need to be accumulated before withdrawal. And the pts have expiry.,btohqsg
what my household typically does is treat the 1% Amaze cashback as a bonus. Only go for the linked credit card benefit as the definite.,btohqsg
For cashback card  again thereâ€™s a min spend of $800,btohqsg
good morning  may I know UOB one card quaterly rebate calculated by calendar month or statement month?Because my uob cycle from every 2nd date by month  CSO said they can not set to every 1st date by month,btohqsg

Unfortunately my main spending card is DBS Live Fresh,btohqsg

Hi topic up for debate:Is it better to top up cpf SA or top up srs and from there buy retireready single premium from manulife (IRR for retireready is projected non guaranteed 2.6%-3.7%) thanks!,btohqsg
CPF SA will guarantee 4% p.a. but you cannot withdraw funds until 55. SRS you can withdraw before 55 at a 5% penalty + taxable income,btohqsg
Do I wait until I get an sms from them then transfer money in and do 5 FAST transfer?,btohqsg
i would have thought the first topic should be... should a person buy Manulife Single Premium policy..,btohqsg
The min amt for single premium is $25k. Srs can be topped up over 2yrs to save up this amt to convert to Retireready single premium. Whereas cpf SA can also be topped up over 3+yrs to reach this amt while generating 4%,btohqsg
Personally (assuming all other finances are taken care of)  would be to top up SA to earn that stable 4% without incurring any additional fees  which is already higher than the non projected rate. For SRS  you will incur transaction/commission fees on top of fund fees,btohqsg
Hey folks  can I ask whether anyone here has personal experience using Trust Bank Card in Japan? Aware that no fees charged by Trust Bank. I wish to know how much fees are charged by the 'ATM provider' ðŸ˜ŠI used YouTrip card at 7 Eleven ATM in 2019. I remembered there was a S$5 charge per use.Thanks!,btohqsg
Key word - â€œ non guaranteed â€œ,btohqsg
The experience of ATM withdrawal overseas is touch and go in my opinion.Even Revolut always says there is no cash withdrawal fee if you withdraw at one of the ATMs listed in their app. I personally kept trying to find a supported ATM based on their map app in-app and could never find one in Japan that is near enough to me even though I was staring at a 7/11 ATM in my face.Basically I won't try it unless I'm desperate for cash while in Japan. Don't plan it such that you 'have to' withdraw cash in Japan. They are actually very card friendly except for street food and the smaller restaurants who only accept cash.,btohqsg
Thanks  Mt for your suggestion. Fully agree. Card remains the priority mode for spending. However  rural places (such as a ramen store in a street in Hokkaido) may have challenges accepting cards.Hope to hear from the folks with personal experience :),btohqsg
Itâ€™s w different thing.The 5 in 5 out is for 1% extraThis sms is for the 5.5% interest,btohqsg
I believe the fee imposed by ATM bank varies from bank to bank. Likewise the withdrawal limit applying to overseas issued cards when using ATM in Japan. I did that last year in Tokyo using YouTrip. found that fee from banks and limit differ. YouTrip will charge SGD5 equivalent from your JPY wallet. So I'll always withdraw the maximum allowed by the ATM,btohqsg
do they state the maximum allowed by the ATM before you press PROCEED?,btohqsg
As in u can just send the 5 in 5 out if u want to use it for the 1% Cashback for your credit cards,btohqsg
Thanks!! Exerpt from YouTrip FAQ. Unclear whether $5 is charged by ATM or YouTrip though.Any folks have withdrawn Â¥ in Japan using Revolut or Trust Bank  can share ?,btohqsg
is it worth paying education fees/condo rental with citi payall? and which is the best card to do so?,btohqsg
Yes. The one I tried in a 7 Eleven had 2x withdrawal limit compared to a ATM in a big local Japanese bank branch. so I suggest you try those in conbini first,btohqsg
5 bucks is definitely earned by YouTrip. Japan ATM is probably less than 200 Yen or even 150. Can't remember,btohqsg
i wanted to test a 7/11 ATM using revolut but it wasn't identified in the Revolut App to be a fee free ATM.. so i chickened out and didn't do it. Afterall I didn't need the cash  just want to 'know for fun;.,btohqsg
Hi Alan  I signed up online  my acc are 12 numbers  how come this 9 numbers,btohqsg

Just send the first 9 digits?Mine is also 12 digits,btohqsg
