Hi all  it seems like BOC smartsaver is not talked about as much compared to uob one and ocbc 360 or even hsbc EGA. Just wondering any reasons since interest seems to be higher for BOC?,btohqsg
Mind sharing what is the effective interest pa for boc smart saver?,btohqsg
How do you hit 4.6% pa for 100k? I saw a few conditions sal  cc spend  insurance  etc.,btohqsg
Ocbc is 4.65% pa and easy to hit,btohqsg
For amount above 100k   is the interest per month gonna increase exponentially?,btohqsg
I find BOC easier to hit. But only 4.3% if u spend 500 on cc. 4.6 only if u spend 1.5k on cc,btohqsg
For ocbc 360  what is the most brainless way to monitor the save bonus? The increase 500 per month,btohqsg
"This part concerns me.â€¢ Salary editing bonus is applicable to the first S$100 000 of your MCS account balance only.â€¢ Only genuine employment salaries credited via GIRO with transaction descriptions ""IBG-SALA"" or ""SALA"" printed on the monthly statement within the calendar month are eligible. (Please refer to Terms and Conditions Governing BOC SmartSaver for more information.)â€¢ If there are multiple salary credits within the month  the total amount will be combined to be considered for the bonus interest.â€¢ Salary crediting via inter-bank GIRO usually takes up to 1-3 working days. Eligible salary credited will be based on the actual posting date.â€¢ To arrange your MCS account as you salary crediting account  you will need to provide the following to your HR department: 1) Last 11 digits of your MCS account number 2) Bank SWIFT code (BKCHSGSGXXX) 3) Bank code (7083) 4) Branch code (011)â€¢ You can also use our template""Instruction Form for Salary Crediting""for your submission to your HR department.",btohqsg

Hi all  im started using ocbc infinity cc in july. As of today  i have received 2 statements - July and Aug. I havent receive the 1.6% cashback on my cc spendings but i have received spend bonus for the 360 account tho. When should i be receiving the cashback? Cos i read that the cashback will be credited in the following month,btohqsg
cashback is used to offset your following month card statement  not credited to your 360 account if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re implying,btohqsg
I wasnt referring to my 360 account. I checked my cc statement  didnt reveive the cashback to offset my bill. I am aware that cashback will be credited into cc but i didnt receive it thoI was just saying my spend was tracked in the 360 account as i received spend bonus,btohqsg
what u spend on? maybe ineligible?,btohqsg
I checked the tnc  its eligible tho. Mcc 8011. And i received the spend bonus but just not the cc cashback,btohqsg
