You know what is damn cute?,btohqsg
Starting more than $5k is like,btohqsg
Time to jump off the bandwagon,btohqsg
wait I thought they removed CSC,btohqsg
for saying being cs students make them the elites of society,btohqsg
Probably becaue Ben Leong is the only one that reads nus confessions,btohqsg
And the most fun to troll,btohqsg
U want to fight with ah tiongs?,btohqsg
Lol in the comments of that confession prof ben practically said he trolled too,btohqsg
CSC - Computer Science in Chinese,btohqsg
oh god bedok is jumping on the wagon,btohqsg
Engineering was no longer popular since 2010s,btohqsg
I want to know why ah,btohqsg
All mathematicians will be paid 10k a month in the future,btohqsg
PM Lee keeps saying they need more engineers,btohqsg
All mathematics being paid >10k a month ==> Riemann Hypothesis is proven,btohqsg
Got some other CS profs read also but they rarely comment,btohqsg
I topped the class for first order logic,btohqsg
Does he even remember his math,btohqsg
Apparently he codes stuff in his free time,btohqsg
I mean those hardcore math theory,btohqsg
Why aren't math profs cool enough to comment,btohqsg
Why did he even choose to do maths anyway,btohqsg
He was pretty much 99.999% confirmed to be a government official,btohqsg
He already has a career path planned out for him,btohqsg
Why need to think about the practicality of the degree,btohqsg
His prof wanted him to do phd,btohqsg
Sure but you’d think he would pick the classic politician degree,btohqsg
Do math profs look like they surf nuswhispers,btohqsg
If you have like a lot of experience in coding  making projects  etc,btohqsg
You can get hired without the need of a cs degree,btohqsg
If I meet LHL in real life  that’s what I’m going to ask him,btohqsg
I mean which course is the next bandwagon lol,btohqsg
Will the honour be meeting LHL in real life or meeting John Smith in real life,btohqsg
Imagine if LHL was a math prof,btohqsg
Or whatever skillset is required to do shit to the brain,btohqsg
Too hardcore man. Many will drop out,btohqsg
Didn't end well for bio graduates tho,btohqsg
Before chem engine was life science,btohqsg
It's time for maths to have it's moment,btohqsg
Before dot com bust  it was comp sci,btohqsg
Once we can upload our brains,btohqsg
I think math will be pretty good,btohqsg
As the next and final bandwagon course,btohqsg
Don't think business will ever have bangwagon lol,btohqsg
Unless it's rise of entrepreneurship or something,btohqsg
Few jobs require biz degree anyway,btohqsg
Stem majors can even do biz degree jobs,btohqsg
Wah that one suited for math degree lol,btohqsg
It is under math dept anyway,btohqsg
