Don't know can hit 20 week boüòÇ,btohqsg
Hi. Im new to lala. Any part time driver doing this. May i know a rough income for part timers,btohqsg
From my experience as I‚Äôm part time it‚Äôs hard to hit 100 dollars a day unless you drive 8 hours and or camp in town area fighting for jobs  just treat this platform as a form of pocket money to tide you through a season  definitely not a career option in my opinion,btohqsg
Probably 50-70 dollars a day part time,btohqsg
Cash on delivery means need to collect money from customer?,btohqsg
Just now got customer want scam. Put the address in the building column. üòÇ,btohqsg
Which Sum Kee zichar restaurant always late? Taman Jurong or telok blangah? I took adv order for Tmn Jurong ley.,btohqsg

Dont leave your fate in the hands of CS  settle what u can on your own and contact CS only for what is essential. What u can let go jus let go and movr on to next trip  no point waste time over claiming a few dollars,btohqsg
Usually if client double book they own self compensate me full fare - see heng suay  and maybe it helps to be nice abt it. Sometimes is honest mistake,btohqsg
