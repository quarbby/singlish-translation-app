So if I go barber and pay him for the service of cutting my hair  I don't need to pay GST?,btohqsg
When GST was 8%  1x1.1x1.08=1.188  now 9%  1x1.1x1.09=1.199.,btohqsg
Thx 🙏🏻 lol at least I learn. Rather be a fool for 5 mins than to be a fool forever 😬,btohqsg
Businesses taxable >= $1m need to register for GST. GST can only be charged by businesses with GST registered.,btohqsg
Yes I'm aware  I was just giving an example to prove my point 😂,btohqsg

What is your opinion on this?I have $16000 of SSB (still have 9 years) at about 3.1% pa.I also have a UOB one account which I can earn 3.85% on the first $30k and higher % after $30k up to $100k.Is it still worth holding SSB? Or should I liquidate and park in UOB one?How long has UOB ONE been around? I suppose the interest rate will be adjusted downwards once US fed cut interest rates?,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I was charged a total of 2.8% for my Airbnb transaction for International Processing Fee from UOB? Is this normal?,btohqsg
yup it is and I have been done a few times before.,btohqsg
How is this avoidable in the future? 2.8% is abit ridiculous for a purchase charged in SGD,btohqsg
Must see which batch of ssb. If every year is above 3% just keep it.Once sold u might not be able to buy back. And they are dropping.New salary then put into uob one.,btohqsg
have to check every time who the processor is  I guess. :( unless someone else has any ideas,btohqsg
If it’s sgd. it should just be additional 1% for crossBorder fee. Processing of sgd overseas.,btohqsg
Apparently UOB doesn’t give any warning? Even UOB sms stated the original amount from Airbnb,btohqsg
Is this normal across other banks?,btohqsg
