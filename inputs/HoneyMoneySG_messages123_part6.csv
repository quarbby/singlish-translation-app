Are you not looking for a cashback card?,btohqsg
He just don’t bother learning. He just want to speak and since he can’t  he leaves,btohqsg
Gd point . Miles card can work too if it doesn't expire fast,btohqsg
If you travel often maybe won't have to worry too much. But the flights and methods of booking matters now. Maybe someone can give you a recommendation if you share more details,btohqsg
Usually I just do direct flight booking from airline website plus hotels from agoda ortrip.com,btohqsg
Oh That’s Terry new name  no wonder 💭,btohqsg

How does uob one card Cashback works?If say I just want to clock $500+- spend monthly for the uob one account interest. I made recurring insurance payment of say $400 then for the rest of the $100 spend I use it for sp utilities and simplygo transport or shopee or dairy farm merchant to clock it.Will I get 3.33% Cashback for the $100 spend or I need to clock $500 into the those mentioned sp utilities shopee and whatsoever spend then can get the mentioned Cashback?TIA!,btohqsg
Nope u won't get cash back but u qualify for uob one interests.As insurance don't qualify for cashback.This is what I am doing for past 6 months.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  If I use kris pay and changi pay link with credit card. What will the MCC code be classified under? Will it count towards credit card spend?,btohqsg
Some dp mention it will change mcc while some transaction remain the sames. But mcc should be generally eligible towards credit card spend,btohqsg
You get $0 cashback unless you spend $500 of eligible transactions.,btohqsg
Thanks then will just go for minimum $500 to get uob interest,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know which card is more preferably for buying an air ticket and hotel? UOB lady or DBS WMCC? Thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Both is 4mpd assuming u have travel cat for uob lady. But if u are booking hotel thru agoda can try dbs landing page have 20 percent discount on eligible hotel,btohqsg
For UOB lady card in transport category does anyone know if you can link it to kris + app and pay at esso? will transaction still earn 6mpd?,btohqsg
Can I say the DBS is more versatile than UOB lady then?,btohqsg
Sure because of the blacklist vs whitelist approach  but do note the points expiry on wwmc,btohqsg
Okay  thank you guys so much!,btohqsg
Can we pair OCBC rewards to Amaze card to earn 4mile per dollar?,btohqsg
Ocbc rewards is mcc dependent  link to amaze is to save on fcy if u do link to ocbc reward,btohqsg
Hi everyone  tot of setting up ezlink wallet which is running promo for Jul and Aug. I want to use UOB One VISA card and top up the wallet with it. Does the transaction of top up counted towards the minimum spending requirement?,btohqsg
Yes. Btw  right now ocbc rewards  has 0 fcy rate promo so just use the card directly. Rmb to send sms to register.,btohqsg
"Hello all  does anyone knows what is ""Billed Finance Charges""?I got this on my HSBC Travel 1 card.Have no idea what it is.",btohqsg
Thanks. Then can only continue to do wait for news from liquid group on xnap if what is claim will happen,btohqsg
Guess your best bet is call hsbc to ask.,btohqsg
Do you have overdue outstanding? Or applied overdraft or use it in oversea before? Or is the amount equal to card annual fees?,btohqsg
Did you not pay in full or paid late?,btohqsg
Got this charged to my card this month. I called up the call center and was explained that it was some form of admin payment for having late charges. Which is ridiculous when I was already charged the late payment fee.My advice is to call them and waive it off.,btohqsg
Most likely it's the interest instead. Admin fees are usually part of late charges. Let me guess  UOB CSO? 🤣,btohqsg
Not too sure man. Nah it's HSBC..,btohqsg
Probably my first and last time with them >_>,btohqsg
Likely also.. their outsourced CSOs 10% competency.,btohqsg
My latest experience with HSBC isn't great. Just got HSBC t1 with 600$ limit. 🤣,btohqsg
But will stick with them for ega 🙈,btohqsg
Hi  I interested in opening Mari saving.Any referral/promotion code?Thanks.,btohqsg
Seems like Citi is buffing their Premiermiles overseas spending from 2mpd to 2.2mpd.,btohqsg
Just wondering can anyone can’t access atome now?,btohqsg
anyone able to assist with new registration for moomoo and tiger?,btohqsg
Hi all ! Been using the Citi card cashback (6% dining cashback) and I've just seen the HSBC live card. Do we know if HSBC will remove the extra 3% cashback after the 31/12 or is there a possibility that they end up keeping it ? Thinking of switching to HSBC but might not be worth it if they remove the extra 3% next year.Thanks for the help !,btohqsg
nobody knows to be honest. If you think the current offer is not worth  then dont switch to hsbc.,btohqsg
