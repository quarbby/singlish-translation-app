I'm heading to Europe soon with a youtrip card. What's the difference between just swiping with the card (in a restaurant or similar) with SGD currency loaded onto the card vs converting to Euros in the app?,btohqsg
Oh good question. I had the same question during my recent trip too  but I use Revolut.. i think if it's in SGD  it'll convert to the local currency based on that day's exchange rate? Could be  not too sure,btohqsg
Blackrock iShares US Index fund so far only exclusive to Endowus platform like 1 year ago.https://youtu.be/NUuImRcNQ8s?si=9JzCBPUoilxtt-rH,btohqsg
"Yes  that's right. The idea is that if the rate is good  you can ""save"" the rate by converting beforehand",btohqsg
Just remember to lock the card after that in case of fraud,btohqsg
Hi all  stupid question regarding DBS giro paper form submission  can I just drop by a bank branch and handover the form or must it be mailed?,btohqsg
Giro paying for dbs bill or giro using dbs saving account?,btohqsg
Sorry  I was referring to pay DBS card bills via EGA,btohqsg
Must be mailed. But you can try queuing and waiting for your turn just to hand over the form to them  DBS staff most likely will turn you away. The time taken to process will still be 4-6 weeks.Before that you must have signature with HSBC also.,btohqsg
I did. They don‚Äôt allow anymore. Even  to cancel  still have to pay the annual fees. The only way to cancel is next year before the next annual fee kicks in,btohqsg
Don't make sense. You pay the fee to use for the next 12 months. How can they force you to pay and prevent you from cancelling?,btohqsg
Exactly. Told them that the fee is an upfront payment but they insist that cannot waive anymore.,btohqsg
Has the annual fee been posted? Did you miss their eligibility to waive?Cancellation should be clear cut one...,btohqsg
You can try calling again another day  sometimes CSO say different thing. They can‚Äôt stop you from cancelling your card,btohqsg
No need to q  just pass the form to the person manning the queue machine and tell him it's for giro  they will know,btohqsg
Haha sometimes you need to queue to reach the person manning the queue machine.. DBS queue forever long one,btohqsg
No need  just wait at a side and wait for him to be a bit free,btohqsg
Ppl queuing will just stare at you waiting there lo. See you buay paiseh or not only,btohqsg
I did that at a few banks  noone stare at me leh,btohqsg
Just received my $8 hsbc hongbao!üòÇ,btohqsg
For the ega bonus interest promotion?,btohqsg
Recently scb tighten a lot. I personally unable to get anymore credit card annual fee waivers for all my humans and have been progressively cancelling cards.,btohqsg
Cannot waive but if u cancel they can flatten the fee.,btohqsg
I did this at plaza sing dbs branch a few days ago.. went to hsbc to update my signature first  then went to dbs. The lady at queue counter at entrance gave me the giro form to fill up n told me to hand it over to someone at a counter on the left which i think is where the cheque deposit box is.. they just emphasised that they will not do any form of verification on their end (i suppose they meant the signature that i signed). Just submission of the form to hsbc..,btohqsg
Thanks for this!Let me check if HSBC has my signature in case account was opened online‚Ä¶ it was years ago when I had my advance account converted to EGA iirc,btohqsg
Can hand the form directly to branch? Any success stories so far?,btohqsg
Serious?I‚Äôm still thinking if I should cancel my SC spree card‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs offers 2% cash back for contactless and online spend‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs no longer available for application I think,btohqsg
Got it! Let me try to do it at the branch‚Ä¶ at least it‚Äôs still easier than mailing‚Ä¶ too much hassle just to send paper mail‚Ä¶ envelope‚Ä¶ stamp‚Ä¶ and waiting time,btohqsg
U mean the giro form for ega? I did it a few days ago at dbs..,btohqsg
Yes  wanna submit giro form for EGA for my DBS bills,btohqsg
Why need stamp? The business reply envelope is free. Print  tape  and drop.,btohqsg
I open EGA through online  no signature. I need go to hsbc branch to put signature?,btohqsg
Yeah thats what i did. Unless u have other accounts w them.,btohqsg
I think some bank don‚Äôt have? I recently print out the giro form from OCBC website  then mail out with my own stamp.. üò©,btohqsg
He stated DBS. OCBC has. The only bank I remember that doesn't have BRE is Citibank.,btohqsg
You guys have any idea  I apply credit card through Singsaver and submit reward form application on singsaver website 1-2 days ago  but today I went to check with my ARN number it shows my rewards applied to be empty,btohqsg
Alamak‚Ä¶ I printed out the giro form  in the pdf file no have business reply envelope. I googled OCBC business reply envelope  there is another link for it! I wasted my stamp üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Just go branch fill and pass the form to staff  it is fasterm,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if paying renovations fees via CardUp  charging to UOB VI metal is valid to qualify for the current UOB sign up miles promotion ? As I saw that ipaymy is in the MCC exclusion list but didn't see for CardUp  just in case I missed out anything. Thanks,btohqsg
I am in the same boat,btohqsg
Dbs don't have I think  I submitted last month need buy stamp,btohqsg
Included with the giro form or have to download the letter separately?,btohqsg
Oh then maybe I couldn't find it üòÇ anyway the stamp like less than 50 cents,btohqsg
I'm heading to Europe soon with a youtrip card. What's the difference between just swiping with the card (in a restaurant or similar) with SGD currency loaded onto the card vs converting to Euros in the app?,btohqsg
double post? there are responses on your earlier query,btohqsg
Why are you asking back the same question? And it‚Äôs an exact copy and paste,btohqsg
Hi  I'm thinking of buying furniture of around RM10k in Malaysia. I'm considering whether to simply use cash  using Youtrip  or applying for a credit card to spend and earn cashback (but will incur currency conversion fee).If I'm not considering the credit card sign-up gifts  which option is more worth for making a one off overseas purchase? Thank you!,btohqsg
Depend if u want to pay 3.25 fee for miles or u want best exchange rate etc  not much cashback card can cover the 3.25-3.5 fcy fee,btohqsg
If I'm not into miles and simply into cashback  does pairing a Mastercard w Amaze makes it more worth than paying I cash? Thanksüôèüèª,btohqsg
Not much cashback cards offer high enough interest to cover the fx spread by amaze and usually there‚Äôs a 1k cap on your bonus points.I think a better option would be just go for fx free cards like youtrip or even trust card,btohqsg
