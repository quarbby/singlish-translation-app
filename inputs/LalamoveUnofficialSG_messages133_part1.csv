I dont know if even motorbike wants to take that kind of fees.,btohqsg
"True  plus once u take that kind of amount means customer will keep on book with that pricing and will not increased a few dollars. To customer ""previously there's some drivers will pick up"" so next time they will still book delivery with that fees amount. Long run  all of us will die.. haahha",btohqsg
For cancellation fee  please contact CS at your own do not let the customer contact CS bcos CS will follow what ever customer said. My experience let customer contact CS  cancel straight away without compensation. And CS told me customer don't want to pay then lanlan. This is lalamove,btohqsg
Yes u must contact CS on the spot. If its a cash delivery ask customer to compensate asap. I always do that. So far no problem. Keep that photo for reff.,btohqsg
Be careful what ever you do  protect yourself,btohqsg
LLM can deduct you money from credit without your consent,btohqsg
If fees too low dont take. Wiat till they plus a few more $$ to make it more reasonable price. Then in future they will automatically know what to do.,btohqsg
Oversize  overweight  over timing don't take  just cancel. This is my advice,btohqsg
Oddle job always over timing  that is the appeal come from,btohqsg
If you don't have good excuse LLM will deduct your money,btohqsg
And if they cannot get in touch with the sender  they will just cancel without compensation. It happened to me  so I‚Äôm just sharing my experience.,btohqsg
We as drivers must unite and take a stand. Haiz!#StandUnited,btohqsg
They will always say this. But since last time already stated in the app regarding the size & weight in the apps. Customer just trying luck to save cost. Once u are there explain to them about the cancellation fees of 50% they start to wobble. Cause have to pay 50% and item not delivered. Let me just share what i do.. for example  i called b4 proceed to location to confirm about the job and item and they mention just small item but eventually upon arrival its oversized i give them 2 options. Either cancel and pay the compensation of 50% or top up fee $ follow on which ever mode of dwlivery they are supposed too.,btohqsg
Another customer that will always ‚Äútake advantage‚Äù is 10 Haig Road. Vietnamese sending food and groceries over. I saw first hand coz I was there and she booked van. Then came a rider and asked to courier a box of ingredients over. Then when the rider argued  she said ‚ÄúI thought you drive car.‚Äù Sibei sialan this sender.,btohqsg
To me  all vietnamese shop all like that.. hahahaahah,btohqsg
Another one is at Mandai Estate. TMD!,btohqsg
U only get 15.90 for 2 drops of location... worth it?,btohqsg
Meaning per location is $8. Come on lah... grabfood better right? Hahahha,btohqsg
So to me  lalamove is not for us to earn if the price is like this and there ppl still take it.. but as a customer i will book lalamove i save alot. And i know there ppl so hungry for this kind of fees.,btohqsg
