Trying to find a poly diploma field that can maximise emigration opportunities  given that I have given up hope of having a good life here in Singapore,btohqsg
"poly diploma.. is a bit hard unless you enter a course related to a field or industry that has connections with overseas opportunities for further studies or full-term work that allows you  the student to kind of ""station""  wouldn't say immigrate overseas",btohqsg
ask np. they love giving us random assignments that serves no- a few purpose most of the time,btohqsg
i know students like to pursue education in areas such as psychology  linguistics  arts  veterinary  humanities etc overseas because of the lack of opportunities and things to learn in sg institutions or education,btohqsg
so I suppose the best way is still overseas uni?,btohqsg
typically students will pursue up till a (higher) nitec cert  poly diploma or A-level qualification first in sg before going overseas,btohqsg
eh pursuing education overseas doesn't need to mean your family's rich to support you,btohqsg
nowadays a lot of students work at least 2-3+ years while studying full-time/part-time in sg before going overseas lool,btohqsg
