why is it when I question whether is it fair,btohqsg
Mmm since it is the holidays  maybe you could try to buffen up the resume a little bit  maybe try like volunteering or doing some kind of coding project?(Idk how eae works....)But most important  your grades eventually has to be there for you to get the offer.,btohqsg
if u censorship is the way to go,btohqsg
I think this A not easy to get...,btohqsg
üê¨*I just wanna be part of SIMPANIIII*üê¨,btohqsg
im going to dip before any more drama happens,btohqsg
Is it cause I take Geog,btohqsg
Your most recent messages weren't on-topic for the O-level chat  so they were removed,btohqsg
And as if ur response or either,btohqsg
So in this case if u count that as relevant,btohqsg
Then we go back to DBWB,btohqsg
Being smth that actl came out in the paper,btohqsg
What response are you talking about?,btohqsg
Or more so the said standards that admins opt to uphold,btohqsg
"from my experience  standardised questions for science can be inconsistent or unaligned with university level resources dethe student will need to check with his teachercase in point: Previously Moe school marked my nephew's probability answer as wrong when written in percentage. Researching into Cambridge pre uni they state Percentage is accepted  furthermore uni textbook probability answers have been written in percentages.Turns out it's a Sg MOE practise to disallow % in probability. No particular statement from textbooks too. I even spoke to the teacher and all they explain is ""its standardisation"". Their explanations had no link to math concepts lol",btohqsg
Set ur own pre conditions and now u can‚Äôt defend it ?,btohqsg
do I need to dig out ss from dbwb,btohqsg
Let me remind u it did come out for paper 1.,btohqsg
Then DBWB shud not have been nuked,btohqsg
And previously another admin did say,btohqsg
So why are admins differing in standards ?,btohqsg
Is this what sg exams chat upholds as admin ?,btohqsg
Lowkey the whole convo just wasn't relevant,btohqsg
Your conversation was not about the subject itself; it was a discussion about speculating what questions will come up in the exam,btohqsg
Ok and so how is marking standard relevant to the subject,btohqsg
Even this message isn't really relevant to any homework qn tbvh,btohqsg
That is irrelevant. The percentage in probability is a formatting issue while the question above is a factual question,btohqsg
Tell me how is this not relevant,btohqsg
Ok la u tell me I take fake a level Geog papers,btohqsg
The person who responded to V's message was also irrelevant,btohqsg
Marking is not the same as speculation  or is it?,btohqsg
Everything shud have just been nuked,btohqsg
Is it relevant to the subject given ur standards ?,btohqsg
How‚Äôs marking standards gonna solve ur question,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the relevance of marking to homework help,btohqsg
I don't get what your problem is  honestly,btohqsg
You're just trying to equate two completely different things,btohqsg
given V‚Äôs high and prestigious standards,btohqsg
u never offered a good explanation,btohqsg
On the topic and scale of relevance isn‚Äôt it the same,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not relevant to homework help,btohqsg
Tell me how is marking standards and whatever u stated in formatting issue relevant to homework help,btohqsg
I have never removed any messages on marking,btohqsg
yes and don‚Äôt u think that‚Äôs a problem in your double standards ?,btohqsg
Is it relevant in nature ?,btohqsg
I remove messages from other users too,btohqsg
You think I'm only targeting you and that is not the case,btohqsg
Tldr this chat only for answering practice qns that other ppl ask lol,btohqsg
I think the main thing is this tbf,btohqsg
Then what double standard are you talking about?,btohqsg
