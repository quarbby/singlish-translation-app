Jc bio is also a waste of time,btohqsg

Any BIO course in UNI requires more physics than bio,btohqsg

He just told me don't go jc,btohqsg
But when u go there and struggle to maintain cumulative gpa coz u never do well in early courses or when u miss ur gpa to enter uni course by 0.5 or when all u do is projects with shit teammates,btohqsg
