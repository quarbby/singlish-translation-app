🚀Pika World Markets Breakfast Update - 19 Dec 2023🚀Stocks rose decisively throughout the trading session  even as comments by some Fed officials tried to dial back the optimism on rate cuts. As we recall  the S&P 500 had risen by around 2.5% last week  delivering a seventh consecutive week of gain.Without significant economic data release  corporate news dominates the session. Let's review some quick facts on key news.🔒US Steel company was the highlight after they reached an agreement to be purchased by Nippon Steel for $55 per share. The deal is still awaiting approval  given the US's previous stance to consider the company as having strategic importance. Still  there are hopes of the deal gliding through  given Nippon Steel's commitment to keep the the union relationship intact.⌚️Apple trended down on Monday despite Nasdaq rising sharply  displaying how the stock gains are broadening to support the index. The consumer electronics giant halted some Apple Watch sales due to compliance with the US import ban. This does not bode well for the holiday season.📤Sunpower  a green energy solar company  collapsed by over 30% after the company issued concern about its viability to continue business as it was treading on the prospect of a default.🚘NIO  a leading Chinese EV maker  rose sharply after announcing an investment receipt of $2.2 billion from CYVN Holdings  Abu Dhabi's investment arm. This means the firm now owns around 20.1% of NIO's shares holdings (both issued and outstanding).📪What's on the menu today?🗽At 9.30 pm  we will welcome Building Permits data  and at 12.30 am  it will bring us to the Atlanta Fed GDPNow Q4 data release.It is on 19 Dec  Tuesday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. With the equity market hovering around a short-term overbought situation  trading would be more challenging  and we hope you have a safe and profitable trading week ahead.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
