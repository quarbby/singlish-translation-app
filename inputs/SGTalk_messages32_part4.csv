Is this sh talk similar to the one that was close recently,btohqsg
The news reported yesterday was very bad.  According to OYK’s answer to reporters  they can collect about 100 KTV customers from TT data and contact tracking. Among them  43 cluster cases were announced (not including early cases)  so those who were tracked  50% positive rate.  If 20 Vietnamese women entertain 4 people per night  from June 29th to Jul 14th  there are 80 people per night  which is about 16 days  so the number of contacts may be 1 280.  The positive Covid among them can be predicted to be 640 (50%)  and then if the secondary infection is 2 cases per patient  we will add 1280 cases  plus the primary cases  we expect that there will eventually be 1920 to 2000 cases.  It's best to stay at home obediently for the next 28 days and do not roam around unnecessarily.  ( fwd),btohqsg

*LATEST COVID MEASURES  - WHOSE FAULT??*1. KTVs abusing pivot to F&BGovernment tried to help everyone under the ACRA classification of Nightclubs  Bars  KTVs to pivot.These outlets were all forced to close since April 2020.As long as you fall under this classification  you could pivot and build a kitchen (even apply for grant if they qualify) and allowed to continue operations. It’s a streamlined way of offering help  so people can get help fast.Some people abused it  pretended to serve food  but operated vice instead.Police try to close them  but it’s hard when people are determined to play cat and mouse.The vast majority of law abiding operators I am sure are grateful for the help.Now everyone has to close.2. Vietnamese coming in on sponsored social social visit pass.Since April 2020 many couples have been separated by border closures.It’s already hard enough for legally married couples.It’s even harder for people in long term serious relationships who are not married.The Government exercised compassion and allowed Singaporeans to sponsor their unmarried partners in.Some people abused it  but how to check?How do you force people to prove that their relationship is bona fide?We give the benefit of the doubt. But some abuse it.Now it’s all cancelled.MORAL OF STORY : Government tries to help. People abuse it. This is not a loophole.Stop blaming the Government.Stop blaming foreigners.Blame the people who abuse privileges and aid  who cause problems for all of us.This is a pandemic  situation is in flux worldwide.Stop complaining.Most of us are trying our best.Thank you.,btohqsg
Totally agree. So true! Thanks for putting it out!,btohqsg
Well said. Government try the best to address and balance the situation. All the initiatives are meant to be good if nobody abuse them.,btohqsg

*President Xi Jing Peng of China said:*As a small child   I was very *selfish*  always grabbing the best for myself.Slowly  everyone left me and I had no friends. I *didn’t think* it was my fault and I criticized others.But my father gave me 3 sentences to *help* me in life.One day  my father cooked 2 bowls of noodles and  put them on the table. One had an egg on top while the other bowl had none on top.Then he asked me to choose a bowl of noodles.Because eggs were hard to come by those days  I chose the bowl with egg!I was congratulating myself on my wise choice/decision and decided to wallop the egg. To my surprise  I saw that my father's bowl of noodles had *two* eggs at the bottom beneath the noodles!With much regret  I scolded myself for being too hasty in my decision.My father smiled and *taught* me to remember that  *what your eyes see may not be true*.He added that  *If you make a habit of taking advantage of people  you will end up losing*.The next day  my father again cooked 2 bowls of noodles: one bowl with an egg on top and the other bowl with no egg on top.Again  he asked to choose the bowl I wanted.This time  I felt smarter so I chose the bowl without any egg on top.Hmmmmmm to my surprise  there was not even a single egg at the bottom of the bowl!Again  my father smiled and said to me  *My child  you must not always rely on experiences because sometimes  life can cheat you or play tricks on you*.Never be too annoyed or sad  with situations  *just treat experience as learning a lesson that  cannot be gotten  from any  textbooks*.The third day  my father again cooked 2 bowls of noodles   one bowl with an egg on top and the other with no egg on top.He asked me to choose the bowl I wanted.But  this time  I told my father  *Dad  you choose first. You are the head of the family and you contribute the most to the family*.My father was very happy and he chose for me.He chose the bowl with one egg on top. But as I ate my bowl of noodles  to my surprise  there were *two* eggs at the bottom of the bowl.My father smiled at me with love in his eyes. He said  *my child  you must remember that when you think for the good of others  good things will always naturally happen to you*.I always remember these 3 sentences of my father.Xi Jing Peng_As we continue on the journey of life  think for the good of others. Put others first and your joy will be complete._Thanks 🙏.,btohqsg
