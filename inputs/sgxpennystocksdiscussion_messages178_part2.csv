Yea bro. Many people want fast money .Very risky because if not experienced enough to trade and out fast can get Stucked. I prefer intro counters that even stuck now . In future u can still win,btohqsg
Yeah want fast money must first learn how to stomach losses,btohqsg
Yup but everyone wants that . Then after suffer the losses then will realise not so easy. Better research and invest in value counters.,btohqsg
Nothing against mbullish la but I believe he move fast,btohqsg
Anyways for HSO Although clearly got BBs activity  I thjnk best is Q $0.007/ $0.008 instead. The $0.009 can only be taken down by the BBs who planted it there. When have stronger buying signals of $0.009 breaking with big mouths then can risk $0.009.Have to monitor closely meantime.,btohqsg
sui.... tomorrow Rex gap up 160 liao la,btohqsg
I mean sino G. Any news? Tks,btohqsg
Same for me . I lost a few hundred k listening to those bollocks . Keep asking me to average down when I asked for advise . 9-10 years back when just started out.,btohqsg
