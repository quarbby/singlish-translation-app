and i just ''wtf-ed'' at him in all honesty,btohqsg
I know people who do this,btohqsg
i dont say need to be the best,btohqsg
suburbs have less job opportunity and lesser pay,btohqsg
u r also competing against super upz ppl for the opportunities,btohqsg
i agree with this. so...even if you go to a regular/non-top-tier JC  i think its worth a try also if you want. I think you can also try for poly also  because you never know if it'll work out  until you try.,btohqsg
They say better class more studious people then you can study better,btohqsg
I tell them it is just your drive to study,btohqsg
I mean itâ€™s actually hard to study in my class tbh. Everybody is talking during breaks when I want to study,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s jc1 but only towards last half of jc2 everyone goes silent,btohqsg
bravo  u are more mature than your parents,btohqsg
i have frens who got too stressed out over being in a class whereby every1 was competitive,btohqsg
Drives you to be as good as you possibly can,btohqsg
Yes if you intend to move to that country  you should definitely get a degree from there instead of SG,btohqsg
My secondary 3 and 4 class,btohqsg
I relate to this on a spiritual level,btohqsg
Want to ask sth. My bro is in J1 now and he kena retained so he's thinking of going NS first then go back to JC after that. Does he have to notify the army or?,btohqsg
If you leave JC  you cannot join back again,btohqsg
JAE admission for JCs is only available to people who have never JAE to JC before,btohqsg
Eg poly kid can JAE to JC  but JC kid cannot JAE into JC,btohqsg
So if u r to do this you would have to work something out with the JC school admin  but highly unlikely they would allow your brother to join back in 2y time,btohqsg
Just retain and finish A levels,btohqsg
You can only go NS after A lvl.,btohqsg
Better strategy would be to retake A levels while in NS,btohqsg
Sit in the office while studying for As,btohqsg
Fail jc1   get retained how to go NS ? They wont accept you,btohqsg
Huh really ahðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜¶ the Vice principal said that my bro can go NS then come back to JC in the future,btohqsg
Your bro jc wont allow also,btohqsg
Well  they are very kind then,btohqsg
Tell the VP dont talk cock,btohqsg
So ur brother can just go ahead and call CMPB and ask them to put him in,btohqsg
He sabo your bro only. Later after your bro ORD  he cant go back jc. Have to go poly.,btohqsg
Even if this particular VP say ok,btohqsg
How do u know the VP in 2y will be ok,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s not really any guarantee that things in 2y will be as expected,btohqsg
Ah it's either retain and tahan finish A levels OR go NS then poly OR drop out and enter poly,btohqsg
Retaining is really nothing to be scared of,btohqsg
It should be even easier than the first time round,btohqsg
So I would just go ahead and take the retention,btohqsg
It's not that. It's just that my family after hearing the VP' advice thought that it's better for my bro to go NS then go back to JC cos he can learn to be more disciplined there,btohqsg
Since this is not a possible route,btohqsg
I guess I will have to update my bro and my family,btohqsg
Even that outcome is extremely dependent on how mindef assigns u,btohqsg
If they assign u a slack unit then obviously the intended effect of discipline wonâ€™t succeed,btohqsg
So it was already a very ?? plan in the first place,btohqsg
How about transferring to another JC? Is it possible. He seems to dislike his JC somehow,btohqsg
legit been depressed the past 1 month,btohqsg
friend retained in jc  next year applied and transferred to another jc,btohqsg
went through same application process and competed with the consequent cohort,btohqsg
You would have to go directly to the JC for that  and not JAE,btohqsg
