big disappointment to me but whatever  can always buy used FD,btohqsg
euro BS regs more like it,btohqsg
but then again the K20C1 is potent as hell,btohqsg
2:25 from a light-tuned FL5 at Sepang,btohqsg
there's no better substitute for the FD2R imo,btohqsg
"CL7R doesn't have that same ""point and shoot"" handling characteristics",btohqsg
its one of the few 4 cyl cars i will not call a shitbox,btohqsg
unlike a certain other member in this group that despises the FD2R,btohqsg
lucky me  i dont know who it is,btohqsg
the FD is the only FF car that handles as well  or even better than alot of FR cars imo,btohqsg
the Honda engineers were smoking good shit.,btohqsg
you need to watch more initial d cartoons son,btohqsg
ahaha only watched the movie w jaychou ehh,btohqsg
ew the fake one  sounds like something an FN2R driver would do,btohqsg
any cars at milinia walk tdy?,btohqsg
iâ€™m actually quite surprised that majority voted for I6/V8.iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s a E90 M3 vs F80 M3 debate ðŸ‘€@usernameusernameusernameusername,btohqsg
what i love about V8s is how many unique variants you can get with very distinct characters. You have boosty turbo v8s like koenigseggs  mclarens. Then you have thumping hemi v8s which sounds so damn sick when cammed  on idle. Then you have regular crossplane  flat crank (both turbo and NA). and each of them have their unique powerband  character and sound,btohqsg
in turn which i love Rotaries for the sake of sound & smaller displacement,btohqsg
not to mention the supercharged ones like the dodge demon and the jaguar f type which make freaking awesome V8 + supercharger whine sounds,btohqsg
13Bâ€™s are amazing  keep it stock with a twin/sequential turbo and itâ€™s amazing. do a streetport & stick on a big turbo? worth it,btohqsg
very cool engine  too bad found in so few cars,btohqsg
the whining sound is something super underrated locally,btohqsg
iâ€™ve only ever heard it once on a RS6.,btohqsg
not enough of them on our roads for people to appreciate,btohqsg
those who install aftermarket are constantly running away ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
especially whoever this was  i respect that build a lot especially when it caught me off guard,btohqsg
22-28 actually  but with a few touch ups 32psi,btohqsg
used to sit on the back of the bus for turbo/supercharger noises,btohqsg
back to this  i am team F80. I6 Turbo makes me feel all kinda ways,btohqsg
next poll is probably gonna be european,btohqsg
also those who vote twincharge cfm drive scirocco/jetta/golf,btohqsg
Then those who vote na drive civic? ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
