Yep  exactly! I've only learnt about amaze and MB F&F like 2 months back from this group... Just in time for my short KL trip! I only brought 2 cards for this trip  and I will max out shopping category by end of the month in sg. Too bad all those genting theme park tickets aren't counted as entertainment else I could have gotten more cashback!,btohqsg
I don't even think I can complete 1 let alone 4 ü§™,btohqsg
Oh  I timed my car servicing to be in the same month as my trip  so I can hit more transportation spending... As for online fashion  amaze card is simply amazing... Converts all my premium outlet purchases into online fashion spends. Lol. Food  shopping and hotel (sadly no cashback) are my main expenses so after maxing the category  I charged some RM expenses to max the last category. üòÅ,btohqsg
Mean you spend almost $2k to get 5.3% cashback?,btohqsg
When i go malaysia  maybank fnf pretty much my default card together with amaze and crmc,btohqsg
More like $2.2k to get $125 (with completion of grocery). Almost 5.68%.,btohqsg

Hi all  would like to seek the experts' advice.  If i am booking hotel via agoda shld i use Amaze card (linked to Krisflyer uob) or use krisflyer directly ( have charged more than 800 this yr for sia ticket using the Krisflyer uob) . Will there be a difference if using amaze other than clocking the insta pts.,btohqsg
Are you booking in foreign currency? If not  then no instapoints,btohqsg
if you want the extra 1.8 mpd then you have to use UOBKF directly on agoda instead of via amaze,btohqsg
Sorry i dun understand. I know there is a 3mpd for krisflyer. U mean there is an additional of 1.8mpd ?,btohqsg
Can you earn 1.5% cashback on American Express¬Æ¬† True Cashback Card for utilities and insurance?I saw UOB absolute nerf the utilities recently,btohqsg
UOBKF has 3mpd for bookings from certain OTAs  agoda is one of them,btohqsg
hi all  i have 2 qn for uob krisflyer:(1) do i have to clock $800 spending before i can receive 3mpd for unlimited spending?(2) the annual $800 spending is for SQ/SCOOT  can i use 3rd party app like skyscanner and route through traveloka to fly with SQ/SCOOT  will this still be counted?,btohqsg
Any idea on how to clock the snack insurance portion when I at overseas. Utilities bills not yet up.,btohqsg
Ok what u mean is base 1.2mpd + 1.8mpd ( prefered merchant eg. Agoda). If i understand you correctly  i shld use KF directly even though foreign currency since agoda is prefered partner.,btohqsg
Hmm uob vS is it considered a blacklist mcc card? I cannot find those white list.,btohqsg
Did u managed to find out how to do step 4 of SNACK insurance? Try and try but idk how to issue $8 insurance,btohqsg
Yes for utilities and insurance  Amex TCB excludes wallet top ups (MCC 6540) and installments.,btohqsg
yes  additional 1.8 mpd only comes in after end of membership year if you fulfilled at least $800 on SQ/scoot spend within the year,btohqsg
Any idea on how to clock the snack insurance portion when I at overseas. Where to clock online. Utilities bills not yet up.,btohqsg
Only grab wallet bah.. I got the cashback topping up to Starbucks  nets motoring and coffeebean,btohqsg
yes  take note of the FCY/contactless spend requirement,btohqsg
as long as you clock the $800 sq/scoot spending within the membership year  txns in the whitelist will get additional 1.8 mpdno,btohqsg
Refers to prepaid wallets. Starbucks topups seems to code as Dining.,btohqsg

Meaning if i spent this month 800 on sia ticket. And next month i buy agoda hotel  i wont have the additional 1.8mpd ? I have to wait till i renew menbership by end of the year . Only then buying from agoda will then earn the additonal 1.8mpd ?,btohqsg
first  800$ then u get additional 1.8 right? there wont be backtracking of my previous card transaction before the fulfill of 800$?,btohqsg
officially the additional 1.8 mpd is only credited in one lump sum for all eligible txn  after end of membership yearthere are cases where people have gotten them 1-2 months before end of membership year,btohqsg
no  the $800 can be fulfilled anytime during the membership year. it will retroactively apply to all eligible txns made during the membership year,btohqsg
Ahhh ic. So it is clocked but it is not immediately reflected in our total mileage,btohqsg
nice  u are way clearer than any fine print or uob staffs,btohqsg
and the $800 can solely be from direct sq/scoot web purchase.got it.,btohqsg
can be krisshop also  if you have something to buy therekris+/pelagonot counted currently,btohqsg
just to note  if you're paying in FCY then you need to consider if additional 1.8mpd is worth the FCY fee of 3.25%,btohqsg
I just applied UOB privmile card. Worth it ? And how to maximise miles,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone confirm that if I use Citi premier miles card + CardUp with my car loan  does it earn the base 1.2 mpd? SOS! Because some webs stated that cardup does not support Citibank credit cards while other webs stated that it supports. SOS!,btohqsg
Guys for overseas spending only paywave works? For card insertion even if i enable magnetic stripe still rejected,btohqsg
Rejected like how? Declined or ?,btohqsg
Yea all my sg credit cards decline,btohqsg
Did u try amaze chip or magstrip?,btohqsg
If you have 1.5k worth of dining in June then UOB PRVI. 5mpd,btohqsg
