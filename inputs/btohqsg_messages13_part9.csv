has anyone ever selected a BTO/SBF unit and then gone on to buy a HDB resale unit instead?,btohqsg
Cos the tengah project extended for another 2 to 3 yrs,btohqsg
And she has been waiting for almost 3yrs I think.,btohqsg
so she cancelled her BTO unit  requested for new HLE and went ahead to purchase a resale unit. is that how it works?,btohqsg
For next launch AMK BTO  what is the requirement to apply for 3Gen?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have similar situation where my bf is still in army and we want to try bto for the first time. I‚Äôm currently working full time but soon transiting to part time as I‚Äôm going to start university soon. But the hdb staff asked me to apply under employed as I was working full time when I‚Äôm applying.So will we still be able to get the staggered down payment scheme? Would like to ask if anyone knows more about the staggered downpayment scheme? As was wondering how do HDB determine if you can get it or do we have to go and apply separately?And does applying for the HLE  tell us whatever grants that we are eligible to apply or must ee ownself go and findüòÖ,btohqsg
As I know that if staggered downpayment then is 5% if not must 10% upfront first,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm abit worried if we can‚Äôt get the staggered downpayment,btohqsg
5% first thh 10% later stage,btohqsg
I think it may have changed though?,btohqsg
Wait those experienced ppl say bah i also nt experience üòÄ,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt seem to send the pic or link here but I saw the hdb website yesterday and it says 10% of downpayment if take hdb loan then if can get staggered downpayment then is 5% then when collecting keys is another 5% or something! Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong,btohqsg
Please kindly reply to my questions everyone  if anyone knowsüôèüèª,btohqsg
From late Dec 2021 HDB* rules changed to 15% downpayment,btohqsg
It's age based i think. Under 30 or something.,btohqsg
is there any ways that i can share the link here?,btohqsg
If you are taking a housing loan from HDB:You need to pay 10% of the flat's selling price as downpayment using CPF and/ or cash.First-timer buyers and existing flat owners right-sizing to a 2-room Flexi or 3-room flat who qualify for the Staggered Downpayment Scheme only need to pay a 5% downpayment. The balance purchase price is payable at the time of key collection.,btohqsg
This is what i found at the hdb website,btohqsg
Im on staggered downpayment scheme. Both applicant must be below 30 yo at the point of application. Apply as fiancee/fiance.5% during lease agreement and 5% during key collection. (Based on hdb loan) if you are on bank loan  you maybe have to fork out 10% more during key collection.,btohqsg
Thts for flats purchased before Dec 2021 right? After Dec 2021 I recall additional 5%,btohqsg
Ya. Didnt know got new change,btohqsg
Actually just go hdb website and check. The details are very clearly stated.,btohqsg
yes i did but i was still abit confuse as im a first timer,btohqsg
Based on ur said situation  you both definitely can be under staggered down-payment scheme. (Rmb to select fiance/fiancee scheme during BTO application),btohqsg
So it does not matter if you are employed or not employed?,btohqsg
It doesnt matter for the scheme. What you need to worry is your HLE and Loan Quantum.,btohqsg
The HLE letter is mainly to see if you can get housing loan right? which is the HDB loan right? is different from like the enhanced cpf grants and all right?,btohqsg
Yes. During booking of flat (the very first appointment)  they will ask if you want to apply for grants etc  can apply on the spot.,btohqsg
Sorry one more question  so for the staggered downpayment thing  do we need to specially apply for it or it is auto given if we met the criteria?,btohqsg
Dont need to apply. If you meet the criteria  say that you want staggered payment during the 1st appointment.,btohqsg
Okay understand  thank you so much for helping,btohqsg
All the best to your BTO application!,btohqsg
Mm mm! You too if you are applyingüôèüèª,btohqsg
Looking at yishun but it seems like alot people applied for it hahaha,btohqsg
Which area you guys think that many people will bid for it?,btohqsg
Was actually planning for yishun too but now gonna go for bukit merah ba,btohqsg
But bukit merah the downpayment chor,btohqsg
Also make sure you have enough to make the 5% downpayment...since you are going to study full time..,btohqsg
i think downpayment is always the main issue for younger couples,btohqsg
Can use both partners cpf or cash right?,btohqsg
Places like yishun i think should be okay,btohqsg
