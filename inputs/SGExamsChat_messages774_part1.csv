She has not reassured me of my symptoms,btohqsg
So i keep talking and asking,btohqsg
dang respect i thought u were j2,btohqsg
what are the chances of nie,btohqsg
I'm actually a working adult now,btohqsg
Then when she retake...were her results nowhere still near the pre-requisities for med,btohqsg
That is why dun go ane when ur symptoms or not serious enoughâ€¦just pop urself into gp or polyclinic,btohqsg
what can u do with a math degree?,btohqsg
I actually have a lot of friends who major in math and got NIE scholarships,btohqsg
Of course they ended up teaching math in schools in the end,btohqsg
at least she kenna sponsored overseas uni lol,btohqsg
So they only provide free if u go ane??,btohqsg
So yes you can actually major in math and then go to NIE,btohqsg
As for the chances  I don't know,btohqsg
Bruh erm what is w the govt and them trying to siam ppl fr ane,btohqsg
For me  teaching is not my first career after I graduated,btohqsg
Dr referred me to ane n then when my dad came  the nurse got scolded coz my dad scolded them say dr anyhow refer me to aneðŸ’€,btohqsg
I used to consider it for mid career  but not anymore,btohqsg
Mine is the field of SWE and data science,btohqsg
The reason is I feel that having the industrial experience and coming to teach in schools will help to benefit the education more,btohqsg
ooh so like freelancer just sort out company data and yea?,btohqsg
Back then I felt that a lot of the education is more of like learning something but why do you need to learn it that type of thing,btohqsg
math major to NIE is either getting the scholarship halfway through undergrad then PGDE or apply for PGDE after graduating,btohqsg
But that point is when i hv not tested positive  i went gp coz i needed an mc and not confirmed covid yet,btohqsg
Then i fell when walking to the dr room,btohqsg
So people seem to like lose interest in stuff,btohqsg
And was hving a super high fever (39.2),btohqsg
No la we don't sort out company data,btohqsg
Yes we do that but that's probably the 0.01% of the jobscope,btohqsg
Mine is more of using the weather data and do predictions,btohqsg
Bruh the doctor did not even suspect covid (until my dad brought it up to her),btohqsg
tbh just look up what data science entails and you'll get a more thorough answer,btohqsg
LOL nah for me is my heartbeat rate increased by alot  or smth when doc used stethoscope to listen...END UP need to measure BP monitor to measure my BP,btohqsg
bc data science is very broad,btohqsg
Recently my job is more operations research related,btohqsg
My previous project is actually on supermarkets,btohqsg
It was coz i couldnt walk (i fell while walking to the dr rm then the nurse need to hold me over + my fever was 39.2,btohqsg
So we want to do an order replenishment system for items sold in the supermarket,btohqsg
investigate why mama shops charge cheaper than fairprice?,btohqsg
i mean getting a job that uses math vs math math is diff,btohqsg
Like how many to replenish per day for each supermarkets,btohqsg
if you want MATH math you're looking at academia alr,btohqsg
My heartbeat do go up too (it was 93 once),btohqsg
nowadays i feel fairprice not fair anymore,btohqsg
So we want to find a way not to order too much to incur wastage,btohqsg
We don't want to order too little so that the supermarkets cannot earn profit when they have more potential to,btohqsg
So we have to find a logic such that we can earn profit  earn sales  reduce wastage and achieve such goals,btohqsg
oh ya cuz sg economy is down now,btohqsg
write an mc for my dear lance coporal yt,btohqsg
So our work is related to Japanese supermarkets,btohqsg
