üéâPika World Bit Size Update ‚Äì 18 May 2022üéâüí∞Spending your way to prosperityüíéEven as prices and interest rates are rising rapidly  the ending of the federal stimulus has not watered down spending enthusiasm among consumers. At least not for now.Tuesday's latest retail sales data reflects Americans on a speeding spree  ranging from shopping to vacations and fine dining in restaurants. As a result  we saw a monthly 0.9% jump in retail sales  and March retail spending was also revised upwards.üèòWork your way to the moonüóΩMarvellous  isn't it? Indeed  it is a sign of a robust US economy strength built on consumer spending. It is also a reflection of a growing labour market  as more Americans are working and taking home paychecks. Moreover  about $2 trillion of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic period is about to be spent by households.It certainly helps to downplay the fear of an imminent slowdown in the economic engine. Yet  the data is also a double-edged sword  for it supports the aggressive stance of the Fed to tighten monetary policy to slow down aggregate demand in the economy. It means a hawkish Fed for a more extended period.The dilemma  resilient consumers  a headache for Fed.It is 18 May  Wednesday  8.50 am in Singapore and 8.50 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a sunny  cheerful day.,btohqsg

when it break down 37 neckline  i was also bearish  called for flush to 33  but ytd strange buyer sudden attack up from 35 to 38. and since this TT has been the stronger stock in recent months  so the pullback could be finished early,btohqsg
