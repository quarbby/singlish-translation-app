Hi  may i know this works to pay for other insurance companies premium to qualify $500/$1000/$2000 uob one card spending? I have a monthly premium of $2500 to pay.,btohqsg
Some banks have more verification e.g singpass before they disburse the cash.,btohqsg
If I have Singpass and bank apps on a separate phone which I don't use for social media and online transactions  am I safe?,btohqsg
The phone also has to be completely up to date with the latest updates and security patches. Also on a separate phone number that isn‚Äôt used anywhere else other than exclusively for your bank accounts.,btohqsg
Not necessarily because e.g dbs does not need singpass or any verification to disburse loan.,btohqsg
no  only clock to uob one account bonus interest  not card rebate,btohqsg
If both phones are on my home WiFi  will that be unsafe?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not about the data connection. It‚Äôs that if your main phone gets compromised  the hackers can get your sms OTPs now. Or worse  if someone manages to port your number out to another telco which they have the SIM card. So it‚Äôs best to keep a 2nd low profile number that isn‚Äôt shared or used anywhere else.,btohqsg
I meant that my safe phone has Singpass and bank apps  another phone has social media and online shopping. The unsafe phone can be compromised but scammers can't access my bank accounts.,btohqsg
Yes that‚Äôs probably the safest. Just make sure your safe phone isn‚Äôt some ancient out of date Android. Maybe get a spare $5 Simba senior number and shift your bank accounts over as well to completely cut any link between your safe and unsafe phone.,btohqsg
Yes Can. Air BNB uses 4722 or 7011. Both included MCCs for UOB Lady Travel category.,btohqsg
Let's say my main phone gets compromised and this is my SMS OTP number. But my bank apps on the safe phone is not compromised and scammers won't know my login credentials.,btohqsg
Yup they won‚Äôt. But having a separate number will also make it easy to tell if someone from the ‚Äúbank‚Äù calls you on your main phone number is 101% a scammer.,btohqsg
I don't pick up calls at all. Thanks for all the advice.,btohqsg
