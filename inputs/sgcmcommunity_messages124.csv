My mother tells me to wake up early to catch worms,btohqsg
Who's waiting for coe to drop before buying  like me 😑,btohqsg
Any thoughts when's the right time to bid?,btohqsg
"When your gut says  “it’s hammertime.""",btohqsg
Your wallet will tell you too,btohqsg
Like life partners  when the right ride comes along  just grab only. Don’t think already 🥰🥰,btohqsg
dont think dis year gna drop anytime soon,btohqsg
I think2024/2025challenging . I think the earliest period should be the presidential election coming in sept,btohqsg
Wa arnd the time to sell car liao 😂,btohqsg
If no candidate to fight for the election   maybe got to wait till2026/2027till the gov stop provide funding to business or give $$$ to people,btohqsg
Next yr 2024= gst increSe again. So expected the gov to give out money to “tide” over .,btohqsg
If i know a car mileage is fake on sgcm listing,btohqsg
They adjust the meter from 200k to 116k sia wth,btohqsg
Apparently now is when the large batch of coe's dereg and is renewed? So maybe towards end of this year and next year  there's more coe supply hence lower price,btohqsg
now vezel drivers can flip the car with style,btohqsg
Question is what happens after leeport?,btohqsg
No use if it is not meant for mass production.,btohqsg
of course sherlock. but think of the number of vezel owners in singapore,btohqsg
In local context that’s more than enough!!!,btohqsg
Come have some Bedok Padang. Instant mood lifter 🥰🥰,btohqsg
i don't even work or stay near there,btohqsg
More reason to drive your ride! No miles how to smiles?,btohqsg
gotta work to pay for my car,btohqsg
Need to let the plebs gawk at that gorgeous new front bumper,btohqsg
I don’t even know how to answer that statement 😳,btohqsg
How is your day going Mr Mood Lifter Food?,btohqsg
Any pictures to show the egr?,btohqsg
I wan to ask any idea wats the size of tbe bolts and nuts and materials used for ultraracing bars. Usually,btohqsg
Differ from car to car leh,btohqsg
Normal mild steel bolts and nuts.,btohqsg
Can we change to sus bolts and nuts,btohqsg
Not sure. But if you are using Ultra Racing bars  you can ask them.Foong Kim do alot of Ultra Racing,btohqsg
anyone know how to convert bucket seat into office chair?,btohqsg
Not recommended lol. The CG is different from office chairs so can fall down unless you use a wide enough base,btohqsg
yeah finding a wide base is ok,btohqsg
it’s the assembly that’s the porblem haha,btohqsg
Can just go find those neighborhood furniture shop I guess,btohqsg
I am using ur bars. But paiseh to ask,btohqsg
hahah ok they are pros at retrofitting too sometimes,btohqsg
My friend buy secretlab chair and show off in fb,btohqsg
i just change new actuator nia,btohqsg
i see the carbon inside i also gaowei,btohqsg
216 parts + 320 labour + 100 cleaning,btohqsg
636. 26 feb I just pulled it out from workshop to replace water pump,btohqsg
How come but t got banned also,btohqsg
That’s a lot of money in 1 week,btohqsg
Very fuel efficient. Can do grab. lol,btohqsg
Lmao i no time do grab. Got full time job alr,btohqsg
Now need 30 yrs old then can get pdvl anyways,btohqsg
The phv co.s are being smart,btohqsg
And phasing them out in stages,btohqsg
So that the coe's introduced into the market aren't going in altogether and creating a surge of supply,btohqsg
By doing it in stages  they can control the number of coe's going back in and thus control prices,btohqsg
Higher COE is good for phv co.s and car sharing co.s because people are less likely to buy a car at the low to middle income sector,btohqsg
And will therefore use more of their services,btohqsg
so there is some form of market manipulation after all,btohqsg
Yes forgot to tag with this,btohqsg
@arnavgulianibro uk how to check whether a car was ex PHV converted to normal scheme?,btohqsg
There is no way to do so,btohqsg
Unless you buy over the car then email lta and try,btohqsg
wa like dis means got some car models i cannot buy alr,btohqsg
means their odometer will work magic abit,btohqsg
Why do you think people avoid some models or focus on ppi more,btohqsg
Because even if the odo has been moved back,btohqsg
There are signs of higher mileage,btohqsg
Also newer cars you plug into the ECU,btohqsg
Can tell if any mileage tampering has happened,btohqsg
How to check if a car u want to buy got any Malaysia summons?,btohqsg
Need to check the specific specs sir,btohqsg
When sell car can remove/replace with poorer parts as many as can and will not affect car value much? What parts can remove and sell?,btohqsg
change to $3 brake pads from taobao,btohqsg
Is it legal to remove the catalytic converter and sell the car?,btohqsg
ask here no use  we don't entertain stupid questions,btohqsg
No wonder CEL came on sia,btohqsg
Catalytic converter sell many. $1000 to above,btohqsg
Did he change from Peter to Pete or issit two diff person,btohqsg
But let's keep this one around,btohqsg
Last few iterations all go away too quick,btohqsg
Thought you just d walnut blasting? How many thousands KM since?,btohqsg
Buy a bucket seat type gaming chair?,btohqsg
but i will look for one,btohqsg
They didnt walnut blast my EGR,btohqsg
Cus they say cudnt take it out,btohqsg
If you're trying to make a sim rig... No need anything too fancy,btohqsg
i got two ‘sim rigs’ liao until no space hahaha,btohqsg
Get an office chair like ergotune or something lol,btohqsg
And can be uncomfortable for extended use,btohqsg
Building with no experience is dangerous 😂 later the Screw go thru the bucket seat and poke buttock 😂😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
Having a standing desk also good  can stand up to work when tired,btohqsg
He wants to pull a semi bucket from a car,btohqsg
And put wheels and a base on it,btohqsg
The stock ones are super heavy,btohqsg
And the aftermarket light ones.... For the price can buy like a good ergonomic chair,btohqsg
Looks and sounds good but not very practical,btohqsg
Like certain cars with huge wings,btohqsg
Huh ur civic no wing meh,btohqsg
I expect urs to be big,btohqsg

Then next can help me change seat,btohqsg

my old company has a driver that drive a ES300  for guests,btohqsg
Granted it's a luxurious sedan. But wonder how ride comfort and interior compares to Merc s class or BM 5 or 7?,btohqsg
es should be more like e class,btohqsg
yes LS is even higher level than that also,btohqsg
heard lexus very quiet on highway from relative who drove it,btohqsg
lhl used to be driven around by Lexus last time. heard now use 7 series,btohqsg
I rmb seeing his convoy before,btohqsg
Used to drive ls300 back in the day  zippy car nice handling. major turbo lag tho,btohqsg
Ngl im still trying to feel dis turbo lag for myself,btohqsg
I dun feel it in my current car,btohqsg
Unless you just can't tell the difference,btohqsg
but for some reason this current car has lesser bhp 1.5 compared to 1.6,btohqsg
then again diesel torque is high  so not really a fair comparison,btohqsg
but at some points  i do feel abit of lag when i wanna accelerate fast  can feel abit of lag. but its not sooo significant,btohqsg
Floor the pedal from 0 you can defn feel it,btohqsg
Yours company stingy. Use es300 easy maintain and more betters resell value than conti? Calculatives,btohqsg
Diesel low end torque very high,btohqsg
Unless you drive the same exact car,btohqsg
I recall your previous car being an SUV,btohqsg
If his mouth stingy  we wouldn't have an issue,btohqsg
Diesel won't struggle as much when you have a heavy load.,btohqsg
huh? my prev car sedan bro,btohqsg
i haven had the opportunity to drive an SUV yet,btohqsg
Is just diesel engine doesn't have as much explosive power,btohqsg
And diesel helps with the low end torque a bit,btohqsg
It's more like a slow burn,btohqsg
Most diesels tuned for low end,btohqsg
Like you don't use LNG to do BBQ  you use charcoal,btohqsg
i was talking about i dun feel turbo lag in the current car  then compare to a NA really not much difference LOL,btohqsg
need the torque to actually tow shit,btohqsg
that's why SAF vehicles mostly diesel still,btohqsg
Diesel engines are just more torquey and consistent with power and do so while being efficient,btohqsg
Hence all heavy vehicles tend to be diesel,btohqsg
Because they can pull weight and be efficient,btohqsg
You try running a petrol semi,btohqsg
You will need to refuel way more often or have huge tanks,btohqsg
But I went to the airport tech exhibition at MBS on wed  quite a few Chinese companies now have EV for ground support vehicle,btohqsg
technically speaking wouldn't EVs have high torque too?,btohqsg
But the torque is dependent on the motor rating,btohqsg
Towing with an ev is still not as efficient as a diesel,btohqsg
honestly china is one of the big players in EV  so im not really surprised tho. my qn is the downtime to charge,btohqsg
Because you get all the torque at the start,btohqsg
But due to single speed gearboxes and no power graph as such,btohqsg
Your torque is just there at the start,btohqsg
So you tend to run out of juice a lot quicker,btohqsg
That's why you see Tesla semi is a very different model of powertrain  from the motors to power delivery,btohqsg
Yup that's why Teslas still lose in a circuit to supercars but win at drag races,btohqsg
Try watching the carwow drags with the 992 turbo s vs taycan turbo s,btohqsg
I once had an argument with someone on a Tesla forum regarding lap times of a Tesla on track and how they're the best cars ever,btohqsg
Compared them to some track specific cars/performance cars,btohqsg
"Was told ""come on the cars used tuned for track  Tesla is stock""",btohqsg
People are rolling up to drag strips in the US in model 3s and beating supercars in a 1/4 mile 😂,btohqsg
1/4 mile sure  what about after the mile. And drag races are only fun for a bit,btohqsg
You've beaten the fastest road car,btohqsg
Track driving is just more involving and actually skill based and fun,btohqsg
Invite the Tesla to 99 bends,btohqsg
Got accident at Adam road there,btohqsg
I tell you  if it's raining,btohqsg
Driver capability on our roads drops to 20%,btohqsg
thanks i wont use PIE liao HAHAH,btohqsg

How am I supposed to go jurong without PIE,btohqsg
