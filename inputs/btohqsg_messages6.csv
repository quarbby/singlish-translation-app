My wife is holding on to LTVP. But i have 2 kids. I applied for 4room to,btohqsg
How long do your wife hold ltvp,btohqsg
Yup. Waiting for it to be ready next year,btohqsg
I applied for bto on 2018,btohqsg
Does anyone here rent a house under PPHS?,btohqsg
got kids as citizen different liao since its quite a sure way to convert to citizen from LTVP,btohqsg
Ooo cause i want to apply,btohqsg
can anyone guess where is this,btohqsg
living room has a small balcony but it's an unique layout,btohqsg
4r at $400+k  low floor like 3rd/4th,btohqsg
Im not sure but ive been keeping up w their vlogs for some time  theyve been doing reno for soooo long!,btohqsg
so secretive  anyway someone commented its at amk,btohqsg
since they want to remain secretive  then let the mystery of their BTO project remains,btohqsg
low floor can't expose since easy to guess  but for high floor  can only guess the range nia,btohqsg
those ballot for fun probably are depriving other genuine applicants from getting a chance  benefiting HDB nia,btohqsg
my colleague ballot for tampines of Aug 2020 which it has 3 projects  and he got 200+ which is considered low but he balloted for fun to see how his luck fares,btohqsg
my other colleague got 700+ but never attended the selection and ended up getting resale,btohqsg
she never ballot for fun  but she failed to apply leave for that day,btohqsg
as if luck is constant...... hahahaha,btohqsg
because he already has a house and tampines not enough to attract him,btohqsg
cmon man  other ppl have no home yet,btohqsg
what housing stage are you at now?,btohqsg
this launch is my first time balloting,btohqsg
i have a friend whos failed 4 times so far  haha,btohqsg
i have a cousin getting married but havent secured a BTO unit  haha,btohqsg
I was married like a week after I applied BTO,btohqsg
not sure am I considered lucky to get numbers within supplies using scheme,btohqsg
i have friends who failed 7 times. and went for resale. got tired of paying $10,btohqsg
i had my 1st ballot for Aug 2020 project  and thankfully had a good number,btohqsg
4th try to get a ballot number for me. I got mine thru sobf exercise.,btohqsg
I heard of cases where people balloted for fun and then drop their applications... Really detrimental to those who are in urgent need of a new home and also to themselves..My understanding is  you only have 2 chances where you are considered a first timer.Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
Last day for the bto exercise  guys. Good luck to those who have applied. To those who are keen but yet to submit  u have till the end of the day.,btohqsg
some people already have roofs over them but don't mind spending $20 a year to see how far their luck can go,btohqsg
actually I also no different from them since I ballot for 2 times and skipped the appointments but I was a genuine applicant who only keen in a water facing high storey unit,btohqsg
I dropped once too  but simply because the remaining available units not suitable for me. When I got my ballot number for my current unit  I guess I'm blessed.,btohqsg
but did you call to cancel your appointment?,btohqsg
never  the staff called me up instead on the day of selection,btohqsg
Yes. Very. Pricing wise also a bit inflated.,btohqsg
3r of TB is so underwhelmed compared to its 4r counterpart,btohqsg
in fact 2nd lowest besides MW,btohqsg
For me  I went down on the day to inform them that I won't be picking a unit. But I got tell them my reason. They informed me that regardless of reason  my 1 out of 2 first timer chances will be gone. I acknowledged  cos I rather burn one chance than to end up with a unit which is not suitable... I.e. bigger problem.,btohqsg
The shrewd decision is to apply for 3R this time.,btohqsg
oh  I never attended probably because I have gotten a double digit on my 3rd ballot,btohqsg
that's unless if one does not mind the size,btohqsg
if anyone is aiming for a Seaview HDB BTO  then just wait lor  should be coming within the next decade,btohqsg
but please note on the potential issue of sea rising level in Singapore,btohqsg
say the DPD of the launch now is as early as 4 years later should the pandemic gets better  with the progress of construction gets normal  plus MOP  9 years of wait before you can ballot for new BTO as a 2nd timer  that's if cooling measure remains the same,btohqsg
Oh. I didn't consider this before. Mainly because I've been looking at areas in the central.,btohqsg
DPD: delivery possession date  which HDB has to hand the keys over to the home owners,btohqsg
might as well don't go since already one chance used up,btohqsg
Actually... I was hoping they give chance upon hearing my reason. HAHA,btohqsg
But dang  no use. And I was around the area anyways for work.,btohqsg
wah ATAS area for HDB estates,btohqsg
Lucked out. But got it through sobf,btohqsg
aiya if I were you  I also would have went over to gamble,btohqsg
Ya lor. Hahah. Just try only ma.,btohqsg
OK as long as not repo unit,btohqsg
Ya. Its the balance units after SERS of tanglin halt,btohqsg
but the flat types of Dawson are smaller,btohqsg
3r at 60 compared to usual 68  4r at 85  usual 93,btohqsg
that's the only drawback besides the price,btohqsg
Aiks  few years ago  I tried 4 rounds only one round I got very bad number 10xx out of 850 units  I hate the system as I had to bought second hand,btohqsg
Haha when I collected keys and went in for the first time.... Me and my gf reaction was..WTF,btohqsg
But ok la. Be happy that got roof lor.,btohqsg
I believe the ballot for fun naughty applicants may have same thought s.  But maintain the first timer and aiming at the Aug 2021,btohqsg
you should have known upon application mah,btohqsg
karma for being a naughty applicant,btohqsg
Maybe I have a bad sensing of space ba. But ya haha,btohqsg
not naughty why applied 4x despite 3 times have numbers within supplies,btohqsg
self entitled MF botak  what would you do if that's your kid,btohqsg
3 times totally no number given,btohqsg
I had very bad luck for bto in the past  hopefully can have luck in the coming projects,btohqsg
so everytime trying on first timer luck right?,btohqsg
which location are you aiming for,btohqsg
The one I was in waiting list was non mature town,btohqsg
That is why this system is really stupid in certain way,btohqsg
But fare to most of the people,btohqsg
OK maybe you can come up with a better and a fairer system?,btohqsg
4r is always the hottest favourite in every launch,btohqsg
That time still had 5 room,btohqsg
so which project you ballot this time?,btohqsg
Ya this project caught my eye too. Not keen as an applicant  but just interested to see the offered price.,btohqsg
too far to the MRT  900m away and it faces AH too,btohqsg
Hougang is fake non mature lol,btohqsg
what to do since HDB claimed so,btohqsg
tiagong Canberra only surfaced a couple of years back??,btohqsg
Doesn't matter whether it's mature or non-mature as long as you like the location haha,btohqsg
Ok la. Not that far from mrt,btohqsg
as long as the amenities are within 300m plus MRT,btohqsg
Best plot for non mature estate,btohqsg
Near to MRT is the priority,btohqsg
wah Lao  15mins walk though in a relaxing pace of 60m/min,btohqsg
But hdb always v smart to launch desirable plot and undesirable plot together in the same estate. So those in second half of queue either have to choose the less popular one or waste one chance,btohqsg
Ya. But the main selling point of that project is it being in Queenstown I feel.,btohqsg
It should be as hotly contested as TB beacon  if not hotter.,btohqsg
if it's raining  walking 15 mins with no shelter from mrt is no joke,btohqsg
Ya. I'm not too familiar with that area  unsure if it's not sheltered tho.,btohqsg
don't think it'd be hotter since no atas seaview/sentosa view,btohqsg
probably cutting through the HDB estates but otherwise  further than 900m,btohqsg
earning many many times of $10  and imagine if they launch the hot plots together under one launch and non ideal plots another launch (not anywhere near MRT)  sure got people whining,btohqsg
Haha maybe. How high is the project tho? Don't have 40+ storeys?,btohqsg
Really learning alot from you guys from this chat,btohqsg
Yes. Should be. It's directly behind AH,btohqsg
No la. The Queenstown project in Aug. No info yet right.,btohqsg
800m means you must know how to cut through the estates,btohqsg
that should be the shortest distance,btohqsg
I'm guessing it's the poster child development in the next launch,btohqsg
hard to estimate the date since the late launch of this may,btohqsg
wah Lao mai lah so far..... i lower my expectation to within 400m for nearest MRT  just like TB to TB MRT,btohqsg
if all are within 400m range  best lol,btohqsg
never been to the above hawkers despite I'm a native sinkie,btohqsg
Oh u should.. maybe when this covid measures loosen. Food is good there.,btohqsg
But still  can try ma haha,btohqsg
I was going to say might be overhyped lol,btohqsg
Got legit good food there at OAR hawker.,btohqsg
OARFC is 400m away to my BTO  7mins walk from doorstep  under the hot sun is no joke,btohqsg
True. That side I rmb is damn hot.,btohqsg
Exit mrt walk over at noon is like entering an oven,btohqsg
if only got mall within the proximity,btohqsg
envious of residents staying next to mall and MRT,btohqsg
never seen a man with umbrella under a hot sun lol,btohqsg
but ya agree with you  sg mid day sun no joke,btohqsg
maybe can petition to MP to build a sheltered walkway?,btohqsg
omg got my music playing behind,btohqsg
Only the traffic junction not sheltered,btohqsg
I go OAR always dk what to eat. Those with long queue I nvr try before 😂,btohqsg
I haven't tried the lor mee,btohqsg
always see got queue but when no queue  my wife did not want to try,btohqsg
I also haven't try. Usually eat the other one with shorter queue,btohqsg
The lor mee queue is damn siao one.,btohqsg
The queue can fight the line for 4r TB beacon,btohqsg
It's like when you stay there you won't really feel like queuing 😂,btohqsg
I'd love to try it someday,btohqsg
too bad the only vegetarian stall there not nice one,btohqsg
Fact.Because u will think  what's the rush? I'm so near it anyways.,btohqsg
Only if you travel far to a place then you'll feel like queuing since you alr spent time travelling haha,btohqsg
I forgot which satay stall  it's damn nice.,btohqsg
Inside one. I don't really know how to tell u haha,btohqsg
tiagong that's the only one  I'm not familiar with the hawker,btohqsg
The vegetarian stall changed 1-2 years back,btohqsg
Dk if yall referring to old or new one,btohqsg
o you stay there now ah@Laoclaw,btohqsg
went there just last year first time,btohqsg
Wait u talking about vegetarian or satay?,btohqsg
so it should be new one as per what you described,btohqsg
but yeah the satay is reasonably priced,btohqsg
my side food court sells at 80¢,btohqsg
Try the ee mian there. Once u try no turning back. Last time drive there 1 week eat 4 times on lunch time🤤,btohqsg
Haven't been there in a year or so le,btohqsg
Which stall? Have so many haha,btohqsg
Ever since covid I go there 3-4 times a week coz it's my nearest hawker centre,btohqsg
Waiting for coffeeshop to open at Dakota Breeze for more food options,btohqsg
which channel are you at now?,btohqsg
Oh I buy from that stall quite often too. Usually get ban mian or the dumpling + fuzhou fishball noodle,btohqsg
whenever I go there  I aim currypoks,btohqsg
imagine the 4rooms in this round bto  90sqm internal,btohqsg
yes due to the 3sqm aircon ledge,btohqsg
We also always buy from this stall,btohqsg
so the size of the video should be 90sqm internal excluding balcony  it's the same as usual size of 4r,btohqsg
Btw they moved to another part alr fyi,btohqsg
I try this one time. The chicken cold leh.,btohqsg
sorry to disturb. any idea when will the may launch result will be out?,btohqsg
Eh? But crispy? I find ok like not very hot but still nice.,btohqsg
Around 3 weeks after application closes,btohqsg
Should be 3rd week or 4th,btohqsg
I forgot liao should be crispy,btohqsg
Try again when dine in lifted,btohqsg
We buy the curry chicken rice only  haven't really try the rest,btohqsg
All at home waiting for 4pm,btohqsg
lol joking  maybe went toilet or what  wait for 5min,btohqsg
Spot him drinking his magic cup,btohqsg

Hi everyone! Random question  do anyone here is waiting for Aug BTO application?And to those who applied on May  all the best! 😊,btohqsg
Aiming for Tampines but I feel like the chances for me is low even tho I'm first time applicant 😅,btohqsg
Ohh is it near the kovan one?,btohqsg
And you're applying as a first timer?,btohqsg
why low despite you're a FT?,btohqsg
The total projected units is 570 include both 4 and 5 rooms lol,btohqsg
So there's two projects for Tampines,btohqsg
oops soli I was mixed up,btohqsg
are your parents staying in tampines or bedok,btohqsg
Nice  goodluck to you then! May we get our respective choices haha 😊,btohqsg
Pasir Ris I don't think can use the proximity grant,btohqsg
oh nice scenery if you choose any unit here,btohqsg
Correct me if I'm wrong  proximity with parents is it for resale or BTO?,btohqsg
no such thing as proximity grant for BTO,btohqsg
Ya lor  a lot of dead bodies found there 😭,btohqsg
then choose the other project nearer to the MRT lor,btohqsg
But regardless I would love to get that area cause near to my workplace haha,btohqsg
yah  that one nearer to tampines west mrt,btohqsg
Ahh I see  maybe cause near to bedok reservoir haha,btohqsg
eh can used aircon be unininstall and used over at new house?,btohqsg
Good question but don't know the answer cause I don't even have a house 😅,btohqsg
if can be reused  can save $3k,btohqsg
that’s strange... it shouldn’t be 73 years lease left. it was built in the early or mid-1980s if I’m not wrong  with the rubbish chute inside the house,btohqsg
you mean those flats TOP in the 90s were the first batch not to include the rubbish chute within the house?,btohqsg
yeah  1995 houses (73 years lease left) and beyond do not have rubbish chutes in the units. an example would be the Woodlands Drive 72 flats,btohqsg
that’s the weird thing... it shouldn’t be because the flats in that area were built before 1990. oh well,btohqsg
I don't think this one is built in the 90s,btohqsg
1985 maybe they typo one digit,btohqsg
"3 levels of ""mall""  followed by 35 levels of housing. I wonder for the food option  will it be like a kopitiam  food court or something else since there's a wet market next to it based on the floor plan shown",btohqsg

Yea and theres only 32 units in total,btohqsg
did you manage to get it,btohqsg
No instead i got a 5 room there,btohqsg
Theres a linkbridge at 10 storey . Its to the carpark right ? But the carpark only 9th storey leh 😟 so still need go down stairs/lift to access carpark ?,btohqsg
It's possible for 9th floor of carpark to be 10th floor of another block due to different elevation or ceiling height etc. Best to look at 3d model to find out,btohqsg
Ohh i see !! Didnt know 😅 any idea where can i see the 3d model at?,btohqsg
Which project is this? May BTO?,btohqsg
It applies to other projects as well. There is a project where the carpark roof garden is level 7  but it links to lvl 8 of the adjacent block. from the block to the roof garden  there is a downward sloping ramp too  so it's not a surprise.,btohqsg
Ohh i see .. didnt know about this 😅 thank you 😅,btohqsg
Fun story. I have a friend who stays on lvl 5  his friends visited him. He asked them to park on lvl 5and walked over. They ended up on 6.Lolol,btohqsg
Sorry I can't find the 3d model for this project online,btohqsg
But unlikely to have stairs. Probably will have a ramp if really on different levels,btohqsg
Its okay thank you so much 🙏,btohqsg
Yup saw this too but didnt show about the carpark thing. Anyways its okay .,btohqsg
Hi all just want to check  I went to the first appointment but haven’t go to the second appointment  if I change job now  will it affect my bto? Thank you,btohqsg
No. They see the year when u apply your flat. What happens after they dont care,btohqsg
So if I change now and few month later I go for the second appointment they won’t check the cpf again?,btohqsg
still need to present your latest CPF statement,btohqsg
Hi  any groups for senja ridges/ senja heights/ senja valley?,btohqsg
Is there an enthic quota for SBF?,btohqsg
I didn't check when helping my mum apply 🤣,btohqsg
Like never show on their list,btohqsg
Haha. You have to go to the units. Then they will show at the side :),btohqsg
Alright treat $10 pay for lucky draw 😅,btohqsg
That's what we are all doing. 🤭,btohqsg
If you found one lmk please!,btohqsg

not sure is it varies on project,btohqsg
For grants will need 2020 whole year of salary right ? I was in maternity during that year for 4 months . Anyone knows whether can appeal or do anything about it ?,btohqsg
EmploymentYou or your spouse/ fiancé(e) must:Have worked continuously for 12 months prior^ to the flat applicationStill be working at the time you submitted the flat application,btohqsg
you or your spouse  means can use your husband's,btohqsg

I buying as a single . Cause we planning get 2 flats 🥱 1 each lo,btohqsg
Completed but still no keys. 😭,btohqsg
does that mean it’s a 3 room unit for each of you both?,btohqsg

👆☝️ To share for everyone.A safety for yourself and your family,btohqsg
Hi All  what are your chances of getting a sbf for FT with priority?,btohqsg
as long as don't get married 😉,btohqsg
you have applied for priority under the Parenthood Priority Scheme(PPS) and the Married Child Priority Scheme(MCPS). Your flat application will be balloted with the other PPS applications for 50% of the flat supply set aside for this scheme. If the application is not successful under the PPS  it will be balloted a second time with the other MCPS applicants for the 30% of the flat supply set aside for this scheme. If the application is also not successful under the MCPS  it will be balloted a third time in the first-timer group under the Public Scheme.,btohqsg
Example:UNITSBTO distribution for non-elderly in mature estatesFlat type: 2-room Flexi to 5-roomAssume there are 100 units available.First timers: 95% of the flats are set aside. This case 95 units.Within the 95%  the break down is:Families (PPS) = 30% (30 units)Families (MCPS) = 30% (30 units)Other families = 35% (35 units) (total add up to 95%)Second timers: 5% (This case only 5 units for you.)APPLICANTSAssuming total 400 families applied.300 are first timers  100 second timers.out of the first timers there arePPS family: 90MCPS family : 90 (and 30 PPS families also applied for MCPS  yes you can apply more than one scheme)just first timer family: 120TOTAL 300 first timers families,btohqsg
Second timer family: 100There are pps and mcps too  but to simplify I just ignore it  assume no one applied priority scheme.BALLOTFirst  hdb will ballot for top 100%  in this case is 100 units.HDB will first shortlist 100 families  then assign random number to these 100 families.FIRST TIMER DRAW95 units for first timerPPS DRAWS FIRST30 units for PPS: 90 families will lucky draw for the 30 chance. (take note  each family has 2 lucky draw ticket  but if you have failed twice  you will have extra tickets)Total 90 families ballot for 30 units.MCPS DRAWS SECOND30 units for MCPS: 90 families + the 30 PPS and MCPS families who failed ballot (To simplify  I just assume they unlucky and all 30 are unsuccessful in PPS draw).,btohqsg
ALL OTHER FIRST TIMER DRAWS35 units for Other families: 120 first timer families + 120 unsuccessful PPS & MCPS familiesTotal 240 families ballot for 35 units.End of first timer for now.95 families have now been shortlisted  205 first timer families are now out of the top 100%. (But they still have chance  just not with queue number smaller than 100)SECOND TIMER DRAWS5 units for second timer: 100 second timer families(no first timer involved)Total 100 second time families ballot for 5 units.100% SHORTLISTEDNow these 100 lucky families will be given random queue number from 1 to 100. If you are a damn lucky second timer you still can get number 1!!!!!!FINAL BALLOTNow  the rest of the 300 families  regardless first or second time  will all ballot to get a queue number from 101 onward  in this case up to 400.,btohqsg
(Note  first timer gets two lucky draw tickets  second timer only one  so in this case  205 first timer families = 410 tickets  95 second timer families = 95 tickets   total 505 tickets)HDB will shortlist applicants for up to 300% of the total flat supply.In this case those families with number 301 and above are out of the game. If you are a lucky second timer  you can get number 101 from this ballot.,btohqsg
Model is still available at hdb ?,btohqsg
Not available. I took it that time,btohqsg
When will we know the ballot number tho ? June 15?,btohqsg
Any idea melody spring p2  which block is nearer to the bus stop going towards yishun inter ah ?,btohqsg
you haven't been to the site yet?,btohqsg
Hi there. Just asking..... If key available for sbf how long is the procedure? 😅.,btohqsg
should be at least 6 months,btohqsg
selection exercise to AFL is 2-8 months?,btohqsg
Hi  for bto is it better to opt for OCS or no? Any recommendations?,btohqsg
I think this is the nearest bus to a mrt,btohqsg
Im thinking of 476a too !,btohqsg
Yea now still very inconvenient. Need some time. 476A got the views. But noisy la.,btohqsg
I taking 3 room   they only have 1 unit facing the road . But low level 😞,btohqsg
477a and 476a both also near road . Sure noisy🤷‍♀️,btohqsg
Not yet my turn to select unit . The only available one is at level 5,btohqsg
the only good thing about it is  can use CPF,btohqsg
but very important is to go to the site before selection since its a big purchase,btohqsg
I pass by there monthly actually . Gonna go the site to see the bus stops and all after i get my selection date,btohqsg
Yes ! But level 5 only 🥲 somemore dk got chance to get anot,btohqsg
even level 5  facing the dam also good leh since it has unblocked view,btohqsg
I see level 5 available is 05-28,btohqsg
Ya i very tempted to take it ! But only have 1 🥲,btohqsg
Got alot units actually   but facing inside,btohqsg
The view must be good 🥲hope i can get it !,btohqsg
but 05-28 is facing greenery woh,btohqsg
5r of stack 66/68 good view,btohqsg
the plot opposite is for high rise buildings,btohqsg
Then it doesnt matter alr 🥲,btohqsg
whether i get it or not i guess ?,btohqsg
you only want water facing unit ah,btohqsg
Actually i think still ok leh ! The high rise buildings wont be as near as other blocks are 😂,btohqsg
Yup but still   18 more people to go until me 🤷‍♀️,btohqsg
Haha best is unblocked and fixed view,btohqsg
Like facing the dam but too bad only for 2 such stacks,btohqsg
Can i know what is the price of the key to collect For 3 room Bto?,btohqsg
You mean the price of the house or the balance you have to pay upon getting keys?,btohqsg
I have a hle letter already  am i able to cancel and reapply again?,btohqsg
If can  use which reason to be able to reapply immediately?,btohqsg
My recent pay higher than my feb one 😂,btohqsg
What stage are you at now,btohqsg
If it makes a difference to which your loan amount can't cover the balance you must pay then maybe have to call up HDB and ask,btohqsg
Like every $500 can loan $30k,btohqsg
Still waiting for my selection appointment,btohqsg
Ohh i see ... ok thank you 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Like example your loan quantum is 400k and have to pay balance of 100k  you would like to minimise the loan as you have 150k  does not matter if your current pay is higher than the previous time you applied for HLE,btohqsg
others  please correct me if I am wrong thanks,btohqsg
Unless you want to take the max loan,btohqsg
In order to maximise the interest returns using cash/CPF,btohqsg
Actually my partner advised me if can  don use cash for it . Just buy using loan & cpf.,btohqsg

Yes the freedom of liquid cash,btohqsg
Will try to ask hdb tmr 🤔,btohqsg
So is it better to max the 25yrs loan or take a loan with shorter loan term?,btohqsg
if your cash is able to generate higher than 2.5-3% returns than CPFOA then maximise the loan tenure using CPF,btohqsg
otherwise use cash lor but you won't be able to save up unless you are a high earner,btohqsg
anybody know if example i have a 5room hdb now  can i ballot 5 room bto and sell mine when TOP?,btohqsg
can sell 2 months before your new house TOP  to have a buffer of 8 months to compare the offer made by the potential buyers,btohqsg
plus got the money to pay the balance which is the proceeds of the house upon getting keys unless you have sufficient lah,btohqsg
can 5 room to 5 room ah?,btohqsg
cos i always tot only can upgrade,btohqsg
you mean HDB disallows one to ballot the same size of flat?,btohqsg
You just can’t downgrade that’s all iirc,btohqsg
but my mum has chosen a 2r flexi via SBF  she owns a 4r currently,btohqsg
Lol no reason to have such rule,btohqsg
At which stage now for not flat at length -garden vales,btohqsg
If you sell your first flat after you have received the keys to your second one  then the resale levy is deducted from the sale proceeds. Any shortfall will have to be paid in cash. If you sell your flat first  then you need to pay the resale levy in cash before you’re allowed to take possession of your second flat.,btohqsg
for 30yo your ERS by 55yo would be $584k,btohqsg
anyone any idea if transfer OA to SA   still got accrued interest inccur on OA?,btohqsg
what about transferring from your SA to RA of your loved one? can't find any info  read can top from personal CPF but never stated from which account,btohqsg

Hi. I have 2 questions.1. If I buy resale flat now  can I apply BTO this year?2. I applied SBF hougang  waiting for ballot result. When I got ballot result  but there is no more units from hougang so will I be allowed to choose other units from different areas (same SBF)?,btohqsg
1. As long as MOP has met  yes,btohqsg
2. Nope unless it is under hougang,btohqsg
Oh no. If no more units under hougang  then no chance?,btohqsg
Yes. I mean if no more leftover units under hougang  I cannot choose other leftover units under different area? 😅 I really tot can choose other unit. Haha,btohqsg
Which blk? U are not in eastglen group?,btohqsg

Hi. Anyone waiting for Casa Spring bto here?,btohqsg
Question: I heard recently that if I applied for 5 room now as my first flat  my 2nd flat has to be 5 room or above  I cannot downgrade to smaller unit. Is that true?,btohqsg
Just search for Eastglen @ Canberra on telegram,btohqsg
but my mum is able to downsize her 4r,btohqsg
Ok. I was recently told and shocked.. the person who told me said can downgrade but buy resale  if bto must be same or upgrade,btohqsg
wow didn't know got such thing,btohqsg
Ya.. now we worried we applied for 5 room.. should we go for 4 room then? Haha,btohqsg
but you have already ballot for 5r right  regardless BTO or SBF,btohqsg
Ya we submitted for may 2021 bto 5 room,btohqsg
before you are thinking which stack to get,btohqsg
eh for home owners who have bought resale  you take the old aircon system from the previous owner or get a new one?,btohqsg
hmmm what if the old one is well maintained,btohqsg
Was told on the other group that this is true .. resale can downgrade but bto cannot,btohqsg
U mean bto 2nd chance time can only choose larger flat?,btohqsg
Then all the elderly how to downgrade. Flexi scheme is also bto leh,btohqsg
instead of hearing all the tiagongs,btohqsg
Can I get a new HDB flat if I used to/ still own an HDB flat  DBSS flat  or EC?Yes  provided that you only own/ owned 1 of the following units prior to your application:Flat bought from HDBEC/ DBSS flat bought from the developerHDB resale flat bought using a CPF Housing Grant (only applies to first-timer applicants)In essence  an eligible Singapore Citizen is allowed to buy the above properties twice in total  not twice per type of property.If you have already bought 2 such properties  you will not be eligible to apply for a new flat or be listed as an essential occupier in an application.,btohqsg
twice in total  not twice per type of property,btohqsg
hmm reading it again  it'll be third time of my mum to buy a new and subsidised flat from HDB,btohqsg
so that's how the rule of 'buying new HDB twice in a lifetime' came about,btohqsg

Thank you!! Hope i got a good q for this ballot 😅,btohqsg
As long as not many people staying in the flat the size is ok ba,btohqsg
xwany idea why they ask for aug to oct payslip?,btohqsg
Not the recent 3 months ?,btohqsg
Because i use the recent 3 months to apply for HLE leh,btohqsg
that was the period your application is right,btohqsg
my mum applied Nov SBF and she was asked to provide payslip from Aug to Oct,btohqsg
What isit for exactly ? 😅,btohqsg
for record lor  my mum is not taking loan also need to provide them with her payslip which I was puzzled too,btohqsg
I see .. okay thank you so much !,btohqsg
so let's say she's not working at all  she could not have the eligibility to get 2r flexi shortlease ah?,btohqsg
Oh seems like for short lease is 14k,btohqsg
OK so sounds like if a couple earn $14k  they are not eligible to ballot for BTO even if they are not taking loan,btohqsg
what are the options available for the couple then? can only do resale flats is it,btohqsg

Cannot see the sun coming from where ?,btohqsg
I only know this site is able. to help you but I don't know how to see lol,btohqsg
I did not have a hard time choosing my unit despite it'd be a sun facing one  I just aimed at my top reason to choose  the view  and the highest available unit of that stack,btohqsg
yah and also it was one of the most hot favourite stacks too,btohqsg
I read this article i also blur already idk whats a north south house 🥲,btohqsg
Wow people dont mind the sun 😂,btohqsg
As long your windows is facing North or South. You're safe,btohqsg
Cfm is either north or south hehe,btohqsg
Map will display an arrow pointing to N. Mean that is north.,btohqsg

So far stayed either facing north or south quite windy during year end.,btohqsg
Those windows is facing the east.,btohqsg
wanted to get stack 126 but tiagong the gulliemard camp plot is reserved for high rise residential buildings  so I changed my mind though there was a #17 storey available,btohqsg
#17 confirm windy. But higher u go will be humid.,btohqsg
what about mid floors at stack 132/130,btohqsg
No worries ! Didnt do anyth much ! 😅,btohqsg
I really don't know about sun and wind directions,btohqsg
let alone which months are windy and sunny,btohqsg
Should be very good position. As unit facing park. So no block should be windy,btohqsg
May til Sep will be hot,btohqsg
Morning sun only. Not too bad,btohqsg
must shift in liao then get to experience how is it,btohqsg
Anyone know when will the result be out for may bto,btohqsg
between mid and end of the month lol,btohqsg
The unit I want  window face south main door from inside look out facing north,btohqsg
does it mean one can only ballot once for BTO as he owns a resale flat?,btohqsg

Hi   anyone knows Senja Valley TOP date   thks,btohqsg
This part meaning its all done or havent ?,btohqsg
Living/Dining and bedroom floors are optional. So it depends on whether the previous person who selected the unit opted for it,btohqsg
tiagong from many the quality of the OCS by HDB cmi,btohqsg
optional component scheme  those you have asked above,btohqsg
Ohhhh i see  ! My friend told me durable leh 😂 bluff me liao lo,btohqsg
I have no way of knowing whether have all these or not before selecting unit or keys collection?,btohqsg
it will state on the papers that you would get to receive the letter from HDB,btohqsg
worst or not  I do not know too unless I engage someone over to check for me  think it costs about $200,btohqsg
After you got your ballot no  and before your selection,btohqsg
there are a lists of units for you to choose under the particular town you have ballot for,btohqsg
useful to shortlist the units of your choices instead of looking at your hp,btohqsg
Idk how to find or Never state 🥲,btohqsg

Hi All! I'm new to this group and saw this BTOHQ progress date via Google. I wonder if the progress % indicated can be viewed as an accurate assessment?,btohqsg
Nope  I believe the % is calculated based on estimated completion date,btohqsg
Hmm so meaning if the estimated completion date is not amended accurately  then it's gonna be wrong?,btohqsg
It's just interpolation based on launch date and estimated TOP date,btohqsg
Alternatively I can hope for the end date to be accurate,btohqsg
When will the results of the may bto be announced ?,btohqsg
maybe in few days time  otherwise month's end,btohqsg
In ur email it states mid june right,btohqsg
In the email it states end june right,btohqsg
they cancelled entire june appt due to phase 2 HA. Guess they will give out appt date after phase 2 HA.,btohqsg
Ya they said mid June so is it like on tues ?,btohqsg
Or will they delay because high application ?,btohqsg
Wont lah! They will release as promised.,btohqsg
Just calculate about 2 and half week to 3 weeks max,btohqsg
By coming friday is the lastest i guess,btohqsg
All the best to everyone who applied haahha,btohqsg

Hi all  is there a chat group on renovation cost and details? Like for comparison of contractors  furnitures  materials etc..,btohqsg
I don't know but you may search for Singapore renovation,btohqsg
Hi guys  i wanted to get some opinion  I recently got a sms from hdb for flat selection  for 3room mcnair heights.I am wondering if its a good project to get as the prices are high .also if I ever want to sell the house in the future will there be demand for it.I am of indian race  and I have heard that sometimes we can only sell to our own race so will this be a factor?Do share your thoughts on this.thank you,btohqsg
It's hard to predict future (who would have predicted Covid) so it depends also on your time horizon. 5 yrs? 10? 20? 30?For the racial quota  I think it is not that you must sell to same Indian race but that the quota allocated for your block may affect the ability of the new buyer to purchase your unit if quota not allocated enough for his or her race.,btohqsg
Invited to select unit in that project can consider strike lottery as it's very in demand right  so just enjoy it and don't worry too long into the future.,btohqsg
Thanks for the opinion.This BTO game I shall call it is very unpredictable as I feel that I need to get it right the first time as its like a long term investment and wait.,btohqsg
The last thing I'll ever want is to regret the decision made,btohqsg
as they say  public housing is not for investment!,btohqsg
Morning everyone!Otw to HDB to select my sbf  i am left with only Marsiling Grove option to choose! 😵‍💫,btohqsg
I wanted to get blocks with keys available but all taken up fast!,btohqsg
A nice project with great location,btohqsg
New woodlands hub and just need to wait for jb reopening,btohqsg
oh MG same launch with mine,btohqsg
Oh okay. Me too lol. Haha,btohqsg
It was written that the flat will be ready in 2023?,btohqsg
mine supposed to be Q2 2021,btohqsg
Really ah. Ok la see what they will be sharing with me.,btohqsg
Oh? Which SBF exercise is that?,btohqsg
Managed to get a flat there!,btohqsg
is it your desired choice ?,btohqsg
Yup! Flooring is included as well.,btohqsg
our projects were launched in may 2017,btohqsg
Anybody knows about if we are able to rent a rental flat while waiting for our flat to be ready?,btohqsg
I supposed you mean renting from HDB,btohqsg
Yup!I shall check out the rental scheme they have.,btohqsg
Currently staying with laws so they are planning to downgrade their house too. So we got nowhere to go.,btohqsg
means they haven't started looking for smaller house ?,btohqsg
can ask them to apply SBF 2r flexi at marsiling grove in Nov,btohqsg
They are currently waiting for their sbf result too next month!So by hook or crook i have to look for a rental flat asap.,btohqsg
no need to be so rush?,btohqsg
They applied during November2020 SBF  in woodlands area as well.,btohqsg
what did you mean by they are waiting for the SBF results,btohqsg
understand for construction but why would choosing of flat have a backlog of so many months? they limit the number of appointment to 2 a day or something?,btohqsg
Their selection of flat will be next month. Their balloted number is 36 out of 90!,btohqsg
the number of selections would increase progressively,btohqsg
wa that's very long. my mum was from Nov too but she has already selected her unit in March and just paid for the misc fee need to go down 2 more times,btohqsg
for sbf need to go down hdb hub 4x,btohqsg
No SBF and BTO during CB last year so there were many flats released in Aug and Nov 2020.,btohqsg
May and Aug were under one launch,btohqsg
Oh i think bto may and aug combined,btohqsg
my mum ballot for Nov though,btohqsg
Wahhhhh. Lucky them. I was wondering how ckme theirs so long.I called hdb to check and they told me to check hdb app end june on the details and select the flat on july.,btohqsg
Mature estate selection always earlier than non mature,btohqsg
Hi  relatively new to this game so I’m a blur ><How many times can you apply for HLE? say  for example flat will only be ready in 2024  do we submit a new HLE then or is the one with the first appt final? Sorry if the qns has been answered before,btohqsg
HLE is not tagged to any flat application. It's tagged to you. It's valid for dunno how many months upon issuance.,btohqsg
When you are getting closer to your key collection date  you should reapply for hle beforehand. They should send u a reminder on that. If I remember correctly  it's 6months.,btohqsg
So  you should apply beforehand to ensure that you have a valid Hle when u collect keys lor.,btohqsg
before selection exercise  once  forgot about the signing of AFL,btohqsg
Correct. Once for the selection of unit and another for key collection.,btohqsg
Ahhh! I see. 🙏🏼 thank you! There’s a change in our income hence we are wondering about the max loan we can get.,btohqsg
Suggest that you do financial planning of more than 6months in advance of key collection. If you foresee that your eligibility for loan is an issue due to income change  u may want to contact HDB early to seek extension or deferment of key collection in a bid to settle your finances.,btohqsg
thanks for the advice! we foresee an increase in income so we aren’t sure if we should look slightly above what is approve for now or just stick to it,btohqsg
Can always get reapply again for HLE when the time comes. It's free.,btohqsg
if the loan quantum remains the same  no point in doing HLE again,btohqsg
I mean the loan amount you need,btohqsg
But usually the previous hle already expired le,btohqsg
hi  um is there any more balance flat in ang mo kio?,btohqsg
Anyone wanna guess where the Nov 2021 bto will be. My suspicion is McNair road,btohqsg
unless you are young  if not i think the wait is going to be minimally 7 to 10 years for a HDB,btohqsg
if you are young and married at the age of 21  and if you are lucky  you might get your BTO at the age of 28  earliest,btohqsg
Heard with covid  it's gonna take longer,btohqsg
yes bro. the silver lining is  save up more CPF OA  take letter loan  and also pay lesser interest. In the mean while  can leverage on the yearly compound interest given by CPF lor,btohqsg
im guessing it should be within next week,btohqsg
i thought it's supposed to be this week,btohqsg
First timer have 2 ballot chances right ? Then if have select MCPS mean another chance right ?,btohqsg
