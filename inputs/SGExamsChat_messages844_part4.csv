idk why i smell there's more more muskier or masculine hormone scent from most guys,btohqsg
even at the start of the day,btohqsg
i think its because it's the start of the day,btohqsg
at the point  i would prefer to get choked by cologne,btohqsg
no leh  girls also tend to not shower early in the morning as well,btohqsg
like they actually bother to maintain their skin + body routines,btohqsg
can everyone just take a morning shower,btohqsg
i rly donâ€™t get why that guy was getting hate,btohqsg
the hate he got was more about his attitude anyways,btohqsg
the way he definitely assumed things as such,btohqsg
validated opinions  sure but one that throws ppl off,btohqsg
especially in r/sgexams but i gave up tracking subreddit,btohqsg
he roams around multiple reddit communities,btohqsg
so maybe it's more of his character & preference with doing stuff,btohqsg
i know people who appear like red flags online  but are total sweethearts irl,btohqsg
People are more willing to pull off bold stunts under the guise of anonymity (on the internet) no?,btohqsg
but there's generally a lesser amount of etiquette of showing basic respect  politeness and integrity online,btohqsg
at least from my own observations since 2017,btohqsg
it should be due to this effect,btohqsg
things may be changing for the better  but generally some things are the same,btohqsg
just a bit more disguised or mixed intentions,btohqsg
it's like that mike tyson quote,btohqsg
"""Social media made y'all way too comfortable with disrespecting people and not getting punched in the face for it.""",btohqsg
"i know ah  but i personally never understood or could ever find a reasonable explanation to console myself with that common assumption of believing the virtual world stays separate from the real life world ""idea""which isn't wrong either  but most don't know1)WHENto show & understand differentiated forms of Virtual WorldOnline  vsIn-real Lifepersonalities2)WHYis it a tendency to convince or want others to do something  but not be open to hearing out more perspectives & long-windedness3)WHATis the ""supposedly"" generalized idea ofOnline Etiquetteto show  as compared to whether it's something to normalize for both the virtual vs reality world  and like whether there're any contrast weather they can notably politely try to respectfully understand",btohqsg
mike tyson and other notable industry-specified professionals  get drained so fast when they socially interact with a lot of other online users,btohqsg
"im just staring at the reception to his recent match that he ""lost""",btohqsg
this is a real struggle  even for those people who aren't considered to be on-par with any kind of famous entertainment industry figures,btohqsg
even though they have fans  sure but they tend to have separate cultures with all their specified communities,btohqsg
at least before the internet just decided to blotch everything together,btohqsg
were you always awake as well.. lol,btohqsg
night is the only alone time + watching football match also,btohqsg
I only know historia from attack on titan,btohqsg
Are there still any places to donate ur old assignment books and stuff,btohqsg
I guess but might take awhile?,btohqsg
my brain had a aneurysm reading that,btohqsg
Ye was overseas during then rip,btohqsg
hmmm which mod should i ping,btohqsg
But tbh I feel that they should not have signed Mbappe,btohqsg
He's kind of a flop at Real Madrid,btohqsg
Oh and it's football not soccer ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
football means something else in America,btohqsg
isn't it the other way round  cuz soccer came from the french football sport? iirc soccer is usually meant for football games internationally speaking  but americans have their own version  as wellwhich is american football  an evolution of rugby & soccer,btohqsg
but ngl which person sg uses mostly British English  outside of schools & maybe work,btohqsg
you just don't realise how much of the stuff we use is british english,btohqsg
hii guys random but can yall deco my tree:))https://decomytree.com/home?hashedId=QqdxPdtVDmfk&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaYWSmAhrrt121dgpLj-zAcjJudCRG60dI_ufvpI2BeDHMKD80EGlw20uwE_aem_P3SH1JrByRoloTOnXaXE-Aif yall free Hahha,btohqsg
ðŸ¥´ terrorist taken control of Syria,btohqsg
nobody local has the morale to fight...it was bound to happen,btohqsg
"i meant internet social chatting wise ppl in sg use it more interchangeably instead of just simply using one type of Englishlike when it comes remembering the rules of ""correct"" english that since SG used to be a pre-existing british colonial nation  no one really gives a damn outside of official settings like school / work",btohqsg
people donâ€™t use it interchangeably really,btohqsg
itâ€™s just whatâ€™s ingrained in most of us,btohqsg
