the scirocco R is a good car too,btohqsg
Thanks all bro for the advice,btohqsg
Same dq250 trans as the 2.0L. Which is also not spared from the deadly mu,btohqsg
Why sad. If i were to get a scirocco  i would get the 1.4. Super fuel efficient,btohqsg
Buying the 2.0L is like buying the 650i. Some will say its dumb,btohqsg
With all the gabra bimmers hogging the headlines now vw owners safe liao,btohqsg
I know of someone that drives the 1.4-litre rocco. He changed his mechatronics unit twice during his ownership. And yet  he says his rocco is one of the pretty “not bad” ones.So see if you brave enough to buy🤭-R,btohqsg
Coz I never try vv b4 I researching which model is best. Come down to golf Vs Scirocco,btohqsg
Scirocco. Because golf price is skyrocketing for the gti and r,btohqsg
Both the 1.4 variants of the golf and scirocco uses the same platform tho-R,btohqsg
Golf better for family  roc better for xmm,btohqsg
https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1110246I think the passat wagon seems pretty good for a family car too😍-R,btohqsg
Street rep not as bad as the f10  but cant say the same for reliability,btohqsg
640 can already. No need 650.,btohqsg
If want 650  go for m6,btohqsg
Car times? Move on with life better...,btohqsg

Superbike in Singapore can install quick shifter.Don't need to clutch in.,btohqsg
im talking abt sequential manual in cars,btohqsg
1.4Litre MU repair Ard 1 500 😂👍Ask him change golf R. MU repair 3500😜,btohqsg
"Ya I know😂Same  quick shift ma😂👍It's costly for manufacturer to put in.Like you said Anything has ""race use"" modifications will not be allow on street used I believe 😀",btohqsg
Don’t know how many have been bought by broke bois that cheap out on repairs,btohqsg
YOLO 😂1.4L not expensive to repair,btohqsg
What is your definition of “not expensive” sir,btohqsg
i only see volvo catch on fire twice,btohqsg
Not sure if its illegal but lta does entertain request from changing the teans from manual to auto  and vice versa. And i know people who had it done.,btohqsg
But there was a manual car that installed a sequential shifter  and was quite well known  so it could be legal,btohqsg
Haha my circle not so atas. My friend changed his 135i auto to manual,btohqsg
manual to seq manual v hard,btohqsg
i heard only gtr do in sg,btohqsg
Thats so troublesome  why not get a auto one instead lol,btohqsg
because seq manual will have less drivetrain loss  faster shifting and sounds cooler,btohqsg
all those GT3 cars in FIA racing series use seq manual,btohqsg
I mean like why mess with the gtr gearbox unless its going to be a full blown race car. For the sound  you can install aluminium bushings for the transmission  should get a similar whine,btohqsg
Even road legal prosche GT3? Also comes with seq shifter?,btohqsg
Porsche? U ask him Suzuki swift ok la.,btohqsg
Then he will talk abt swift until got dragons n tigers,btohqsg
Straight cut gears makes the special whining sound on the sequential box,btohqsg

Lol bruh your patience much more than me still run out,btohqsg
That guy is literally same guy as Nissan,btohqsg
Maybe he is the legendary troll who always post about other people's  being cheap and shitty driving etc etc,btohqsg
