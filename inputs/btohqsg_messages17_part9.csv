Does anyone know the Feb 2023 bto launch‚Ä¶ roughly which date in June to go ballot?,btohqsg
Can Cancel  forgo the $1000 if you haven‚Äôt sign your lease yet. If you already signed  then the penalty is 5%. Once cancelled  you‚Äôre  banned from applying for BTO for a year. But from what I heard  you can appeal against the ban. Success rate I am not sure.,btohqsg
They havent open up for sbf let us know which are the houses available?,btohqsg
Usually they will open up early to let us know isnt it?,btohqsg
No. It's on May 30 as reported in the news,btohqsg

@all anyone have a unit at west glades?,btohqsg
My new flat the window at living room is facing south west,btohqsg
I was in the same situation but with hle. Just leave that section blank or put in whatever payslips she has. As long as got upload the student letter  hdb will ignore whatever income she has.,btohqsg
Where to upload the student letter? üòÖ,btohqsg
if they request for it  they will have a section for you to upload under documents required,btohqsg
Oh ok thanks thanks when i did the hfe there wasn't any option.,btohqsg
Probably this field  if indicate that she is student  they will ask for the letter,btohqsg

just fyi to anyone who might read this  there's a private group formed during the BTO stage of sunsails  and i believe the bulk of residents are there. verification can be done athttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdokZiWJfyjTqPvU0ClSJWbzcxSdk21IyhUe7A9ISM63j-qIw/viewform(note: do NOT contact me to process this form  i am NOT an admin of this group),btohqsg
How to refer to our HLE loan amount again?Want to do some rough calculations,btohqsg
Wanna ask... if theres launch..b4 applying can see weather the layout is open kitchen and gt balcony ? Just curious cos im aiming for that kind of unit for 4 room,btohqsg
Firstly u must get a good Q then u can plan your desire unit like have balcony etc.... Now is still too early to think right.Before applying of course can see layout and floorplan. Applying of BTO & SBF have deadline just apply before,btohqsg
My sister Q number at Yishun Boardwalk also cannot get a balcony unit. Balcony unit is limited. Good Q number all will go snap out . Hope u can get a good Q number la,btohqsg
Where can we find the layout and floorplan of projects?,btohqsg
Yes whenever hdb launch bto exercise they will provide the information,btohqsg
my advice is go ahead directly to apply BTO location u likeapplying BTO is similar like lucky draw  not every one can get  and very difficult to getregarding decorations or layout  this is your last priority,btohqsg
1st time applying?Wait till BTO launch then can see.,btohqsg
Me 3rd time then get a number within flaymt supply last year may 2022.,btohqsg
1st 2 tries all out of Q,btohqsg
Ballot la . Some lucky 1st time get some 12 times also can't getU still want to Think of Choosing baconly unit haha,btohqsg
That's why  ballot first . Can get Q number then plan,btohqsg
Hello just to ask  how does hdb calculate the 12 mths income to determine how much grants and loan the couple will get? Is there a fixed formula for it?,btohqsg
Gross income of all applicants (including essential occupier)How to calculate Gross Income:Applicants + Occupier Salary + Recurring allowancesIncluded: Shift Allowance  Transport Allowance  Meal Allowance  Commissions  Anything that you claim/recieve every month frequently.Excluded: AWS (13th month)  Performance Bonus  One time bonus  One time claimsGross Income does not include Employer's CPF Contributions,btohqsg
Thanks.How about if 1 of the applicants only started working for about 4 months?How do we calculate the average income for the past 12 months?Is it ($xxxx x 4)/12?,btohqsg
I think they have to wait until they are in the new job for 1 yr ba. Coz for enhanced housing grant you need to be working for at least 1 yr to qualify,btohqsg
This is what i had understood,btohqsg
It's ($xxxx X 4) / 4 for my case. I only worked 4 months within the past 12 months and they just divided it by number of months you worked lol... My EHG was issued like few days ago so I think should be quite updated? Not sure for your case maybe can check with hdb,btohqsg
Because of this my grant dropped precipitously,btohqsg
Thanks. I will check with hdb for more info :),btohqsg
