aku sampai bawak satu sweatshirt then pakai jacket HAHA,btohqsg
Aku tgh pakai like sweatshirt top,btohqsg
nissan skyline s2000 nismo 50th anniversary edition,btohqsg
is this on god or for real???,btohqsg
Tats not as bad as my fren confidently saying r35 honda skyline,btohqsg
And honda stream as evo wagon ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
My brain just lag big time when she said tat,btohqsg
midnight mary rsz now can advertise as evo wagon on sgcarmart alr,btohqsg
that one lancer ex gt2.0 la,btohqsg
isap ape sampai bute mcm tu bro,btohqsg
for what people mod mpv or spend so much lolol,btohqsg
but put exhaust all like bruh,btohqsg
ya u can think itâ€™s fine to mod stream,btohqsg
pls kao aku da terikot2 ape kao ckp au,btohqsg
kk nnti kene marah ckp melayu,btohqsg
u think got tuner stream ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
omg how many times u say this,btohqsg
bro people will put universal lip and say tuner,btohqsg
I mean the Stream at IAM is pretty decent.,btohqsg
but I recalled got one white Stream gg rice (not at IAM),btohqsg
kinda defeats the purpose of an MPV but itâ€™s decent considering there arenâ€™t much heavily minded Streams here.,btohqsg
but for what u mod a stream lol,btohqsg
I mean every car show will have someone mod,btohqsg
not like performance mods make a diff+ keep in mind itâ€™s old,btohqsg
^ lowered and static Honda Stream,btohqsg
At least didn't modify a Sienta,btohqsg
people need to understand that camber if not the most practical mod,btohqsg
Actually in Singapore  modifying a car is not practical at all cus you will somehow end up with TP and LTA being an inconvenience of your time. ðŸ˜“,btohqsg
just stay within ur needs and LTAâ€™s guidelines everything is fine,btohqsg
must straight pipe a normal stream and label as MIDNIGHT,btohqsg
TP and LTA wonâ€™t inconvenience you if u donâ€™t do illegal mods what,btohqsg
If motorcycle can kind of understand  my s4 is loud enough so ppl can hear me. Driver cannot see me? At least can hear me.,btohqsg
Cars louder good. Pesky pedestrians who listen to music and blindly cross roads are dangerous,btohqsg
Besides exhaust is not the only mod to do. Suspensions  engine bay deco  body kits. There are seriously tons more to do that are perfectly legal.,btohqsg
but some idiots will drive loudly through neighbourhoods at 3am ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
To haunt people and wake them up from nightmares ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
That one is sad Lor. If only LTA allow valvetronic exhaust mods i donâ€™t mind it if it gets late at night.,btohqsg
actually why they donâ€™t allow ah,btohqsg
cos without the valves is damn loud right,btohqsg
If no valves  it would be fixed with loud pipes,btohqsg
I bet no stream here can do 200kmh,btohqsg
my dad told me when otw cameron he got reach,btohqsg
but tht one our old car,btohqsg
idk lor i sleeping at tht time,btohqsg
aiya like that my greatgrandfather also shoot down people in war la,btohqsg
but wah 3am i angry sia,btohqsg
max is like 100+ maybe 170-180,btohqsg
But gg v hard for stream to do 200,btohqsg
