🚀Pika World Insights- 4 May 2022🚀🏀Valuation and Expectation🎢The equity market has been under pressure in the sea of uncertainty. The relief rally appears short-lived on several occasions  and indices might still have room for downward pressure before recovery. The S&P 500 forward P/E multiple is around 17.4  a drop from 21.0 at the start of the year.This is converging to a 10-year average which is around 16.9 times. Nonetheless  some commenters believed the index is still rich in one variable: earnings.🏀An optimistic outlook?💡While earnings have sometimes been revised upwards  many guidance assumptions might be over-optimistic. The old bell of Fed hike to fight off inflation is one of them. Second  supply chains constraint from the Covid-19 rise in China has not eased. Third  the Russia-Ukraine war is affecting the sales and revenues of corporations globally.💰A recession simmering?💎Such macroeconomic challenges are pivoting the economy towards the path of recession. If it happens  the S&P 500 is at risk  which typically corrects around 25% during a recession. As a result  companies may also start to revise downward their EPS.The moving parts of the economy are shaking. The final piece of immediate game changer might be the Fed  which will release its monetary policy at 2 am Singapore time on Thursday.Stay tuned as Pika World shares our latest insights with you!It is 4 May   Wednesday  7 am in Singapore and 7 pm in New York. Pika World wishes you a splendid day of work ahead!,btohqsg
