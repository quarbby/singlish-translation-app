They spend more to save more!,btohqsg
And i think having a business allows you to write off more things as a tax relief? correct me if i am wrong,btohqsg
I make up to $80/hr I can imagine those ppl making several hundreds or thousands per hr it is worth the cost of 5-10k per month for a private accountant,btohqsg
Hi do you know how they did it? Do I need to register a business for it to be convincing? Currently I am a full time salaried worker only dont think it is convincing to book my holiday travel expense as tax deductible expenses.,btohqsg
It is not worth doing it for a dormant company. You pay so much more in filing your tax returns and registration fee,btohqsg
I have registered a business as sole proprietorship so don't enjoy all the tax savings,btohqsg
are you also a full time salaried worker?,btohqsg
Yes it's not illegal. just need to make sure no comflict of interest with your existing company and they don't have concerns if they ever finds out.Do you file income tax under this company you registered?,btohqsg
if you choose to not register a company and collect freelance work payment under your own name as in individual  whatever income will be taxable right? so this is one benefit of registering a company?,btohqsg
Anyway I think we already sidetrack too much from CC to tax avoidance,btohqsg
ok we discuss in private. 😅,btohqsg
Maybe@ChrisHMSGcan create a tax avoidance master course to share more,btohqsg
This one is professional tax advisor already  i think need MAS license one,btohqsg
Yes definitely costs more than $88 or 888,btohqsg
These people don't easily share for free. If not their rice bowl broken,btohqsg
I cannot pay my tax and insurance anymore using grabpay. Is the best way by cardup with maybank family card?,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check if use posb app scan and pay sgqr and use live fresh cc to pay  considered online txn?,btohqsg
think that is paynow which is paid from bank account not card,btohqsg
XNAP paired with apple pay is considered mobile payment category is that right?,btohqsg
Why use cardup when u can just use fnf on axs,btohqsg
online mobile in-app (not mobile contactless),btohqsg
fnf on cardup isnt it also 0.3%?,btohqsg
ya then whats the point  might as well i just use fnf to axs where there's no cardup fees,btohqsg
yup or use other cards via Cardup.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution card 10x rewards excluded Kris+ comfort cab book. Even its stated clearly comfort transportation.,btohqsg
Ya this is one whole buggy app payment that I want to avoid using  when im in rush to book a taxi,btohqsg
Yup  guess this is not the ideal card to work with kris+ app. Plus they got serious risk of having misrepresentation of their credit card CVP.,btohqsg
Yes  then use Flashpay to pay Tax. But there is still a better way to use up GPMC. Pls do not ask me. I am fered after this $88 course  this method will be gone.,btohqsg
Where will you recommend to place deposit if balance in ocbc360 has maxed out 100 000?,btohqsg
Hi  gurus. Can cardup or ipaymy be used to pay credit card bill? I failed at use nets flashpay to pay credit card bills  want to find an alternative way to do it,btohqsg
depends what is your requirements  if fuss free can consider SIF Gosaver  GXS Bank  Maybank iSavvy and SCB Esaver. if you are willing to work a bit harder HSBC EGA ..,btohqsg
EGA interest is only for incremental balance?,btohqsg
EGA has 2 parts  1 is the bonus interest 4.55%  if you put in March-June cycle is pegged to reference month Feb. The other part is the 1% for the everyday+ which peg to previous month which you need do 2K in and 5xFAST out every 2 months,btohqsg
Hi  do you guys think now is still worth to buy dbs bank stock?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGu mentioned in the video you won’t discuss things that could be considered “unethical” on the courses or private telegram group. How about hacks like CC>Grab>CC ?,btohqsg
This is not considered unethical  but a loophole.Unethical is like you make XNAP payment $1000 to hawker for a $100 meal then ask for refund $900 because you keyed in one more zero,btohqsg
No doubt there is a thin line between unethical and loophole and ofte a grey area. But ask yourself  can you sleep well doing this. that will be your answer,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may I check if booking Air ticket and Hotel for overseas trip qualifies for UOB Evol online spend category?,btohqsg
One more unethical example: One particular transport turned financial services company  suddenly block payments to prepaid e-wallets without notice until someone flagged it online. The information was only distributed by online communities without official notice from the said company. So  is this unethical?,btohqsg
I never say who ah  don't speculate,btohqsg
May i know what is the base interest for hsbc EGA?,btohqsg
And to meet the criteria for spendings  does it mean i xfer $2000 from another bank account into hsbc EGA  and i make 5 $1 transfers ( 5 transactions) and transfer out the rest of the money?,btohqsg
Yup  recent update from what I read.,btohqsg
kinda shocked  711 doesn't accept amex card😂,btohqsg
yes for everyday+ just 2K in and 5 x FAST $1 out will do the trick on the 1st and 3rd month cycle,btohqsg
OCBC FD 8 months higher returns,btohqsg
Sorry  what does it mean by 1st and 3rd month cycle?,btohqsg
Since the interest rate is so low  i am wondering once i put the 2k in  can i take it out,btohqsg
if you see HSBC everyday+ promo  once you do 2K in and 5 x FAST $1 out is for 2 month period only  you will see it when you receive the sms,btohqsg
now no more  now is 3.55 for 5 mths,btohqsg
