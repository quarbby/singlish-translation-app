cos apparently they focus more on explns,btohqsg
physics tbh has the least content,btohqsg
I can foresee u are gonna talk about ur phy in uni,btohqsg
ah he can psycho u not to drop his fav subject,btohqsg
but when i say dont drop chem....,btohqsg
ya plus h1 takes out stuff like g field which is actl kinda fun,btohqsg
just stick with 2 h2s ba,btohqsg
Every phy student knows QP is the most fun topic,btohqsg
hmm but theoretically speaking if i cld master essays thn drop chem will b worth ah,btohqsg
But didn't u said u like chem more,btohqsg
oh no bedok pissed off kumargod,btohqsg
And like dropping chem severly limits ur options,btohqsg
most content heavy shit i ever encountered,btohqsg
realistically dropping econs closes the least doors since u dont really need econs to do econs in uni,btohqsg
speaking of organic chem  its rly nothing compared to h2 bio or organic chem at higher levels,btohqsg
Dropping econs also least worth at the same time arh,btohqsg
diff between h2 and h1 rite,btohqsg
The drop in content is pretty little,btohqsg
Chem more manageable than bio in air level,btohqsg
Organic chem is literally 40-45% of the entire H2 chem syb,btohqsg
but the chance to do well is harder for h2 imo,btohqsg
h1 the cohort is generally not so good in econs  so if u are above avg  A/B is very easy to get,btohqsg
Isnt that true for all subs,btohqsg
humans dist rate always very low,btohqsg
i see h2 sciences ard 40-45% (except for chem),btohqsg
idk chem h1 lowest distinction rate rite,btohqsg
but thats not because its hard ba,btohqsg
its because of the cohort's standard,btohqsg
Math is the highest among all subjects lmao,btohqsg
Ya i meant i was talking about sciences,btohqsg
Its the easiest to score A in,btohqsg
Anyone got good h2 bio teacher,btohqsg
does ur sch still have cool blue/hot pink,btohqsg
i was 1 of the cohort leaders for that nonsense,btohqsg
can look on some of the tuition website,btohqsg
In uni became the other way round,btohqsg
me  but i give free lessons,btohqsg
but i personally dont use any tutor so idk anyone,btohqsg
But phy is still relatively mush easier to score,btohqsg
its like a weekly night study session in j2,btohqsg
Any tutors want a chem tutor to teach them? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya they have snack and shit,btohqsg
they will get a teacher there,btohqsg
i will be a full time tutor if i no NS,btohqsg
full time refers to ppl who graduate from uni and teach tuition only,btohqsg
i thot max is 90 HAHAHA,btohqsg
Ah help how to do well,btohqsg
and how old ar eu now,btohqsg
idk   i dont use any tutor at all but i see alot of people using tutors nowadays,btohqsg
im not getting any new intakes,btohqsg
