Updates on Moya Asia ($0.070/$0.071)- the significant happening for yesterday  is there was big sell down which cleared all $0.069 but then hidden buyers swamped in to protect $0.069 and then eat up $0.070 gradually before doing a nice weekly close at $0.071.- Chart wise  Moya is finally trading above the 4 years downtrend line (day/week/month)- MACD in nice green territoryThis quick recovery IMO  is strength in the counter  and likely because they are aiming upwards. With results coming out anytime this week  I expect some play and this week to be an exciting one  considering that Penny Leader JT ran yesterday which will wake up other sleeping pennies.DYODD#itiscoming#itstime#thetimetoriskisnow,btohqsg

90% of consolidated stocks don't do well. It's the reason why they need to do consolidation in the first place.,btohqsg
I only know u ASK nia,btohqsg
Yup! Woodland Ave 1 Kopi shop..Open around 1 to 2 am,btohqsg
Yes  ghim moh lots of good food,btohqsg
Bookmark for the next food adventure!,btohqsg
After 1 pm no more.. so need to early,btohqsg
Oh I see.. MC go spot him.. follow by us.. haha,btohqsg
They consolidate 1:20.$0.01 become $0.20.Anyways don’t jump into Amos. Wait for Danny Lien to stop . Once he stop  I believe they players will come.I heard he have sold 200 mil shares before consolidation and only Bbs have ability to collect that much.Retailers took 20mil shares at best. If best case 50 mil is with retailersChips are with the players now. My view but don’t buy. It will take some time to materialise,btohqsg
Great insight! Thank you for sharing!,btohqsg
It better you go night time.. 24 hours coffeeshop,btohqsg
one of ze besy wtm in sg,btohqsg
Yea he needed money that’s what I heard after I asked around. So no choice . Even Low price he give up his shares . BBs collect cheap before consolidation from him.$0.010 they buy from him  when Amos NAV $0.03x,btohqsg
Damn long never go golden mile,btohqsg
dat hc lot of good food,btohqsg
Last time Tai Seng have.. then move out..,btohqsg
The parking issue specially the hawker,btohqsg
1st day they traded after consolidation  they players already come to stack the counter. Hence  I believe when the time comes this will be played.Other counters  for example no interest from any operators will have no stacks at all.,btohqsg
Only for Amos stuckist  the rest who not in  please don’t buy thanks 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Amos gearing only 8.8%.NAV $0.6736.Just wait for Danny to stop or finish selling  then it it can recover,btohqsg
Anyways not the time to buy  since selling is evident. When the time comes  I will hoot for revenge. Meantime stay out of this counter,btohqsg

Excelpoint is just a component distributor and it is mainly in semiconductor industry   should not be directly compared with the others bah  ... instead  it should be compared with serial system  which is in the same industry...,btohqsg

It did try before.. free pass by must try out..,btohqsg
dk leh this one furion subject matter expert,btohqsg
Their net profit is indeed very little...which is very strange... usually if components are on allocation   and the they have stocks  can sell many fold higher price than usual... 🤔🤦‍♂,btohqsg
their staff costs and admin expenses quite high.. they attribute it to biz trips im like huh,btohqsg
desmond pls study nordic appreciate comments,btohqsg
No comment I need time to read financial report,btohqsg
must respect our bro and sis,btohqsg
This was happened during the y2k  when IC/memory are on allocation... the prices shot rocket high...,btohqsg
Their customers are cm/ems  like venture/Flextronics etc...,btohqsg
VIRUS UPDATE:An 80-year-old S'porean woman is the 42nd patient to die from Covid-19 complications locally.She had not been vaccinated against Covid-19  and had a history of diabetes  hypertension and atrial fibrillation.➡️https://bit.ly/2VD0nH8Follow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates.,btohqsg
hmm u mean it's normal for admin expenses to skyrocket during this period of semicon shortage ah? idk wat happened during y2k era,btohqsg

At the moment  the usual price of a passive part  such as diode  which only a few cents   can cost more than 10+ cents or higher...same for active parts...,btohqsg

My beloved bro  Maclaren take vaccine larI buy you one lorry MSW,btohqsg
By right  admin should not increase too much... unless they are paying good comm to their sales team/channel partner..🤔,btohqsg
ya that was the other possibility i tot of too,btohqsg
Sales and distribution costs increased by 51.0% from US$15.8 million to US$23.9 million and generaland administrative expense increased by 70.1% from US$7.3 million to US$12.4 million. These weremainly attributable to higher staff cost and higher travelling expenses due to partial resumption ofbusiness travel.,btohqsg
admin expense increase 70%.. they reward their staff rly well,btohqsg
Y2k was the time when many people wanted to change/upgradetheir pc/server   as they worried about the millienium bug... hence   there was surge in demand for the memories & other components...,btohqsg
ohh interesting  guess it contributed to the dotcom bubble haha,btohqsg
ok rmb share ur insights here hor want to learn from u,btohqsg
Knn midnight I must sleep else 6 packs gone lol,btohqsg
🤔🤷‍♂Normally  the coy will not be so nice one lah   the management  probably will also revise up all their sales team target accordingly and there should be a cap... anyway ... 🤔,btohqsg
Y2K  bro  you should be part of the era ...right?,btohqsg
No .. cos I want to be in the news too ..,btohqsg
Sales/distributioncost increase is  understandable    could be due to higher comm to sales team. But admin / travelling costs (need to read in details)    a bit strange   as whole world was under lockdown and not much travelling and every company was trying to trim.their staff cost and plus government supports..🤔🤷‍♂😂,btohqsg
