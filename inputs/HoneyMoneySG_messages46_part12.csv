Citibank premier miles or dbs altitude,btohqsg
Hi Gurus.want to check which is more worth it for payment of grab/gojek/zdg rides?- Citi Rewards with 10x points- UOB one with base 3.33% and further 5/6.67%Or are there better options for payment for private hire rides,btohqsg
Hello  I use the Citibank rewards + amaze strategy  but for additional (above the citi limits) and travel spends I have been using the DBS Woman card. I noticed they have been charging additional fees for spends like Airbnb and some flight companies. Upon further looking it seems they charge additional 1% for purchases outside singapore  even if the purchase is made in SGD.,btohqsg
Has anyone faced this already? Seems quite a downside. Was thinking to give up on the miles accumulated on it over the past months and move to another card. I have never been charged fees for those types of purchases on other cards before. üòï,btohqsg
Yeah u need to beware of Merchants that incur dcc. Payment processor outside of Singapore.,btohqsg
Hi all  does it affect my credit score or anything bad if I apply too many credit cards,btohqsg
Citibank  dbs uob and i would think other bank also charge this  just whether u check or not the transaction and fee difference between the other bank,btohqsg
Your credit score will decrease if you apply for too many in a short period of time,btohqsg
I vouch for thisMy credit score from AA dropped to EE ü§£,btohqsg
What about cancelling credit card that dont really use ?,btohqsg
Only after 1 year of apply,btohqsg
Does increasing credit limit of credit card also affect the credit score ?,btohqsg
Hi I am comparing Maybank FD 3.9% 12mths and DBS shares. I see they say DBS pay abou 4.95%,btohqsg
Hi  from my experience  it does slightly. According to my CBS report  it dipped to 1927 when I was in a flurry of signing up a few credit cards last year. Based on my last check early this year  after a few timely payments  it had returned to 2000 (the full score). My credit score remained in the AA range throughout though (1911-2000) and I nv missed a payment.To answer your question  it may not be so direct. Does it affect the score? yes. Does it affect affect the overall grading? No in my case. If it concerns you  has it affected my banking facility  credit and loan limits with my bank? No too.Hope the above helps.,btohqsg
Hi  newbie here... May I know how do we know our credit score? Is it free to get the score?,btohqsg
You Shd get one free report each time you apply a credit card,btohqsg
highly personal and also depends on your holding power. one is deposit and one is investment,btohqsg
I'm using an old phone without NFC. I recently installed Kris+ which needs to use Google Pay. Is it possible to use my CC linked to G Pay without NFC after scanning the QR code of a Kris+ merchant?What about other merchants  can I scan their QR code using G Pay and still be able to use my linked CC to pay? Apologies as I seldom use G Pay. TIA,btohqsg
Kris+ is online  need data plan or wifi  can use CC linked to GPay without NFC.Scan QR code using Gpay is online also  the payment will be from bank account linked to GPay not linked CC.,btohqsg
Thanks. This means I can't use the linked CC. It'll be paid through PayLah linked to G Pay. Then I have to get a new phone with NFC,btohqsg
u mean i can request for the report from the bank i applying the cc?,btohqsg
Recently I applied for 3 UOB cards in a row (I am existing UOB card member).UOB didn't seem to make new queries at Credit Bureau (I was not entitled to new credit report)  so i cannot confirm or deny if my credit score was impacted.,btohqsg
Yeah existing member i think they dont  coz just draw dwn on existing limits right,btohqsg
I believe all 3 credit cards are sharing same credit limits. Hence  no impact on the bank.,btohqsg
so if I use giro to pay $2000 uob bill i get $20 cashback?,btohqsg
i think there is always a last sentence they will include in their approval email/letter. say you can get a copy of the cbs report that they retrieved then got steps to follow,btohqsg
Anyone know which is the cheapest water and electricity provider besides SP group?,btohqsg
Yes  assuming u fulfilled the requirements for everyday+ rewards ($2k/$5k transfer in from other bank to your EGA account and 5 transaction e.g. FAST out from EGA or HSBC card spend)  and GIRO bill payment was setup by submitting manual form and successfully GIRO auto deduction from your ega account to pay  the uob CC bill.,btohqsg
Seems too good to believe hor. You can create an artificial cashback card by chaining with hsbc ega giro,btohqsg
yes my brain is now thinking of all the new possibilities üòÑ,btohqsg
is there a cap on the 1% ?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not from the bank. CBS is independent. Google CBS  then enter your details. At the payment part  just click the button. If you have a free report  they will give you for free.,btohqsg
thank you so much for sharing the steps. first time seeing my own credit report. really appreciate the sharing in this grp very much! üôè,btohqsg
Something must have gone very wrong to drop from AA to EE just over many applications. I‚Äôve applied for 3 cards from 3 different banks over the course of 2 months  score barely dipped to BB.,btohqsg
i second you... i don't think application for multiple cards would drop by so much.From my understanding  the biggest factor that will cause u to have lousy scores is if you are late in making payments.All others have negligible effect (at most drop 1 notch).,btohqsg
some people believe that if you pay bills before the statement is generated it will negatively affect your score too,btohqsg
This is rubbish that isn‚Äôt applicable to our Singapore CBS system. Cannot just blindly apply wholesale what you watch from YouTube videos meant for a US audience.,btohqsg
you mean it's true for US?,btohqsg
Yes. Cause they want to see credit usage. If you pay before the bill is generated  I think their system doesn‚Äôt capture,btohqsg
the video i saw for US is that their version of CBS retrieves credit details from lenders on fixed date of the month  so people pay the day before so that it seems they dont owe money/owe less,btohqsg
Cashback cap is $300 for EGA  $500 for Premier,btohqsg
For those who still doubt üòÇ,btohqsg
Subject to cashback clawbacks if bank found there is manipulation on this. You may want to read thru the TnC first. There will be audit on this to request to produce proof of spending if you are the chosen one.,btohqsg
mpd if want to use to book plane ticket can only do at their offical website?? is it for all airlines or within the alliance,btohqsg
U want to be clearer with your question?,btohqsg
Hi Friends  just need a quick confirmation  I have Citi cashback + VISA card with 1.6% Cashback. Is MRT/bus transactions eligible for 1.6% cashback ?,btohqsg
