If have all these card with jade green crypto card. Effective cashback is how much,btohqsg
1.5/1.7% from Amex true cashback/UOB absolute + 3% (in CRO) from jade green card. Effectively 4.5/4.7%. Essentially makes all <=5% cards irrelevant if you spend <30k a year.,btohqsg
Just sad. I miss the trick for cpf top up. Didn't know about this.,btohqsg
anyone faced trouble when trying to register the acct? they send u an sms to tap on the link but the link says the page not found,btohqsg
Copy the code and key in the box will be much easier. The link is buggy sometimes,btohqsg

Hi guys  im wondering between VOO and CSPX  does VOO 30% tax against ireland domiciled 15% tax matters for long term investments?,btohqsg
SP500 dividend yield is 1.27%  multiply 15% difference = 0.19%,btohqsg
Assuming compounding of 10% and (10% - 0.19% = 9.81%),btohqsg
Starting with 10k  the end value after 30 years are $174 494 and $165 675,btohqsg
I think another factor to consider is the inheritance tax  VOO will subject to inheritance tax which could be quite high,btohqsg
Yes. If something touch wood happened. Any US asset  It will incur inheritance tax of up to 40%,btohqsg
Thank you for this. Something that i need to read up more.,btohqsg
On the last part  does it means if you didnt spend on anything else youre not eligible for the cashback? Eg...you spend on online ordering of food  shoppings etc etc?,btohqsg

Only get cashback from groceries  food and petrol. Other spend excluded from cadhback,btohqsg
This year sa topup is 8k?,btohqsg
Thanks  may I confirm paying bills eg mobile also considered eligible?,btohqsg
Understood on that part  for groceries  petrol and dining you will get 8% cashback  provided minimum spending for the month is $800 right. Im not clear on what contribute to the minimum spending  is it only from the 3 listed above or anything that were use to pay using the card contribute to minimum spending (i understand exclusion of paying to govt institution  insurance etc),btohqsg
Ah from my understanding  Yes. Thanks!,btohqsg
Yeah correct it is in point 2,btohqsg
May I check for crypto com app where can I check my P&L? Thanks,btohqsg
