Yo guys if I got Covid on 20 Feb rigjt means I canâ€™t take booster for 3 months but then will  my vaccination status still expire on 10 May,btohqsg
I planning to take aft 11 May cuz I have camp b4 that and I donâ€™t wanna miss it,btohqsg
Actually u can take it a month after the infection but youre recommended to do so after 3 months,btohqsg
For better clarification you should check with MOH Covid-19 hotline 6995 9199,btohqsg
I think expiry date is 270 days after your initial dose not after ur covid infection IIRC,btohqsg
As i said this is the most reliable way to check for your situation.,btohqsg
If anyone is in a similar situation  please do not feel devastated. Work hard and seek help from school teachers when needed.,btohqsg

So if we apply 2 Courses for EAE in one Poly example School of Applied Science.Does that mean need go for 2 interview?,btohqsg
SCHOOL OF HEALTH & SOCIAL SCIENCES  So need 2 interview for each EAE?,btohqsg
Maximum how many Poly or courses could I apply?,btohqsg
Oh I thought can apply all the polys,btohqsg
3 courses out of all the 5 poly courses :),btohqsg
I think the person just talking abt their choices,btohqsg
NURSING (C97)Range of Net ELR2B2: 5 to 28,btohqsg
NYP is the best school for Nursing.,btohqsg
is it allowed to apply EAE for 3 courses in the same poly - Chinese media and communication  Chinese studies and mass comm?,btohqsg
this one diff diff no meh,btohqsg
Food Technology which is the best?,btohqsg
Like that DSA we also could apply 3 JC's?,btohqsg
NYP is Pioneer Sch NP also hv Nursing,btohqsg
But go JC confirm go NUS/NYU?,btohqsg
2 yr A Level super demanding,btohqsg
Not like only can go also,btohqsg
Sadly I will say at least 20 percent of the students won't make it there.,btohqsg
Erm it is usually last few days in May and June is holidays and first 1 or 2 weeks in end June / July. So technically is 2 to 3 weeks.,btohqsg
Can only say going to JC will net you a higher chance of entering local U but not necessary 100%.,btohqsg
if u expand to private u becomes close to 100%,btohqsg
If like general all go JC should land a place in NUS or NTU,btohqsg
But seem most Deg courses all need AAA/A,btohqsg
If not a guide like get 10 pts and below go JC,btohqsg
Above 10 pts go Poly better,btohqsg
No pt Private Uni paying so much money;in the end the pay also terrible,btohqsg
straight b gives u access to most,btohqsg
u can get cs and ds for some nus ntu courses also,btohqsg
Its only Computing/Law/Medicine that needs AAA/A,btohqsg
I not gna weigh in on this one,btohqsg
