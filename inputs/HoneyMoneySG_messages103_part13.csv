$100 per statement month. Note that there is need to fulfil min 5 transactions and $500/$1000/$2000 eligible spend for each of the 3 months of your qualifying quarter to get quarterly rebate and then the bonus 5%.,btohqsg
Hi gurus here.. can I ask abt priority pass access-  if I have 5 person in my household  me and my spouse each can bring 1+1 into the lounge. Any supplementary card I can apply for the additional pax? Thank you in advance üôè,btohqsg
Sub card no lounge entitlement usually unless is the super high income tier card with huge annual fee,btohqsg
Does ezlink top up count for Rebate 1.5%? I can't see it mention in t & c.,btohqsg
U see any top up is excluded,btohqsg
use sc smart card better 5.6 mpd for simplygo,btohqsg
Not sure if I'm too dumb to understand  or my English is too hard to understand. I checked again with live agent to clarify about the 1% admin fee and this is the result...,btohqsg
I dont understand u also to be honest  1month per domestic spend is still useful if link to citi crmc,btohqsg
There is plenty other way to buy lv to be honest,btohqsg
the admin fee higher than the linked rewards?,btohqsg
Lol there is lv in ion,btohqsg
My question - with each new month  does my domestic spend get reset to zero so that each new month I won't incur the 1% fee between $0-$1000 spend for that month. I ask this question many times but the agent like don't understand and keep trying to tell me my spend is cumulative so I will keep getting charged the 1% admin fee past $1k regardless of month. I make it as simple as possible but the agent keep don't want to explain to me succinctly whether this will happen or not,btohqsg
Convert offline to online is not the original intent of Amaze. I will prefer not to mention it in the chat. Once Amaze change the setting from ‚Äúonline‚Äù to ‚Äúoffline‚Äù  it is a game over for many people.From Amaze point of view  their business objective is to make money from FX spread and wallet. The rest of ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù are discovered by members and make use of it by community here.,btohqsg
I understand members here stated it will reset for the new month but I wanted to get clarity with Instarem team  end up they just make me even more confused,btohqsg
Read this first page  monthly domestic transaction  what is so hard to understand about this?,btohqsg
I dunno  but I don't want to be charged the 1% admin fee past 1k spend.,btohqsg
I can tell u alot of way to overcome this to be honest if the merchant is in capitamall,btohqsg
Then don't use amaze after 1k spend for that month  which is what everyone already advised you.,btohqsg
Just open your instarem app  Card tab and you‚Äôll see your tracker with this information,btohqsg
Damn it even shows when it resets ü§°Tough read üò´,btohqsg
need to weigh if still worth it to use Amaze after $1k domestic spend,btohqsg
Clueless person  even the CSO can‚Äôt understand him based on the way he phrase the qn,btohqsg
Yes it's not hard to understand but it confuses me when I ask them this question and they reply me with this:,btohqsg
That why u see if people dont reply in this chat is either they dont know the answer or they dont know what the question is lol,btohqsg
They are replying to your 1 percent fee question earlier. The one on top of your red column. Miss the second line most prob,btohqsg
CSO probably assumed you saw what the app explicitly stated before going on chat with him.1. 1% fee (min $0.50) for domestic transactions above $1k2. Limit resets on 1st May 2024,btohqsg
He and CSO are wasting each other‚Äôs time. And now he is wasting our time  even if we answered already  still insisting on CSO confusing him üòÇ,btohqsg
You must remember  he was answered here before he went to chat with CSO...,btohqsg
Typically  È∏°ÂêåÈ∏≠ËÆ≤. Like i always emphrasize  ask the right question if u want right answer. Dont give filler inbetween,btohqsg
He just too impatient on getting his LV  need to clarify first before waiting for the CSO to reply. Good problem tbh. Not everyone can afford LV,btohqsg
"And now there's a higher risk of amaze becoming a ""offline"" transaction with the extra yap to CSO...",btohqsg
Actually this offline to online thing has been talked about by all these sponsored posts anyway,btohqsg
I think more of bank nerf amaze* link transaction rather then amaze go offline issue  like what dbs did for dbs wwmc and all other dbs card,btohqsg
Because what u guys replied doesn't tally with what the agent said ma. So who to believe?,btohqsg
After all  amaze saving on fcy fee is alike to snatch rice bowl from banks beside the offline to online issue. From a long term point of view dont benefit bank to accept amaze* transaction,btohqsg
People showed you screenshots of the monthly reset liao,btohqsg
If i am not wrong the agent did told u the spending number reset monthly in his reply.,btohqsg
I went to the Card tab but I don't see this reset countdown anywhere leh,btohqsg
Do you see the tracker under linked bank card?,btohqsg
He did. Then after that he went to explain further and keep telling me the admin fee can't be reset. So what am I supposed to do?,btohqsg
What he mean is that admin fee once charge when u over 1k spend is not refundable  even if there is refund to the charge afterward,btohqsg
Will show this after u tap question mark,btohqsg
Using the latest version of the app?,btohqsg
And i like to highlight it is not 1 percent only  it is either 1 percent or 50 cent minimum per transaction. So if u use for small amt less then 50 dollar u are infact paying more then 1 percent,btohqsg
Wtf?? I'm not even asking that question. Seriously miscomm siah,btohqsg
Like i say u give too many filler  just go straight to question does the monthly domestic spend of 1k reset each month will do,btohqsg
Have you spent more than $1k in Apr? If yes  the message n reset date will appear.,btohqsg
I tried that in earlier agent chat. But they gave the the same confusing replies. That is why I was trying to be as clear as possible. Really spoil my day,btohqsg
Oh well cant comment since no screenshot lol.,btohqsg
Giving more info does not mean clear. Sometimes less is more. Just be straight to the point. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
