Standard Chartered spree card and Citibank cash back+  any recommendation for this two card?,btohqsg

Which bank account is best for salary credit for fresh graduate,btohqsg
Depends on what your salary is. You can check salary crediting requirements for POSB Multiplier  OCBC 365  UOB One and SC BonusSaver respectively,btohqsg
Between the two cards I would choose SC Spree. I would get SC Smart for 6% cashback on transportation with no min spend,btohqsg
Maybank Platinum Visa card is also another good card to consider for low spenders,btohqsg
scb jumpstart a/c has 2% interest rate with only one requirement: deposit > 20000,btohqsg
Another one to consider  a bit esoteric  is SIF GoSavers,btohqsg
Jumpstart is for 18-26 years old only,btohqsg
SIF GoSavers gives same rate as Trust Bank NTUC membership without the membership or spending requirement,btohqsg

for webull  the reward change to trading voucher so which means we need to use it to buy and sell shares or it is still cash into our account?,btohqsg
use to buy shares  will offset the cash outlay,btohqsg
Hi all  I signed up for citibank credit card through Singsaver and was patiently waiting for the reward. As it was taking too long  I decided to email singsaver recently to check and they told me that the reward collection email has been sent to me in July 2022 and collection expires in Oct 2022. But I did not receive such email. I had reply them to appeal. Was wondering if any of you encountered this as well and did you manage to still get your reward in the end?,btohqsg
I got rejected email 2 days later. My friend say usually should be within 1-2 working days if approve,btohqsg
by the term contactless payment  i can use the physical card and tap right? or i need to use phone to make payment?,btohqsg
but for hsbc revolution card  it have to be online too? if i dine at cafe  i wont get the 4miles?,btohqsg
Contactless like paywave for revo u can 4mpd,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  10x point for this card you need to satisfy both of two criteria  (1) online or paywave and (2) fall into given MCC list,btohqsg
Btw if anyone travels to Malaysia and want to get 4mpd with SG cards  you can buy touch and go reload pin from Lazada MY. Their MCC is 5310.,btohqsg
This is best dining card . Hotel restaurant also can.,btohqsg
Do consider CPF shielding! You still can shield your SA and allow OA monies to flow into your RA (higher interest),btohqsg
I remembered one of my fren had the same problem as you. Did not get the rewards even after appeal,btohqsg
Hi all  what high yield account available without salary credit?,btohqsg

Can also consider CIMB FastSaver account for first S$75k  EIR 2.5% pa as well with no spend or salary crediting requirement,btohqsg
I googled and saw this reddit post. It seems like a common issue that they did not send the email but claimed that they did.https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zwahzh/psa_beware_of_singsaver_for_credit_card_rewards/,btohqsg
Does anyone know if Trust Debit Card has any limit for overseas ATM withdrawals?,btohqsg

Hello   wodnering if I should switch my StanChart bonussaver to ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm a uni student who is doing small investments into ETFs. I'm currently using Fundsupermart ETF RSP monthly. Can I check if FSM is a good platform or is robo advisors better. Which platform has lower fees?,btohqsg
