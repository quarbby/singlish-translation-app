Hey friends! Some reminders fortonight!1) DO NOT enter thru the Mcdonaldsgantry. It'll block all patrons of therestaurants and we do not wantcomplains. Go in thru the backgantry instead.2) Do not be reckless orinconsiderate. No revving  nospeeding  no illegal activities in thecarpark. This is a PEACEFUL meetupthat we all have been expecting for 2years. Please do not mess this up.3) I don't know why people aretalking about fighting and all  but ihope non of that happens heretonight.
