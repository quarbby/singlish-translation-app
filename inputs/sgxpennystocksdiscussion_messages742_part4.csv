India May Cut Gold Import Tax — BloombergNew Delhi is considering reversing its recently hiked import tax on gold to stop illegal inflows of the metal  Bloomberg reported on Monday citing sources.According to the report  the trade ministry is considering cutting the current 12.5% levy to 10%. The step could be announced at the budget presentation due early next year  or sooner  the sources said.India hiked the tariff on gold imports from the previous 7.5% in July.
