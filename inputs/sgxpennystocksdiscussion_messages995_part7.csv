yalo    durian price will shoot up !!,btohqsg
all intents are good but not too sure if it comes too late or a time when crisis is imminent as you cant fight the market when it is in bearish mode.. we have missed the good times to shoot out the good news as the chinese saying goes : 天时地利人和.  Notwithstanding is still not too late to turn back the clock. Too many good companies have left and now to entice good ones to come bac  is harder but perhaps the crux of this whole saga is still valuation and regulation. If valuation is low  who else wants to list here than elsewhere.. If market regulates till no BBs wants to anchor for fear of “public caning”  then they rather MM elsewhere which is more mkt friendly...  Participation cannot be limit to juz family offices alone. It wont help...,btohqsg
