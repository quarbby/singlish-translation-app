Wow a row of cool cars??,btohqsg
wtf owner got new addition ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Hey   would you mind if i ask  what's  your ethnicity?,btohqsg
no but i identify as a bangladeshi,btohqsg
Aiyo Malay la easy to say,btohqsg
Your name sounds like  a Bengali name..,btohqsg
It is by law everyone must watch this video.https://youtu.be/HSG9eTL8WPQ?si=OAMBb_mFtj3Y4VEV,btohqsg
wait not really but aiya u get what i mean,btohqsg
some update on this there will be light food and drink selling on the day !,btohqsg
4.778FD and 3.5 TRD gear ratio,btohqsg
the fact that this sound can actually put me to sleep though,btohqsg
the transmission whine is more than enough.,btohqsg
it's like a comforting ride in a old Crown,btohqsg
should i install the speed chime,btohqsg
Anyone have a snap grip? Is it useful for taking photos with iPhone?,btohqsg
2 new attractions are set to open in Singapore â€“ a wellness attraction in the Marina Bay precinct by 2030 and a Porsche Experience Centre in Changi by 2027.https://str.sg/eHJ6,btohqsg
PEC coming to SG  atop the old unbuilt unfinished Changi Motorsports Hub,btohqsg
yay good use of tax money,btohqsg
Porsche is really invested into SG,btohqsg
especially with the launch of the Macan recently and taking over Eurokars Porsche,btohqsg
bro i see more porsche in singapore than taxi or PHV. they must be freaking printing money thanks to our market,btohqsg
diluted european version type r but type r nonetheless,btohqsg
different body  not made in japan  and not 100% sure on this one  but i believe it also made less power than the JDM 4 door body one,btohqsg
maybe they used the same one,btohqsg
oh damn so the eu one had two doors but japan had 4,btohqsg
the japan one was a totally different chassis they were totally unrelated...this european version was universally disliked and i think it was a commercial failure in all markets where you could buy the JDM vs euro. but i think in the UK market it did ok,btohqsg
the FN2R cannot be compared to the FD2R,btohqsg
ah yes the FD2R was the JDM one,btohqsg
like totally no comparison except in name only,btohqsg
diff chassis but parts like the headlights shld be same same right?,btohqsg
The FD2R is like gigachad  the FN2R is like his younger incel bro who watches andrew tate videos,btohqsg
no its totally different  body wise nothing is shared,btohqsg
since young I thought these two were different gens lol,btohqsg
yeah understandable. but they were sold at the same time  side by side depending on markets. In SG we were one of the few where you could buy both. if i remember right Kah Motor sold one (i believe the FN2) and the FD2 were parallel imports. Or it might have been the other way around,btohqsg
someone has to buy the 4 cyl shitbox macans,btohqsg
both are K20s. none of them have much similarities.,btohqsg
Kah sold the UKDM FN2s. PIs brought in the JDM spec FD2Rs,btohqsg
much like how Borneo sold the UKDM GR Yaris  and the PIs with the JDM Yaris,btohqsg
yeah thats what i remember too. I think honda forced the ADs from non japan markets to sell the FN2,btohqsg
looked awful  the Mugen kit looks okay-ish but still looks very un-Type R,btohqsg
i dunno what honda was thinking honestly. there is literally no reason to buy that 2 door shitbox where the FD2 exists,btohqsg
i suppose they wanted some exclusivity,btohqsg
i'd be fucking embarassed to drive a type r that wasnt even fucking made in japan,btohqsg
TLDR everything but the NSX DC2  DB8  EK9  FD2R and FL5,btohqsg
the FK8 and all were from the Swindon plant,btohqsg
LMAO it even weighed more and made less power,btohqsg
FL5 is now assembled back in japan,btohqsg
this is good but i wish they never went turbo,btohqsg
tbf that's to keep up with the times,btohqsg
