It’s just as hard to get all wrong as all correct,btohqsg
U can do it legally in Canada thou.,btohqsg
You can legally die any where,btohqsg
You can legally die in Singapore,btohqsg
But in Canada  the doctors will help me,btohqsg
Can someone send the compo part,btohqsg
Tons of people do so all the time,btohqsg
you die they can catch you meh,btohqsg
I wanna see wat it came out,btohqsg
Dying should be an enjoyable experience,btohqsg
Its literally the last thing u do,btohqsg
Tis looks so much easier than last year,btohqsg
3 and 4 is slightly tricky,btohqsg
you can pm me about it but don't spread -ve vibes!!,btohqsg
Everyone thinks their batch has the hardest papers,btohqsg
2019 compre is defo ezier than their,btohqsg
i think people wouldn't appreciate that,btohqsg
But cuz I had teacher's help uh,btohqsg
Cuz I dyslexic and they read for me HAHA,btohqsg
Brb I go ask my bro how he find the paper,btohqsg
争夺 is usually used for 冠军 计较 for 输赢,btohqsg
if no A1 then bobian jus wait for nov,btohqsg
can anyone send the compre questions and passage,btohqsg
How's the O level Chinese paper today,btohqsg
My sister said it was very very hard,btohqsg
Wah so u wrote the argumentative one,btohqsg
Did a similar passage came out before?,btohqsg
I rmb seeing this passage before somewhere when I was sec 4,btohqsg
What’s the difference between June and Nov MT paper?,btohqsg
Nov is the second chance if u want retake,btohqsg
If u think June u did badly,btohqsg
Is it the same standard  difficulty level?,btohqsg
But usually is when ur oral and LC disticintion liao,btohqsg
Than u retake have higher chance get an A,btohqsg
But u will need to restudy and all,btohqsg
Like u study so hard the past month or so for Chinese liao,btohqsg
Than end up need do it again  and divert focus from other subjects,btohqsg
For Qn 4 is it easier to 同意 or 不同意？,btohqsg
Does sch recommend students to retake?,btohqsg
Where u want go after I level,btohqsg
If u want go poly  and Chinese not even needed for the L1R4 calculation,btohqsg
I have this friend who only sat for 5 papers in o lebel,btohqsg
For all his geog and ss,btohqsg
Cos he don't need geog or as to go science course in poly haha,btohqsg
But if u see his prelims and all,btohqsg
Ss and geog is F9 ah,btohqsg
If I drop to clb  will I be limited,btohqsg
Good qn  if u take CLB u almost confirm plus chope get high score one,btohqsg
Idt it makes a difference at all,btohqsg
As food? Sure I like ice cream,btohqsg
Need to take A level CLB again,btohqsg
But it's also very easy one,btohqsg
And I don't really see how ure disadvantaged by taking clb ah  except for JC rank poontz Chinese can help u add like a 0.25 rank point out of 90,btohqsg
How likely is it to fail chinese? Idk,btohqsg
Fail CLB? Almost 0 percent from what I've seen,btohqsg
Where did that 0.25 myth come from  it’s just not calculated like that,btohqsg
If you wanna aim scholarship all that  every bit helps,btohqsg
U count the RP to 100,btohqsg
I have 6 subjects and I plan to go to jc.,btohqsg
Than divide by 10 multiply by 9,btohqsg
I mean at JC level H3 is also useless,btohqsg
As in u have decided u want JC alr?,btohqsg
I only took 7 o level subject also,btohqsg
This means it is dependent on your Ori score and not a blanket .25,btohqsg
But I want to keep my choices as open as possible,btohqsg
When u go from sec sch to JC,btohqsg
The gap is really very hig,btohqsg
U can A1 for A math Emath,btohqsg
And get U grade for H2 math,btohqsg
That's all I have to say haha,btohqsg
Not true  instances where B works magic too  and every decimal place matter in a dog eat dog fight,btohqsg
I mean I haven't graduate so idrk ah haha,btohqsg
But I know it can add a few decimals,btohqsg
What are the 6  just curious,btohqsg
Can someone send the comprehension qns,btohqsg
Can someone send the essay Q?,btohqsg
Gosh  4 and 5 is damn hard hahah,btohqsg
Hard to discuss and write about that eh,btohqsg
It's like a GP essay in chinese,btohqsg
Qn 3 my friend misread the qn she wrote rout of point,btohqsg
I wrote that becus the economy is industrialiseing  jobs created jobs lost. We dont change we die liao. Cant respond to global demand can find job becus not willing to chanye,btohqsg
You just need to answer why you can adapt,btohqsg
I would do either 4 or 5 tbh,btohqsg
My other friend wrote 4 too,btohqsg
Then I wrote uh everyday what we know is changing  so if we dont adapt we will be out of date and cant really do anything,btohqsg
How is Q3 difficult to understand? The story prob abit hard to imagine but I don’t understand how so many ppl don’t know what 竞争 is lol,btohqsg
Idk whether I wrote out of point,btohqsg
Shit I got 6 and 12,btohqsg
Though I would say Q3 is difficult for brain juices wise. Haha with a Govt that places so much emphasis on 竞争力 probably very difficult to go against the grain and criticise it,btohqsg
I think your points are ok but you also have to address on 成功part to get higher marks,btohqsg
The last qn is so random,btohqsg
It’s just the 启发 question disguised,btohqsg
Good lord it's all chinese discussions here,btohqsg
ya they just Want you to talk about the lesson you learn and how you feel,btohqsg
LMAO I’d imagine COVID-19 would appear a lot in Q4 answers hahaha,btohqsg
Idt anyone would do q5 lol,btohqsg
is it healthy that i'm getting influenced by my friends,btohqsg
I wanted to write recession due to covid  but idk the word,btohqsg
R they good or bad friends,btohqsg
Yea it’s difficult but anybody who decides to do it will Def hop on the COVID-19 train,btohqsg
i didn't take the paper today,btohqsg
English  Chinese  combined humanities(ss  geography)  amath  emath and science(physics  chemistry),btohqsg
Same as me sia haha  one for one replica except bio instead of physics,btohqsg
Oh there's a famous ACJC dude here,btohqsg
hmmm idk how ur performance is like for other subjs,btohqsg
cus now u rly bobian diedie have to use cl,btohqsg
Quite good with Chinese being the only exception,btohqsg
Is internal really harder than Os?,btohqsg
but O level got the factor of moderation oso,btohqsg
You guys know for paper 2 comprehension wut the hec is the 水 about. Got dirty water got clean water,btohqsg
Even Kim Jong Un pray to the bell curve,btohqsg
N level EMB3 5 but what's the point if my Chinese is going to make my L1R5 shit.:(,btohqsg
CL can add a whopping 9 to your L1R5  immediately disqualifying you from AC lolz,btohqsg
I'm relying on my dsa application. :/,btohqsg
Was this what everyone was talking about for O level Chinese lol,btohqsg
eh don’t so bad lah anyw its hard to get f9 for cl,btohqsg
i think that kind is when u legit can’t read and give up,btohqsg
U havent seen me yet then,btohqsg
unless u legit f9 all the way during internals,btohqsg
I did worse in Os that mock lol,btohqsg
I get B4 in mock but Os  I think I might fail,btohqsg
Eh since when u come back,btohqsg
At least it is a B4,btohqsg
even if ur score is a fail on the paper,btohqsg
cus of moderation u can pass wut,btohqsg
Moderation exists but bell curve doesn't,btohqsg
Bell curve only exist in uni,btohqsg
I believe that the invigilators for today are your sch Teachers?,btohqsg
I didn't rlly understand the 2nd passage,btohqsg
Shud my brother retake his O level math (A2) n English(B3)? Background info:He took last year with N level and got 5points total.  He just been called up for an online interview at nyjc for leadership and acjc for sports. He has only these subjects this year to take : amath sci(C&P) chi ss+hist poa,btohqsg
I mean what post secondary institution,btohqsg
ah i see he's in for the money,btohqsg
My older brothers are all in cs,btohqsg
But which sch is btr for computing?,btohqsg
If he managed 5 for N levels sounds like he’s good at studying,btohqsg
Ask ur inner heart Wat u want to achieve in life? Money or passion?,btohqsg
if he wants to get rekted  NUS. If not  NTU,btohqsg
Well that's cuz he got convertion,btohqsg
You mean he has the choice to not retake?,btohqsg
you sound like u want money,btohqsg
i dont think there's a right or wrong tbh,btohqsg
I don’t think any particular JC has computing as a niche,btohqsg
So probably no need to take the JC’s reputation for computing into account,btohqsg
Why is my school such an ass when it comes to na student not getting an A1 for whatever o level subject :/,btohqsg
Cause if u retake there’s always a chance to get A1,btohqsg
How dare u assume I have one,btohqsg
But if u don’t retake it’ll never be an A1,btohqsg
If only I scored an A1 for emath...,btohqsg
I want MacD. Who wants treat me?,btohqsg
Damn it  if only I appealed to the English hod for o level English...,btohqsg
Ur sch not must to take 1 Lang  2 Os sub?,btohqsg
No I mean I feel taking O level english is painful lol,btohqsg
English is a thing you learn for years,btohqsg
So if you have a history of Englishing then you’ll do well relatively easily,btohqsg
I only like compo  the rest can go to hell,btohqsg
My school doesn't offer o level English. :/,btohqsg
Like serious  compo is so freeing for some reason,btohqsg
Its like I can put all the shit in one story,btohqsg
Paper 2 section B is fun.,btohqsg
Paper 1 is like the only part where it's pretty easy to get A1,btohqsg
what genre shd u write for essay,btohqsg
No that's the easiest to get marks,btohqsg
I love narrative lel. I always write people die,btohqsg
You cannot survive narrative without good English,btohqsg
I survive it with shitty plot,btohqsg
but i have never gotten above 50 for narrative,btohqsg
but i have scored 50+ for argumentative before,btohqsg
Icey writes narrative cause his Chinese good,btohqsg
Oh I thot u talking about English,btohqsg
I wrote argumentative in Chinese o levels cause the topic suited me,btohqsg
Isnt getting 50+ for english paper 1 quite easy idk,btohqsg
tbh i rly dun have motivation to work for el,btohqsg
my el essay sucks and i hate reading english books,btohqsg
My first paragraph was about my parents dying in car crash and my grandpa hospitalised,btohqsg

I just listened to chinese songs and watched chinese moovies and do Chinese papers to build vocabulary,btohqsg
is not even cus my cl good,btohqsg
I wrote my first argumentative essay for Os,btohqsg
Then my chinese powers peaked in O levels,btohqsg
Ah yes chinese songs like 雪花飘飘北风萧萧,btohqsg
but yes just go for argumentative,btohqsg
the hcl scholars all pick that,btohqsg
just need to have strong arguments,btohqsg
So to be good at English just listen English song watch English moovie and do English papper,btohqsg
my cher say all of us shd write narrative,btohqsg
What do u even use chinese for btw?,btohqsg
Isnt it just ordering food at hawker center,btohqsg

And when talking to some of the elderly,btohqsg
U can use chinese to talk to boomers,btohqsg
My dialect is so bad haisu,btohqsg

I wonder what kind of drink he's drinking,btohqsg
i heard best course in ite is gardening,btohqsg
I feel that it would be a good thing to try again  because A2 B3 are not bad grades,btohqsg
And even a single grade difference can be big,btohqsg
Do a lot of people retake Os? Idk seems like theres a lot,btohqsg
then ill be smartest in cohort,btohqsg
If only shit works that way,btohqsg
Isnt it their first time in sec 5 so they stay for 6 years?,btohqsg
I mean they take some O Level subjects as Sec 4s,btohqsg
Then they may retake them in Sec 5,btohqsg
lol i would actually do that,btohqsg
In the school I go to last year  there was estimated 40 private candidate,btohqsg
Idk never met anyone who retook before lol,btohqsg
if i oni had to pay $11 for sch,btohqsg
i would retain every single year,btohqsg
