0.3% cashback  same total cap of $600 cashback applies....,btohqsg
so if i want to qualify for the 5% it must be a online transaction? provided i hit above $500,btohqsg
https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/cashback/smrt-credit-card/The categories alr laid out clearly....,btohqsg
If you buy groceries or take BUS/MRT  provided u hit $500 per month  those can be contactless.Taxi I'm not sure.,btohqsg
How does uob one come into picture? They were talking aboit citi smrt card,btohqsg
any gurus can point to any sources which can give clue if i/r will increase on fomc meeting?,btohqsg
Taxi can be app or contactless,btohqsg
does UOB Absolute still consider insurance premium as eligible transaction for cashback?,btohqsg
Absolute or evol card is more on cashback?,btohqsg
think can only do it via AXS..dont think recurring using AMEX is allow on the insurance portal...usually only Mastercard,btohqsg
Can't really compare  Evol minimum spend $600. Capped at $40 while Absolute is unlimited but not many merchants accept Amex,btohqsg
dont think have much choices as most CC nerf insurance. citipayall needs $8000 to qualify and mine is not that much. better than nothing,btohqsg
CDG  Premier taxi contactless got 10% admin fee. Not worth. Not sure Strides Mobility have or not  no info on their site.,btohqsg
however paying thru AXS  does not matter right for UOB Absolute? I know some banks nerf it if use AXS,btohqsg
Usually it's better to call Grab or Taxi through app,btohqsg
Limited to companies that accepts AMEX,btohqsg
In terms of cashback  Evol more user friendly if u hit 600,btohqsg
Depends on your spending. Min spending of $600 which includes at least $250 online and $250 contactless gives you 6.67% effective cashback on EVOL with $40 cap.,btohqsg
oh I think so... I misread it for diners. Damn. GG then...,btohqsg
So it counts as eligible spend for the uob one spend too?,btohqsg
Absolute still gives 0.3% cashback for Grab wallet top ups but TCB doesn‚Äôt anymore  I heard.,btohqsg
Oh ok. Cashback is how many percent?,btohqsg
Can payment for polyclinics be made through Amex?,btohqsg
Never ever book metered fare unless you paying cash/paynow/paylah. Basically a scam. Unless you can predict the final fare before charges is 10% lesser than usual flat fare.,btohqsg
Based on a simple Google search  1.7% on all except Grab wallet top-up  which is 0.3%.,btohqsg
Always able to pay  just no rewards.,btohqsg
