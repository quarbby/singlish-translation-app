Yea the chencharu hills physical 3d plan,btohqsg
Riley & I have said it. The 3D model for June 2024 BTO won't be out that soon.,btohqsg
Hi all  I'd like to ask for clarification on my question. sorry and big thanks in advance as I am new to this.We are first timer and have a BTO queue number for Dec 23  but it's outside of supply. we had applied for Feb 24 BTO  and I'm in the same situation of having a queue number but outside of supply. My partner and I are considering applying for Jun 24 BTO  but if we have a change of mind and decide to go for resale in the future  are we able to? Will there be any penalty? such as the grant for resale as first timer?,btohqsg
You will be able to forgo the ballots and go for resale. You will still get grants.,btohqsg
No. Queue 2 will have to wait for queue 1 before they can select,btohqsg
In the meantime queue 2 can process documents  but the act of HDB officer selecting the unit on their system will have to wait until queue 1 has selected their unit,btohqsg
That's why sometimes appts get delayed,btohqsg
Don't be late you will cost all behind you to delay,btohqsg
Think there is a cut off time  after that considered missed queue,btohqsg
Understand this is hypothetical but pls try to be early or on time to be considerate to HDB staff and those behind you,btohqsg
All miss their Q will be put to 4pm on the same dayAfter which are counted as forfeit,btohqsg
Where did you get this information from?,btohqsg
I asked the HDB officer when I was selecting my flat,btohqsg
Is that on the assumption that only one officer is handling all the flat selection on the same day for the one project though?Otherwise like hard to control whether queue 1 gets to select before queue 2,btohqsg
Can. It's a centralised selection system,btohqsg
So basically no one gets to jump the queue number.& it will be very fair. One number by one number rite?,btohqsg
UI looked v old sch 😂,btohqsg
Yea  unless beyond some certain point  then considered missed queue number,btohqsg
Doesn't sound very efficient if queue 2 officer can't do anything because must wait for queue 1 to select first😱,btohqsg
Can  they can do everything else except the selection,btohqsg
So they can ask for your documents first,btohqsg
Unless queue 1 didn't authorize a third party to attend the appointment and change their appointment to a later date  then queue 2 will go first,btohqsg
Wa then hope for more of such cases & ppl who forfeit tooSo our number moves forward automatically 🤣,btohqsg
But ask for documents also won't take that super longOr might not know how late queue 1 will beHa ha  officer and applicant stare at each other while waiting for queue 1,btohqsg
Last time when there’s no penalty. The forfeit rate was up to 40% per projectNow got penalty. Forfeit rate at most 5-10% ba I guess,btohqsg
Yah  dropout rate supposedly much lower now,btohqsg
Yeah correct. But not sure what the threshold is cause heard someone's selection delayed like 45 min. Which seems like a waste of time on both parties parts,btohqsg
Yah lor... Can be quite a waste of time  esp when it comes to flat selection because competing for the units,btohqsg
Thought this one not just singles only,btohqsg
Right..if pre covid I can afford 3br resale..now I can afford 2rm bto flat..insane,btohqsg
Actually i find that even if the single is well to do  2R resale are not really worth the price tagIf resale  can just go for 3R  regardless if renting out or not,btohqsg
I LOL at the upper price range of 2R Type 2 at Tanjong Rhu in the current launchCrazy  378k + 15k for singles on 99y leaseIf OCS  maybe another 2k?,btohqsg
Oh yah  i forgot this one is mature estateBut that price for 2R 😱Think ~47 sqm? Not that it is bigger than other 2R BTO?,btohqsg
Tanjong Rhu prices are crazy  4 room 568k to 779k,btohqsg
Imagine the resale price 5 years later...,btohqsg
I think highly unlikely  thats what the government is trying to prevent from happening. But we should expect a much larger clawback % upon sale due to the higher expected subsidy to make  it affordable,btohqsg
If i rejected once in the past  if i reject again will i still be allowed to apply?,btohqsg
Oh by the way  i wanna ask -So  does Standard / Plus / Prime apply to only BTO?Should have nothing to do with resale  right?I mean  even Standard in a ulu place can be sold for high price after its 5y MOP,btohqsg
Plus and PLH restrictions will be applied to their resale counterparts as well.,btohqsg
PLH resale still maintains the 10y MOP. not too sure about PLUS,btohqsg
Can't rent out full flat  income cap  etc,btohqsg
You have yet to see SBF mature areas like Queenstown that's about the same price as this. 2 room type 2 is bigger.,btohqsg
But yeah the higher the floor the expensive it is 🫢,btohqsg
Housing loan can loan so much? What if my hfe states 400k only,btohqsg
Is it for prime area they will loan higher,btohqsg
Yeah I never understood this. Cos when I look at my own HFE letter it doesn’t make sense haha,btohqsg
Like the household income is lower there compared to mine but they’re saying this household can afford a higher price at a mortgage rate much lower than what was given to me,btohqsg
But i think they increased grant amount right,btohqsg
Hi  I am currently applying for Hfe for next round If I have been working for 2 month and my partner worked for 12 months 1) would both of our salary be counted for grant? Or only the one hitting 12 months?2) would both of our salary be counted for loan?3) what if the hdb loan amount is too low and cannot cover the property price in prime area  can I find a bank loan on top of hdb loan? Or can I re-assess loan closer to key collection (in this case would they take back my grant)?Thank you for help!! :)),btohqsg
1. No grant  both must hit 12 months(Edit: people below have corrected that only 1 person needs to hit 12 months for EHG. Total household income needs to be $9K and below)2. Yes (they'll divide the salaries accordingly). Cut off 2 months before HFE application.3. Choose either HDB or bank loan. No reassessment.Income decrease  loan decrease.Income increase  loan remains unchanged.,btohqsg
They way hdb sell the bto..gov say they don't control the resale price..but the bto price so high..this will just push resale price even higher..1.5mil maybe common in few years time.Low income single/family...really atb to them..,btohqsg
Thank you for answering! I tot EHG only need one person to be more than 12 months?,btohqsg
So means if the hdb loan can’t cover the remaining of my property price  I can’t do a bank loan on top? The only way is maybe to find a loan shark or smth?,btohqsg
Is hdb loan usually higher or lower than bank loan amount?,btohqsg
Also combined income cannot be >9k,btohqsg
Although this illustration I still don’t understand.,btohqsg
I wanna know what hdb is smoking,btohqsg
hi guys any idea what is this? (circled in Red),btohqsg
There's 1 specific grant that needs 2 people to hit 12 months I think? Can't remember which one.-> If I mixed it up  paiseh.,btohqsg
Uh not that I know of. Only 1 grant for bto and I'm not so familiar about resale grants but I don't rmb there being one too,btohqsg
No man. I also don’t understand this. Like I can afford a 600k flat down payment. My combined income cannot get grants. >9k. But then my max loan is only 580k,btohqsg
In their visual they assume 60k grants  but somehow this salary enough to loan 580k???60k grants means $3k salary  which will be like 200k loan (based on 1 experience maybe abit diff for each person but cannot be that diff that it can jump from 200k loan to almost 600k loan right),btohqsg
can play around with the calculator,btohqsg
Or is it as long as u can make the first 10% down payment. And the other 10% upon key collection?,btohqsg
Then month by month struggle lol?,btohqsg
No  its fully determined by your combine income,btohqsg
I believe the applicant must have their mobile number registered . The HDB officer could call them to confirm if they are giving up their queue . That would be ok .. unless the applicant switched off or don’t answer any call,btohqsg
If the calculator says we cannot afford it are we still able to purchase the place?,btohqsg
when do we need to pay the shortfall amount in cash?,btohqsg
Still 500-700 k with 20% clawbackGov will not allow 1M BTO to happenSimply increase clawback can le hahaha,btohqsg
That’s why  gov realised their mistake for not launching AMK under PrimeSo  from Oct 2024 onwards  Plus implemented with 10 years MOP  so flats can be affordable since this is what people asked for,btohqsg
Is it possible to increase our hdb loan?,btohqsg
Bank loan and hdb loan Both will have same amount using30% MSRThe only way to increase your loan amount is increase your salary,btohqsg
actually in fact bank loan may be lesser because interest rate higher,btohqsg
Ohh if the hdb calculator says our budget is ard 400k but the bto we are looking at is around 700k  this means that if we do get the flat we have to pay 300k in cash when we collect the keys?,btohqsg
I also hope i can strike toto,btohqsg
Its not possible to reassess our income closer to key collection date and get a high loan correct?,btohqsg
so the remaining can only be paid either via cash or cpf oa  is there any limit on how much can be paid via cpf oa?,btohqsg
am i able to drain it fully?,btohqsg
is it possible to get other loans to finance it?,btohqsg
Why not finance with bank loan?,btohqsg
we only clicked on hdb loan for our hfe  is it still possible to change?,btohqsg
hmm okays  thank you for all the help!,btohqsg
Either you or your partner should have worked for 14 months when you guys apply for HFE,btohqsg
I see  is it possible that when I apply grant they only consider my partner (cuz she worked for 12 months and I’m only 2 months)  but when I apply loan they count the overall income  in this case I can get a high grant with a high loan?,btohqsg
Hi all. May I check  if you cancel your bto application before signing the agreement of lease (which means you've paid the option fee)  are you still considered as first timer after being banned for one year?,btohqsg
High grant should mean lower loan,btohqsg
No ideabut more logically the ban should kick in when applicant does not select a flat despite given an appointment to do soIf option fee has been paid  it would be forfeited when BTO application is cancelled (if i don't remember wrongly),btohqsg
Yea  option fee is non-refundable. However after the one year ban  if decided to apply for bto again is the applicant considered as first timer still or second timer? Coz the grants all return back mah,btohqsg
Information that has been made public is -> grant - must have worked for full 12 months for income assessment> loan - must be working at the point of application  so both you and your partner's income should be assessedThings which are not officially made known (as far as i know) but gathered from people who shared their experiences -> the norm is lower income / higher grant / lower loan> for HLE but potentially applicable for HFE too: there may be reassessment of income when nearing key collection but more of  wanting to make sure that you can repay the loan amount that you were eligible forIf your income is lower than in the past  loan reassessed and may be loweredIf your income has increased  no change to loan amountEither you or your partner must have worked for at least 14 months when applying for HFE because of the cut off date,btohqsg
So  your question is  grant credited to your CPF account  then you want to cancel application before the appointment to sign lease...?,btohqsg
I forgot what the documents say leBut had them filed nicely 🤭,btohqsg
Haha  yeah cancel then if want to apply again is it consider first timers? Cause if second timer lower chance hor,btohqsg
Legal fees not refundable as it's considered utilisation of the service,btohqsg
Lower chance doesn't mean no chanceThere are also many first timers who don't get queue numbersPlus  ballot is more like luck or fate...,btohqsg
oh yes yes  of course!! Was just wondering how it affects if you're second timer,btohqsg
It start when HDB processed the cancellation,btohqsg
HFE does NOT have reassessment closer to key collection (unless you're under the deferred assessment scheme).This has been confirmed by calls with HDB and emails that people have shared in chats before.,btohqsg
Now the BTO price are more expensive. The tanglin halt cascadia 4 room BTO (Oct 2023) price from $537 000.00 to $702 000.00,btohqsg
Looks like reassessment is potentially applicable - HDB might ask applicant about their income situation when nearing key collection  like HLE practice. Otherwise  how will they know whether applicant is still employed when disbursing the loan?Even for HLE  based on what some people have shared  there isn't exactly reassessment per seHowever  HDB would contact applicant when nearer to key collection and renew the loan eligibilityProblem may arise when applicant's income is decreased. That is when income gets reassessed and loan amount eligible may be lowered tooBecause lower income is perceived as lower ability to repay loan,btohqsg
That makes sense :) So it's more of case by case then. Cos they can see our CPF anyways.,btohqsg
Just sharing... Many things based on hearsay tooSince some things cannot be found from HDB website 🫢When HFE was first implemented  some people got different answers for similar questions from HDB too...,btohqsg
However  HDB wouldn’t increase the loan amount even if there’s a subsequent increase in income. There was always an income reassessment before key collection with HLE. Things have changed with HFE.,btohqsg
HLE doesn't increase loan amount if income increasesBecause HDB had already given a higher grant to applicant previously,btohqsg
Anyway  i don't see why HDB wouldn't do their due diligence and confirm that applicant's income hasn't decreased as compared to when they applied for HDB loan  say  3 - 5 years before key collection,btohqsg
Maybe next time BTO prices will be $800k++ close to $900k for prime areas HDB scary 😦,btohqsg
Just wait and see  the future outram park area Pearl's Hill BTO price will be very..... expensive.,btohqsg
Pearl hill could be 600-800k with 12-15% clawbackSince havelock hillside 2022 already 531-730 k with 6% clawback,btohqsg
Initial launch is 6%  then 8%  now 9%.,btohqsg
"Maybe cause of ""experts"" who say it's too low.Adequate or not? Analysts mixed on 6% subsidy clawback for Rochor flats under new prime location modelSINGAPORE: A 6 per cent subsidy recovery – imposed on the resale of flats from the first housing project under the Prime Land Housing (PLH) model – has drawn mixed views from property analysts  with some believing it is “reasonable”  and others saying it is not high enough.",btohqsg
But seems like people still whacking PLH despite 9% clawback  so they'll keep increasing ba.,btohqsg
Ya with clawback  BTO looks affordable.Instead of 1M BTO  gov can launch at $800 k with 20% clawback 😂if not $700 k with 30% clawback,btohqsg
Even with increased grants  it's still more expensive than previous bto launch last year...,btohqsg
Floor is a factorLower floor is cheaperPrice increases with each floor up,btohqsg
500k is lowest floor  600k is highest floor.Example  24th floor block.Same stack or unit number  24th 23rd same price  22nd drop 3k  21st drop another 3k  until you reach lower floors like 6th floor where every floor difference is 10k plus.Unit with desirable features like corner unit vs others on the same floor can be another 10k difference.,btohqsg
My HFE letter expire on 20th October. High chance October launch will be few days after 20th. What is the procedure? Can I cancel current HFE and re apply? Is this allow?,btohqsg
Anyone seen a 30-40 storey price difference per floor before?,btohqsg
Yes more desirable stacks are also priced differently.,btohqsg
Each BTO will price the increase differently. Usually top 2-3 floors are the most ex followed by a slight price drop,btohqsg
Just sharing. You may refer to tanglin halt cascadia BTO Project(Oct'2023) pricing. (Every BTO the pricing are difference.),btohqsg
On September 20 onwards will have renew button on where the HFE letter isCan renew from thereAfter this June BTO period you can just cancel your HFE and reapply,btohqsg
Look out for HDB given deadline for Oct 24 BTO application,btohqsg
I miss my chance for the june bto launch,btohqsg
Can i still apply hfe and try my luck for june bto launch,btohqsg
Just apply HFE now. If really missed then at least you can apply for Oct launch,btohqsg
"Hi all.Can I ask during key collection  do they still do the typical ""wipe out your CPF OA  leaving behind 20K""? Or was that only last time?If we have alrdy paid 10% downpayment and have enough loan for the remaining 90%  will HDB still do the wiping out during key collection?",btohqsg
Hi hi! I have a genuine question I'd like to ask!!! Under the couples scheme If 1 is a student and 1 is working  applies for BTO  are the chances of getting a 5 room flat  high?I saw that they look at our income and they said as long as it doesn't hit the max capital income but how do they determine if we are eligible for a 5 room flat or a 4 room flat?,btohqsg
As long as you can apply  the chances will depend on the application rate.Whether your HDB loan is able to cover the costs or you have to take a bank loan is another issue.,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone have information on how does the proceeds from selling hdb to pay for BTO work? Can both proceeds and profits be used to pay for part of bto? And can continue using cpf to pay?Context is parents just became Singaporeans last year and wanna apply for new BTO. Current hdb house is really old.Been trying to find information on this  but unable to find any. Appreciate if anyone could let me know or link me up to forum/article on similar query!,btohqsg

Am I know what’s the remaining flat left for 3-room for Woodlands beacons ?,btohqsg
U may log in to the hdb or you can join the public chat that u follow the tracker,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone know how to reapply for a second HFE? Currently our loan assessment is based on one party’s income. I was still a student when we applied for the HFE  but now I have been working full time for the past 3 months. Our current HFE loan isn’t enough for the flat size we’re going for and we are planning to ballot during the September/October launch. Any advice is appreciated 🙏,btohqsg
If hfe expiring  when reapply. Its reassess one or the loan amount all will be the same as previous?,btohqsg
Will reassess. Loan amt might not be the same.,btohqsg
How long does it usually take to receive BTO ballot results?,btohqsg
2 months. Apply in June  results in August,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know if there are anymore SBF launches this year?,btohqsg
Hi can I check if I alr have a queue number from the previous BTO but it’s slightly out of the number of flats available  can I still apply for the June BTO?,btohqsg
June results will come out in Aug 2024  but does anyone know when we will be invited to select the flats?,btohqsg
Hi just a question   if my husband and I have applied for the HFE and it's approved but quit the job after 3 months due to family problem & then went to work grab for time being until everything settled then go back to work but different job due to the timing issues . Do we still need to re apply for the HFE if we intend to apply for the October launch as the June launch areas are far from the place we wanted,btohqsg
based on past launches: Depends on project  HDB will stagger the start date. They will share the month that it starts when results are released,btohqsg
Hi all does anyone know how to track for Chencharu Yishun ??,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how to see whether there’s any more balance flats for rail green?,btohqsg
Can try the group chat  SM's tracker MIGHT have an indication if there's leftoverThey also have an excel unit tracker (manual  volunteer basis usually) but you will need to check if it's updatedGroup chat:https://t.me/choachukangsep2023bto,btohqsg
Next year Feb . But not sure if I need to re apply if my husband income change then need to re apply for the HFE in regards to the financial income,btohqsg
Advise you to follow their timeline in terms of applying 1 month ahead  as they may require more time to process,btohqsg
Expiry in February 2025 means approval is this month?So  your husband intending to change job in August / September until things are more settled?,btohqsg
You can contact HDB maybe when his job is more settled or mid Aug and explain your situation to seek their advice since your case is unique. Either via HDB hotline or efeedback@Sillybendanzxc,btohqsg
She already has a valid HFE...,btohqsg
After the approval due to some family issues   he has to quit his job and decide to do grab for time being cause his past job needs to work until 12.30am but reach home at roughly 2 am and it's hard for him to manage his time to take care of my girl as I need to regularly go for checkup at the hospital .,btohqsg
My personal opinion -1) is the new income higher or lower than what was assessed in your existing HFE2) are you looking at higher grant or higher loan3) likelihood of your husband getting a new job that pays the same or higher than before?Other alternatives instead of quitting job?Change to part time? Take no pay leave?4) other ways of financing BTO during key collection if not relying on loan? CPF? Cash?,btohqsg
Yupyup  agree with this. If its more beneficial for a review then you can reach out to HDB for further assistance.I know of people who updated their HFE (still valid  ahead of expiry) before they get a resale since they could a higher loan which they prefer.,btohqsg
Plus  if she apply for October launch  BTO completion is few years laterPretty much how confident they are in getting a new job that pays same or higher and/or repaying the loan  assuming amount eligible is higher in existing HFE,btohqsg
But also  in case income lower than previous  HDB might or might not revise loan amount downward  so have to also consider how else to finance the flat or apply for a unit based on what they can afford more comfortably nowBasically  don't let $$$ become the cause of arguments and quarrels in the future,btohqsg
Maybe another consideration is -Say  apply for new HFE in September  the income documents submitted required are probably August 2023 until July 2024If husband is still in the current job in July  will be like not much difference than the financial situation assessed for existing HFE  unless there is pay cut?,btohqsg
Ok thanks so much guys .,btohqsg
Hope things gonna turn out fine for you!,btohqsg
hy how about woodgrove edge track  anyone?,btohqsg
Can a 4K house hold income get a 4room flat in non mature ?,btohqsg
I don't think is calculate like that... Should be looking at income ceilingWho knows  the 4k household is rich in cash savings leh?,btohqsg
If say cash n cpf have saving but monthy income 4K can get a 4 room bto in a non mature ?,btohqsg
Don't really understand your question...You can read the website and see if you are eligible to apply for the BTOIn terms of payment  ask yourself whether you can affordCost of BTO - grant - CPF - loan = any balance  you pay in cash,btohqsg
I mean  even the cheapest 2R will cost more than 4kWhether you can afford the BTO of your preference also depends on your own financial planning,btohqsg
If you are intending to apply based on Mature / Non Mature  you should apply in the current June exercise that is ending in 2 daysNext BTO exercise in October will be based on Standard / Plus / Prime model,btohqsg
Perhaps you wanna read up this reference by HDB@botcamo👇🏼Additionally  your HFE should indicate if you're eligible to buy 3 room or 4 room flat.,btohqsg
Planning to purchase a new home at the June sales launch?Work out your housing budget with HDB’s online calculators athttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg.,btohqsg
HFE will show you total HDB loan+ grant amountJust take it HDB loan won't increase on key collectionDo your maths,btohqsg
BTO are going up on every BTO exercise,btohqsg
Hi just wondering  HDB loan won't increase means they won't reassess our income anymore?,btohqsg
I heard they will assess ur income nearer to key collection  but its only to check if u are able to pay off  if not they'll decrease loan but not increase,btohqsg
Thanks! Cause I heard alot of different info from different people. Some say need reach out to HDB officers directly so they will reassess if not they won't do it anymore,btohqsg
If don't reassess it will be stressful though  means based on 1 income 1 student (for my case),btohqsg
It's case by case based not 100% will increase loanHDB don't want people to plan base on future salary,btohqsg
Then if they decrease loan the grant will up ?,btohqsg
Look at the deferred income assessment,btohqsg
Im not sure but we shld just assume worse case  but best to just ask hdb directly,btohqsg
Aw... so much has changed   isn't this at disadvantaged for students. But government kept encouraging us to apply BTO,btohqsg
Gov also encourage birth rate but yet so hard to get bto😂😂,btohqsg
"Deferred income assessment is only if both parties are students/ very fresh grads (within 12 months)/ NS men. If only 1 they won't allow. I tried to call and check before :"")",btohqsg
So is it for the updated scheme Grants and loans will be assessed nearing BTO key collection period??Previously was give grant first  then loan nearing key collection then assess.,btohqsg
😪 then how to afford bto,btohqsg
HLE and HFE is different.You need HFE to buy BTO and resale. HFE gives you the grant and loan amount. It doesn't change  only decreases. The rest is appeal basis.,btohqsg
Use the budget calculator for a prudent decision. If not do the preliminary check. You'll get a good reality check on what you can afford!,btohqsg
Nope grant is given before the 2nd appt (signing of lease) so that any grant you get will be used to offset your down payment amount,btohqsg
So on the 2appt they will check increase or decrease the grant based on monlyhy income,btohqsg
Nope. Loan and grant are assessed and fixed during HFE,btohqsg
They will just disburse the grant before the 2nd appt so that it's in your CPF to be used during 2nd appt,btohqsg
Ya this is the scary part because means is based on our lower income when we applied?,btohqsg
Then technically we will earn more 4 years later,btohqsg
Then if we apply hfe then behind monlthy income drop,btohqsg
Do you qualify for deferred assessment?,btohqsg
nope. if your income increase  they can reassess for loan only but you have to forgo your grant.,btohqsg
If eligible  you would have received the grant in your CPF OA before your second appointment,btohqsg
If lower income  grant would be higher and loan lowerHDB doesn't ask applicants to return the grant when their income increases too,btohqsg
My viewpoint is HFE = HLE + grant etc assessed and made known to applicant all at oncePeople also needed HLE when applying for BTO before HFE was implementedHLE = housing loan eligibility  only for the loan partGrant is like a separate letter of sort,btohqsg
Deferred assessment is not newThere is even lower % deposit or something for staggered payment scheme nowHLE era -1) apply HLE2) income assessment for grantFlat selection somewhere here??3) grant is credited into CPF OA4) sign lease  pay deposit5) HDB renews or reassess HLE when nearer key collectionIncome no change or higher - no change to loan amount eligibleIncome decrease - HLE reassessed and may be revised downward,btohqsg
Thanks for the info guys :),btohqsg

Ye Leong KangCan read the priority schemes here:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes,btohqsg
I bought previous hdb house with my wife and child.this time bought hdb flat again,btohqsg
so can not choose priority schemes,btohqsg
Ok :) just make sure to read through carefully before submitting  else hard to resubmit,btohqsg
not yet got time see the new house from hdb,btohqsg
The more grant u have means your income is lower. The lesser your Grant means your income is higherHdb will give u more when your income low ma,btohqsg
give me just take.I also don't know it which one,btohqsg
Since you said that you're a second timer  did you take grant previously? If yes  probably the next house you won't be eligible for grants,btohqsg
Do you see yourself as being low income?,btohqsg
Can as they will constitute forming a family nucleus.,btohqsg
Can read up more on this >https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-publications/publications/hdbspeaks/helping-singleparent-households,btohqsg

Hi asking for my dad… can a 70 yr old divorcee apply for a 3room bto for second time? First bto was way back in the early 90s… now staying 5 room… will get any levy charged?,btohqsg
Hi for retired parents of newly bought resale flat just curious how our HFE eligibility would look like if wanna apply for BTO,btohqsg
If applying as single  maybe 2R only?,btohqsg
Hey all  could someone help a newbie out and direct me to somewhere that I could find the available units left for Urban Rise and Woodlands Beacon estate?,btohqsg
Thanks for the response! Actually i'm due for an appt in 2 weeks time for those 2 estate. I'm not too sure how to navigate to find out what is left over.,btohqsg
Great! I found it! You're a lifesaver!,btohqsg
Non-related BTO but sorry I couldn't help but to observe this particular user here often than not like to mimic answers that been said by previous users. It happened on SBF group chat as well. Funny but are you an AI or typically FOMO? It's seriously unnecessary. I understand this is community group chat; but no need to repeat when the answer is the same though. What do you even get? A medal from HDB? 😂 I get that you're helpful but no need to waste time mimic answers la hahaha,btohqsg
I think it’s ok to repeat answers there are always new folks joining,btohqsg
End of the day depending  of what kind of prospective you are looking at.Everyone is sharing for free  is a community  effort to maintain the channel.,btohqsg
Can I apply BTO at different area during same periods?,btohqsg
What about the situation that   I submit BTO application  then 1mth later the SBF is launched before I get any results for the BTO I applied earlier  can I also apply SBF? Will BTO application still valid?,btohqsg
system will block u from applying,btohqsg
And anyway SBF is once year now,btohqsg
Oh I see  ok thanks for info.,btohqsg
now bto are spaced apart so u get results before they launch next one,btohqsg
You read my mind for my actually next question. Thanks Jocelyn.,btohqsg
one more info is if this project if u applied  and u get queue no. within supply of project  system will block u from applying for next project also,btohqsg
and if u reject  will be 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
I see. System block but not ask 'if I would like to give up my 1st submission'?,btohqsg
Anyway 2nd timer status  from what i hear it starts from the day u are supposed to select ur unit (But some also said starts from when u call to cancel application so i am not 100% sure here!),btohqsg
Or are u asking within same application period? Sorry forgot clarify ur qn,btohqsg
Before given a chance of selecting unit.,btohqsg
Should be from the date you cancel the application but should confirm with HDB if anyone is serious about doing it,btohqsg
Yeah if you reject after application close will be 2nd timer if u are called up for appointment and rejects it,btohqsg
yea thats what i thought  but hdb said different things to different people hahaha best to email and get black n white 😬😬,btohqsg
One of my friend given a queue number but left few units before the selection  so decided not to turn up at hdb office  thereafter received a letter was told he is now consider 2nd timer if he submit a new application in the next project.,btohqsg
Hahaha yea definitely good to get black and white  sometimes when you talk to diff cs officers  they will tell you diff things,btohqsg
This was from Oct 2023 launch? From Oct 2023  <10 units can get waiver,btohqsg
If <10 units i think he can call and ask for waiver of 2nd timer status,btohqsg
Ya hahaha and also must chase them reply email  hdb took like 3mths to reply me 🫣,btohqsg
My friend said it is not buying vegetables at the market so if left few units cannot anyhow choose. It is over few hundred thousand dollars.,btohqsg
Yeah  prior to Oct 2023  need to appeal for waiver. From Oct 2023  it's set in stone - 10 units or fewer,btohqsg
My one i chase until i select unit  the officer in charge help me chase the person to reply 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
Im online so can ban quickly,btohqsg
Yup from oct 23  reject if given appointment = 2nd timer for a year unless < 10 units  this is to make sure people who applies are serious in wanting to get a house,btohqsg
previous because have 1 free pass the application all sky rocket 💀,btohqsg
So now my friend can write to ask for waiver? cos he is put as 2nd timer now.,btohqsg
When was the application / flat selection?,btohqsg
I mean appeal anyone also can  but subjected to HDB's approval  no harm trying,btohqsg
Ok will pass message to ask him to try.,btohqsg
Thanks everyone for the info & answers.,btohqsg
anyone is the admin for keat hong verge ?,btohqsg
But actually for this also abit..<10 units. Person A can choose to forfeit and no penalty givenBut what if unlucky suay suay his turn call up & he’s the last few to choose  Person A left only 12-15 units?That sucks 🥲So it’s all depends on luck & fate ba for BTO / SBF nowadays 2024 🍀,btohqsg
Ya last time alot of free play for2021/2022Now no more. HDB v strict nowadays,btohqsg
Hi all  let’s say there are a total of 200 BTO units  700 applicants total (250 first timers/ 450 second timers).Hdb website states 95% of the BTO is set aside for first timers. And there is also priority schemes such as married child/live near parents.My question is  How does HDB balloting works. Will the first timers (priority scheme) still be balloted together with the second timer? Therefore even second timers if lucky have the chance to choose a unit (ie. smaller queue number) before the first timers even when hdb states 95% of the units is for first timers?Sorry if abit confusing.,btohqsg
Yes the 5% of second timer can get better queue number than 95% of first timer,btohqsg
June application tmr end. Wait how long to receive email about queue number?,btohqsg
Final application rate results  tmr 2pm,btohqsg
Hi future neighbors  putting here to share about HFE loan reassessment. HDB came to my school for a talk last week. Along with a staff  the CEO held a q&a.The staff clarified during the q&a that yes  there will be a review for loan assessment but it isnotfor higher loan amount. Is is only for lower amount  do not expect loan revision to be higher if it is reassessed. Their official stance is to make up the shortfall (if any) with cash or change to bank loan. The CEO then said that this is partly to close the loophole of high grant + high loan.(Edit: there also will not be an option to forgo the grant to get higher loan )I don’t have black and white  but that’s what was being said during the talk. I guess since he’s the highest ranking exec  this should be firm until further notice 😅,btohqsg
From somewhere to Telegram Parc Meadow BTO to Tiktok back to Telegram,btohqsg
Take bank loan if cannot meet the shortfall. But more importantly plan with current income,btohqsg
How about other priority schemes and ethnic quotas?,btohqsg
The reassessment but no higher loan is not new though... Has been the same for HLE  as i have heard so far,btohqsg
HDB might not have really made it official in case there are special cases that require exceptions? 🤔Had to write some process documents for a department in the past and was told that some details are not necessary. The more is written into the document  the more restrictive it can become  except there is still a norm of how things are done,btohqsg
Correct. I appealed for waiver and it was successful.,btohqsg
Hi guys  IF I get a queue number for this June  can I still apply for October?,btohqsg
If your queue number is within supply  noIf out of supply  yes,btohqsg
Meaning if I don’t get a queue number  I can apply for subsequent ones? This is different from the past is it? Or is it all along like this?,btohqsg
No queue number at all  you can apply for Oct 2024 launchThis has been in effect since Oct 2023! Before this no restrictions,btohqsg
Do note that if you do end up getting called for selection for Jun  and you don't select  your Oct 2024 / subsequent applications will be cancelled and you will become a 2nd timer for 1 yearNick,btohqsg
Hey  is anyone an admin in the Holland village chat lol  there's just porn in there,btohqsg
anyone have the payment schedule for bto? first timer hdb loan. like when need to pay cash when will cpf be wiped out when monthly payment tru cpf/cash?,btohqsg
You should write into HDB to ask. They can advise you specifically on your circumstances.,btohqsg
GIRO deduction on every 28th of the monthOther cash methods - no dates definedBut if in continuous employment and CPF contributions  probably won't wipe out OA so easily...?https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/servicing-your-hdb-housing-loan/loan-matters/payment,btohqsg
But what happens if both partners have very hugely differing CPF OA balances? If wipe out (leaving behind 20k)  then wouldnt that mean that both partners are not paying the same amount? How does HDB navigate this unbalance/unfairness among the 2 partners? I'm sure it's a common issue.,btohqsg
"Not sure what your backhanded ""compliment"" towards people who want to share more is aboutAnd mimic? Most people know what they are talking about when trying to help out with questions raised by fellow users in this group  not like they copy & paste answer from another personRegardless of who you are referring to  there were times when i do chip in on what others might have already responded too  either because have additional info or for clarification purpose...Perhaps there were times that i missed that someone else had already provided the same answer as mine beforehand?I suppose people should make a mental note about your name. Like  if you ask a question and someone else have responded  no one else should reply further even if additional info could help you understand things better or get you more prepared of what to expect or confirm that you are getting the correct info etc... Like your backhanded compliment is also totally unnecessary 😂😂",btohqsg
How much money each partner pays is between themselvesThey inform HDB of how much to deduct from whose account and HDB only executes the instructions,btohqsg
"But how does this tie in with the ""HDB will drain away both CPF OA  leaving only balance of 20k per person""?",btohqsg
Lets say I have 50k in my CPF OA. Partner has 80K in her CPF OA.  Just an example.If the draining happens  wouldnt it mean we're paying different amounts at key collection?,btohqsg
Whatever you pay  have to be returned to CPF with accrued interest after you sell the flat later on in life anyways.,btohqsg
you'll just tell hdb how much to drain (keep 20k or dont keep),btohqsg
theres an option to keep 20k or just drain all,btohqsg
But the thing is. This draining - is it equal among the partners? If its not equal  doesnt that mean both partners are paying different amounts for the BTO?,btohqsg
When you and your partner apply for the BTO together  both of you are considered as  like  one entityHow much you pay and how much your partner pays is between the both of you  be it through CPF or cashHDB is not some family courtThey can advise or recommend but final decision is up to the coupleAnd who knows  a person might pay less through CPF but fork out more cash and vice versa for the partnerIf a couple is concerned about separation or divorce  as per some news reported in the media  proof of who contributed more to the house and so on can be presented too,btohqsg
It’s up to you to decide. If deposit is $60k. U can tell them each $30k. Or u can even say you want to split $50k/$10k.Entirely up to you and your partner.,btohqsg
My worry is this - most of my CPF OA funds are parked away in investments. So when the time comes for HDB to drain my CPF OA  it will mean that I am paying very little for our BTO.Seems like only way is for my to liquidate my CPF investments?,btohqsg
Or else can pay cash 😂,btohqsg
Sorry  what deposit are you referring to? We have alrdy made 10% downpayment previously.,btohqsg
Yes or you topup in cash lo,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter what deposit im referring to. Any payment you make  can tell them how you want to split.,btohqsg
So only after HDB drains out the CPF  will the balance amount be given as loan?,btohqsg
Decision between the partnersAnyway  there was a person in this group who shared about his situation but subsequently deleted his postGist - he is SC  partner is notHe received grant but partner did notSo  both of them were supposed to pay 50/50 for the BTOHis partner paid the deposit through her CPF and he paid his share using both grant and less than 10k cash,btohqsg
Up to you and your partner on how to finance the flat... Drain CPF  keep 20k in OA  loan or cash etcIf you are concerned about you paying little for the BTO  you should be discussing about that with your partner,btohqsg
Sorry to ask.If our loan is high enough  will HDB still make it a point to drain out our CPF OA?,btohqsg
You can choose to keepminimum20k in your OAAlso  whether or not your loan is high enough  you should also consider if you can pay back the loanEsp if you guys plan to renovate  have kids or maybe other plans like one quits job and both live on a single income  start a business etc... All these are $$$,btohqsg
I mean  getting a house is supposed to be a happy thingWouldn't want to fight with partner due to money for the house next time... That is why have to carefully think through,btohqsg
Erm  i thought is minimum 🤔,btohqsg
I primarily see 20k as the recommended amount  ha ha,btohqsg
Like  keep in OA to service the loan  in case loss of income / CPF contribution stuff like that,btohqsg
Oh... If like that  sounds like can be minimum or maximum too?,btohqsg
A friend also said 20k is maximum but didn't quite understand his explanation... 😂🫢,btohqsg
Regardless of loan quantum  hdb will drain cpf oa first before disbursing loan. You can only choose to keep max 20k,btohqsg
Ah thank you! This is clearer to me now,btohqsg
I see. This is clear now. Thank you!,btohqsg
OA can be wiped out? i thought have to retain 20k either way?,btohqsg
oh so can put OA to zero la. the 20% downpayment can use cpf? usually the downpayment is made upon appointment in aug 24 (june 24 bto)? so the wiping out of OA is done upon key collection after 5 yrs when the project TOP right? asking about timelines becasue i use cpf oa buy tbill so working out timelines and funds,btohqsg
First appointment option fee cashSecond appointment down payment CPF (will know the % on first appointment) with the use of gains if availableKey collection ( wiping CPF before HDB loan),btohqsg
Downpayment  stamp duty  conveyance etc - can use CPFFirst appointment - pay option fee in cashSecond appointment - typically 6 - 9 months later  sign lease  pay depositIf eligible for EHG  it will be credited before your second appointment date,btohqsg
ah ok. thanks thanks! will create a gantt chart so i dont forget. so for now can reinvest the returned tbill funds in cpfia (bought end of the month 6mths ago so if dont reinvest now will lose 2mths. haha),btohqsg
FYI for Jun BTO  you will only receive ballot results by Aug.Ballot results differs from flat selection.For Dec 2023 launch  selection started from late Mar 2024For Feb 2024  only Tanjong Tree(Hougang) started selection on 25 Jun (other projects no movement yet),btohqsg
For flat selection  can monitor from SM's unofficial tracker too...https://t.me/btoapptdates,btohqsg
I wonder how the queue number allocated? Though some % goes to 1st timer  2nd timer etc  will hdb actually let 1st timer (starting queue no. 1.....last number) to select their units first  then start 2nd timer (with queue no.1) etc?,btohqsg
Or concurrently: means tgere are different sets of queue numbers.when 1st timer (1st in the queue) & 2nd timer (1st in the queue)  otger categories (1st in the queue) to choose the unit?,btohqsg
There's only 1 set of queue number,btohqsg
How about MCPS   ethnic quota etc ?,btohqsg
all same set of queue no.,btohqsg
ethnic quota is alr factored in when they release queue no.,btohqsg
Hi  if during key collection appointment  we need to pay a big lump sum of cash of more than $100k  what are the payment methods available? By Nets  credit card or cheque?,btohqsg
If remember correctly HDB only accepted Nets and cash cheque order,btohqsg
Cashier's orderNETS  may have to check if any limits imposed,btohqsg
Is this what u are looking for?,btohqsg
Example bro.. rough schedule and estimated figures,btohqsg
@thumper9223and@nylecojnatsome musings about ethnic quota from SM,btohqsg
Hi  any resident here from kempas and received this?,btohqsg
Not from KempasRoadshows usually held for BTOs which are having key collection soon,btohqsg
Omg thanks@purrevilfor replying! I can't wait for key collection! 😍,btohqsg
Ya!! Super excited! Usually key collection is how long after this roadshow?,btohqsg
"No problem! Congrats!!!Not sure how long after the roadshow that you will get news of key collection but  yeah  HDB organizes them for BTOs which will be handed over to the new owners ""soon""Anyway  let me try ask another group if they have info on how ""soon"" 😅😅",btohqsg
Maybe i should volunteer with HDB for these roadshows...Free food😂😂🤭🫢,btohqsg
A member from another group shared that her estate roadshow was end April  key collection started end May and will complete end AugustI didn't ask her which or how big her estate is thoughVaguely remember some people getting virtual tour of the BTO apartment before key collection tooBut don't know if they are generic ones or specific to their unit numberMaybe can also look up defect checkers  other than sourcing for reno,btohqsg
This sounded promising!! Hav been waiting since 2018.. I wish it can b v soon cos I m tired of sending my kid to hongwen everyday hahahaah,btohqsg
Hi  idk if this is relevant to this group. Was hoping someone can tell me if i do not want to put in any cash monthly for loan repayments  do I put the same number for both Monthly Income and Monthly Financial Commitments columns? Thanks alot!,btohqsg
Do you know when they will release brochures for June BTO?,btohqsg
Ard results period so probably August,btohqsg
hi  can anyone send me the group chat link for bedok chai chee?,btohqsg
If anyone can advise about OCS after confirmed during the selection of flat   now want to opt-out still possible ?,btohqsg
Contact HDB and ask for cancellation.Need to go down and sign documents.,btohqsg
Hi all  I've gotten an flat selection for Oct 23 BTO  but am outside of supply  does that mean we have a flat secure? caused based on our understanding the current drop out rate is still below our chance.,btohqsg
Don't mind asking what's your Q number?eg 1XX/65,btohqsg
ah  so its what i expect  so there will be a chance the appointment will be cancel if there is not enough dropout or quota,btohqsg
Ltv mean what so if a 4K household can only buy a 300k house  ?,btohqsg

Hi  can anyone tell me where can I view the latest progress update (up till 30 Jun 2024) on the construction status regarding Yishun Broadwalk BTO?  I would like to view the photos taken of the project construction.  Thanks.,btohqsg
Essential occupier haven’t 5 year but take a flat selection will they reject or approve,btohqsg
Essential Occupier need to stay after the MOP then can buy flat la,btohqsg
Essential occupier most stay during the MOP period and also cannot buy other HDB during this periodMain Applicant only can have 1 HDB unit at anyone timeIf u want buy another condo can. After your essential occupier after MOP go buy CondoThisnis how ppl do,btohqsg
So the essential Occupier can buy a condoRather both is the main applicants in HDB application as 1st and 2nd owmer after MOP u need to pay levy to buy condo leh,btohqsg
So essential occupier cannot apply for bto project?,btohqsg
Can you share your true story instead of piece meal.,btohqsg
Occupiers who are essential for you to meet an eligibility scheme for the flat purchasemust continue to be listed in the flat application and live in the flat during the MOP. They cannot apply or be listed in an HFE letter to buy an HDB flat or Executive Condominium unit from a property developer.,btohqsg
So basically my mother use my name as essentially occupier but now I apply for a bto so they need to appeal,btohqsg
U already apply BTO how can be essential to another project? U can split into 2 to stay at 2 unit ? Haha,btohqsg
Your mother can apply as single why go for family,btohqsg
Cannot. Must fulfil the MOP. You apply also waste 10 dollar hahahhaa,btohqsg
Try apply also cannot ma. The hdb system wont lets u,btohqsg
May I ask what’s the pro of listing children or child as occupier(s)? Is it necessary to list them?,btohqsg
List it . They living w u ma. Pros is when they are in the household. Gov will treat as 1 headcount  when u applying like Chas card or whatever they count more household ppl ma.When u apply subsidy for childcare all this also get more because u have more household in the family,btohqsg
Unless u old already no need all this,btohqsg
Thank you Kris. But will it affect or has restrictions for my kids who apply bto on their own with the other halves.,btohqsg
Listing as occupierThey need to stay in for 5 / 10 years MOP depending on the house area / PLHAfter which when they applied BTO in their own name count as first timer,btohqsg
Those who form a family group/ those who's name are use for the BTO has to stay together until MOP,btohqsg
there is a group for this bto,btohqsg
current drop rate 16%...my Q is somemore behind u,btohqsg
After we get Q number  will HDB tell us the date or month for flat selection?,btohqsg

hi all  ive recently applied for June's BTO. The problem now is i just received an invitation to book a flat for my Dec 2023 application.If i were to reject this booking of flat  will it affect my June's BTO application? If so  how should i go about this matter?,btohqsg
I saw online that  if you adds to reject December’s invitation  they will also cancel off your June application too,btohqsg
Not sure if you’d become second timer tho if you were to cancel,btohqsg
Maybe you can contact HDB to find out the exact details,btohqsg
"wahhh i want my june one... :"")",btohqsg
Now the HDB ruling very strict,btohqsg
reject dec booking = cancel off june,btohqsg
yea just called  thats what they said...,btohqsg
sian i want my june one but dw dec LOL,btohqsg
U better call hdb to check.Means your Dec 2023 project u out of Q ?,btohqsg
issok my problem solved le cuz they said flats for chinese sold out LOL,btohqsg

Hi there  seeking some clarification from the experienced here.Assuming an elderly applied for the 2 room flexi for the Dec 2023 batch  and the Feb 2024 batch.Both got a queue number but Dec 2023 was way over the supplied flats  surprisingly got called down for selection soon.If the elderly were to reject/no show for the Dec 2023 appointment  can they still select a unit for the Feb 2024 batch?,btohqsg
must select whichever called up first else subsequent one all will be cancelled,btohqsg
So the appointment is next week  and as of now there’s less than 20 units left.Let’s say on the day of the appointment left 5 units but nothing that the elderly want  don’t select will also get the penalty?,btohqsg
Oh if its < 10 units can ask for waiver,btohqsg
but best to email in n ask,btohqsg
Sounds like the applicant has a preference for the February project?Are you guys in the BTO and/or Tele groups of the December one?It is not necessarily everyday that there is selection for the same project,btohqsg
Hi  only BTO related content here  so I'll delete this thanks,btohqsg
You also need to factor ethnic quota.. If you scroll up  someone received invitation to select flat but due to ethnic quota so she no need to come down.. Best to call & check with HDB,btohqsg
I think this was the message,btohqsg
issok my problem solved le cuz they said flats for chinese sold out LOL,btohqsg
Hi  anyone from towner and gotten letter to collect keys?,btohqsg

Hello everyone   wanna ask u guys something. If I’m unemployed  can I self contribute to cpf and declare that I’m self employed so to qualify for higher loan amount in hfe ?,btohqsg
This one no bto contents ah? May I ask?,btohqsg
U need NOA for self employed,btohqsg
U mean notice of assessment ?,btohqsg
I chanced upon a mutual friend posting on her ig. Perhaps this might be useful for you..,btohqsg
I noticed the design for hdb flats looks similar regardless plh or standard. The selling prices are greatly differed . Besides the location  I wonder if the quality of the materials and work is different or similar.,btohqsg
HDBs are built using a legolike construction method now :),btohqsg
Not all the projects are PPVC,btohqsg
So the quality is the same only the facade and the external designs are different.,btohqsg
Judging from the recent problems by the new Punggol and Tengah BTo. Are we expecting these issues as common problems as they are mostly prefabricated?,btohqsg
Is it a norm to engage professionals to inspect the new bto flats after taking the keys.,btohqsg
Defect checking  before starting renoNot uncommon for people to do soBut homeowner should also decide after the inspection which defects die die must be rectified as the defect checking person might highlight some aesthetic flaws which the inhabitants can also live with somehow...,btohqsg
it's down to the company contracted for your individual project  some are good  the Punggol one was dismissed and another company took over IIRC.,btohqsg
Yes... It was Punggol Point CoveThe contractor was facing financial problems or something  and HDB ended up appointing another contractor for the project and Toh Guan Grove,btohqsg
Thank you so much for these information. I wonder those bto flats completed with 3 years might have defects issues. Also wondering why plh takes 5 years plus to complete. If the methods of construction are similar  how can the completion period make such a great difference?,btohqsg
uhm  completion differs for each project  mine is 3 years +  the project besides mine is 4 years.,btohqsg
smaller project  shorter buildings = faster,btohqsg
Doesn't seem like Punggol Point Cove is really PPVCThe only project in the same exercise to be built with PPVC was in Tampines,btohqsg
Very informative indeed. Thank you! 🙏,btohqsg

If i applied a bto and put my child and spouse as essential occupier  will they be deemed as 2nd timer when they apply for a bto in the future?,btohqsg
If parent-child  no impact to child as they would not receive the grant so can still be first timer.If spouse is essential occupier  they will be deemed 2nd timer,btohqsg
Huh i thought if spouse co-owner that will be deemed as 2nd timer though 🤔Essential occupier and co-owner are 2 different things,btohqsg
You can refer to thishttps://www.99.co/singapore/insider/essential-occupier-hdb/End of day  regardless of what is shared in chat group highly recommend to contact HDB cause if they change policy all of us wont be first to know 🤣,btohqsg
child no problem. actually can put spouse as essential occupier but there will be some impacts later. it's best to call/eFeedback to HDB on this.,btohqsg

Hm did she graduate within the past 12 months? based on the eligibility criteria on HDB's website  yall won't be eligible for deferred income scheme  meaning that loan and grant will be assessed per normal (apply for HFE).https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/booking-of-flat,btohqsg
She hasn't graduated yet from her pt degree.since both of us are unemployed  we also do not qualify for any loans as well?,btohqsg
Based on the eligibility criteria  technically needs to be FT degree to qualify for deferred assessment. BUT really think you should contact HDB to check on your situation. Maybe it's possible to get deferred income assessment on a case-by-case basis,btohqsg
Hdb hub to visit to view models can go any time?,btohqsg

Hello  please help me out. I’m working for 4 years and my partner is going to ORD next month which opts us out of DIA. Fortunately we got a number for one of the bto but our loan amt is not much as it was based on one income. Will hdb give extra loan during key collection after taking in account his income?,btohqsg
If its HFE letter then cannot,btohqsg
U can try appealing though  subjected to HDB approval,btohqsg
I tried appealing for reassessment of loan but sadly got rejected and they ask me try for DIA but I know I’m not eligible :/,btohqsg
Sorry not applicable to BTO so I have deleted,btohqsg
they asked u to go for DIA even though you cant even meet the criteria?,btohqsg
Cos i was otp with hdb jn,btohqsg
But my appeal was unsuccessful cos both me and husb both not students or ns,btohqsg
They asked me to send some documents to see if I’m eligible,btohqsg
Haven’t got back from them yet. But I know I’m not eligible,btohqsg
Just try appeal see if they allow,btohqsg
i see  the recent change to hfe makes everything so difficult,btohqsg
I’m not eligible as well but I still appealed and got my DIA approved today! 🙏🏼🙏🏼,btohqsg
good news! Wondering which scenario you fall in? 1 working adult and 1 student?,btohqsg
When I applied for the HFE  my fiancée was still a full time student but now she’s already working full time. So can consider 1 working adult  1 student,btohqsg
So you were alr working more than 12 months?,btohqsg
I got a friend same situation as you. Got his DIA approved as well,btohqsg
So just try to appeal for DIA,btohqsg
Just hope HDB will approve it🙏🏼🙏🏼,btohqsg
🥹so happy to hear all this! Yes hopefully!,btohqsg
Do we have to wait to be called to know if our DIA got approved or they will send email?,btohqsg
they will send an email to you,btohqsg
1 working adult and 1 NS?,btohqsg
I hope they make amendments to the DIA and our either/or instead of both.,btohqsg
Makes life so much easier haha,btohqsg
This is what I received from HDB today,btohqsg
Sorry  but they asked for CPF OA statement but I’m not sure how to retrieve it alone.,btohqsg
So I sent a SS of the page. Hahaha help pls.,btohqsg
For that they’ll know how much your cpf is during flat selection.. I printed out my cpf statement etc but no use. The hdb officer didn’t even ask me for all of that,btohqsg
I’ve been working 4 years and they wanna see how much I have in my cpf OA and they asked me send a statement of it through the feedback form to appeal for DIA.,btohqsg
If they asked you for that   just give it to them. For mine they asked for my graduation certificate,btohqsg
I graduated long ago but I just give it to them,btohqsg
They asked my graduation cert  cpf OA statement and my partners NS card and CPF OA,btohqsg
Yaaa what they want you just give. Makes it easier for them to process your DIA if eligible,btohqsg
Have any idea how to retrieve the CPF OA statement only? 😅,btohqsg
Yeah submitted hahah waiting for reply but dk if I did the CPF OA part correctly,btohqsg
It shows your OA SA MA,btohqsg
Can choose from which month to which month,btohqsg
Btw how long did they take to reply you?,btohqsg
Wah maybe you can try to login cpf website and search for transaction history for 4 years worth,btohqsg
if you're on mobile  it's simple.. after you at the login page  at the right top 3 lines > tap on my cpf > tap on my statements > tap on yearly statement of account > tap on the PDF icon to generate the statement..contribution history can produce 1 and half years only,btohqsg
Hihi? Anybody got experience applying for bto as a cabin crew and how does hdb assess the loan amount?,btohqsg
It will still by CPF amount  contribution and 12 Months payslip. Apply for your HFE then you will know how much maximum loan they gave.,btohqsg
But if by cpf amount then as a cabin crew if my income ceiling exceeds the cap then how will that work also,btohqsg
Not sure about this  but you might drop a feedback form to HDB to have them to answer you.,btohqsg
You can also do a preliminary check under the HFE letter. That'll be a good gauge.,btohqsg
Got my DIA approved 🥹 thank you!,btohqsg
Hi everyone  full disclosure  I am an Interior Designer  feel free to ask me any questions regarding your renovation.,btohqsg
That’s great!! So happy for you!,btohqsg
Hi when  canberra  drive  BTO completely?,btohqsg
They will likely ask for it 2-3 months before key collection.,btohqsg
No ah grant was given before your 2nd appointment.As for the loan  I’m not too sure. If it’s a couple  the loan amount will reduce accordingly unless the other partner likely earns the same amount as the couple in the past.,btohqsg
You need to write into HDB to ask them what is their process if this does happen.,btohqsg
Oh I see… then pls write into HDB to check pls!,btohqsg
Nope. HFE is the confirmed grant + loan amount. Grant will be disbursed before 2nd appointment  and then during 2nd appt  the grant be used to offset your downpayment,btohqsg
hi  just to check. Once my HFE is approved  i dont have to provide any documents right?,btohqsg
Just curious  why some BTO new projects have balconies? Are we able to know whether a new project will have balcony or not before applying for the BTO? Do they release the designs before sales launch?Planning to apply for the October BTO launch,btohqsg
Yes you can see the floor plan of the BTO before applying,btohqsg
When sales launch u go inside check the floorplan. And of course all this with balcony ones very popular  projects that have also not all units will have   so your Q number also must be way above the nos of the unit with balcony then u can have a chance.,btohqsg
Hi all  sharing this here to promote Green Homes @ NorthWesthttps://s.lemon8-app.com/s/TcjdepFrQR,btohqsg

are u asking whether there is rs for canberra drive bto this coming 25th aug? usually the first key collection will commence ard 2-3 months after e rs. just a guideline tho..,btohqsg
The final confirmation answer  is still hdb.,btohqsg
If you can't find  ask your HRNot sure what impact you are referring toThe amount or HDB taking much longer to approve your HFEHDB might still end up asking you for the June & July '23 payslips,btohqsg
They have justification for rejecting your application since you did not provide the required documents,btohqsg
If you are looking at EHG  suggest you provide the 12 months payslips that HDB has asked forIf you are looking at HDB loan  it is not a must to furnish 12 months payslip but you must be employed at the point of application  as well as when loan is disbursedIf you must use August '23 - July' 24 payslips  then apply for HFE in SeptemberBut no guarantee whether it will be approved before October BTO launchThere are people who shared that their HFE was approved quite quickly but there are also those who had waited for months,btohqsg
I submitted 1 different month & they still asked me to submit the exact same as they stated.,btohqsg
They asked to submit the additional documents for my application & it got approved in 2-3 days upon submitting,btohqsg
Is yours HFE?How long was it after your application that HDB asked you to submit the correct documents?,btohqsg
Thanks!For my EHG application in the past  it was almost 12 months before i received an email from HDB  asking for additional documents 😂😂Had submitted 12 months payslips previously but yeah  my 12th month is not their 12th month,btohqsg
Yah... But since flat selection was done  just chill and waitNot in a hurry to give away my CPF$$Was mainly uncertain about the grant amount as there was change in monthly income during that 12-month periodPresumably HFE should be more efficient now by assessing both grant and loan concurrently,btohqsg
Yah  heard some HFE are approved very fastNot sure what happened to those that are taking months,btohqsg
Sorry  not really understanding... Is HLE or HFE easier?,btohqsg
Was thinking - if wrong documents submitted for HFE  should be not that difficult to ask for correct ones to be submitted soonerUnless the documents totally not touched yet and haven't discover wrong...,btohqsg
This is meThat was why cannot understand just now 😂,btohqsg
Understand in Aug  you will be given ballot queue number.My niece's Feb bto  her number allocated was quite to the front  she just got her unit chosen in mid-july  about 5months from submission of bto application.So for Jun bto   if you are give a queue number  i guess for selection of unit may be around dec or Jan 25 before the new launch of bto in feb 2025.,btohqsg
The selection of flat timing will depend on the queue number tbh.Plus when they start selection is also variable  as HDB staggers start month of selection within each launch,btohqsg
Ok  hoping to receive queue number and a chance to select a unit.,btohqsg
could you guys share  how long did your HFE took to get approved? many thanks.,btohqsg
Got ours within 1 week. Applied Jan16. Approved on Jan22,btohqsg

Surprisingly one day  and it's PH,btohqsg

I received hfe approval notification  but no sms or email. No document to download too.,btohqsg
Nothing to download after hfe is approved,btohqsg
Can I check how do we know on the balloting results. If we didn’t get to ballot for the BTO flats we have chosen  will we be notify as well?,btohqsg
Yes they will send email I believe,btohqsg

Just wait for Aug after NDP. Mid Aug onwardsWorst will be release by end Aug. Depends on HDB mood,btohqsg
Yes I thought it should be out by 31/8 Malaysia national day 😁,btohqsg
You will receive sms when there is an update (sms would not mention whether it is approved or not but ask you to login to check your status) of your HFE.After you login you go to check your HFE  and you can see the status like Approved and the EXPIRY DATE.There is no document of this piece of information for your to download  but you can do a Screenshot of the page.You will also receive sms 1month informing your HFE is expiring soon  and you can submit your HFE again only 30 days before your exiting one expire. If you try yo submit 1.5mths before expiry date  the system won't allow you to submit cos there is no button etc for you to continue.,btohqsg
Hi. Does anyone know if we alrd receive probable completion letter  any chance project can be completed earlier?Eg.: our probable completion is Q1 of 2025 and queue number quite early.

May I check  will the HFE explicitly state that you are a 1st timer or 2nd timer?,btohqsg
Any news of bto results today ?,btohqsg
@Tien: No. HFE won't state if u areca 1st or 2nd timer.  You know it by yourself.IF you are given a chance to choose the unit & you didn't turn up  you will receive a letter confirming that you become a 2nd timer for the next project.,btohqsg

"Hi  does any one know is ""Open Booking""=""SBF""?",btohqsg
So what is Open Booking? I heard this is opened all year round?,btohqsg
It's leftover of SBF.There are also launch(es) for it  but application is on FCFS basis. Currently no OBF available,btohqsg
Nope. If sbf open no more available flats then no more open bookingU must know open booking flat (OBF) is balance flats from Sale of Balanced projectsIf sale of balance projects mostly taken up then no more OBF,btohqsg
Oh I see. Ok understand now. Thanks Bern and Kris for the explanation. 👍,btohqsg
Your answer is the last sentence she gave.,btohqsg
Hello! If my HFE is valid till 28 Oct  I’ll likely be able to participate in Oct BTO exercise right? 😃,btohqsg
Think unless the Oct bto project is launched on 29 & 30 Oct then you cannot submit application  cos your HFE expired on 28 Oct.,btohqsg
I think if Oct bto is launched on 28 Oct  you cannot submit cos your HLF expire on 28 Oct means from 0001hrs on 28 Oct which your HLF already expired  to be exact I think your HLF is valid till 2359hrs on 27 Oct.Not sure my thought is correct?,btohqsg
May be some others very familiar with bto system in this group chat can advise better. 😀,btohqsg
Thank you Serena! 😊 That’s my thoughts too.,btohqsg
1 month before ur HFE ends  u will get sms from hdb reminding u to renew ur HFE. Do check the hfe portal for the notice too :),btohqsg
Awesome  thank you very much Jeff,btohqsg
