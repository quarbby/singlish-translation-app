Engineering = hard maffs  but lower pay  it‚Äôs true,btohqsg
But probably CS need take more time but not as hard math,btohqsg
To be fair CS math also quite tuff imo,btohqsg
But not as much as physics or engineer or pure math,btohqsg
this is a godly CA call LMAO,btohqsg

I used to drive an ambulance when I was still in SAF NSF,btohqsg
I know all the shenanigans medics and the Medical center get up to,btohqsg

Wah my time no grab  only zichar place. Add 50 cent one egg  5 dollar zichar or 6 dollar if you fancy.,btohqsg
The whole camp will order and the uncle know all will order,btohqsg
Mitsubishi that used to be a cop car,btohqsg
Fun Fact: This Minivan was Singapore's First fast response vehicle,btohqsg

damn RSS unity is still in service,btohqsg
almost my shift when im at telok blangah,btohqsg
@kohsyanLast ditch effort just asking if you know anything about how bunching (not necessarily entangled) can contribute to information 'leak'. The only thing i know is single photon lasers are poisson sources that need not necessarily be entangled  with some g(2)(tau) information  and the g2 property changes as it lases into CW laser regime,btohqsg
i did a literature dive for like 2 weeks alr,btohqsg
the closest i had but it doesn't say shit is from a SE post but afaik no links here (physics SE question ID: 413438),btohqsg
Wtf i almost tot this one spam post,btohqsg
i mean siyan is the only rando physics phd student i know online that iven't met in personi've just about asked everyone else i could already lol,btohqsg
bro you can ask chatgpt for me,btohqsg
it can't even do year 1 physics like the cringelord it is,btohqsg
U ans my stackoverflow ques i do ur phy,btohqsg
im a rust and c and python and kernel programmer for work tho  see if i can,btohqsg
for a moment i thought u just leaked ur private key,btohqsg
yall should be able to post oso no ?,btohqsg
last time i posted a link i rmbr ur had to unban me,btohqsg
i posted to a msg in the SGE discok,btohqsg
Only new members cannot for some time delay,btohqsg
yebro me no network enginger i mount my synology nas in fstab and trying to get ls perms already want puke,btohqsg
also nice amount of rep on SO,btohqsg
https://www.studocu.com/sg/homeidk if you need any more resources  maybe can check this website,btohqsg
hmm i'll think about this in the morning. might ask others better suited in this area than me too,btohqsg
my boss still in germany  last guy i could ask lmao,btohqsg
yea i'll post in my phd friend group or smth,btohqsg
Oh  thought I‚Äôll just share some resources I found,btohqsg
effort better spent in the A-level chat or something,btohqsg
also the only thing i guess i can truly say about the entanglement property of this question is quantum resource theoretic,btohqsg
Dw I did not spend time looking for that  was saved beforehand alr,btohqsg
so the usual idea we have at hand is that the bell measure is one way to impose a metric of extent of entanglement,btohqsg
but that really starts going off into the deep end with post-quantum resources  operations that lower on the metric of entanglement,btohqsg
definitely specifically tagging my friend that focuses on resource theory then,btohqsg
tbh i think a comm person might be better  but what do i know,btohqsg
im just the noise studier guy in my lab,btohqsg
no harm asking anyone and everyone,btohqsg
otherwise you wouldn't be tagging me in sgexams,btohqsg
Im going to hunt for this when i go phuket,btohqsg
Almost got heart attack by just looking at that,btohqsg
my poly just went through a fire drill for my building‚Ä¶ppl bringing their bags and laptops,btohqsg
hi guys i need sum advice,btohqsg
im planning prom w my friends for sec sch and ppl r only willing to pay $10 and wants it to be hosted at a hotel . all the venues i researched are above $10k including food not included of decor,btohqsg
i was thinking abt the hall but it is the last resort cause my hall is bloody hot,btohqsg
my one was also in hall but fully sponsored by sch cuz my batch missed out on alot of stuff,btohqsg
but if the sch hall nice nice one then can lah,btohqsg
$10 per person for hotel is not happening,btohqsg
$10 likely not enough even for a bbq,btohqsg
have the prom at Ridout road,btohqsg
cos my teachers said our sch had a lot fas students and unable to afford,btohqsg
$10 get sky water only no food,btohqsg
u rent a cafe also more than 1k,btohqsg
22 years ago already need $80 for hotel.22 years later people want $10 hotel prom,btohqsg
FA companies love sponsoring this shit,btohqsg
wedding banquets are near $2k per table of 10 now,btohqsg
the macs jingle for background music,btohqsg
I think sch hall best bet,btohqsg
Like we asked how much wld u pay,btohqsg
find those food catering companies and check their prices for 200 students. Give them a budget and see if they can match,btohqsg
never plan school events before üòÇ,btohqsg
only planned wedding and baby showers and bday parties,btohqsg
but don't really have budget kind cuz is I treat and not getting people to pay,btohqsg
Tbh the cost of venue already cost so much even 100$ per person hardly can cover it,btohqsg
it goes down into your portfolio and experience,btohqsg
Can someone check if 16 can hv FA?,btohqsg
If i can  i plan to get a event planner,btohqsg
no point. Your objective now is cut costs,btohqsg
Usually in uni the SOP is to get FA companies like AIA and online trading companies like webull to sponsor,btohqsg
but they just normal sec sch kids,btohqsg
i just wanna get a quote for now and see,btohqsg
get first. Look out for restaurants that can do catering and professional caterers,btohqsg
i think mayb u can ask ur sch whether they got extra funds to cover abit or smtg,btohqsg
feel like i shld take a break from this awhile cause its stressing me out and i need to studyüò≠üò≠,btohqsg
personally I like neo garden but I think prices are a bit on the higher side,btohqsg
No point saying can or cannot,btohqsg
yeap the sch will provide i think not sure how much,btohqsg
but so far it's the only one that has never given any problemsb,btohqsg
thats why we gotta propose convince why this budget is crucial,btohqsg
The teachers asked us to do a proposal first by end of this week,btohqsg
Chilli Api and Jumbo Seafood restaurants do catering too,btohqsg
Like i send to the event planner,btohqsg
school hall might as well not do,btohqsg
We have a whole slide about prom,btohqsg
for me is schedule and timeline most important.Neo never had the issue. Timing always good for me,btohqsg
Jumbo was late for 1.5 hours for my baby shower,btohqsg
They got the wrong date somehow,btohqsg
Never had that happened with Neo,btohqsg
Chilli Api kenna some food poisoning thing before I think,btohqsg
if school covers $10 per head (2k)and the rest pay $10you have $20 budget to work on,btohqsg
$20 can do many many things already,btohqsg
as per many things in sec sch,btohqsg
"it's about ""holistic education"" and that ""grades are not important""",btohqsg
LOL saf can get $7/pax for decent stamford buffet,btohqsg
which is very funny cos apparently cookhouse also $7/pax,btohqsg
idk but so far for me,btohqsg
buffet receptions in saf is like not as good as outside ones ive been to,btohqsg
bookout 4pm wgt sleep ah u,btohqsg
contractor friend also tell me cannot take contractor jobs from govt sector  especially military,btohqsg
keep ask you come back and change this and that until burst budget,btohqsg
fam hes rarely seen after 4,btohqsg
wait ur brother works in catering coy ah,btohqsg
Crabstick thats not even real crab,btohqsg
crabsticks r lowkey the superior fishball,btohqsg
nowadays I don't want to eat so much,btohqsg
"Last time go buffet is ""I'm here to eat till restaurant goes broke""",btohqsg
hv u ever wondered how human meat tastes,btohqsg
yeah. Nowadays just go haidilao with small kids for free kids set üòÇ,btohqsg
not for everyone but that‚Äôs like a lot of expensive dining,btohqsg
ord i treated my unit sushi,btohqsg
werent u gonna give it to me,btohqsg
but 2 adults plus 2 kids about 80+,btohqsg
I missed the restaurant name he was referring to opps,btohqsg
That's the first time I heard it from,btohqsg
Yup  definitely not my current taste but the lyrics is cool,btohqsg
at least theyre actually investigating uk,btohqsg
i was busy preparing for o‚Äôs cl oral,btohqsg
hahah bro hall itself  we all paid $40 from edusave üòÇüòÇ dream on ah $10/person,btohqsg
oi focus on n‚Äôs first laaa that one can plan later,btohqsg
yes or was it 40 or 20 forgot,btohqsg
U mean how rich and how much the student‚Äôs parent donate,btohqsg
My brother is doing the same thing  he is part of a community that is tasked to plan a prom,btohqsg
School hall  standard buffet system‚Ä¶decorations counted  each student pays <100,btohqsg
$10 per pax and a hotel?,btohqsg
This is the first prom in 8 years  the last prom from my alma mater and my brother‚Äôs school was at ritz Carlton,btohqsg
Yep. That‚Äôs why my brother has been answering prom related qns since they announced it,btohqsg
And had to deal with major bullies and trolling for the last 4months,btohqsg
It got so bad they started attacking Teachers thinking they had a say,btohqsg
But the idea of prom was mostly a student venture with maybe 1 or 2 Teachers involved only,btohqsg
Bruh sec school was far from being the cream of the crop  when I was there for the first two years‚Ä¶they would confiscate your phone for two weeks,btohqsg
Like literally take your phone or Simcard for 2 weeks‚Ä¶parents can‚Äôt do anything for these two weeks,btohqsg
My brother has resorted to using the red packer honour system,btohqsg
The same way students put money in a red packet to ‚Äúdonate‚Äù,btohqsg
I mean there is a reason why proms are not universally done across all schools,btohqsg
Apart from students generally not favouring one  there is also the backlash from the ministry of education,btohqsg
Actually for the school my brother and I was from. It‚Äôs actually ok to choose our school hall because it‚Äôs air conditioned.,btohqsg
js when they switch it on ryan..,btohqsg
Tbh did no even experience much of the hall‚Äôs aircorn because I was part of the audio visual team,btohqsg
People sing national athem  the lot of the avcrew playing phone games in the control room‚Ä¶fun times,btohqsg
I mean most of the cost went to food,btohqsg
Like I heard 70% of it,btohqsg
Tables and chairs were reused from storage  decorations are mostly surpass from past events,btohqsg
Heard it‚Äôs optional so I take prob less than 500,btohqsg
Idk man  not my prom just putting the figures,btohqsg
yeah bro tf is 35$ being spent on  cn genuinely get lunch at a hotel for 35,btohqsg
The part that sucks is my school is rich af,btohqsg
School don‚Äôt want to fund any part of it,btohqsg
That is the students  it‚Äôs rich but they don‚Äôt spend money,btohqsg
If they have to they will,btohqsg
Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but 1mil seems like a lot,btohqsg
Basically money used to keep the school functional,btohqsg
3 million as a closing fund is higher than most,btohqsg
You know in manjusri  every 3 months there will be a student exchange,btohqsg
mu sec school used events for donation towards my sch upgrading lol. i saw he qr code the min amt was $50,btohqsg
mayb also cuz my sch is gov aided sch,btohqsg
well the chruch not giving my sch money ig,btohqsg
but they sell merch and all,btohqsg
took 6 yrs to raise funds maybe even more,btohqsg
semo  i buy for my brother la knn,btohqsg
why u nothing to do ah,btohqsg
uw help me write my report,btohqsg
the students fams must be rich then,btohqsg
kuro wld u like to write my report,btohqsg
and they cant install proper turnstiles,btohqsg
Uh 6 rounds around the school to hit 2.4km,btohqsg
Oh hi yunrui let me predict 183,btohqsg
which sch has more rich alumni donors*,btohqsg
Manjusri usually got A lot of rich alumnis,btohqsg
my one can nvr read my fingerprint,btohqsg
now i think abt it nyp got turnstile anot,btohqsg
no I only stand at the taxi stand wait for rand to come out,btohqsg
And every over morning assembly got dc talking about ppl breaking the mechanism,btohqsg
By squeezing through the wrong way,btohqsg
no cuz kuro u rly got a lot of free time,btohqsg
my alma mater smaller than a sec school,btohqsg
but that is normal i guess afterall maha bodhi has 6 year od students,btohqsg
im also in prom planning comm for sec school this year  do yall have a budget set aside already?,btohqsg
i think my sec sch even smaller then urs,btohqsg
Or did ur sch jst decide that ticket sales are alrd enough to fund for it,btohqsg
the hall is so small tht can oni fit 2 levels inside,btohqsg
WHAT KIND OF SCHOOLS YALL HAVING üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
i wish i was joking. lucky now reno,btohqsg
i saw the financial statements for your school,btohqsg
I think my school is only rich in spending for prom and on fake ass grass,btohqsg
they go chruch door to door just to raise funds,btohqsg
Though im interested in whats on the 3rd column to gain like 530k plus on sponsorships and donations,btohqsg
why the smc fund so low lmao,btohqsg
the rest of the sch sux,btohqsg
Idk man Ive only jst started learning what SBQ is on POA,btohqsg
lol my dumbass did not realise the column beside,btohqsg
Also ure that bus guy on discord right,btohqsg
i was about to mention...you also are familliar to me lmao,btohqsg
Idk who said that earlier on but yeah I applied when I was underaged LMFAOAOAOAO,btohqsg
But I did end up getting the job last year,btohqsg
And then I got promoted real fast and then quit after a few months,btohqsg
Cause nobody in the mod team,btohqsg
i thought got sec 2's working fast food alr,btohqsg
When can they install floor tiles in our classrooms sia,btohqsg
Ajisen sucks once uve tried other ramen places,btohqsg
Except for their ice lemon tea,btohqsg
But I like ice lemon tea either way,btohqsg
dw my school also dont have,btohqsg
Bro our prom they alrd got the hotel for us,btohqsg
Like they organise the prom committee AFTER theyve almost confirmed the venue,btohqsg
my school gatekeeping all the money,btohqsg
if we use sch hall like 8-9k but if venue maybe $20k,btohqsg
my singpost job has a underage guy working,btohqsg
he got called out and barred after his first job,btohqsg
Have yall tried to set up a fundraiser for the prom yet?,btohqsg
Fundraising would be impossible as nobody would be willing to chip in,btohqsg
idk if its too late  but what my primary school used to do was jumble sale,btohqsg
my pri sch did smtg like this for grad. end up still not even enuf money,btohqsg
sch hall so ex wan meh? to rent,btohqsg
I think what they meant was decorations  food catering  equipment etc.,btohqsg
most of it was used for our post psle learning journeys,btohqsg
we went sentosa 3 times in a week,btohqsg
i got movie for childrens day. we go cinema,btohqsg
I mean I did find a venue but since the school didnt give us an opportunity to learn how to book a place I have no idea how much it costs altogether,btohqsg
plus when we went sentosa..its not the beach...its places like the trick eye museum  maddam tussauds and sea aquairum,btohqsg
@ilikemoneyandcatshave you tried finding places that are not hotels nor ur school hall yet?,btohqsg
One of my older cousins had a unique prom experience  two schools combined funds to fund for prom,btohqsg
i dun rly rmbr wat we did but i rmbr got this one lj we go cbd walk walk arnd,btohqsg
Ive seen such a thing happen before,btohqsg
go around cbd..walk here and walk there,btohqsg
my sch no money but still wan to fully sponser prom. the oni con was tht is was in the sch hall,btohqsg
"But worst case scenario is that yall jst tell the sec 4s ""blame ur school for no budget and beggars cannot be choosers"" and hold it in the school hall",btohqsg
Maybe they wan you to manifest a job at the CBD LOLOLOL,btohqsg
thats the worse out of the worst toever happen,btohqsg
i mean we were 12 why not,btohqsg
Mine was in 2020 so we went nowhere,btohqsg
small kids got huge dreams mah,btohqsg
Like when I grad frm pri school,btohqsg
both my graduation years was mauled by covid,btohqsg
i didn't get my sec 3 camp nor overseas trip:(,btohqsg
Then when covid gone now I needa go for OBS 5d4n,btohqsg
And I am not trusting my school to assign us to a nicer camp,btohqsg
Since their budget is prob gone frm the hotel,btohqsg
Mine last year did do an obs,btohqsg
my sec 3 camp was supposed to go dairy farm,btohqsg
So for like 2d the sec 3s had to travel to and fro frm school to the camp,btohqsg
Oh ive been to dairy farm before when I was p4,btohqsg
I got my toe skinned there,btohqsg
actly all planned out alr then gahmen go and put full hbl when we were supposed to go for camp so it became online and sucked so bad,btohqsg
i go changi there for camp,btohqsg
i kind of barely talk to my frens anymore,btohqsg
I mean usually in a school environment you dont really keep in contact with a lot of ur friends,btohqsg
i mean like i talk here and there on ig but thats it,btohqsg
untill u go tertiary education and gey thrown into diff jcs/poly ite courses and schs,btohqsg
Cause its either too busy  nothing to talk abt anymore  or yall secretly hate each other all the time but had to hold it in for the sake of not causing drama,btohqsg
Most of the times its the second one for like those in duos,btohqsg
And the third one for ones in those big friend grps,btohqsg
if you are still in sec school..make as many friends as you can...,btohqsg
2 of my frens i knew since i was 9. one of them same class frm p3 to sec 4,btohqsg
i was thinking more of forming connections,btohqsg
cause you never know where they will lead,btohqsg
who the fuck has 50 frens,btohqsg
its figuratively impossible to keep so many friends,btohqsg
the revolving doors of change will keep them planted for sure,btohqsg
And that one CCA grp is bound to have a large drama split up the second they graduate,btohqsg
I mean I think the main friends u wanna make if u wanna form connections will be in tertiary education,btohqsg
yea you do have a point,btohqsg
yah oso cuz like u dun see each other anymore everysingle day,btohqsg
Cause in sec school u really cant tell whos gna be what bc everyone here doesnt know wtf they wna do yet,btohqsg
i still dont know what i wanna do,btohqsg
Even I myself only know which sector I want to join and not exactly which job within that sector,btohqsg
i dont even know the sector i want,btohqsg
the only reason why i joined the course i am in is because of my o levels score,btohqsg
i joined y1 in the common course,btohqsg
then just decided on digital design and development..because if anything  design was where i could figuratively not fail at doing,btohqsg
Ah I was thinking of joining the finance/business sector,btohqsg
Precisely cause I realised my math is only 99% accurate when it comes to money related stuff,btohqsg
intresting thing is during my o levels..maths and POA were my highest scoring subjects,btohqsg
we r planning to do at hall,btohqsg
Like ppl said it was gna be boring but its not that bad at all,btohqsg
"half my class ""dropped"" poa halfway through the yer",btohqsg
üòÇ our response time from turnout to location supposed to be max 11min,btohqsg
So they jst flat out gave up?,btohqsg
yea..absent for mid year exams in sec 4,btohqsg
LOL what was the passing rate for ur class,btohqsg
a class of 18 became 8,btohqsg
1min to respond to call10min to go from base to loc,btohqsg
i got $25/h for tutoring ppl and its my first job,btohqsg
Iirc its up to $600/hr for private tutoring,btohqsg
wah better than my first job,btohqsg
Brooo may as well work mcdonalds lidat,btohqsg
yea welcome to the life of an NSF,btohqsg
training to be soldiers (that get paid a dollar an hr),btohqsg
someone older than me by 1 year. he‚Äôs a private candidate as he failed his o‚Äôs last year,btohqsg
from what  can see  its recycling of online information maybe from other news sites,btohqsg
I did teaching after sec sch  got ~$30-50/hr teehee,btohqsg
i feel like i gg get fever but i cant get it i HAVE PRELIMS,btohqsg
my body feels warm like not usual warm,btohqsg
It's okay  preparing her for the sign on career,btohqsg
literally 3out of like 28 passed english during prelims,btohqsg
what a wakeup call for the whole class,btohqsg
Bruh i move a chair...and a mega cockroach came crawling out,btohqsg
it was not the small one,btohqsg
I kept thinking that every big cockroach I see is a female cockroach,btohqsg
idk but i nearly stepped on it,btohqsg
Anyone here has taken any Science (more specifically Chemistry) related course through EAE? Wondering what do you guys put on your portfolio other than showing your grades. Just in an awkward position where I‚Äôm in a media course  going for an Applied Chemistry course interview.,btohqsg
I went thro eae for bms ahaha,btohqsg
Or put why uw change course,btohqsg
[Confession#C773]To all my fellow nsfs  what symptoms other than urti can i report sick in polyclinic in order to get mc? Perhaps the kind that will give me at least 2days one and doesn‚Äôt cause much hassle (don‚Äôt have to take blood test/ecg/wtv dumb diagnosis‚Ä¶) any ideas will be appreciatedüôèüèª,btohqsg
