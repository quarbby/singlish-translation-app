so@BillSingh1313you saying@Kopi0kos0ngis wrong la bo ko leng la.goldman is wrong üëç  no policktics ah sanctions are politicks üòÇ kidding,btohqsg
I tikam one   anytime wrong. üòÇ,btohqsg
Only quote based on news fa,btohqsg
See goldmine right or Trump right,btohqsg
üòÇ jokes aside  US oilies production breakeven if not wrong was 30 to 40+ (editted this part-> yup was not wrong),btohqsg
that was when it was really hot and prices of fixed investments were cheap,btohqsg
after many rigs and anciliary industry to O &G went bust (note teho international is in such sector)  the average production price is around 40 to 50+ after all the high costs and inflation,btohqsg
so for oilies to drop further  given that there is mandate for eu to buy us oil  UK gas prices must fall first.which it havent and is still up up and away  i will do one better;you can check the stats here (plus this buay zhun cause yet to factor fixed investment purchases bidding if want to increase production)https://www.statista.com/statistics/748207/breakeven-prices-for-us-oil-producers-by-oilfield/so rex (direct EU oil digger) and anan (direct europe petrol provider) got chance to huat.,btohqsg
if US ramp production now it actually causes price war competition for fixed assets which will destroy their edge to 50 to 60+ breakeven costs.it happened before when shale was introduced and will happen again.the saudis will retaliate to maintain market share by at most drop floor price to 60 or 70 max.beyond that US oil will not survive one.you go check rigs count and costs you will understand.so the only chance is sanction on healthcare which he is big on.so direct healthcare in US or EU got coverage is who?UG healthcare üëçpositioning,btohqsg
do feel free to whack my explanation so i can learn thanks,btohqsg
this is also why got one big shale company diamond billionaire just cashed out and relax for entire life for entire family.his costs is lowest and he bloodbathed before.then notice how berkshire keep buy exxon and other oilies?they know this cycle,btohqsg
yup earning good $ on cashpile risk free,btohqsg
