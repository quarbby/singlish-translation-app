Is Amaze Spread 3% off spot now? Noticed many people getting this rate now,btohqsg
I just got 3.3% off but i thought that‚Äôs because it was an exotic currency.,btohqsg
I thought people said it was a 2% spread,btohqsg
My experience is amaze is 2% off master card rate. Then mastercard rate against spot varies,btohqsg
It‚Äôs probably 2% off it‚Äôs one of the majors.,btohqsg
Exotic currency do get worst rate compare to mainstream currency due to trading volume i guess,btohqsg
Just like how u go money changer and those less in demand currency spread is bigger,btohqsg
Oh  so it wasn't Amaze that increase the spot rate but mastercard then?,btohqsg
Is JPY considered exotic currency? I recently saw a youtuber get a spot rate of 3%,btohqsg
Definitely no. Jpy is the top few trading pairs in fx.,btohqsg
I got 2.2% above spot for AUD yesterday.,btohqsg
Isn't JPY more popular than AUD,btohqsg
Amaze total cost =Amaze spread (usually 1.8%)+Mastercard spread (usually 0.8%)However Mastercard rates don‚Äôt update live. So if spot jumps up or down. The usual 0.8% Mastercard markup might appear to be 0.5% or 1.5% for example. This is the moving part when u compare against spot rate.,btohqsg
Mastercard rate. Amaze rate agaisnt mc rate is about 2.1% but could be fluctuation between your transaction time and now.,btohqsg
Ah  that's very informative. Thanks for that mate,btohqsg
Noob to trading platform. Which one should I choose for very passive low trading frequency on SG (and maybe US) market?,btohqsg

Uob lady with travel category. Or uob lady sol if your income allows.,btohqsg
Snack by income excluded from maybank platinum visa,btohqsg

Old news already  it is excluded from all maybank card,btohqsg
any reasons to pick visa/mc/amex over the others for uob prvi card?main use case for general big ticket items + cardup payments,btohqsg
Cardup has lower admin fee for certain types of payments for visa cards.,btohqsg
Oh dear. Time to cancel the maybank visa horizon as well,btohqsg
Sister any suggested card for snack by income,btohqsg
Just use any card with hsbc ega,btohqsg
Hi for UOB peffered platinum Visa card is it can get 4 miles for any contactless spend except those usually excluded in credit cards?,btohqsg
cannot be excluded spend on the card's TnC also  notably UOB$ merchants. Also cannot use physical card need to be mobile contactless or if online only get 4mpd of specific MCCs.,btohqsg
Sure but is it on most of the categories  like retail shopping or dining?,btohqsg
Hi all  just curious if there‚Äôs better way to pay via Alipay or WeChatpay  and get better FX rate or rewards / cashback?I‚Äôm currently using the OCBC scan and pay for Alipay but want to learn if there are better options available.,btohqsg
Hi can ask if one already receiving cpf life payout can one still top up the cpf life account to get tax deduction?,btohqsg
for mobile contactless will get 4mpd on $5 blocks so long not excluded MCC or UOB$ merchant,btohqsg
Link your wechat or alipay to amaze/youtrip or ichange card. Their fx better. Below 200 rmb per trans  there is no 3% mark up from these 2 platforms.,btohqsg
Thanks! For Alipay  do we need China local mobile number for registration? I think for WeChat probably need local number to activate the pay function.,btohqsg
Both you can register using sg numbers and verify account using sg passport.If you want to activate the hongnao function to receive money then you need chinese ID to do so.,btohqsg
Got it! Thanks so much! üôè,btohqsg
Yes  as long as recipient not reached FRS,btohqsg

Can i check does it also applies for overseas spend on the card as well? Or only local spend is applicable,btohqsg
Should be applicable for overseas spend as long as not excluded. But you can consider instarem amaze to pair with this card,btohqsg
