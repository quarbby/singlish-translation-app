This one never follow master yuanâ€™s chart. ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
See this afternoon. I got a good feeling it is today. Vicplas will cross 300. They tested 0.285 thrice in a short span. The more a resistance tested  the weaker it gets. this one should be good. Many will chase after it break 300 too. Human mentality.But still for me  SL 255 in case.,btohqsg
Wa. This gif Smm will tio stun or not,btohqsg
No need see chart lah. Pointless. See the buying force,btohqsg
Chart good lesson hindsight analysis and classroom learning,btohqsg
