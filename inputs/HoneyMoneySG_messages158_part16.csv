What the best card for mile for big purchase cum traveling? (Anything above 1k)?,btohqsg
It isn‚Äôt as mathematical as this in Practice.The problem is master and visa only update their official rates a few times a daySo when u use the card at 12pm when their last fx update is 10am and there was a big market movement at 11am it might appear as if master or visa markup from fx spot rate is 1% for example.,btohqsg

Hi anyone with UOB stash?How to maximise the MAB of $100k?Can we debit out the interest on same day so making the MAB retain as $100k throughout?,btohqsg
Hi  what is the best bank/way to receive money in USD then convert to SGD? usually major banks has bad rate for currency conversion,btohqsg
Yes  but the interest is credited on last day of the month. For the next month  UOB shows how much you need to top up & maintain to get the interest. So its quite easy to manage  eg: it will show (Top up $x this month to earn your bonus interest. Balance to maintain: $y).,btohqsg
"You can check on the UOB Stash website or check with UOB if unsure.Not financial advice.This is the information I found on the uob stash website.""If you have performed withdrawals  you can still receive bonus interest when you top-up again within the same month. Simply login to UOB Personal Internet Banking or UOB TMRW to find out the required top up amount and balance to maintain for the month.""",btohqsg
