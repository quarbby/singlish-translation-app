[Trading Ctral]your ah ma👵🏻chi mianOur pivot point stands at 0.097.Our preference: as long as 0.097 is support look for 0.192.. 😱Alternative scenario: below 0.097  expect 0.07 and 0.054.Comment: the RSI is above 50. The MACD is below its signal line and positive. The stock could retrace in the short term. Moreover  the stock is trading under its 20 day moving average (0.1309) but above its 50 day moving average (0.108)..@CharKwayTeow12,btohqsg
