Question about credit card approval -My Citibank credit card application rejected as I told them that I was leaving the job for another job..The Citibank officer told me to reapply once I start new job.Now  it sounds weird  coz I only got a prorated salary slip in my new job.Anyone got similar situation?,btohqsg
I see no points keeping premier as money won't earn anything for 3rd month,btohqsg
Wait a few months (like 3 payslips) at ur new job and apply again?,btohqsg
That was why I applied at the last job. üòÜSianz liao.,btohqsg
Why did u tell them you are leaving thou? Bank would see it as risk,btohqsg
a lot of Priority Banks suffer from this issue whereby there is nothing worth to maintain under Priority Bank except for Cash.And the promotions are always such that you are forced to musical chairs the Cash.,btohqsg
Then they proceed to block u during musical chair üòî,btohqsg
Hi  trying to pay my insurance using choc finance card in AXS. I choose credit followed by other bank but system do not able to process. Anybody can help?,btohqsg
common issue for some ppl  I suppose choc finance is aware of the issue already  hope they can solve it,btohqsg
So I tested with 2 Choc Finance accounts. 1 account applied for physical card  1 account digital card only.The physical card account cannot pay via AXS  will always receive the P001 error message (System unable to process your payment request).The digital card account can make payments with no problems.,btohqsg
Don't think because of these. The card no is the same.Of course I done way earlier. Not sure any changes.,btohqsg
So is the choc finance card problem?,btohqsg
so far i tested a few merchants... the smoothest appears to be AXS pay iras... of course choose CREDIT CARD OTHER BANKS,btohqsg
wah touch wood.. that being said.. my physical card came yesterday and i ACTIVATED IT.. haven't tried to pay new payment..TOUCH WOOD!,btohqsg
I did that- choose credit card and other bank card but system said not able to proceed.,btohqsg
yes it appears not to be 100% reliable..reminds me of early Amaze card days.. those pioneer like me will remember..you paywave with Amaze  you can 50% expect the transaction to be declined..,btohqsg
Wonder if I go to the instute to make payment will have this issue.,btohqsg
Yup I called AXS they said it is a chocolate finance problem.Contacted chocolate finance  they said they are aware of the problem and not sure when it will be fixed. Their suggestion is to just keep trying,btohqsg
Not related I think  I have not received physical card yet  it‚Äôs been 3 weeks.The account that applied for physical card cannot pay on AXS.,btohqsg
i shouldn‚Äôt have applied for cf physical card ü•≤,btohqsg
so far based on what was posted it seems like so. even in the above ‚Äúnot related i think‚Äù post  user applied for the physical card but cannot pay by axs. that is exactly the issue.,btohqsg
i have humans:1. applied for physical not yet received physical  can successfully pay2. applied for physical  just received and activated physical  just successfully paid $10,btohqsg
If i have giro for iras  how do i cxl it? Must i cxl it before using cf card to pay?,btohqsg
just make sure you pay at least 10 working days before GIRO due date,btohqsg
I applied for physical card  not yet received. But still could make payment on axs,btohqsg
After physical card was received and activated.,btohqsg
If I pay via Apple Pay (S$1500) on Shopee using UOB VS  does this transaction earn miles?,btohqsg
only 0.4mpd  this is online not contactless,btohqsg
Both paying the same type of bill? I'm guessing is the insurance one? üòÖ,btohqsg
Same bill type  personal income tax and property tax,btohqsg
Same phone  same app. Tested on computer  same browser.,btohqsg
that could only mean it is not dependent on the device or whether you applied for physical/virtual only.Certain card numbers just will fail,btohqsg
Possible  to rule this out I can try applying for physical card on the digital CF account that works now.If it starts failing then it means applying for physical causes the problem,btohqsg
Meaning the one with physical card applied can't pay for both  while the other one with only virtual card can pay for both?,btohqsg
but but but... i also have multiple humans5th feb applied for chocolate  and immediately requested physical.5th Feb CAN PAY using virtual25th Feb  one human got the physical and activated it. 26th Feb  just paid $10 axs successfully,btohqsg
hence my hypothesis nothing to do with the virtual or physical card thingyis just blacklisted/defective card numbers,btohqsg
Yes  but it‚Äôs only 1 data point  so it could just be totally random as Mt mentioned,btohqsg
whether you kenna 'good' or 'bad' card number at least u know your fate.the WORST is you think you got a good one.. works at axs blah blah... you bring it overseas to use at paywave merchant... keeps declined,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to confirm before I share the knowledge to my partner.Any purchase from website & app is a online transactionAny purchase you go to the  store you go there and tap your card is offline paymentAny purchase you go the store and tap using your phone is called NFCPlease correct me if I'm wrong in the explanations üòÅ,btohqsg
