Lalamove should make every CSO do one day of deliveries per month using a company vehicle. Then they'll understand what the person on the ground goes thru,btohqsg
No such thingYou have every right to demand payment before deliveryEven if u send first u no need to complete the job in your app,btohqsg
The only thing cs can/will do is they say they investigateBut if customer dont respond they will jus tell u make police report,btohqsg
Oh I can don't complete the order and carry on take jobs ?,btohqsg
"Pls note that if job indicates ""COD"" service (the purple icon)  it does not refer to us - it refers to COD between buyer and sellerIt is an ""additional service"" where we help seller collect cash upon delivery to buyerSo do not let customer make u think u must deliver first then they pay you",btohqsg
Which means its definitely no wrong to collect payment from the first location am I right ?,btohqsg
Unless it is recipient who is paying,btohqsg
But what if cus refuse to pay,btohqsg
Not sure what cs will say though  u can try,btohqsg
But if cancel job need reason right,btohqsg
Ya unlike grab  bad weather also can cancel lol,btohqsg
Lol dk what I should do alr,btohqsg
Say WhatsApp her but still no reply,btohqsg
If its recipient  u know her address u can go ambush her lol,btohqsg
Some ppl very chao kuan one lar  if u feel its worth it go ambush her lo,btohqsg
Other than that  cs wont be able to do anything,btohqsg
If me i jus let it go take it as charity to her and it is her karma to bear,btohqsg
I had a few incidents.... just whatsapp politely and keep asking,btohqsg
Problem is they take a few days to pay 14 or 16,btohqsg
But my advise CS waste time,btohqsg
