Hi  can i pair krisflyer uob account with uob prvi miles card? To earn both the 1.4mpd from the card and the bonus miles from the account?,btohqsg
Hi im newbie  and planning to apply for credit cards. Im not much of a spender and i would like to utilize only no minimum spend cards. what do u guys recommend. thank you,btohqsg
I started with DCS Mastercard as it has no minimum spend but I had no lucky getting the annual fee waiver‚Ä¶ my cashbacks did not exceed the annual fee so in the end  I lost more than I ‚Äòearned‚Äô.If you have the potential to gain cashback exceeding the annual fee or have better luck getting the waiver  this card might be great for you.,btohqsg
But for me  I am sticking with no annual fee cards like CIMB cards or SCB Smart Credit Card so I don‚Äôt have to worry every year‚Ä¶ but their rewards aren‚Äôt that great and CIMB has a minimum spend.,btohqsg
Yup.You can check for comparisons on this website:https://sgfd.neocities.org/,btohqsg
If they dont waive then can just cancel right?,btohqsg
I cancelled but the final bill still charged the annual fee‚Ä¶,btohqsg
How could i sell the tesla fractional shares in moomoo apps?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone use priority pass to access lounge recently?Do u still have to show ur credit card tagged to priority pass account when accessing the lounge? Thanks,btohqsg
No need. Physical PP card or QR code in app. SIN T1  Penang in October.,btohqsg
Seems like rose's click and unmute isn't doing well :(,btohqsg
For permanent credit limit increase  does the bank give an increase on its own or do we need to request for it? I‚Äôve been requesting and rejected.,btohqsg
need to request for it  subjected to approval,btohqsg
If T- bill matured today  how soon it will reflect in my CPFIS account balance?,btohqsg
Mine was back in dbs by the next business day,btohqsg
Are you sure you need the new phone ? Cos why would you extend spending when one of your card has reached limit. Do you regularly spend until card reach limit ? Do you intend to pay back the monies you owe to the bank ? Are you aware that not paying your bills can affect your credit rating,btohqsg
I pay every month  not minimum sum. I still have 2K credit limit  and as I pay my bills on time ever month  I notice my credit card limit increases.I spent on house appliances for my BTO  and I only have one credit card  that‚Äôs why it left 2K credit limit.,btohqsg
Side track abit  credit limit increases if we keep paying full on time over time? I‚Äôm trying to increase my own credit limit but always rejected. Lol.,btohqsg
I have applied for SC smart card hehe  so I can give my DBS credit card a break  and let the credit limit increase over time.,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre going to use the zero interest installment plan by Harvey Norman  or any installment plan by any merchant  credit card rewards don‚Äôt apply to the purchase. Sadly  posted transactions must be a complete transaction.,btohqsg
credit score* perhaps. haven't heard of credit limit increasing by itself outside of credit limit reviews,btohqsg
I get SC smart card so can enjoy 6% cash back  and I can buy my iPhone (by one shot) to get cash back 288 cash back coz I‚Äôm new user to SC.,btohqsg
are you not paying the full bill monthly? giving the card a break to wait for limit increases is not a thing,btohqsg
Sorry I mean available limit  not credit limit,btohqsg
only get 6% cashback on very specific merchants yah  and need to accumulate points to redeem cashback,btohqsg
Then what credit card to apply sia.. I was recommended by a friend to apply this SC smart card‚Ä¶no annual fee mah,btohqsg
The 6% cashback covers these specific merchants‚Ä¶ and the cashback is given in terms of points.The points must collect until a certain amount then can use.,btohqsg
Hi I have applied for a CIMB cc during the singsaver deal with the PS5 during the 18/11.Till now I have not received my card approval  may I know anyone else aso in this shoe too?,btohqsg
can i subscribe for new tbill with my balance in cpfis account dbsor it must be return back to cpf first? Thanks,btohqsg
FsmOne uses Standard Chartered Bank. Last understood is no fees for transfer to a Standard Charged multicurrency account. For Moomoo  I personally tried transfer from my Dbs multicurrency account  no fees.But transfer of USD from SCB to DBS  it goes through SWIFT (not FAST or PayNow). So there would be handling fees involved.Good to give Fsmone N WeBull a call respectively to confirm if u still keen,btohqsg

Hey guys  anyone here been to HK and use Trust Bank Card to withdraw HKD from Hong Kong ATM with no fees? Can share pls? üòä,btohqsg
Paying of bill on time by customer is expected by the bank and our duty. Constant late payments might result in a adverse record in our consumer credit report. Did u try to apply for temporary credit increase for a period of time (if ur use case fit  can Google what use cases can ask) ?,btohqsg
Hi  any recommended credit card to get for my oncoming bulk appliances and furniture purchase for new house?,btohqsg
I applied too. So far only received application confirmation,btohqsg
Payment mode? Over the counter  online  FavePay or?,btohqsg
Actually looking at Gain city or Harvey Norman üòÖ,btohqsg
Ok. Please use FavePay for both and your linked payment card should be a non DBS card that has higher miles per dollar or cashback,btohqsg

If everyone pay full on time.. credit card will give less perks also. Tks to these ppl also,btohqsg
? Maybe just want to maximise usage of cash flow. Not necessary bad habit of expenses.,btohqsg
Not wrong but if everything on installments. U miss out on the credit card perks/rewards etc. pros and cons bah,btohqsg
Higher chance of miscalculation and overspend also cuz all the few ks items suddenly become ‚Äúcheap‚Äù 40-50 dollars monthly payment,btohqsg
No. If you bought with credit card that can with rewards  you can effectively get discount range from 7% to 18%.Can you imagine if you put deposit into a bank n the bank gives you 18% interest?,btohqsg
Yup i agreed  no need to judge other ppl lifestyle. Each to its own,btohqsg
Pls enlighten how to get 7 to 18 percent discount? Thank in advance,btohqsg
Maintenance till 26 Nov? But i am unable to spin on 27 Nov  it says all prizes are won.,btohqsg
He probably mean miles. But miles game not for everyone. And lots of ppl overvalued miles too.,btohqsg
Hi  want to ask should i contact ocbc or singsaver if i havent got the gift redemption code ?I assume should be ocbc right ?,btohqsg
