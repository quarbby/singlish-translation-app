Or maybe im reading too much into it,btohqsg
Lit has killed all my braincells,btohqsg
Ukw if U like the subjs,btohqsg
Afaik if U can take physics n chem as h2,btohqsg
Then it'll legit open q a few doors in stem side la if U R int in that,btohqsg
MY PRINCIPAL ALSO CALLED MR ANF,btohqsg
Isok idm U yapping abt econs,btohqsg

J1 shld be micro  j2 macro,btohqsg
The main diff betw H1 n H2 is the,btohqsg
Content diff not that much tbh,btohqsg
U tell me whther weird ah but jp math start with vectors,btohqsg
Bro does not want to be there,btohqsg
Cj pls accept my appeal ü§ó,btohqsg
Everyone and their mother say fuck vectors,btohqsg
Ok anyw basically both H1 and H2 got CSQ (case study qn),btohqsg
Is abit like Ur sbq for SS la,btohqsg
lol quite a few jcs do that cos apparently they say they start with the hardest topic to allow students 2 yrs to digest vectors (*then there‚Äôs me who proceeds to get both vector qns for my year wrong*),btohqsg
bruh apparently TM does that long time ago,btohqsg
But my batch is graphing tech,btohqsg
1 is for csq  the other is essay,btohqsg
SO I WS GOING THROUGH THT ABIT,btohqsg
@chemcerhow they inform u if u can take fmath,btohqsg
They turn up at ur doorstep,btohqsg

Don't bother try getting tuition for everything,btohqsg
U literally won't have the time,btohqsg
yeah a level econs only learn the concepts then uni econs spam math to apply the concepts,btohqsg
For micro econs (basically econs for each market)H2 got- central economic problem- demand supply  elasticity- market failure- market structure (H2 only),btohqsg
