Will update in detail once the trade culminates,btohqsg
Last time when I put $15k monthly into my son's HSBC EGA account  they auto upgrade him to premier. Another alternative is call the premier centre  and put in $200k for immediate upgrade. Both way should work without going to bank since you already have EGA.,btohqsg
May i know when was it?,btohqsg
That was many years back. based on the email screenshot is 2017. but i have recently seen the criteria for HSBC premier still the same.,btohqsg
Hi! can i buy travel insurance (from FWD) and use citi rewards card to get citipoints?,btohqsg
Is there a Max limit to deposit in?,btohqsg
Hi May I ask when u apply for hsbc revol credit card  do u need a hsbc account?,btohqsg
Hi!! Anyone knows what is the best savings account and credit card touse for fresh grad?,btohqsg
need more info to help  income? how much expected spend per month? what type of spend? prefer miles or cashback?,btohqsg
Salary after CPF 2.8k  expected spend per month 400-500,btohqsg
400-500 is purely card spending on retail and online? i.e. not paynow/paylah  not cash withdrawal/payment  not NETS  not insurance/financial services,btohqsg
For hsbc revo supplementary cards  does the supplementary card have a different separate cap from the main card or is it linked? ( Ie. Main card capped at $1k for 4mpd) and  this mean that the secondary card won’t benefit from the cashback?),btohqsg
Ah so technically you can get a supp card and then enjoy a “2k” cap yes,btohqsg
Around 200-250 will be card spending,btohqsg
Meaning your spending will only be 200-250  if can convert more of your cash/nets spending to card will be good. E.g. using XNAP at hawker so it will use card instead of cash/paylah.,btohqsg
With this low spending  you won't hit the min spending of most high cashback cards. So the best you can go for is UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX at 1.7% or Citi Cash Back+ Mastercard at 1.6%.For bank account  OCBC 360 Savings will work for you since you spend less  assuming you don't succumb to lifestyle inflation.Salary credit of at least 1.8k gives 2% p.a. (first 75k) and having $500 increase in average daily balance in account monthly gives 1.2% p.a. (first 25k)/2.4% p.a. (next 25k).,btohqsg
But once you hit consistent $600 spending  move to UOB One Account and UOB EVOL VISA Card. 3.85% p.a. for first 30k.,btohqsg
Icic thanks a lot for ur advice!!🙏🙏,btohqsg
Currently I’m using Stan chart’s jumpstart account which gives a flat 2% pa for the first 20k only  so I should switch to OCBC 360 account once I start work?,btohqsg
Suggest you keep track of your expenses/budget using an app/excel sheet. Also put an indicator if its cash/paynow/nets or credit card.And read up on card t&cs if unsure about what is excluded.,btohqsg
Does anyone know which are the best non-AMEX cards to pay for education/school fees?,btohqsg
Hi  if I have UOB ONE card as well  will I be able to get cashback from both cards? does it work that way?,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “school card” or “education card” to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
Do you guys use Revolut stock exchange  IBKR  Syfe  tiger brokers or moo moo to buy stocks and etfs? Can someone kindly advice me?,btohqsg
Like will I get cashbacks from both cards?,btohqsg
yes if u met the spending requirements for both card,btohqsg
You mean you have both UOB EVOL and UOB ONE cards? Then make sure you hit your eligible spending for both cards lor.. UOB EVOL's 600 + UOB ONE's 500/1000/2000.,btohqsg
thinking of getting EVOL too. both cards need to hit eligible spending for 3 consecutive months then will get cashback right?,btohqsg
Read the t&cs for each card's minimum spending  how the cashback works and their exclusions.,btohqsg
Anyone notice that UOB TMRW does not allow u to track bonus interest milestone anymore?,btohqsg
I’m still able to track bonus intersest,btohqsg
It does. Details  interest tracker  view activities.,btohqsg

Citi rewards paired with Instarem  does it work it dinning/f&b?,btohqsg
From the MileLion: That’s because the Amaze processes all transactions online  even if they were made physically in-store. This means you could dine in a restaurant or shop at a brick-and-mortar merchant  pay with the Amaze Card paired to a Citi Rewards Card  and earn 4 mpd on your spending!Kindly advise we can still earn 4 mpd even the transaction do not fall into the correct MCC?,btohqsg
MCC must not be excluded in citi rewards TnC,btohqsg
Is dining and fnb listed in the approved MCC?,btohqsg
That’s what I’m trying to find too,btohqsg
only travel and the fake spendings are excluded,btohqsg
By fake spending you mean paying bills etc ya,btohqsg
If dining n fnb under travel related MCCs  then no 4mpd...,btohqsg
