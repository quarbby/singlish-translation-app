I open my OCBC on 1 Aug 2024,btohqsg
Salary + Save + Sped MAB 101 000,btohqsg
Something is very off. What are the individual amounts for ur each salary/spend/save for Aug?,btohqsg
for some reason ur salary credit didnt trigger,btohqsg
Salary credit on 25/8 is 2060 Credit Card Spend 1 600 Save 501 total balance 103 420,btohqsg
Don't know why the interest is low,btohqsg
Considering the EIR is 4.6% if meet all criteria of salary spend save should get 387,btohqsg
2060 is real salary or u ownself transfer?,btohqsg
either the transaction wasnt coded as SAL or it wasnt paid through a corporate account,btohqsg
EIR for save and spend works out to be 176,btohqsg
Was paid through a corporate account  I need to check the salary code though,btohqsg
Likely the company didnâ€™t use the required methods,btohqsg
By corporate  the company I work in,btohqsg
Actually it's from a Corporate Account . OCBC can't seek the company to change their code mah,btohqsg
Their system cannot detect is from a corporate account ?,btohqsg
it has to fulfil 2 conditions:1) from a corporate account2) transaction must code as Salary Payment,btohqsg
u can check the salary credit transaction on 25 aug if it shows SAL,btohqsg
Try calling ocbc on your statement it will appear 3 line items if u met the conditions. I got mine today.,btohqsg
He already believes he failed salary,btohqsg
Hi! About to make a $5.7k Airbnb booking and thinking to split the payment into 2 (pay now and pay later) to hit the cap of S$1.5k per month on the dbs wwmc. However  i saw that reservation must be fully prepaid online - does that mean that I cannot split the payment and should pay one shot?*Alr hit cap this month for my uob ladys/dbs altitude/crmc. Have uob prvimiles.,btohqsg
One transaction cant spilt mode. Try spilt booking and see if price is same or different,btohqsg
I think only esaver promo no need registration.All other scb promos need to register whether via SMS. Web form. Or in app press button.,btohqsg
Check if your salary credited by GIRO or Fast. If fast  no counted.,btohqsg
I have been transferring my funds in/out from various banks and webull to reap the best interest rates. uob flagged this as unusual activity. Am i obliged to provide them with what they requested here? Just wanna make sure i exercise my rights properly,btohqsg
Not obliged I guess if you not planning to continue the banking relationship with them,btohqsg
"You can exercise your ""rights"" if you don't mind discontinuing from using UOB services. They will exercise their rights as well.",btohqsg
Wow bank can request your statement of other banks?,btohqsg
Do you mean once a week or more than that? If do often surely get into problem,btohqsg
Have to agree the 2 response above are the best description of the situationðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yeah thats the part im unsure,btohqsg
Actually itâ€™s only 1-2 times per month,btohqsg
All acct under ur name or someone else?,btohqsg
Maybe you can call their customer service hotline to verify if the email received is actually from them first?,btohqsg
Yup will be doing that tmw. Thanks for the advice,btohqsg

What is the best card to pay for SingTel bills?,btohqsg
Hi I've link crmc with amaze and add it to the shop back. Will I receive miles from amaze and cash back at the same time?,btohqsg
Hi can i ask where can i check what is my UOB lady current category?,btohqsg
I feel not secure if skip amaze at least a prepaid card can serve as a wall to prevent the external app from reaching my cc directly.(any thing I can just unlink cc from prepaid card as a precaution).that is how I feel,btohqsg
Must citi Rewards be paired with amaze on all transaction to earn the bonus points?Can you use citi Rewards by itself w/o pairing to amaze in Google/ Apple pay digital card and still earn those online purchase Rewards?,btohqsg
"You can also report any fraudulent charge on the card itself and get a replacement card.Have seen people stating difficulty with disputing fraudulent charges on Amaze.Hope you're tracking your spending closely and not exceeding 1k SGD spend on Amaze  especially if you're linking it with other cards.On the other hand  Citibank cards are highly prone to BIN attacks  your ""extra layer"" wouldn't help since they directly attack on the card and not Amaze.Nonetheless  as long MCC not excluded  it'll earn rewards on CRMC.",btohqsg
No and no. But read up the t&c sent by JT.,btohqsg
