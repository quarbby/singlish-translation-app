So i can guide undecover planes duh,btohqsg
Were you in the air force? Or else why would you be using these emoticons?,btohqsg
Oh  you just went into Ns this year?,btohqsg
I thought you were older than me!,btohqsg
Must be nice ording 1 week before me,btohqsg
Ah. What does the x2 touch on,btohqsg
So thats similar to o level hist alr,btohqsg
Really  you sound so mature running all these groups,btohqsg
Its 5 more years to go for me,btohqsg
Uh. Hey i just tot of sth  how bout getting an advanced dip from private sch in the course u want. Then use it to enrol into sit,btohqsg
Ah  so you were born in 2001,btohqsg
Even those require relevant experience. I looked at the wsq skills future thing,btohqsg
But I might apply for PCP if I don’t get into next intake,btohqsg
Ya they sound so intellectual n worldly😂,btohqsg
He sounds like a 90s boy  more like me,btohqsg
I conjured this image in my head that@cauchycriterionwas running some tuition centre,btohqsg
this is like oNE PART of the other x2 i know 😂😂,btohqsg
“The best is yet’nt to be” ?,btohqsg
Sch is big n difficult to manage,btohqsg
I just don’t think tuition centres r very moral for charging such high rates,btohqsg
For something honestly anyone can do themselves if they had motivation,btohqsg
But for 7.99 i can teach u,btohqsg
That's where you can make a lot of money. I don't think you can own a prestigious private school in Singapore. Just unheard of in Singapore.,btohqsg
The best is still not yet to be,btohqsg
It’s a bit like selling masks for high prices when dorscon was raised,btohqsg
U r preying on the people’s panic to sell them shit,btohqsg
But yeah  that's why I have never charged anyone a penny for teaching them something.,btohqsg
That's somewhat different. SG's demand for tuition is consistently high,btohqsg
Indeed  but if I were to go into teaching I wouldn’t do it to make big bucks,btohqsg
Seems like the demand for masks is gonna be consistently high from here onwards too,btohqsg
What if u werent in teaching,btohqsg
In the modern world  'not doing it to make big bucks' is codeword for 'never having sufficient societal impact',btohqsg
I just want to live a quiet life,btohqsg
Isn't that a legalised pyramid scheme?,btohqsg
Not really  masks are worn more for society's benefit rather than benefit to self. It's a cost and the only real reason to wear one is to avoid a fine,btohqsg
I dunno where else I’d be,btohqsg
So what do you plan to do in university?,btohqsg
Whats DXO in normal human ranks,btohqsg
I can’t really see myself doing anything else,btohqsg
Wow! We can call you Dr when you finish your PhD,btohqsg
Seems like we can call you dr first,btohqsg
I dunno if I’m suited for the PhD life though,btohqsg
So dunno if I’ll go that far,btohqsg
I feel I have little options in life. So I don't really have a choice.But I think you have more choices.Holding a PhD sometimes just narrows your career path,btohqsg
I thought I'm in discord for a moment.,btohqsg
Is it? I think it commensurates with offerings,btohqsg
Curious  is۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟Aлексей Мекхантыев۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪☭somehow related to@cauchycriterion? Seems like a sad version of John by the profile picture,btohqsg
But the putting tgt of materials all require cost no? Lesson planning n delivery  requires heavy brainpower depending on how well they want to stand out,btohqsg
These are costs borne only when there is a tutor and a tutee,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwad will the sch provide? Training courses or,btohqsg
