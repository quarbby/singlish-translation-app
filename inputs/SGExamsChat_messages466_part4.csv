In poly your lecturers don't care if you go lectures or hand in assignments or score badly in tests. Stay disciplined. You will be treated like a young adult who can take charge of their own learning and decision-making.,btohqsg
My poly lecturer don’t even do Google meets,btohqsg
He just takes it they everybody attends class nd marks everybody as present,btohqsg
Based on your personal experience  how did your poly lecturer treated you?,btohqsg
Follow the ghost  they know da war,btohqsg
Got a lot of lecturers leh  overall they are ok as long as you do your due dilligence like trying out to answer stuff  then when hit a wall  consult them. I know some lecturers ghost emails which is honestly fked up  be ready to find them f2f lol,btohqsg
Actually every year the place got some stupid new construction so it's easy to get lost,btohqsg
Workshop/maritime area used to be almost entirely barricaded for me coz construction,btohqsg
Then suddenly once its done it's a hugeass empty walking path with garden,btohqsg
As mentioned  as long as you do your due dilligence  things should be ok. Mostly if you do wrong it's due to inexperience and that's ok.,btohqsg
Were there any messed up experiences with your lecturers?,btohqsg
Not really  mostly it's students that's the drama one,btohqsg
not really  mostly its just ego boosting on both sides,btohqsg
either the students are super high to the point they know everything...or lecturers who think they are high to the point...they are like a dictator,btohqsg
other than not  mostly normal people,btohqsg
sec school teachers are def worse,btohqsg
i feel A lvl shldnt be easier,btohqsg
The contrasting pass fail one is strange hahahaha,btohqsg
Ig whole point is that it doesn't affect your score lor,btohqsg
But ig yea if the bar for passing is so low,btohqsg
It's a guaranteed pass even if you don't do shit,btohqsg
Does that mean that everyone gets an A,btohqsg
So does that mean if the whole sch come tgt and don't do,btohqsg
