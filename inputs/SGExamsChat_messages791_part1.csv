back in sec school i was media club..my seniors would tell me the spotlights we had would melt makeup of performers on stage..hence why out of 8 lights we had  the decision was made to cut the wires to 4 of them,btohqsg
also happy mother's day if somehow there are any mothers here,btohqsg
4 on each sides  2 of the spotlights on both sides were cut,btohqsg
I tell u how many times get a bottle,btohqsg
I am lucky to have permission to blow aircon,btohqsg
Sometimes blow aircon also the whole afternoon,btohqsg
basically the media head in my sec school decided to cut the wires without permission from the principal to cut the wires of 2 of the spotlights,btohqsg
But electricity bill is crazy too,btohqsg
so when a performance happened.. the other 4 spotlights would never work,btohqsg
