Do I earn 4mpd for fairprice app purchase (ordering food/groceries )for DBS WWMC ?,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the help@Edwin,btohqsg
EGA also got $2k min ADB otherwise $5 FBF,btohqsg
if recurring telco bill can use amaze+crmc,btohqsg
cannot must manually do it monthly,btohqsg
premier ega account no fall below fee,btohqsg
does it work ? havent tried it,btohqsg
woah nice  maybe i should try set it up too,btohqsg
Is it? I saw premier also $5 in this pdfâ€¦,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is a multicurrency account so if you have their debit card you can enjoy their exchange rates + 1% cashback,btohqsg
Does it work with premier ega for the hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Does anyone face any issue transferring money out of hsbc ega?,btohqsg
must maintain the monthly 2K deposit or can just deposit then withdraw to enjoy the additional 1%,btohqsg
How do I check my UOB one credit card cycle?,btohqsg
You can check via chat assist,btohqsg
I believe these are two separate things. Maintaining 2k balance is related to fall below fee. Deposit 2k related to 1% cash back and 1% additional interest rate.,btohqsg
i just read their tnc  need aggregate deposit of 2K per month  does aggregate here mean that net balance after the month needs to be increased by 2K,btohqsg
nope. they never mention incremental 2k per month... 2 things  1st min ADB 2k or $5 FBF. 2nd monthly deposit 2k  they mention that the qualified transactions even include fund transfer  so u can transfer out the remaining part of monthly 2k after any usage.,btohqsg
Wa swee ah! okay then it make sense to do it. thanks for the clarification. just need to maintain the 2K ADB,btohqsg
Hmm for the 2k ADB  if I just opened the account last week and deposited 2k  does it mean I fail to meet the ADB requirement cos the counter starts from day 1?,btohqsg
ADB just in theory lah... not sure they really that strict for every month or not,btohqsg
first month of course fall below 2k,btohqsg
any one time benefits for existing hsbc credit card owner ah to apply for the account.,btohqsg
yes I have targeted email promotion. I signed up their CC in Dec,btohqsg
$180 cash back: same as SingSaver requirements but just 2 investment txns needed,btohqsg
I understand amaze card gives 1% instapoints on fx spend  but Iâ€™ve also seen some folks say any spend on amaze is converted to sgd. so curious about the actual mechanism. If I go korea and spend using amaze for a transaction in KRW  do I get the 1% instapoints?,btohqsg
maintain 2k ADB still worth seems like. cost $3.67 (take OCBC 3.25% and EGA 1.05% as benchmark) less than FBF $5 ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hello guys questionsYoutrip link to grabIn JB the grab payment are in RM?Thank you,btohqsg
So it logs as krw and that earns the 1% instapoints  but on my statement it would be converted to SGD alr?,btohqsg
Hello all  can I ask if I use my HSBC revolution card on ESSO petrol kiosk  and I use Apple Pay. Am I eligible for the 10 x points :),btohqsg
Basically when ever you charge amaze card in non-sgd you earn 1% then amaze will then your linked card in sgd always,btohqsg
no  petrol mcc not in whitelist for 10x points,btohqsg
Hi sorry just want to confirm for hsbc EGA  so maintain above 2k ADB  but your 2k monthly balance can just transfer in and out? To get the 1% cashback,btohqsg
So you can transfer from the first day of the month  then straight away take out,btohqsg
Utilities eg. Senoko got no 4mpd for amaze+citi,btohqsg
Thank you! So best to use Citibank (add Amaze) one which is eligible for the 10X points? Based on the video released today :),btohqsg
u sure? utilities mcc is excluded,btohqsg
depends  there are other cards that give upfront discount for petrol,btohqsg
It seems that after grabpay nerf for axs  best way now to pay for income tax is HSBC EGA 1%? Through giro deduction. Is there a better way than this?,btohqsg
Huge spending on petrol hence wanna find out which card will be the best,btohqsg
google about it  there are blogs about this.,btohqsg
Yea got no 4mpd  typo ps,btohqsg
bruh your 180 cashback  accounted for the 2 buy trade fees for the equity investment account?,btohqsg
Any website that has the latest consolidated discounted miles fare deals for all the airlines ah?,btohqsg
Anyone know how to redeem Citibank cash back card? I have a few hundred dollars inside however every single time I tried to SMS to redeem  it doesnâ€™t work lol,btohqsg
If I understand correctly  although FD% is the same at 4.15  CIMB 18-month FD earns more dollars interest than 12-month due to longer tenure?,btohqsg
I haven't applied yet. need to open by 28 Feb and complete all by 30 Apr only. Cannot open online. need to go down to branch...,btohqsg
If u referring to cashback card (not cashback+ card)  no need to redeem. Cashback will be auto credit in multiples of $10 once accummulate min $50 cashback.,btohqsg
i see. but the promotion bonus interest rate valid for signup via sms by 31st Jan. ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
I am using the cashback+ card,btohqsg
