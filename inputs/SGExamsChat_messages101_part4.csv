It is an econs term haha,btohqsg
Then close ur eyes u wont see utility,btohqsg
yea i learnt that in ec2101,btohqsg
My stand is that you'd probably fare well enlisting women to SAF  because in the end even if they cannot contribute in the most physically taxing situations  they can help out with logistics and transport.,btohqsg
There's always a way to play to their strengths and weaknesses.,btohqsg
Doesn't solve the fairness/unfairness issue but yes,btohqsg
I'm not arguing  that they couldn't enlist females at the start,btohqsg
hes saying that theres no extra utility in getting girls,btohqsg
since he presume guys must and already fill the roles,btohqsg
This I have to disagree  because in saying so you'd assume that you don't need more manpower to grease the gears in SAF (logistics and transport wise),btohqsg
ballot essentially is making ubiquitous randomness true,btohqsg
so many ppl iforget who is who le,btohqsg
in considering the extra utility I guess you'll have to weigh the cost and benefit of including them in the SAF,btohqsg
(cost of food  equipment and lodging versus their utility in SAF),btohqsg
going back utilitarian is hard cause need prove cause and effect,btohqsg
yeah sadly we don't have the numbers to argue all these tbh,btohqsg
right so we mainly theorise on these issues ba,btohqsg
i would say personally as a male if my zabo knows what shit im going through that would be very warming,btohqsg
Then more respect for nsfs ah,btohqsg
I feel like this conversation didn't really bring up anythign new,btohqsg
while waiting ill just add ppl on linkedin,btohqsg
Unless instead of conscription  you just need 1 nuke to serve as deterrence,btohqsg
Those yellow things look like tempura,btohqsg
In terms of fairness yea its unfair that only males have to serve,btohqsg
i still regret not buying that ny shirt in ur dp,btohqsg
i think best way to advance this argument,btohqsg
But if you're waiting for an argument on why females shouldn't serve,btohqsg
is really know the manpower needs of ns,btohqsg
maybe theres just not that much but just to kacao all guys they enlist everyone,btohqsg
"It's really either physical argments or ""utilitarian"" arguments",btohqsg
I would wear it more but,btohqsg
ehh I feel this shirt looks the best when it's just nice,btohqsg
bookshop auntie say dh s and xs alr,btohqsg
sick  xs would be a rly nice fit,btohqsg
i mean the material is actually ok if u wanna exercise in it,btohqsg
btr than the drifit ny shirts,btohqsg
The orientation shirt material is much better,btohqsg
I'm wearing my orientation tee right now,btohqsg
ns singlet > any ny tee HAHAHA,btohqsg
The navy ns singlet is dri fit,btohqsg
I bought the other formation singlets which look decent,btohqsg
Thank you for coming for my ted talk,btohqsg
how to access the youtube video?,btohqsg
John say it's for privacy reason or smt,btohqsg
The video has been privated due to a panelistâ€™s privacy concerns,btohqsg
Apparently an article about the video will be coming out soon,btohqsg
Cant wait to see the man himself  john smith tomorrow again,btohqsg
R we even going to be in the same place,btohqsg
Who knows maybe I will bump into you at the gate,btohqsg
Well guess I will never see smith ever again,btohqsg
