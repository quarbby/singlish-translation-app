Anyone signed up NTUC Union Membership after having a Trust saving account ? I still do not have the 2.5% interest,btohqsg
NTUC Union membership usually need 2 months to process. I recall applying on 1 October and only getting the old NTUC-OCBC credit card in December. Also called up  gave cheque to FairPrice centre  and joined NTUC FairPrice as a co-op member. Too bad after a few months  NTUC card kena cancelled forcibly.,btohqsg
If your company is unionised  can sign up through them. Might be faster. Or ask your branch officials to help you check/expedite,btohqsg
Yes big and unionized company sign up tend to be faster. I am a GB/U@SME member so wait longer.Regarding Trust bankhttps://trustbank.sg/faqs/credit-card/#will-my-card-details-be-changed-once-my-digital-card-face-is-updated-in-the-trust-app,btohqsg

I am considering opening the High flyer too. I have a side hustle with its own UEN. And am invited for this card too. Haven‚Äôt hit the trigger and apply for it though.If your business spending genuinely cannot do 4 mpd  on spend  why not charge it on this card.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt attend your talk Chris due to outside Telegram commitments lol.Just wishing you a roaring success and much applause  much joy  in your panel sharing üëèüèª,btohqsg
Was browsing thru arca business activity I think I only can put this one *46100 WHOLESALE ON A FEE OR COMMISSION BASIS (EXCLUDING ONLINE MARKETPLACES)*...since I'm working with a company and 100% commission base,btohqsg
Overall I think is worth paying the annual fees for the highflyer points and free hotel stay if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
But I'm a grab & singtel users,btohqsg
Ic.. So just lucky to get invited?,btohqsg
AMEX Highflyer main benefit is 1.8mpd on Top-ups (if you know),btohqsg
Seems totally worth it - so many categories with red tapes on 4 mpd - great to have a very solid backup option of HighFlyer that give 1.8 mpd!,btohqsg
Wow! I don‚Äôt have many points on grab due to the recent nerf. What do you guys generally use grab/grab card for to earn points?,btohqsg
Very rarely lo  i only use it for Grab services lately with PayLater (to earn points)  then pay usin GrabPay (1.5% cashback with Amex TCB)I maxed out all my 4mpd cards already so technically this is the best route for me,btohqsg
This card izit good? I got business but never apply,btohqsg
Maybe buying qoo10 with grab sometime to get the qoo10 cashback. But only monthly once.,btohqsg
I've been using this  so far so good for those transactions that doesn't qualify for 4mpd. I love their app too each transaction is tagged with the miles gained. So much clearer and transparent than others that split up or unclear on each transaction. Haven't tried the free hotel stay tho. I got referral if you are interested  but not sure if got additional benefits tho.,btohqsg
I mainly use it to top up grab and when all other cards either maxed or don't qualify.,btohqsg
Disadvantage is it's in a separate highflyer account from krisflyer and yearly there's a cap of transfer over.,btohqsg
One of main reason! So tempting üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes that's the beauty of AMEX much more transparent compared to others,btohqsg
Yeah I'm confused this part... what's the difference between high flyer account & krisflyer account...,btohqsg
anyone know any free app to keep track of online & contactless payments for UOB EVOL / DBS live fresh card? Or just use excel to track?,btohqsg
Money manager is good for keeping track of expenses and cc spendings,btohqsg
it depends on your comfort level  theres a lot available of app store.personally i use YNAB  expensive but informative and good data charts if u are a visual person,btohqsg
Did anyone recently faced difficulty waving uob or otherbank cc annual fees  maybe this becoming a trend with the increasing interest rates somehow bank finding alt income sources,btohqsg
hi  i‚Äôve a upcoming expenditure of USD$800+ on MOOC (e.g coursera). Any credit card to recommend for good exchange rates and also cashback? Currently have UOB One and UOB absolute cashback.,btohqsg
I used Amex Ascend for such a spend. Maybank Barca Card and UOB Absolute Cashback are not bad options. There is no good MasterCard to use for education ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to take money out of YouTrip card?,btohqsg
hi gurus  which credit card is ideal to earn miles points for1.Car servicing2.Car parts and tyres,btohqsg
Anyone faced with double billing with CRMC + AMAZE. And AMAZE did the double claim instead of the merchant,btohqsg
UOB PPV or VS if can pay via contactless,btohqsg
I have appt this Sat   plan to use Crmc +Amaze.,btohqsg
I had something similar with F&F + AMAZE  merchant said only 1 charge  but AMAZE and CC showed 2. Eventually it was reversed at the backend without further input from me. Took about 1-2 weeks.,btohqsg
I think can topup grab or dash something. Can't rememeber,btohqsg
Now every time time I see CMRC I du lan.,btohqsg
happened to me alot when i used it overseas  seems like it's quite common esp. in japan,btohqsg
for the reward points.... for now i'll just suck it up but it does give quite abit of headache when it comes to reconciliation,btohqsg
So money go in cannot come out?,btohqsg
Hahaha maybe this then the EZ-Link app that one can anot you think?,btohqsg
I did topup something and use it. I think is ezlink,btohqsg
But then my was whole number,btohqsg

Hihi  will I get 10X points for Spotify and Netflix by using CRMC?,btohqsg
can i ask how come you approved within 2 biz days while the rest still pending? are you an existing hsbc card holder?,btohqsg
I'm not. I have a feeling it's deliberate .. I applied just before the singsaver promo went public so I wasn't entitled to it.,btohqsg
i see  i applied one day after u. i called the hotline  still pending. i heard horror stories some waited for 3 weeks for the card,btohqsg
i have applied on the 22nd of december  currently still waiting for my revo and a debit card they said will mail to me when i open my account,btohqsg
Does anybody has experience with UOB Supplementary Card?I have a UOB Supplementary card  but I can‚Äôt seem to pay it directly via the UOB app,btohqsg
For hsbc Ega account  would you still qualify for cash back if to giro to IRAS or insurance?,btohqsg
Anyone topped up grab above $10k for Jan? Reading the words  seems like the limit is based on transaction of $10k. Not the top up limit of $10k,btohqsg
Trying to hit higher interests in my dbs multiplier. Is paying insurance premiums considered an eligible credit card transaction?,btohqsg
Wallet value limit is at $5k. Other than that  all other limits are transaction limits.,btohqsg
The balance will be transferred to main card's balance at end of statement month,btohqsg
That‚Äôs my understanding too. In other words  if one can consume $10k a month  the topping up limit in theory would be up to $15k,btohqsg
Did you guys receive any application number when apply for HSBC revolution card. I couldn‚Äôt find any to input into Singsaver form,btohqsg
Use your hp last 4 digit,btohqsg
No email and SMS was received as well,btohqsg

normally the GXS banner will pop out in Grab  so keep your eyes wide for it,btohqsg

Sole proprietor is $100  Pte Ltd is $300,btohqsg
Do note that the latest rate of 4.08% offered for a 8 month placement is based on a 12 mth return,btohqsg

Maribank is a digital bank by Sea Group (Shopee's parent company). Yet to formally launch,btohqsg
I already have a side hustle cleaning sports shoes. üòÇ might make that formal !,btohqsg
Maxed out my GXS  $0.48 daily interest.,btohqsg

My interest in the pocket gets credited into the pocket  not sure if the bonus $2.50 goes directly into the pocket also?,btohqsg
Cannot Move to the pocket? I create a separate pocket put 2.5k each,btohqsg
Lidat the pocket got room to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù. Still 0.48 per day?,btohqsg
Yes is compounded. $5000 will get around $0.48 (rounding up). To get $0.49 need at least $5100ish,btohqsg
Too small to see any different lah,btohqsg
The $2.50 you need to move manually into the pocket.,btohqsg
$2.5 will be credited to main account.,btohqsg
Hahah still not worth to leave the interest to compound  1 Feb I'm gonna move all back to RHB to milk the 5%,btohqsg
The bonus is only for the first $10 earned,btohqsg
Hi! Can I fund from grab wallet  and later withdraw back into grab wallet again?,btohqsg
Dont think can. Only from bank accounts,btohqsg
Earn 0.48 per day is 14.4,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt it be 14.5 if 3.48 per annual,btohqsg
You can only GXS fund via bank but you can use GXS to fund your grab wallet,btohqsg
No need separate pocket  pocket can hold beyond 5k for interest and bonus.,btohqsg
Rhb can draw out anytime mwh,btohqsg

RHB I withdrew everything on 1 Jan  so my daily avg balance for Jan is $0  1 Feb throw everything back in full 5%,btohqsg

Oh. So once Grab is over  the card will deemed useless,btohqsg
Not really useless bah  can be your backup card when u have max out the rest of your cards benefits,btohqsg
Any other cards recommended for insurance,btohqsg
Not from me  others here might have,btohqsg

Is it a good idea to get from them this month?,btohqsg
Check singsaver HSBC promo  got lucky draw  free chair  earpiece or 300 cash back,btohqsg
I applied for SCB in Nov22 for the chair. Probably getting the $300 cash,btohqsg
For hsbc go download their app.. maybe they would have approved your ecard,btohqsg
When I called and they told me I have been approved there was no email telling me that I was approved,btohqsg
Singsaver seems to be slow in verifying the spending from the bank,btohqsg
If you see your card no. On the app. Just activate and you can start using,btohqsg

hi Gurus  how does the GXS  bonus of 4 times $2.5 works? i received the invite  but i cant find much info from their website. not sure if it is worth to open an account with GXS,btohqsg
opening is easy as clicking a button  if u have 5k around  the flexi interest is not bad?no idea about the bonus tho,btohqsg
i dun have spare 5k  trying to hit the 100k mark for uob one account. maybe few months down the road  i may have spare 5k. haha,btohqsg
so open GXS must 1 shot transfer 5k over?,btohqsg
focus on uob one then  if the interest is higher (if u do all the steps) - 4% > 3.48% is kinda neat,btohqsg
UOB one i lacking ard 5k also to fulfil 100k mark. but this is my first month  waiting to spend $500 and salary credit in. not sure Feb will see some good bonus for cny XD,btohqsg
i see the promotion for GXS bonus didnt seem to have set any deadline yet~ maybe can status quo first.,btohqsg
everytime you earn $ interest of 2.5 from the saving pocket  they match with a $2.5 bonus  until it hit $10 bonus earned,btohqsg
hm. any min amount must transfer to GXS? if i just put 500 will be able to get it?,btohqsg
then no more $2.5 but you still earn your $3.85% interest,btohqsg
min balance of $0.01 to earn interest,btohqsg
i see. so it is go big or go home to earn the $2.5. must credit 5k in 1st transaction,btohqsg
$5k is to earn it fast  too small dk take how long,btohqsg
cause now max is $5k so $0.48 per day,btohqsg
need $21 days with $5k to earn finish the bonus $10,btohqsg
I see. I guess I can try once I have spare 5k to throw in GXS. I will focus on UOB one first.,btohqsg
Has anyone tried this? For Citi rewards cc,btohqsg
HI  anyone used AMEX tcb to buy capitaland vouchers  does it qulaify for the 3% cashback?,btohqsg

If you have Trust Bank you can withdraw without fees,btohqsg
trust card without trust bank can?,btohqsg
I think you need the actual savings account + debit card  or it would be considered cash advance,btohqsg
hmm okay  i guess youtrip also ok? not alot of difference,btohqsg
if you're ok with the $5 flat fee then yah not much difference,btohqsg
I think people just buy giga buck I think,btohqsg

Morning all  I think I saw this thread before but would like to clarify. So CRMC if use for grab will get 10x points but if CRMC + Amaze then wont be entitled?,btohqsg
Only rides and food will get 10x points for CRMC. If tagged to amaze  why wont it earn? MCC is still the same.,btohqsg
I thought so too but somewhere along the thread I read it wont be.. or perhaps I have misinterpreted,btohqsg
Thus would like to clarify on this,btohqsg
Yup  Amaze only changes transactions to online. MCC remains the same.,btohqsg
Double confirm did I heard Chris said that Maybank Family and Friend card does not work with Amaze anymore as it look at the description which consists the ‚ÄúAmaze‚Äù wording?,btohqsg
no. What he meant is for bonus categories that are merchant-specific e.g. popular bookstore under retail and pets category  merchant will be Amaze so no 8% at popular. Should use Maybank fnf card itself for these merchant-specific categories. Amaze+maybank fnf still work for those bonus categories that are based on MCC.,btohqsg

Trying to pair with the 360 account . I haven‚Äôt check the other eligible card for the spend category,btohqsg
Depends on your valuation of a mile. Giving up 1.5% cashback to use a 1.2mpd card means youre buying miles at about 1.2 cents each,btohqsg
I applied ocbc TI it is also qualified,btohqsg
Ok I‚Äôll check that out and try to apply  cause now I‚Äôm only using one CC for all spend   was thinking to get 365 for dining cashback,btohqsg
Understand otherwise have to wait and apply again.,btohqsg
Just wondering if apply via Singsaver  will I entitle for the welcome gift?,btohqsg
This is Citi official offers page  if you sign up from here  you will not be entitled to Singsaver gifts as they are separate promotionshttps://hmsg.link/citicards,btohqsg
What do you generally value a mile at? I read its usually between 0.8 to 1.92 cents,btohqsg
My personal valuation is 1.9 cents,btohqsg
But i know thats on a higher side,btohqsg
Can you share how you arrived at that,btohqsg
A round trip business class ticket to London costs 207k miles. If i take 207k multiply by 1.9 cents  i get about 3.9k. I would be willing to pay 3.9k out of pocket for a round trip business class ticket to London,btohqsg

They could have made it immediate on the 16th .... and scores of people would have money stuck in their GrabPay wallets.,btohqsg

CC via AXS  cardup  ipaymy  or bank payment service like citi payall etc,btohqsg
All the bill payments available on AXS (with the exception of CC payments) can be paid via CC. But all CCs exclude AXS payments for any cashback  points or miles. I think the only exception is Maybank family&friends.,btohqsg
Guys after Axs nerf  what methods yall suggest to pay for GE insurance?,btohqsg

Hi experts  i‚Äôve a question! I‚Äôve reached FRS at 40‚Ä¶ may i know if the sum compounds till 55 or 65(assuming i don‚Äôt withdraw at 55),btohqsg
days before 55 do up CPF shielding  to allow OA > RA. Then bring your SA sum back to top up your remaining RA.then  that‚Äôs how u maximise your CPF to let it compound,btohqsg
If only we still can do that when reach 55 üòÄ,btohqsg
I wonder how come I not receive grab challenge today.,btohqsg

Buy ShopeePay vouchers at $0.01 to easily meet the transaction count requirement,btohqsg
Some did not received the grab challenges.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs random one I realised.Last week my friend received  Grab Challenge but for different top up value.,btohqsg
will HSBC award 4mpd for booking Airbnb?,btohqsg
Hi experts  does anybody know if Investment linked plans (ILP) can be sold to a third party vendor?,btohqsg
Even if can sold likely have to incur huge losses. Maybe 30% losses. In order to attach people to buy. Anyway just guessing,btohqsg
Still any good in supporting grab? Or $600 for your cashback card better.,btohqsg
Thanks! I know endowment plans can be sold but ILP I not sure,btohqsg
Anyone here using webull? I wanna ask if can do daily auto invest?,btohqsg
ILP initial stage not much value 1.. u put in 1-2k maybe cash value less than 100.. all go to set up cost,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of ILP  my one got value haha,btohqsg
If you plan to sell  can shop around Endowment Exchange / REPS Invest / TES Capital  see which one gives you the highest rate (pls remove the links if inappropriate)https://endowmentexchange.com/https://repsinvest.com.sg/https://tesinvest.com.sg/,btohqsg
No set up cost meh? First few years jialat 1,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre intending to cash out I think cannot. But generally for pure investment ilps  the value and the surrender value is different,btohqsg
Only if u surrender then they take the money as set up cost,btohqsg

Hello  is it advisable to replace the UOB Absolute cashback card with the SCB Simply Cash Credit card (1.5% cashback + annual fee waived for 2 years) for grabpay top ups?,btohqsg
(6 + 2)@Wil_Ow  please  send the solution to the arithmetic operation provided within the time amount specified to this group  otherwise you will be kicked. Thank you! (60 sec)Powered by1inch Network,btohqsg
Not much use already after 16th Jan. Get other card with minimum spend,btohqsg
Only the uob absolute and amex true cashback gets cashback from grab wallet topup. The key question is how much use case you have for grab wallet once AXS transactions are no longer allowed.,btohqsg
It's time to look for alternatives,btohqsg
SC SimplyCash does not give any cashback for GrabPay topups,btohqsg
Once TCB amex got nerf grab is dead,btohqsg
But amex TCB still got it's used vs uob amex due to its support SgQR via amex pay in amex app,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your responses! üôè,btohqsg
Does Uob one card spending via ShopBack QR code qualifies it as the monthly spending requirements,btohqsg

Anyone knows what is the average time to get your cr dit card approved? I applied for UOB krisflyer 2 months ago and no updates from them other than asking for some documents 1 month ago(1 month after I submitted application). I have booked about 10 flights in this 2 months mostly on scoot but sadly can't get the miles because the card application is taking so long.

Uob app ?don't think they will sperate it mostly will show how much,btohqsg
it is able to breakdown into online and contactless?  Oh great!,btohqsg
For UOB EVOL? Don‚Äôt think I see it,btohqsg
Most banks don't separate payment to show on statement either online or contactless it just show location date amount so user need to do own Homeworks to record down or use a app lorI record down when I use cards,btohqsg
I mean  there is no tracker for Uob EVOL,btohqsg
Not about the online and mobile,btohqsg
Why not call the bank and ask,btohqsg

"a bit uncomfortable with marko & friend group. they way they ""encourage"" each other. hard to describe. got the mlm vibes although they are not mlm.",btohqsg
Depend how u see it. End of the day. See which one suit u more,btohqsg
Guys  do you know which card can be used for broadband subscriptions?,btohqsg
may i ask if there is no fx transaction fee credit card besides trust card?,btohqsg
Must manually pay monthly  cannot set as recurring,btohqsg
So basically grabpay is useless now,btohqsg
Uob one can set as recurring,btohqsg
What? Any paynow also doesn't work?,btohqsg
But which cards are available for 4mpd for broadband? Is it considered telco?,btohqsg
Technically u can still use grab pay for favepay too,btohqsg
Any that don‚Äôt exclude  would include like Citi reward and HSBC revolution,btohqsg
grab is just an app to get $40 taxi rides in sucky cars now,btohqsg
I thought only for axs paynow,btohqsg
I just got my Citi PremierMiles and I need to spend $800 for the first 2 months to qualify for 8000 Citi Miles.,btohqsg

Hi Phil isn‚Äôt it immediate ? Means my money topped up on 14th jan is stuck ed -$10k gone lol,btohqsg
Anyone has ever redeem standard chartered rewards point convert to miles?,btohqsg
Don't quite get you. What I meant is that at least Grab gave advance notice for you to clear your wallet before the AXS nerf. Back when they nerfed CPF top-ups ... I don't recall Grab giving any advance notice.,btohqsg
Perhaps I didn‚Äôt notice the part that WEF 16th of jan 2023 they will stop AXS payments . I topped up at 14th jan from uob absolute for their 1.7% cut off date,btohqsg

Hmm but seems amaze + crmc is better?,btohqsg
Hi all  how much is the max amount to grab AMAZE point? is it cap at 3K?,btohqsg
If reward can take the hospital mcc then u use amaze way,btohqsg
capped at 500 instapoints ($500 foreign spend) per transaction. no limit if can split into multiple $500 transactions,btohqsg
For Citibank  they don‚Äôt exclude hospital MCC.,btohqsg
Then it is limit to 1k for citi reward then,btohqsg
If the mcc of hospital fall under 9399 citi bank does exclude it,btohqsg
So better to test abit first before paying all,btohqsg
That why it is always mcc not the nature of business that determine,btohqsg
Yes.. hahaha. Must try one time then can know.,btohqsg
Does applying for multiple credit cards at one time affect your credit score?,btohqsg

Hi  what js the best card I can use to pay for insurance? Thanks üòä,btohqsg
So all. Just FYI. I use instarem amaze with crmc and its been ok except for one dubious transaction attempt initially that didn't go through.But I recently tried to do funds transfer using instarem and it has been the most frustrating experience ever. Absolutely terrible service. My transaction has been held for no reason  the chat support asks me to write a ticket. The ticket support is glitchy. They ask for document and don't specify what document they want. There is no live phone number and the mobile interface to navigate forms is horrendous. My worst mistake trying this service - should have paid the extra $20 and done a bank to bank transfer from DBS likr i usually did. Please be warned- instarem is great when things go well  but when there is an issue- its terrible.,btohqsg
the logic of this app is so confusing. one time i want to transfer money to my friend  it kept on making me add new receipt even though i alreay added a few people.,btohqsg
hi   is there ways to earn points from paying cc bills ?,btohqsg
How long did they take to send the new credit card? Still waiting for mine,btohqsg
SC response and react time is very slow,btohqsg
