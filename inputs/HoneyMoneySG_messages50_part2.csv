Anyone have bank account in Malaysia and Singapore? I went JB on wed i exchange cash at 3.41,btohqsg
Actually dunno should i open this CIMB singapore account. Base on the photo i will earn 0.035 ringgit more. If i change $100  it will be about 3.5 ringgit more which is about $1 sgd. worth to sign up,btohqsg
Ya how much u want to change?,btohqsg
I usually change only $100 sgd when i go JB a day,btohqsg
Save the trouble thinking. If not doing big amt. Not much diff.,btohqsg
Lol $1 does not worth the effort lah. Time is more valuable,btohqsg
I will go 1-2 days a month only. Ya i also think maybe not worth the effort,btohqsg
Hi recently i watched a video by the fift person on Sheng Siong. Then 1 guy shared he bought Sheng Shiong 10 years ago then the divide yield on is 18%. I thinking to find a good dividend stock to keep long term. Any recommendations of video  people  which stocks or website i can get information or tips?,btohqsg
Hi bro n sis May I check if I am combining Citi reward card + amaze in StarHub buying a new phone.Will I get the bonus point ?,btohqsg
My comment is to have this stock  you need to look for a stock that will continue to have business growth and the dividend payout will increase over the year. The 18% is calculated based on last 1-2 years. During the initial first few years  the dividend payout of Sheng Siong is about only 4-5.5% per year. It is because share price increase n dividend payout increase  that resulted the 18 percent annual return for last 2 years after he hold it for 10 years as his initial investment is at lower price compare to today price.If you are interested on this method  you can follow Warren Buffet method - Value investing.,btohqsg
Yes  but only the 1st 1k of eligible transactions in ur statement mth is eligible for bonus,btohqsg
I see.. ok thanks. Cos this Citi reward mcc quite blur de‚Ä¶ mcc code dun have transport de. But use grab still 10x üòÖ,btohqsg
I have hsbc premier card  which gives 5%cashback and 1mpd. Been reading all your posts on hsbc revolution which gives 4mpd  but only for online and contactless. Should I apply for the revo card instead?,btohqsg
hsbc premier should be 5%+ 1x point i.e. 0.4mpd  only for limited categories. Hsbc revolution covers much more categories.,btohqsg
transaction type indicator for each transaction.,btohqsg
online transaction goes by blacklist not whitelist MCC,btohqsg
But how do we maintain the TRB for HSBC Premier while playing the merry go round game?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone knows if citi rewards would earn 4mpd for the 1st $1k if I were to add my amaze card into my google wallet and pay with it?From what I understand  any payment through google wallet for citi rewards won't qualify for the 4mpd.,btohqsg
You can use the keyword ‚ÄúCiti rewards amaze google‚Äù to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Any gurus can help me with EGA giro application. I have been rejected 5x it is impossible to get giro application approved with that bloody bank,btohqsg
And the form was even filled in by a bank officer still Kenna rejected,btohqsg
But I am a stubborn person I will keep trying even if it kills me because I will probably tire the other party out before I give up,btohqsg
Sorry  just got to clarify  it seems like  Citi rewards + G pay won't work with contactless payment?,btohqsg

IRAS  AMEX  Incomplete form  wrong bank name  wrong account number  wet signature required,btohqsg
I'm going to collect all their rejection reasons before they give up an approve me,btohqsg
try changing your signature to something simple?,btohqsg
I recently managed to update IRAS giro  and also credit card giro payment. quite smooth.,btohqsg
I am going to go back to the branch and haul the branch mgr ask him/her fill in the form to 100% approval criteria,btohqsg
u send a copy of the empty form here I teach you which field input what,btohqsg
Is your signature on both banks same? If it is different  no way you can setup giro unless you update your signature on both banks to the same one.,btohqsg
u share a copy of your form. I tell you which field is for what.,btohqsg
Nope and that is also not rejection reason,btohqsg
signature is the most difficult. the rest of the rejection is your imput error liao,btohqsg
you just share the form bah. I tell you which part fill in what.,btohqsg
Not me the bank officer filled in for me,btohqsg
