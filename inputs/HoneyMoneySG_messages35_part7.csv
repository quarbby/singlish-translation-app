M1 or MR's 5G plan one of the cheapest liao..but MR using M1's mvno... signal / recep is subpar compared to the other big coys,btohqsg
m1 caller id need to top up   no no,btohqsg
5G is not mature enough in SG yet so never really bother,btohqsg
Jumped through mvno from all 3 main TelcoCircles  giga and gomoSo using m1  starhub and Singtel network respectively.Signal for my usage  gomo seems to be the best  circles was the worst.Issue happens especially in super crowded malls. But ymmv depending on where you frequent/travel pathEdit: this is for 4g,btohqsg
if u dont have high expectations u go with M1's mvno..if u have very high expectations u needa skip M1 network all together,btohqsg
Tried to port to heya they also use SingTel satellite  but they not allow gomo user port in,btohqsg
But ironically.. M1's broadband is one of the better if not best one for price / quality lol,btohqsg
just do a 3-way port... sacrifice abit of small $ and days,btohqsg
I did a M1 > Changi Mobile > MR within 3 days last yearbecause M1 > MR under different plans and cost more,btohqsg
You mean port to other telco first then port in heya?haha,btohqsg
i need MR for the MR talk app overseas.. very handy :),btohqsg

Can I check which vouchers redemption gives the highest cashback for citirewards ?,btohqsg
Just received an invitation to upgrade to the American Express Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer Ascend Credit Card. Theyâ€™re offering 12 000 KrisFlyer miles or $150 statement credit. Iâ€™m planning to go for the miles  but is it worth it considering that Iâ€™ll have to pay the $340.20 annual fee? Any advice is appreciated.,btohqsg
The value of one mile is a tad bit expensive,btohqsg
Only upgrade when you want the 1N hilton hotel voucher and 4 lounge passes,btohqsg
After the first year can request waibver for KFA,btohqsg
Are you sure? I have the cashback credited.,btohqsg
Its eligible for cashback. If you have Amex KF you can also get 1.1/1.2 mpd for amex qr.,btohqsg

Hi  how do I stop recurring SRS contribution to my OCBC account?,btohqsg
hellooo  I open SCB e$saver last month for the interest on incremental balance. Do I withdraw all my money this month and leave it at $0 until next month? So that I can get the interest on incremental balance again?,btohqsg
When did u start depositing esaver last month?,btohqsg
Open hsbc ega and dump allnover,btohqsg
for SCB wealth saver that is shared  looks like u have to be New-to-bank  that's the catch for the 5% i guess  am I right? thanks,btohqsg
hello  did anyone not get the 5% PA interest for RHB promo last month? i put in 25 000 but only got $25.07 for interest. If Iâ€™m calculating it correctly  thatâ€™s only 1.74% interest PA. I put in on 6th feb. So thatâ€™s about 21 days,btohqsg
RHB bonus interest TOC is 90 working days but normally is around 1.5 months,btohqsg
What you get is probably the basic interest from 6 Feb to 28 Feb only,btohqsg
ahhh okay  so I canâ€™t withdraw in the meantime?,btohqsg
Can withdraw leaving $1 inside while waiting your bonus interest,btohqsg
I tried to scan using xnap but payment canâ€™t go through. Not sure why.,btohqsg

So if my acc open in march  any amount is subjected to bonus interest ?,btohqsg
Hi Chris- just now I tried to apply for a stash account but it will auto link my current UOB debit card to this new stash account. My card is currently linked to UOB one account. Does this mean that after I apply  the card will be delinked from my UOB one account? Like that I canâ€™t use it to clock my UOB one account $500 requirement ?,btohqsg
For EGA what happens if you fall below 2k balance? I don't like the idea of 2k being stuck in the acct once interest rates plunge,btohqsg
Wait aft 6 months then just close ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
1. If i were to open an HSBC EGA and put in money tmr  can I withdraw out in Apr  and alternate as such for May (deposit) and June (withdraw). do i still get the Bonus interest by end of Aug on the those months i have money inside  ie March and May?2. for SCB Wealth $aver  need to be New to Bank?,btohqsg
Depends how easy it is. For luck SCB need to go down physical branch. Not sure about hsbc,btohqsg
So itâ€™s true that opening HSBC EGA now donâ€™t need to alternate the cash? Since the reference month is Feb for the next 4 months.,btohqsg
Payment on travel insurance using UOB evol card is it considered as online cashback category???,btohqsg
HSBC EGA march step up promotion can from $1-2mil getting 5.55% on march and 4.55% following month till Jun,btohqsg
What's wrong With HSBC debit card? Open the account alr. Make a deposit and also had afew transaction... But almost a week no details is shown in the app itself,btohqsg
agree easy to open and close a bank account but i think hsbc ega always come out promotion to win the other banks matter of time maybe 1 to 2 months or so,btohqsg
There is 2 way of playing for example if you are March-June cycle if your Feb is 01) March - put in all and do $2k in and 5 transfer out to get 5.55%2) April - $2k3) May - put in all and do $2k in and 5 transfer out to get 5.55%4) June - $2kOr1) March to June whole cycle  just put all on 1st March and leave it there and do $2k in and 5 transfer out on 1st March and 1st May so your first month 5.55% the rest 4.55%,btohqsg
