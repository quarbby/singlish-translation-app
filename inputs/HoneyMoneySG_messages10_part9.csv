Can I check  if my spending on cards is less than $500 per month  is it worth to use miles card? Because I saw like DBs miles card need to spend 25 000 per year in order to waive the annual fees. Thank you.,btohqsg
Happy to be here  just joined. Enjoyed a ton of the content on YouTube :),btohqsg
you may need to do long term calculation on the total miles that can be received before they expire instead of looking at the wavier volumeyou may end up not having enough miles to spend when your miles expire,btohqsg

Is it available for CPF to invest?,btohqsg

Hi. Are we able to transfer own cpf OA funds into own cpf MA to yield the 4% interest?,btohqsg
I can't find an option to do it. Only hv cash top up to MA option,btohqsg
I forget. I think u need to Google search or see if anyone post a video on youtube,btohqsg
ðŸ˜…i googled. it auto redirect to steps to transfer from OA to SA,btohqsg
There is no way to transfer OA to MA for your own account  only cash top up,btohqsg
Need to use the DBS webapp version to switch account between Cashback Bonus and DBS Multiplier Account.,btohqsg
Morning everyone. Anyone here has experience buying Thai property?,btohqsg
Hi Honey Money SG Folks Assuming an individual is 55 and retired this year. After setting aside the prevailing FRS in the RA  he has a balance of $20 000 in OA  $40 000 in RA and $66.000 in MA.Can I check if that person has some cash in his savings account  can he do voluntary cash top up to his SA to take advantage of the 4% interest rate?If yes  is there a cap on the amount he can top up yearly? Is there a cap on the total amount that he can top up for SA?Appreciate if any CPF expert can advice on the above. Thanks in advanceÂ ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
After 55  cannot top up selectively to SA. But he can do voluntary cash contribution to 3 accounts up to $37740 a year if he does not have any other mandatory employment contributions,btohqsg
The allocation to SA from the voluntary contribution will be age grp dependent,btohqsg
Any withdrawals made will be from SA first then emptied out and followed from OA,btohqsg
Thanks for the info KQ and Jeremy.,btohqsg
Not bad for 2.5 and 4 %  better than leaving the cash in bank,btohqsg
One more question  we can do voluntary top up till any age we want right?,btohqsg
That's why some are doing the SA shielding. But it only works if u are near the 55 mark,btohqsg
Yes. Voluntary topups to 3 accounts by employed persons are not eligible for tax relief,btohqsg
Not even the first 8k for tax relief?,btohqsg
So after voluntary top up to 3 accounts after age 55  but can also withdraw anytime as well? Assuming FRS is set aside in RA,btohqsg
KQ said can  but will draw down from SA then OA,btohqsg
But if MA is full  hit the ceiling. Can still top up to MA? Or it will flow to SA?,btohqsg
I think cannot  the contribution will either go the SA or OA. Interest from MA will also flow to SA,btohqsg
This is before 55  beyond 55 i suppose will be the same,btohqsg
So if u do 3VC top up  it will flow to SA and OA only? To enjoy the 4% and 2.5% interest? 3VC portion for MA will flow to SA or OA?,btohqsg
But i may be wrong hehe,btohqsg
Usually above $1000 spending a month to make sense  with 4 mpd cards,btohqsg
tax deductible for self employed only  VC3A,btohqsg
UOB  watch my recent DCA video got say,btohqsg
Sorry AM little confused here. So for cash top up before age 55  its tax deductible up to 8k  but beyond 55  its not tax deductible?,btohqsg
Thx for confirming. Didn't know vc3a is still doable after 55 when RA is formed.. meaning can deposit anytime and withdraw anytime? (In excess of FRS),btohqsg
This is gd right  no risk 2.5 and 4% returns with flexibilty to withdraw any time. Perfect for those who are not investment savvy like me,btohqsg
We're talking about volunary Top-up to 3 accounts. Not RSTU or VCMA,btohqsg
Withdrawal is SA first then OA,btohqsg
Does NS 100 sgd still work with big pay?,btohqsg

Yes for existing citi customers  $30 for each card approved,btohqsg
