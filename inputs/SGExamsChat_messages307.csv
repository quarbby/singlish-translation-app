I like phy n chem btr now than b4,btohqsg
Legit many courses you can take with bio and phy tho,btohqsg
wait i tthink phy chem will be more doors,btohqsg
bc like doctor all dony even need bio,btohqsg
I've been living under a rock,btohqsg
You'll have a better idea of what you're going to learn,btohqsg
Then see your interest I assume you'll want to take one of the common sci combi,btohqsg
If you don't like Chem then pmec or bmec,btohqsg
I took econs and i regretted it,btohqsg
Geog requires a lot of memorisation from what I heard from friends,btohqsg
As in the content quite huge,btohqsg
Rly got to internalise alot of things,btohqsg
Even for h1  my essays jn were several pages long  and my handwriting is small,btohqsg
Sorry ur handwriting in another lang,btohqsg
Its possible to get band 2  but nvr band 1,btohqsg
Okay but there is one thing we can all agrer,btohqsg
Ah then is ur eval got issues. Cuz with good eval can push into band 2 alr,btohqsg
Btw has anyone considered going to an overseas uni in a non english speaking country,btohqsg
PW is the worst subject for all jc students,btohqsg
Geog is content heavy but if you have an interest in it  i would say go for it.,btohqsg
Nono but i take elect geog,btohqsg
I considering germany since they have no sch fees,btohqsg
Its still content heavy and they test little from the syllabus yearly,btohqsg
Aka a compulsory subject for all jc students,btohqsg
I not sure what unis are good there,btohqsg
I wanted to go korea HAHA,btohqsg
I trying for USA but hopeless ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
But is too hard to learn their language fast enough,btohqsg
I take core hist for sec 3 and anyone has any tips ?,btohqsg
Like im sec 3 next yr,btohqsg
I hear Korea uni culture q bit cutthroat,btohqsg
Take ur time to study  but start early,btohqsg
U get 18 months of work visa rhere roo,btohqsg
I forgot all the German I learnt alr HAHAH,btohqsg
You need to pass h1mt for german uni,btohqsg
Was q fun learning to differentiate the street signs and stuff when I was there,btohqsg
Idk if u need to score well for it thou so i damn scared,btohqsg
Need to get my german to C1 level thou,btohqsg
I regret not experimenting more in jc,btohqsg
The biggest thing that scares me is the employment prospect in Sg cus later they dont recognise anything thats not UK/US/SG uni,btohqsg
Honestly on that front I'm not sure,btohqsg
But its better to have 2 choices and then think about this than just go sg uni straight up yeah,btohqsg
Like I got sg placing but trying the us hamster wheel for more choice,btohqsg
Has anyone gone to/ plan to go to the uni foundation program /  a community college is us / uk / aus?,btohqsg
My advise is to ask yourself what course do u want in uni? Look at the pre-requisites then u make your choice.,btohqsg
If u get good grades but lack of appropriate subjects needed for uni course you may not get the course. Or need take extra bridging modules,btohqsg
hi yall. is it a disadvantage to take only one science in jc?,btohqsg
i‚Äôm more comfortable with chem  but i can‚Äôt do physics. i didn‚Äôt take up bio for o‚Äôs either  so totally no foundation except lower sec lol,btohqsg
depends what course u wanna go in da future,btohqsg
Random qn what is netball in Chinese?,btohqsg
Google is giving me weird ans again,btohqsg
i can swear my chinese is deproving the more i learn japanese,btohqsg
My friend wan get me some netball merch,btohqsg
Depends on where u wanna gom,btohqsg
Then most likely you are going for hybrid combi which is chem and maybe econs. (Read my bio and iMaybe u can find out more),btohqsg
As a private candidate it is possible to take hybrid subject. Hybrid as in science and commerence?,btohqsg
1 sci 1 humanities 1 math as h2. Then the other is either hq or h2,btohqsg
POA  MOB  math and F math?,btohqsg
MOB and POA private candidate can take,btohqsg
Private candidate cannot take coursework subject.,btohqsg
Rip but makes sense tho tbh,btohqsg
Use your hand open can alr üëçüèº,btohqsg

@mathconsultantsgRemove ur ad from your name pls,btohqsg
Your whole profile is an ad but that's crossing the line,btohqsg
If u put ur name as vulgarities and stuff I would say the same thing,btohqsg
So yes  there are names we do not want to see here,btohqsg
Hmmm kinda bias right...i see some ads here,btohqsg
Some admin said ok some say cannot,btohqsg
If you are referring to stuff like the pinned messages  it's because those have been approved by admins beforehand,btohqsg
We make a distinction between approved ads and unapproved ads,btohqsg
So whats the criteria of getting approved,btohqsg
Cos Bedok told me no ads at all,btohqsg
Being a walking ad is not one of them kek,btohqsg
Ask mindef apply permission to John,btohqsg
Just in time for Ah Girls Go ARmy,btohqsg

In case theres no other hope in life,btohqsg
Or ur really committed to serve,btohqsg
Because it is about serving the nation,btohqsg
words to use if you apply for a govt job,btohqsg
I already did tho so no point going in again.,btohqsg
I think this is the second one that they send me.,btohqsg
you are an asset to the nation. Apply for SAFOS,btohqsg

Hi fellow 3 kids parent üòÑ,btohqsg
Because 3 kids means 3 ppl to tax next time,btohqsg
Relief for 10 years tax u 40 years,btohqsg

You make adulting sound so scary lol,btohqsg
I wish i remain as a student,btohqsg
No need to kena suan by John Smith for being walking ad because i need milk powder money...,btohqsg
Alot of things can just say 'i am intern',btohqsg
internship is not work for milk powder and diapers,btohqsg
1 large milk tin near $60,btohqsg
Intern ah....u pay sch fee first they give u pocket $$,btohqsg
So u pay for ur own pay,btohqsg
internship sometimes is do nothing one,btohqsg
at least my mentor told me that last time,btohqsg
If you work for welfare org   it ‚Äòs different lol,btohqsg
Mine was internship at the company giving me my scholarship,btohqsg
You work for welfare org   you become the jack of all trades.,btohqsg
u become parent u also become Jack of all trades,btohqsg
Everytime I prep milk  I am thinking this is why we learn chemistry.,btohqsg
Like 3 in 1 drinks   soups etc.,btohqsg
u use bottles with ml markings for that?,btohqsg
But need to make sure is not diluted right?,btohqsg
newborns cannot too dilute or concentrated. Must follow specifications,btohqsg
Time to ans math qn for free (not ad hor....),btohqsg
Still have Physics A Level MCQ with my current students :(,btohqsg
Still got FM paper 2 i think,btohqsg
Good what...means business still goes on,btohqsg
Ya tmr morning H2 F math,btohqsg
I prepared 400 MCQs for first tranche of practice and another 400 MCQs after that üòÖ,btohqsg
Do for math la...publish a book and i will buy,btohqsg
Planning on a H2 Math book. Need time though :(Will be working on 2nd edition for H2 Phy. Sold out for some years but haven't had time to re-do,btohqsg
I am always curious how to publish a book,btohqsg
Maybe can teach me a few tricks...want to have a book for internal use,btohqsg
i wrote 9823948372942 horrible books as a child,btohqsg
and i thought maybe i could publish,btohqsg
i didnt. because it was crap,btohqsg
the closest ive gotten to publishing a book was when they put my crap essay on the newspaper,btohqsg
share with you via pm liao,btohqsg
Actual publishing takes a lot of steps.Authoring it is the 2nd step.,btohqsg
after authoring  need typeset  edit  book cover design  then after that send to printer  then to distributor.,btohqsg
i always wanted to publish a book when i was younger,btohqsg
it's not impossible. Simple way is to do kindle publishing,btohqsg
sell a not is another story,btohqsg
for internal use just bind üòä much cheaper and easier,btohqsg
plus i dont think my writing would be interesting enough to read,btohqsg
let me take a picture of what I do on the internal part. Need to cover the logo first  else it becomes an ad üòÖ,btohqsg
or can make it into a ‚Äúbook‚Äù yourself,btohqsg
storybook wise i like classics and romance,btohqsg
2018 version. 2021 I brought home now don't have,btohqsg
machine price: $60Binder price: $0.20Time take for each copy: 3+ minutes,btohqsg
Machine can buy from ezbuy :p,btohqsg
That looks really tempting to have,btohqsg
Taken at an angle not to become an ad,btohqsg
These type are perfect binding. Send to professional printers to print,btohqsg
Generally the price is only low if you print >= 1000 copies,btohqsg
what other juicy information you all want?,btohqsg
Does this include jc1 n 2 notes too,btohqsg
My notes are much thicker  those will not be published.,btohqsg
How long did you take to compile the notes,btohqsg
10+ years of work  updating every year,btohqsg
Book feels pro....u know marketing gimmicks,btohqsg
Is it As ten year series or smth,btohqsg
It is a compilation of the different kinds of questions that appear in exams.I compiled based on types of questions  and not randomly chosen questions,btohqsg
so when you study  yes TYS is important  but is important for you to know what types of questions are being tested,btohqsg
eg you finished O level Physics. Within Kinematics alone  v-t graphs  I have 10 different kinds in my worksheet,btohqsg
there are at least 15 types  but some are too hard to solve using O level methods. So scrape it.,btohqsg
My secret is no cigarette üò≥,btohqsg
Hi guysI have something to ask y'allMy friend wants to go to NUS  so she's actually writing out her Personal Statement nowFrom the information about Personal Statement that my friend sent to me  the maximum number of characters is 2 000. However  she got 3000+ characters. So  do y'all think it's still acceptable?,btohqsg
guys do you think Low 70 rank points is good or bad? what options do I have?,btohqsg
HmmThen what should she actually have to include in her Personal Statement?She studied Environmental Science in poly  and she is planning to study about the same course in NUS as she wants to save the environmentShe had included her internship  the modules that she had studied on the environmental issues  FYP  use of transportation  laboratory work  and some talks about environmental issues as well in her Personal Statement,btohqsg
Not alot  ur in the same boat as me i guess,btohqsg
I predict like I‚Äôll get somewhere around 72.5 73.75,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking of going for business school,btohqsg
or if not NUS FASS not sure if it‚Äôs possible,btohqsg
they have the bonus points if I‚Äôm not wrong?,btohqsg
so unless u get 74 + bonus 2(?) points  you're out of luck basically,btohqsg
yeah if I get 73.75 and after adding 2.5 bonus I‚Äôll reach 76.25,btohqsg
if not my choice will give me 75,btohqsg
that‚Äôs my prediction after my As now lmao,btohqsg
i mean NUS biz sch hopeless for low 70s anw,btohqsg
but not sure if like I‚Äôm one grade away whether can give a course a try and just apply,btohqsg
maybe like 2.5 or 3.75 rank points away from the 10th percentile,btohqsg
just make sure your portfolio good lor,btohqsg
otherwise they got no reason to accept u,btohqsg
if u want biz  ntu biz your best choice lor  71.25,btohqsg
but not sure are there people who meet 10th percentile but get rejected,btohqsg
I hear rumours but dk if it‚Äôs true,btohqsg
got ppl who meet 10th percentile who get rejected  got ppl who never meet but aso get accepted,btohqsg
i never hit 10th percentile i still got in,btohqsg
your course requires portfolios interviews rite?,btohqsg
idts? but i got in through ABA which requires interview either way,btohqsg
can try ntu econs aso  it's 71.25,btohqsg
but if die die want biz  then ntu biz lor,btohqsg
if no portfolio  u have from now till march to brush it up,btohqsg
I‚Äôm more curious to find out about transfer applications after one semester.,btohqsg
that one idk liao i haven't matriculate lol,btohqsg
any admins or anyone here matriculate already hahaha?,btohqsg
but if u wanna change course  u need to do v well for first sem i think,btohqsg
and afaik  not a lot of ppl change major after they matriculate so might be abit hard to find ppl with such experiences,btohqsg
unless the majors are closely related then it‚Äôs possible rite?,btohqsg
Why tf does telegram have 9.5GB,btohqsg

If I work part time must my salary goes to my CPF,btohqsg
Worked out a-c. I‚Äôm not sure how to write SE and iE. SE: compare a and b while IE compare b and c,btohqsg
yes + the inclusive 10% (?? i cant rmbr the exact % alr) from employer iirc,btohqsg
ik alot of pt jobs like banquet that gives u cash instead though ü§®,btohqsg
so that evidently wont be inclusive of this,btohqsg
iF IM NOT WRONG THATS KINDA ILLEGAL THOUGH‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
see how much u earn lor,btohqsg
How much can u earn being a banquet server per night?,btohqsg
you see regular FnB salary then u √óabout 6h lor,btohqsg
CPF contribution rates for Jan 2016.pdf,btohqsg
Sorry ah i dun even know f&b is how much,btohqsg
I wonder how much my cpf now,btohqsg
I won't even invest in cpf,btohqsg
see how much u make in a month first la hahaha  cannot be one month work one day only,btohqsg
Cos banquet contracr need not be month,btohqsg
It can be ad hoc based agreement,btohqsg
Does the tutoring sector have cpf,btohqsg
private then no lor  unless u ownself contribute,btohqsg
Use my $$ invests in other things,btohqsg
huh u so old ah can withdraw alr,btohqsg
To me cpf is something u wun even touch when u are old,btohqsg
That one depends how many hours u work,btohqsg
old enough to invest in property to make young couples' lives even more miserable/s,btohqsg
The one I work is at least $10/hr some 11 12 even cos approaching eoy,btohqsg
Sorry but i dun trust my govt to the extent of thinking i will easily get my cpf money back,btohqsg
Ya holiday season usually higehr pay for contract workers,btohqsg
pub hols usually double pay I think,btohqsg
Use cpf go invest in other things which u can turn and take it back as cash,btohqsg
I rmb i had a week lomg of 20/hr,btohqsg
uwu can become CPF Consultant instead?,btohqsg
As in there are conditions to get back ur cpf $$,btohqsg
Not so easy as go to bank and withdraw,btohqsg
Even if u buy a property and sell...u think u get full sum?,btohqsg
Whatever u used from cpf u got to top it back,btohqsg
idt most of us will have so much time or are even old enough to deal with the puny amount of money in CPF,btohqsg
Remaining then u take as cash,btohqsg
So if u are working part time....unless u earn alot...tbh dun bother make a big fuss over cpf,btohqsg
Cos they pay u your cpf...u lose ur job,btohqsg
The cpf is oni a way for the govt to get more funds for investment,btohqsg
just treat cpf as another tax,btohqsg
I wun say cpf is bad,btohqsg
But dun need to be overly possessed by it,btohqsg
says the one who's obsessed with using CPF money to make more money,btohqsg
As to make a fuss abt got pay me cpf or not,btohqsg
And i rather take cash than to put $$ in,btohqsg
I mean it's not like we have a choice lol. some of us just want to make sure our place of work didn't fuck us over by underpaying us be it in cash or in CPF,btohqsg
Ya...depending on nature of part time job,btohqsg
I think if most people had a choice we'd rather take cash but since we don't we might as well make sure we get paid in CPF properly,btohqsg
Be glad now u get to serve banquet,btohqsg
everywhere labour shortage  idt there's an oversupply of manpower anywhere,btohqsg
I'm sorry la maybe your industry got too many tuition teachers digging for gold,btohqsg
but fnb got shortage of workers,btohqsg
all my friends who work FnB got not enough manpower,btohqsg
Best is put into parents CPF cuz old enough to take out anytime üò¨,btohqsg
last time I work banquet alr not enough  now confirm aso not enough,btohqsg
yea u see all the wedding receptions,btohqsg
If we fight too hard for cpf for these part time jobs,btohqsg
Soon the foreign labour force will be back,btohqsg
there are probably many who join tuition industry because lost job.,btohqsg
Yup...not all sectors are shortage...some are surplus,btohqsg
so u rather companies not pay CPF even if they're supposed to?,btohqsg
Damn he advocating for companies to break the law,btohqsg
well clearly you two are doing well enough to be chilling in a student's chat,btohqsg
I tot this chat is anything under the sun?,btohqsg
Why need to bring in the tuition aspect because we differ in views abt cpf,btohqsg
It can even be a discussion topic under GP,btohqsg
üò¨ Enough to buy milk powder.,btohqsg
is not I mention tuition one hor,btohqsg
I always admire those who earn pocket money on their own,btohqsg
Just to share the realities of work life,btohqsg
Lots of time to compound growth,btohqsg
My fren 15 also got cpf,btohqsg
CPF is good in that sense.But should not be the only source for retirement,btohqsg
But i feel it‚Äôs quite unfair for 15 year old,btohqsg
What 15 year old think about retirement??,btohqsg
Long term vs short term perspective,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for long term also,btohqsg
I mean 15 year old me aso don't want CPF la,btohqsg
When I need the money now,btohqsg
aiya SS cher will alw be PC,btohqsg
And the money can help me a lot in the future,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs not good for like broke but like,btohqsg
The money cpf can be used in the future what,btohqsg
when young  work for experience and learn,btohqsg
I mean I get it la  u imagine your bank account got $5 your CPF got $50 and u need to buy groceries,btohqsg
But which 15 year old would work for fun,btohqsg
u got not enough money to survive tmr alr why care about long term,btohqsg
people work 4-5 low paying jobs but still have a fam of 4 to support,btohqsg
and don't tell me invest in yourself get an education,btohqsg
because some people don't have the luxury of that choice,btohqsg
as much as it sucks to be in this position,btohqsg
That's why start young when there's less commitment,btohqsg
you know how hard me and some of my peers work earlier?,btohqsg
Who understands what we oldies think,btohqsg
Change the world before getting married.After marriage you can't even change the TV channel.,btohqsg
is this some u strawberry generation don't work hard enough bullshit,btohqsg
not that anyone watches TV nowadays,btohqsg
Ask them find chance to study well also kena shoot down,btohqsg
