Eh anyone can reco good ballpoint pens?,btohqsg
Is the ink consistent? And is it hard to write with?,btohqsg
Cuz I prefer gel pens but I’m getting fed up with the ink smudging.,btohqsg
So I’m more used to the smooth kinds,btohqsg
ballpoint pens can try pilot acroball  pilot jetstream or muji polycarbonate pen ( very smooth ) 0.7,btohqsg
Coughs with looking at the prices in Google,btohqsg
pilot acroball is quite nice tho,btohqsg
I’m prob gonna get it and go broke,btohqsg
doesnt smudge at all  and is nice to hold,btohqsg
not too sure  should be around $1.90? can buy refils tho,btohqsg
but i find it really smooth,btohqsg
Being cheapskate doesn’t help. This not my normal handwriting. But I can’t write normally with pilot ballpoint pen,btohqsg
This is like my normal. Ok maybe unfair lah. Compare numbers and Eng with chinese,btohqsg
