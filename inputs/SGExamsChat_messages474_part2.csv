I chose poly over JC. No matter where you go you should be proud of it regardless.,btohqsg
That said  got pros and cons for each route you go  it's literally just pick your poison. Poly is additional 1 year  but don't forget you have internship and sometimes FYP. I mean real FYP  where if you're in a sci diploma  you legit enter the lab to get your data. Even for internships  people rather hire poly interns than fresh A level interns for lab coz at least the lab education is so much more rigorous for poly students.,btohqsg
It's commonly mentioned in uni sci that JC students are good at theory while poly students are good at lab  and this has been the comment for years.,btohqsg
As long as you know wtf you want from either route and work hard towards it  it's fine. Or if your goals change halfway  that's fine also coz honestly even 30+ yo are doing mid career switch depending on their circumstances. As long as you are clear on what to achieve each time instead of following the crowd  you're on the right track.,btohqsg

This is how catastrophic a fire from a hdb unit can be,btohqsg
I think insurance covers this right,btohqsg
this fire burned for nearly 2 days,btohqsg
you cant even tell which floor caught fire first,btohqsg
how tf did this happen ðŸ’€,btohqsg
some exploded a bomb or what,btohqsg
It started with a 4th floor unit that caught on fire,btohqsg
The fire spreaded to the top floor of the building within 10 mins of the fire starting on the 4th floor,btohqsg
The biggest reason why the fire manage to engulf to its magnitude was because the fire suppression system in the building was not working,btohqsg
oh wait this happened in uk i thought it happened in sg,btohqsg
its a showcase of how bad a apartment fire can get,btohqsg
idk like i chose jc route because ik i wanted to do sosci/lit,btohqsg
its not like poly provides a dip in literature right lmao,btohqsg
but i wld understand if ppl who like wanna do engineering or smth pursue the dip route cuz i see it that those fields require much more hands on know hows than hardcore thinking thinking,btohqsg
alot of poly kids ik study dip alr,btohqsg
then they dont bother pursuing degree,btohqsg
