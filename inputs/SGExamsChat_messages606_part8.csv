lc 10% only dont worry too much,btohqsg
then like i took my own sweet time to write the starting stuff,btohqsg
then the main plot i compress in the end cuz,btohqsg
It really varies from person to person,btohqsg
Different ppl have diff strengths and qualities,btohqsg
but i eae must pass englishðŸ˜¥,btohqsg
Eh does your sch set v hard papers to begin with,btohqsg
idk fr other subj cuz i nv compare,btohqsg
ok la i say my own exp. my sec sch actually near your one. sst el papers also pretty hard. Hard until entire cohort only handful of A2s and no A1s. I prelim C6 jump to B3 for O level,btohqsg
the listening they gave everyone close to full marks cuz,btohqsg
Oh it's time management then  I mean you can practice the same type of qns that you'd normally choose to write for compo ah,btohqsg
Then you focus mainly on that,btohqsg
cuz like i normal write uh,btohqsg
but then my tcher say i shld write situational,btohqsg
Wait wym are u talking abt SW or like essay,btohqsg
so i basically only wrote situational once for the past four years before gg in for olvl,btohqsg
that one fun to write  ok one,btohqsg
It must be realistic and practical,btohqsg
ok what if like the main point never write alot,btohqsg
I focused on that and screwed other types of writing,btohqsg
but the infront bs write too much,btohqsg
got vocab and stuff will fail onot,btohqsg
Normally you have the intro   building block then climax   ending and conclusion,btohqsg
my building block too much i think,btohqsg
it took up like half the story,btohqsg
Ah so ig it's like too much suspense?,btohqsg
like i keep yapping and never get to the point,btohqsg
What I can advise is that I imagine a slope uk like this slope,btohqsg
So I visualize this in case my building block too much ðŸ¤¡  it's like getting to the top of the mountain(climax)  and when u reach it   you'd want to release like a sudden BANG/BURST of energy,btohqsg
yaa like ik how to write but,btohqsg
its cuz i got too much stuff to write but i write too slow so i needed to push everything to last few paragraphs,btohqsg
Yea I time myself and used that  goofy  method so I don't digress  I'd roughly figure out the flow I want my story to go/end,btohqsg
Imo I have to brainstorm/map cause I think of alot of impulsive shit,btohqsg
"That was the only way I improved my compo LOL squeezing and investing time into that then when I think I ok alr   I challange myself with diff and and write out ""actual quality"" compo then hand up to cher",btohqsg
I got lucky A2 for English,btohqsg
My cher say my essays all borderline A,btohqsg
i never got A for english ever,btohqsg
My English teacher was the discipline master,btohqsg
Same  I studied in Fernvale Primary School and graduated in 2018.,btohqsg
Gimme I only got b3 after 2 times retake,btohqsg
I think this year the Os eng syallubus changed,btohqsg
