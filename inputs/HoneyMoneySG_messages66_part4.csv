Hi all  i‚Äôve just got the UOB Evol credit card as my one and only daily use card  but I find myself often exceeding the $250 maximum of contactless spending eligible for cashback. (eg going out for dinner with a group and paying first would hit this easily) Which is the best second cashback credit card with no minimum spending that I can use on the months when I exceed the UOB Evol cap? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
UOB absolute is pretty decent  1.7%,btohqsg
One of the highest Cashback card I've seen  there a card at 2% but requires annual income of 100k,btohqsg
hsbc revolution  can redeem points for 2.5% cashback,btohqsg
Depends on how much you exceed? Maybe even DBS LF?,btohqsg
You can pair amaze with other mC card,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. Many people benefits from it. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code. Eg. 5812. It will give you a list of cards and shows you what is the rewards.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Anyone have experience using OCBC to pay bill with credit card?Like you use OCBC credit card to pay Amex/DCS card in the OCBC ibanking?,btohqsg
Wanna ask if they have some finance charges?,btohqsg
It is easier mathematically. Just use this formula (daily balance x 5.8%)/365). This will be your daily 5.8% return. Calculate for 30 days as you have different end day balance across 30days. You will get your 5.8% return for one month.,btohqsg
Ah  okey  so it‚Äôs not counted as cash advancement ?,btohqsg

You will fail the condition that you need to maintain the incremental balances throughout the promo,btohqsg

one  of several  major factors is whether you have/plan to have other UOB miles cards because the UNI$ pools,btohqsg
