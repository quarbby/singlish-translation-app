I am like a living room length to the rubbish chute  so convenient to dump rubbish don't have to walk so far  but then again  mine is a pointed block,btohqsg
My unit is also near the collection bin centre on the ground floor. So scared got smell that's why difficult to sell. That's what frens told me.,btohqsg
thought you were saying you are staying at an unit on the ground floor,btohqsg
My unit 3rd floor.Bin centre on ground floor circle in blue.2nd floor is garden.Is there a patio?,btohqsg
bto only got balcony no patio like old houses,btohqsg
OK leh  not as bad as you sounded,btohqsg

corner units have the most privacy,btohqsg
Just curious your bto it’s Corner unit ?,btohqsg

too hot to give it up,btohqsg

the grant must be used during down-payment right,btohqsg
can it be dragged till key collections?,btohqsg
Yup only during first payment.if there are leftover it will be use to offset ur loan amount,btohqsg
Nop must during downpayment unless is those key available units,btohqsg
say the grant is $60k  down-payment is $50k and the house is $410k  so the remaining $10k will be used to offset the housing price  becomes $400k?,btohqsg
That's what is happening to me.,btohqsg
My down payment is 20k but my grant is 35k,btohqsg
Grant can also be used to pay for stamp duty,btohqsg
so the remaining $15k can be inside your OA till your house TOP?,btohqsg
Not can be. Is will be,btohqsg
Yup but u cannot touch it,btohqsg
Once u receive the grant  u will see a huge amount  and the category is called HDB Grant or smth,btohqsg
So that portion u cannot touch,btohqsg
But many many years ago according to my friend   there wasn't any segregation.,btohqsg
So my friend got 50k grant  she immediately went to do cpf investment,btohqsg
They changed the system cos ppl misused it,btohqsg
I dono if it's true but she say she manage to do that,btohqsg
Can collect keys in 3 mths,btohqsg
strike while the iron is hot,btohqsg
No  down payment  stamp duty  remaining flat price,btohqsg
Those repossessed units or can collect already,btohqsg
Not can be used for. These are what the grants are used for.,btohqsg
Grants can only be used to off set ur flat price,btohqsg
Think news say hdb ask back grants from ppl,btohqsg
I can confirm I used it,btohqsg
I think is when u sell the flat before MOP,btohqsg
U need to return the grant  not to cpf,btohqsg
