i heard they are making an OLED version with better battery,btohqsg
by the time they make and we can get it  2 years would have passed,btohqsg
but these days i seem to pick up the ayaneo 2 more then the steamdeck,btohqsg
Thatd not my car leh. Since when we lhd,btohqsg
I saying u can use yr deck as gauges,btohqsg
anyway the 64gb can get for $599,btohqsg
Yup and ownself upgrade the ssd,btohqsg
yeah i installed a 512 for less then $80 and then add a 512 sd card for less then 80 also,btohqsg
the aya is the stronger unit  but depending on the control layout  some games the steamdeck is better,btohqsg
Aya is a full normal pc right?,btohqsg
at 599 its damn worth it,btohqsg
value for money hard to beat the sd  I had a specific need for the aya so went for it.  The sd i bought is just to play with mods,btohqsg
put 1tb ssd total abt 800,btohqsg
i got both units so my stuff spread out,btohqsg
its half the cost of the aya,btohqsg
Too scary to play dead space on my pc... Cos my speaker is surround sound,btohqsg
i mainly play forza on the aya for now,btohqsg
Ya cos limited to steam games out of the box,btohqsg
you could install windows  then purchase a dodgy license from shopee,btohqsg
So now considering a new phone or sd,btohqsg
that was my original plan  but no egpu support,btohqsg
Yup i know... But i prefer stock,btohqsg
i already have an egpu enclosure thats why i wanted the aya,btohqsg
