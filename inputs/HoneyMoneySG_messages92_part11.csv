if you have sufficient use it .. if not get your hubby to buy for the family .. He deserves the responsibiliy as head of family,btohqsg
Ok  was thinking how we can combine / transfer the miles from all acc to book as family. Thank you.,btohqsg
Try the 2 plater mode .. get a supp card from the main .. then all points will be consolidated and not end up orphan miles,btohqsg
don't stop at 2...do a household player mode..,btohqsg
Hii   if i transfer multiple shares with multiple quantity from ibkr combined worth 5000usd to webull  will it consider as single transfer?,btohqsg
Update: I have $500 overpaid in my singtel account. I tried to go to singtel kiosk to pay more using my Yuu Visa card. Unable to make payment cause nothing outstanding..,btohqsg
You can't even pay $10 more than your outstanding balance at the kiosk  let alone credit balance,btohqsg
Can I use yuu card to get rebates via singtel app? Or only applies to kiosk,btohqsg
how can you access 10 years old cpf data? I think they only provide 15 months,btohqsg
Don't think applicable to MySingTel app. It's meant to be for SingTel shop purchases only  not for bill payment one.,btohqsg
you need to explore the web and download diligently yearly üôà,btohqsg
yes  I did tried but can't find  even email to cpf  they say cannot  is that yearly statement?,btohqsg
Bro rate fluctuate. Everyday different. 3.77% is the average of the past 7 day,btohqsg
Chose the yearly statement of account can see up to past 10 years.,btohqsg
Yea is yearly statement. Yearly statement can download longer I think,btohqsg
Yes  considered one transfer per submission,btohqsg
I mean for my kid cpf,btohqsg
i recall seeing it udner parents  either mum/dad  can see few months only not years. Then once they 21 years old  they can view themselves,btohqsg
After you top up their cpf account; you can see the amount reflected in their dashboard immediately. Amazing function with PayNow,btohqsg
yes  but can't see the years before,btohqsg
I tried to note all transactions for my kid  since no yearly statement,btohqsg
21 years old still very long haha,btohqsg
consider use miles from husband's account for one trip  wife's for another,btohqsg
Anyone buying service apartment in JB as investment?,btohqsg
Wah; may i know how old the kid now? And what is your strategy/plan for him/her?Monthly top? To OA/SA/MAOr SAOr MA?How much sump and will continue until he grow 21?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  i am a newbie in investment... thinking to try doing rsp every month as I don't have lump sum capital to invest... May you share your experience on which stock to consider for rsp? Thank youüôè,btohqsg
Hi all  can help advice is banks selling unit trust profitable? They mention to do DCA? Ever experience people invested?,btohqsg
Usually buy from banks got quite high fees.,btohqsg
don't do it.If you want to buy unit trusts or do DCA  do not use bank or insurance platforms..use cheap platforms like POEMs or Fund Supermart,btohqsg
All units trusts are NOT guaranteed profitable. Buy at your own risks.,btohqsg
actually if you re read the question.. the answer is YESthe banks selling unit trust sure PROFITABLE... they earn commission whether unit trust UP or DOWN,btohqsg
Normally index etf. But you shld do your own research before buying anything.,btohqsg
Can i clarify that this rebate is for income tax for 2024  which is paid in 2025? Does it mean that its the 2025 tax that is reduced?,btohqsg
I have funds to invest however market now seems very high everywhere  any advice where can I park money too,btohqsg
I think it's income tax for 2024 for income earned in 2023,btohqsg
SC Save up level up $500 cashback is in for 1st batch,btohqsg
Sigh I January batch.. so i need to wait till 23rd April I guess,btohqsg
Any suggestion on current 6 mths t bill competitive bid yield to place?,btohqsg
For snack investments  if i were to make a full withdraw  will the amount goes to my designated bank account or back to my credit card?,btohqsg
Wow  so if i use my cashback cc to pay the investment account  and withdraw the full amount  i can make 1.5%???,btohqsg
that's what people have been doing.But there are reports of big amounts being blocked by SnackAnd you are subject to investment risk since the price can move up or down.,btohqsg
I see..  thanks for the info,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  for the UOB earmark do they take the balance from 31dec2023?If I already deposit the fresh funds on Feb but have not sign up for the promo  will I still be eligible?,btohqsg
depends on your balance as at 31 dec,btohqsg
Thank you  for the fresh funds does it needs to be a lump sum of 100k or can I split it 30k 30k 40k?,btohqsg
i believe it can be split.. but for cleanless.. i always recommend ONE SHOT move in and put Earmark comment.,btohqsg
