Hi all  exam season is approaching and many of you may be struggling with subjects like physics or math. üò©Regardless of whether you are preparing for A/O/N levels  If you have homework  content  or any other questions while preparing for your exams  head over to my channel:‚Ä¢https://t.me/thephysicspage(Main channel)‚Ä¢https://t.me/thephysicsdiscussions1(Physics discussions group)The reason I created this page is to provide free help to students struggling to understand physics concepts! I also wanted to post puzzles which I found interesting so that hopefully you will start to see the fun side to physics :D Most importantly  I wanted to help students who are struggling to have someone to discuss their doubts or confusion with! (something i learnt during my time studying: no question is too dumb to be asked)For those who are not taking physics  I also share useful study and revision tips in the channel so there will be something for you guys too!Just some background: I studied PCME when I was in JC and took H3 in game theory and so if you have any education related questions (e.g.  how to study for certain subjects or wanting to find out more about the subject etc.) I will really hope to be able help you out! You can drop me a DM on telegram or instagram and I will get back to you üôåüèª,btohqsg
I rmb catching hmfd during the week I had 3 prelim papers,btohqsg
Whole week mc‚Ä¶.count not take my English or Chinese paper,btohqsg
18 years is crazy‚Ä¶as a rp lecturer,btohqsg
uhh i don't remember this happening,btohqsg
i completely don‚Äôt understand what that means but ok üòÉ,btohqsg
so this was the useless incident 777 that never disappeared even after a whole day,btohqsg
do u think u can push it up,btohqsg
and how r ur other subjects,btohqsg
Weird ass boy says hi to every strangers on the bus and clearly made students uncomfortable,btohqsg
When I didn't reply back he quickly flipped the bird lmao,btohqsg
Yea best is just ignore these ppl,btohqsg
He clearly doesn't know social behaviours,btohqsg
Him flipping me off shocked me,btohqsg
Wait until you encounter the people that die die don‚Äôt want to move infront of a mrt door,btohqsg
And you need to physically push them out just to get out yourself,btohqsg
i really want to go jc,btohqsg
and i only have 6 subj,btohqsg
I have a non-Chinese friend got a2,btohqsg
If it was the other one  guy who have been arrested,btohqsg
About a C/D kind of grade to A is possible in 2 months,btohqsg
but actually what happened to lead to that question? I didn't read up,btohqsg
too busy recently  finally some room to rest,btohqsg
I read so much and only A2 last time.,btohqsg
is really study till vomit kind to get,btohqsg
First thing  why do you really want to go JC?The subjects are going to be much tougher than what you are currently taking.To me  the underlying criteria to do decently well in JC is an A1 or A2 for Additional Maths.Without that  H2 Maths is going to be a big struggle at least for the first year.,btohqsg
even if go sci/eng in poly taking amath is better,btohqsg
so if score A2 for Maths and B4 for Chinese that's still a 15 points for remaining 4 subjects.Need B3 B3 B4 B4Only then you can qualify for JC.,btohqsg
SG curriculum is so heavy in maths,btohqsg
all the ppl ik who could have taken amath but didnt all regret it,btohqsg
my school distinction for chinese is 33.7% so there‚Äôs a chance that if i get A1 for all subj  i can get into ejc,btohqsg
I don't teach Chinese  I can't comment also,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a chance but it‚Äôs not confirm,btohqsg
YIJC must come let me teach first üòÇSo far my rate is much higher than the school,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why honestly better just do it once then no need worry about it again ah,btohqsg
You can get A1 for the remamining subjects?Or at least A2?,btohqsg
also if cannot cope ino lvls  jc  is a whole other hell,btohqsg
will we be going uni same year,btohqsg
idw to go back to teepee,btohqsg
I have experience rescuing fish. If they die I do feel really bad and sometimes take it personally,btohqsg
and idk I mean like animals it‚Äôs different from humans,btohqsg
I mean we can just go see them to skip sch and not actl be sick,btohqsg
but animals it‚Äôs like they are really really sick when they go doctor,btohqsg
so if I can‚Äôt save em I prob will just get depressed and then eh lose my passion or smth,btohqsg
i scored b3 minimum for the rest of the subj,btohqsg
You can qualify for JC  but I do need to mentally prep you that the amount of work you need to do in JC to do well is at least 5 times of what you are doing now for O levels,btohqsg
for next year JC students  the strategy is quite different  so you really only need to focus well on 3 H2 content subjects and ignore the H1 content.,btohqsg
