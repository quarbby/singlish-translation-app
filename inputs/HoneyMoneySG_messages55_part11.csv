hi if I just started working what is a good credit card to recommend?,btohqsg
UOB One account + UOB lady or UOB One card,btohqsg
go with Citi Rewards Card paired with Instarem Amaze  it gives 4 mpd on almost every category except for travel,btohqsg
with this as the main card  u can start adding side cards to complement your spending style  eg:- you travel alot? add UOB Lady's card for 6mpd for travel category- you take public transport? add Standard Chartered smart card for 6% cashback- you spend more than $1k on online spend? add DBS Woman's World Card for 4 mpd for onlin spend,btohqsg
Hi  if I’m need to clock uob one interest? I will use uob one / evol / lady?,btohqsg
UOB EVOL is better  cos u can hit $600 spend on every categoryUOB One also $600  but need to hit for 3 consecutive monthsUOB Lady is only on 1 category  might be harder to hit,btohqsg
For OCBC card spending  I log in to OCBC IB  and my credit limit x800  combined credit left x687.33  what you have spent = 112.67. But if I manually sum my cards spent  it is 299.44  any idea why the system tells me only spend 112.67? I want to make sure I spend enough for OCBC 360 for extra bonus interest  Does anyone notice this? I spend only on Shopee  Lazada  Giant  Cab  XNAP  Seafood restaurant  Mr. Coconut this month,btohqsg

Please contact the bank for clarification as we do not have access to information regarding the reasons for your ineligibility.,btohqsg
For this  can we add up both UOB one and UOB lady card spending to clock for the $500 spend for higher interest for UOB one account? Or must clock on only 1 card?,btohqsg
I can’t provide link so I provide screenshot instead.Syfe anniversary promo.Fee waiver only for fresh funds. Existing funds won’t enjoy fee waiver.Verified with Syfe le.,btohqsg
this is the general consensus I have gathered so far,btohqsg
I don't know much about this  but will look into it or if anyone has more info regarding this please share thanks!,btohqsg
so uob one account as the main card isit?,btohqsg
so citi rewards + amaze or uob one which one should I pick? what should be the deciding factor?,btohqsg
can add both. but if using uob one card and not clocking min $500 in statement month u not getting any rebate,btohqsg

Any guru here know whether I can use Citi rewards card for PropertyGuru account subscription? Paying by installment monthly  does it clock the 4mpd with Citi rewards?,btohqsg
I think i need to work on the first part  thanks for the advice!,btohqsg
UOB One account will give you 3.85% interest if you spend $500 a month and credit your salary into the account. You can get the account first and spend on the debit card to get the bonus interest before you decide which credit card is more suitable for you,btohqsg
Mile card only suitable for high spender and those who like to travel in biz class btw. If u just in workforce probably cashback,btohqsg
Yes  UOB has one of the best savings accounts. No harm getting a UOB DEBIT card first. Earn some interest as you track your spending.,btohqsg
Actually how high would you consider enough? I dont mind save up 2-3 years miles for a business flight. And travel is more fun if you have friends or spouse to travel with.,btohqsg
