Tomorrow short don’t key in wrongly again ya,btohqsg
Yea good point there. Human nature  many like to wait for the sentiments to change and buy when market is green.,btohqsg
That is so silly! In an active market  if every client watsapp him for orders....how can he keep up with reading msgs  keying in orders  reading the market and advising clients???!!!!,btohqsg
Best is to do your own trade . Cannot depend on no one.,btohqsg
This morning drop below 0.29 all the weak holder all panics and sell ..,btohqsg
I used to do a lot of naked short back in CB time and some counters was restricted. Got screwed up as I called to buy back and take profit but could not get anyone. By the time get through  was losses already. Since then   wont dabble in restricted counters.,btohqsg
Vp many forget yesterday agony already,btohqsg
excuse the naivety  brokers advise people in addition to processing orders? I've only ever used online platforms,btohqsg
good luck  we need all the leaders to rise for sentiments to flow to smaller counters.,btohqsg
There are some broking firms restrict MT so they need to ask broker to assist buying,btohqsg
BB no jump ship we dont jump ship,btohqsg
"Ya.... me too.... very sien to call broker. Then when you call to buy their R-rated stock  then the comment usually is  ""huh? Speculative leh....still want to buy?""",btohqsg
Agree ... actually wattsapp not safe.,btohqsg
understand  I thought someone was saying they take trading advice from their broker,btohqsg
yea  thats why nowadays wont trade restricted counters. too troublesome,btohqsg
Maybe yes if their relationship is good. I do my own buy and sell. Never talk to broker,btohqsg
Cannot leh last time 1 of my broker will scold me if I buy speculative stocks,btohqsg
I will call in to buy . But those counters that must call in to buy and sell I will avoid,btohqsg
Wah 118 also fomo bro zane,btohqsg
Today busy  no time monitor don't Dare buy worry drop.,btohqsg
I realise people like to chase,btohqsg
Ya... then I am like...whose money I play huh?,btohqsg
I like to add last min if strong close,btohqsg
Now I use another broker I usually do online trade unless need opinion then call.and ask broker,btohqsg
Best is bb. Buy pump sell buy pump sell. Down make. Up also make,btohqsg
Chasing with a TP and SL in mind is ok,btohqsg
Chasing and not knowing when to SL is no good,btohqsg
Then questions will come outShould I hold?How ah?This company good or not?,btohqsg
Ya even not chasing TP SL is impt too,btohqsg
If not u baghold the stock for a long long time,btohqsg
Majority of people like to do it,btohqsg
Losses are not realised until you sell ma,btohqsg
Kinda happy cover back abit of losses in MT,btohqsg

Anyone has got the meeting minutes of the AGM at Taiwan today?,btohqsg
Tmr TG up? Now laggard among medicals,btohqsg
TG already up so much. Give riverstone a comeback chance,btohqsg
Hope for special dividend or bonus issue will be👍,btohqsg
I become naysayer to discourage you,btohqsg
Ok la I just trolling around,btohqsg
His vision is vicplas n medtec. Since vicplas result out this friday  he will support vicplas > medtec bah,btohqsg
They will do rotational play if medicals stocks are in play again,btohqsg
today got hit 450 meh... chill heegul,btohqsg
It was not even a bet.Heegul said if hit 45 he give 200.If never hit he give 10,btohqsg

When need to take out money sure different le,btohqsg
okik tomorrow sure get 45 one,btohqsg
Tmr got 128 I happy to sell liao haha,btohqsg
Don be surprised VP result out is good .. but share price down ..same as TG,btohqsg
today up so high .. price might factors in for this Friday coming result,btohqsg
if result no good then beter run for cover,btohqsg
I think bro furion had shared enough on VP le,btohqsg
I bought 118 hope can cover abt,btohqsg
Yes .. if happen to result so so only .. better run for life,btohqsg
Ya sell before results to play safe,btohqsg
drop will be more than rise today for sure,btohqsg
Yes .. I also think so .. sell before result ..,btohqsg
sentiments back. Results good can run more,btohqsg
Cos today VP up more than 40 percent,btohqsg
US corrections seems to be over soon.,btohqsg
but quite surprised last nite everyone is pessimistic,btohqsg
Bull Market for medical is back!! Huat ah!!!,btohqsg
Stock prices are low now. Lots of upside fortraders to play,btohqsg
so dow down good for med confirmed ?,btohqsg
Cause BB cant play blue chips must turn to medical when dow bad,btohqsg
You need bro furion to come target you again ah haha,btohqsg
Nah. U forgot to factor in the drop of vicplas from 60 cents to 30 cents too.Which medtec experienced from 90 cents to 50 cents then back to 90 cents before result announced.After result MT closed 1.4x or 1.5x,btohqsg
actually i am. wanted to short vp but luckily didnt do it,btohqsg
Hopefully next month shoot to 2x,btohqsg
Yesterday I was just hearing MT go back to 0.9 0.8,btohqsg
Everyone please hold your balls tight,btohqsg
Today I hear 2 dollars Liao,btohqsg
R.I.P broski.... actualized loss or paper loss?,btohqsg
U mean medtec? Unlikely. Maybe Nov. Cuz result release in mid Nov,btohqsg
Tomorrow maybe can try your luck to short VP 😂,btohqsg
What other medical companies good to buy now,btohqsg
maybe friday if results no good,btohqsg
They releasing Q3 result mid oct,btohqsg
Dont be so pumped up leh,btohqsg
These are sentiments. Retailers all high liao.  Easy to goreng stocks to high price,btohqsg
Huh medtec q2 result announced in mid Aug right? If u +3 also mid Nov,btohqsg
Is the mkt shifting back to gloves and medical? Or is this just some 200iq bb trap,btohqsg
No leh I heard its oct,btohqsg
Soon. We will hear $3.88 $4.88 8.88,btohqsg
"That one not result lah. Dont anyhow say. They only releasing some ""good"" info",btohqsg
why nobody goreng sta today ah,btohqsg
By then hair all drop alr,btohqsg
Someone sent this a few days back^,btohqsg
dunno should moe half to my,btohqsg
It will slowly climb up. Maybe the price outlook will help to inch MT price upwards. But actual Q3 result is in mid Nov,btohqsg
Can advise whether medtecs isit staircase down chart?,btohqsg
Can expect MT climb back 1.5x - 1.8x  since Q3 their result shoukd be good.,btohqsg
For you to say this means yesterday you loaded a lot?,btohqsg
445 i already considered as hit his prediction,btohqsg
This TG release good results still drop,btohqsg
So the same for MT also???,btohqsg
Because everyone expecting good result already mah,btohqsg
When a secret is open it's no longer a secret,btohqsg
You all think only we know TG results will be good ah,btohqsg
I just base on MT high price,btohqsg
VP holders better take profit before Fri too,btohqsg
vicplas 5mon w5w5 85 tgt 475 up 61.8% of 135- px hit high 445- watch baseline 415 cannot breakadd fib level 78.6/88.6/100watch the level as px moveand cannot be greedy,btohqsg
Share price up too much before results,btohqsg
wa vp will continue up tomrw,btohqsg
TG sux la. Go did a share split spoil everything. Old ppl loaded with cash see price drop from 9 dollar to 3 dollar sure scared out,btohqsg
I don't think anyone expect MT to have 100x profits,btohqsg
You know what time result cOme out?,btohqsg
If yes all buy big big Liao,btohqsg
How come they never announce on sgx,btohqsg
This one even BB caught out I feel,btohqsg
How much is too much.MT from 3 cents to 90 cents before result announced not too much meh?Even though got 100x profit but still from 3 cents to 90 cents is a lot leh. Why keep climbing after result announced,btohqsg
100x profit is a lot leh,btohqsg
But whether it can substain anot is a key issue,btohqsg
Need to see the rise just before results,btohqsg
You ask VP announce a 100x profits loh,btohqsg
Like TG $2 to $3 1 week before results is considered alot,btohqsg
MT after results come out  there was a huge ass gap lol,btohqsg
Please la. Their coy is small lor... 100x is easily achievable. TG/RS/UG previously already earning,btohqsg
VP today also up 40 over %  is alot alr,btohqsg
Rmb HP one day up 50% next day gone,btohqsg
+ when they first announced result. Which should be their Q1? Did their share price drop after result announce? No what,btohqsg
We are hindsight talk now leh,btohqsg
So now is VP first result announcement. Why u think it will drop after announced. If base on resulr announcement it will rise since its the first result announced,btohqsg
Whereas MT 2nd result annouce will drop,btohqsg
So like that I think mid Nov MT will drop aftee result announced lor,btohqsg
It's ok to think that way what,btohqsg
VP results very high risk i feel,btohqsg
Those who vested in MT better be warned. U won't see $2 if accordingly to G.E.M and Zane ways of interpreting how TG share price had dropped after their recent result announcement.,btohqsg
VP results isnt guaranteed to be exceptional unlike MT TG,btohqsg
Bro zane don't need argue with him lw,btohqsg
VP up so much today  no reason will still up tomorrow,btohqsg
BBs just leveraging on retailers hopes,btohqsg
hahaha vp on danger then tmr,btohqsg
When TG sell down from 3 to 2 everyone scared,btohqsg
But I know many ppl stuck in 60 70 series,btohqsg
Think results might not be good etc,btohqsg
Then the marquie report came out in tandem,btohqsg
BBs very evil one.. when they release report tell u sell means they want buy from u cheap,btohqsg
Pumped up on same day as results released,btohqsg
This one my horror story.. still rmb,btohqsg
I never take profit then become loss,btohqsg
No one knows. Did MT release rumors they have 100x profit for the price to climb 3 cents to 90 cents?,btohqsg
100x propel it's share price from 1 to 198,btohqsg
Vicplas only 60 cents. And it didn't start so low from 3 cents,btohqsg
I mean VP isnt a pure medical business & no one can actually predict how well Forefront does,btohqsg
So imo vp results is a gamble,btohqsg
Ryan vested in VP is it,btohqsg
Not like TG everyone knows is either 1bn profits or it's not,btohqsg
Of cuz we wont know how high vicplas can go up to. But neither will it definitely drop aftwe result announced,btohqsg
VP results out this friday or 29 sep?,btohqsg
results out alrdy it hover at 90+ for some time,btohqsg
Dyodd la I just being cautious,btohqsg
Actually  no. Lol. I'm not vested in VP  MT or TG,btohqsg
But if u hold and win big good for u,btohqsg
Lol then you should read bro furion take on VP,btohqsg
I just don't like how u tried to sold big on MT but beat on VP,btohqsg
U should go read wolverine posts on vicplas then,btohqsg
The price action already said so,btohqsg
In the chat what over the weekends,btohqsg
Price beat MT from 1.9x to 9x cents lor,btohqsg
I never once mentioned MT should be 2 dollars wor,btohqsg
But same like vicplas what. 60 cents to 30 cents. At least vicplas climb back 4p cents today.,btohqsg
Lim cheong guan sold not tan sri lwc,btohqsg
Hope all VP holders huat after result announced!,btohqsg
I just don't like the false optimism created here,btohqsg
Its VP time now not MT time!!,btohqsg
But still suspicious director sold shares,btohqsg
Wait I did buy TG 2.7,btohqsg
Agree cause VP results out soon  but rmb to set a SL as always,btohqsg
Gem u still holding ur TG right,btohqsg
Up you chase down u sell. How to win like that?,btohqsg
Up u sell down u buy ma,btohqsg
U no more TG shares ah,btohqsg
I smart alec loh got profit Mai take,btohqsg
That day all shoot me say I one pip trader,btohqsg
This was me lol  bought 2.55 never take then added 2.85 2.90,btohqsg
2.55 i just let it run if the EW ok,btohqsg
And I don't like to sell when it's being sold down,btohqsg
Aspen phrase 1 production raise from 1.1 billion glove 1.5 billion now!!!,btohqsg
Same  but I learnt alot lessons from TG this time,btohqsg
Latest Aspen news! Aspen chiong Ahhh.. big HUAT!!,btohqsg
Anyway VP holders can see what Bro furion shared over the weekends,btohqsg
I don't like to hindsight talk up then good loh.,btohqsg
Good for people that buy low,btohqsg
Yes it’s ok  they did share buyback again today  rm 18 million,btohqsg
So tg wont buy anything abv rm8,btohqsg
TG not really affected by the recent sell down,btohqsg
MT from 1.6 to 0.9+VP from 0.6 to 0.3Aspen from 0.2+ to 0.1+,btohqsg
Hope tomorrow another upward trend. Cannot be one hit wonder only,btohqsg
Look at PE ratio and eps guys  don’t follow the herd,btohqsg
Shares supposed to make you side income  not supposed to make you panic every minute,btohqsg
Pls buy the companies with strong fundamentals,btohqsg
It's not easy if you buy MT at 1.6 and see it drop to 0.9,btohqsg
But it’s a stock that worth $2 at least,btohqsg
It’s obviously manipulated by the bbs,btohqsg
And bbs are in this chat la,btohqsg
So trust yourself  don’t anyhow lose your hard earned money,btohqsg
Even if we know its manipulation it's not easy sometimes,btohqsg
Just my 2 cents worth la,btohqsg
The share doesnt know how much you bought,btohqsg
You buy 1 lot or 100 lots,btohqsg
It will still behave in the same manner,btohqsg
TP whatever is comfortable to you. Everyone’s TP is different  don’t need to chase 2.88  3.88 or whatever.Realized profits are better than paper numbers,btohqsg
It's human nature to buy  when high and sell when low,btohqsg
To you 100 lots may be a lot  but to funds might be very little haha,btohqsg
