Honda makes everything. Engine to chassis to body. All,btohqsg
When is the next carplate bidding?,btohqsg
Anyone knows roughly 245/45/R18 tyre price,btohqsg
Wah  swee.. I saw like all above 200 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
Depending on which tyre you go for,btohqsg
For the carousell listings  the prices are usually generalized not specific to size,btohqsg
Can try this shop  have used them before  very reliable,btohqsg
Another way to check on sgcarmart between vendors but for offers and current price based on supply  best to call them,btohqsg
But dun do wheel alignment there. Waste money.,btohqsg
They do for free if you buy tires,btohqsg
aiya i think if they provide free then do free lor,btohqsg
if not got cheaper ones but must make sure they do properly,btohqsg
i see drivers drive straight w their steering wheel at 90° then ask me whats wrong,btohqsg
Must make sure that it's done properly,btohqsg
Not sure  never had so big tyre before. Now is p zero and drive feels okay  so something similar,btohqsg
u can go for PS4 SUV alternatively for a similar feel to P Zero,btohqsg
can try PS4 or Bridgestone Potenza Sport or F1A5 or the Continental smtg dmtg,btohqsg
all v ex la if u ask me,btohqsg
cos this guys are performance tyres,btohqsg
My friend currently running on PS4 on XF,btohqsg
alot of people say no but i feel that there is a slight drone,btohqsg
PS4 nevertheless is still a great tyre,btohqsg
if you want comfort dont go for bridgestone LOL,btohqsg
their tyre wall are notoriously stiff so the car will not be quiet and it will be very bumpy,btohqsg
P zero feels okay to me  quiet and grippy,btohqsg
PS4 quite good  if you want all season and a bit cheaper can try primacy 4  my personal experience quite good with them on saloon as well,btohqsg
Ya I had primacy 4 before  good,btohqsg
I heard alot of ppl complain P zero harden v fast and wet grip not so good,btohqsg
bro i think your tyre abit fierce ah,btohqsg
Even Huracan STO uses potenza sport,btohqsg
Giti tyre Singapore brand . Support local 😂👍,btohqsg
wet grip is v good which is a huge + for me,btohqsg
wah damn i never hear this brand before haha,btohqsg
my car used re004s then now on pilot super sports,btohqsg
The wet grip decent but yeah it does harden quicker,btohqsg
Yes my customers love them but really I find they don’t last on my rickshaw too,btohqsg
Are there any W124 300E Hammers in Singapore?,btohqsg
Old brand. They may have made a new Brand called Giti,btohqsg

Is twin scroll turbo better than a normal turbo,btohqsg
Supposed to be more efficient in that the pulses from each cylinder don't interfere with each other,btohqsg
the real question is single twin scroll or twin mono scroll better,btohqsg
This one depends on the size of the turbo(s),btohqsg
Depends on layout etc. twinscrolls generally geared towards reducing turbo lags but are more complex with more moving parts. Better go twin charge (turbo+supercharger) 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Better yet; let’s go twin scroll twin turbo,btohqsg

Hi guys. Looking for recommendations for sound proofing against road noise. I drive a W204 (2011) and recently noticed that the road noise has been been louder than previous.,btohqsg
Try to fix the windows robbers,btohqsg
10th gen and beyond are great cars  we can’t take that away,btohqsg
As it should be sir 😁,btohqsg
Depends. On what one is after,btohqsg
Check condition  clean and lube rubber door seals  tyre selection plays a part too.,btohqsg
But I feel like 8th gen is the last shitbox series of the civics,btohqsg
Good suggestion. At least they don’t run off with the windows.,btohqsg
By shitbox do you mean raw  analogue driving focussed experience?,btohqsg
How is your weekend going so far Pak Imran?,btohqsg
Why some lithium will catch fire 🔥,btohqsg
Oh lol I think you misunderstood me.I am looking for good wet performance with reasonable tyre noise and rolling resistance.It is just me  my instincts and my footwork when it comes to handling and braking when road is wet.There is no brake assist  ABS  or EBD.,btohqsg
Is your rear brakes drums or disc,btohqsg
Some beetles are all 4 drums. Mine have front disc brakes,btohqsg
But my disc brake is super miniature by today’s standard,btohqsg

https://fb.watch/et2604oZ8p/Wanted to get an opinion on this. Everyone seems divided on how roundabouts work.,btohqsg
So ignore the rules or teachings on 3 lane roundabouts  just focus on 2 lane rounadbouts.Can you exit from the inner lane or not?,btohqsg
Yes i've seen this and other infographics on facebook,btohqsg
if B is allowed to exit 12 o'clock  what if there is Car C  entering the roundabout from 9 o'clock and exiting 3 o'clock?,btohqsg
HAHA this is a very good question,btohqsg
u know how this can be solved,btohqsg
if everybody that wanted to turn signalled...,btohqsg
and checking blindspot when in sit B,btohqsg
Electric cars make up 9% of new cars sold in first half of yearhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/electric-cars-make-up-9-of-new-cars-sold-in-first-half-of-year,btohqsg
keep to lane A only if you are turninf in the next exit,btohqsg
According to the picture  A takes outside lane and is allowed take 2nd exit.So Car C is also allowed to enter and take the outside lane from 9 o'clock end exit 3 o'clock (2nd exit),btohqsg
Actually roundabouts are safer than controlled junction cos they forces drivers to slow down...but from experience I see not many drivers know how to maneuver in a roundabout...heck I even see some speeding in it *facepalm*,btohqsg
Even if signal  there is still accidents happening. If everyone exits from the outside lane then the chances are much lower,btohqsg
A pity that even Newton circus roundabout turned into controlled junction,btohqsg
Have to apply the basics lane switching...and also patience and give way to these motorists..but I guess in SG it's hard,btohqsg
Both in the wrong according to me,btohqsg
Just rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise,btohqsg
Singapore drivers  when see someone signals  it means the driver need to speed up before the car that signals cut into his lane,btohqsg
But yeah white more so than the taxi,btohqsg
Mr Road hogger! I went and looked at the Tesla model Y today,btohqsg
So u decided to buy model y and tesla share,btohqsg
Ok so in the video the white lexus is Car A  by law or by FTT  he supposed to exit by the 2nd exit.In this scenario  the taxi can argue that they both entered from same entrance so the lexus must exit and therefore he can exit from inner laneBy my question is not about who is wrong. My question is why can you exit from inner lane?,btohqsg
The taxi should've switched lane early and exit but lol I see this is how most drivers do,btohqsg
How come u think no good ?,btohqsg
I still prefer to get a GLB35 or xc60 for that price,btohqsg
YES THIS! why people dont follow this?? No second guessing  no confusion  no accidents.,btohqsg
But the quality has definitely improved with the model Y with regards to panel gaps,btohqsg
They just exit from inner lane and horn the leftie if the latter tries to stay in the round instead of exiting,btohqsg
singapore driving sch cant even teach properly honestly,btohqsg
A roundabout will always be faster than a traffic light,btohqsg
Interior still has some ways to go  still can press panels and hear rattles and cracking like those Mercedes c class panels,btohqsg
That's why roundabouts are supposed to be safer than controlled junction,btohqsg
Oh ok   ice car don’t left long liao,btohqsg
Keep seeing the comments  go back to driving school  do u even know the rules blah blah blah.These people are either not drivers or are sitting ducks  waiting for accidents to happen,btohqsg
The school follows the law. The law might not be the most efficient,btohqsg
real world situation drive at 40kmh one meh😂😂,btohqsg
Newton circus in the past always jam cos difficult to enter due to many vehicles doesn't slow down in the roundabout  doesn't give way  and some not confident to enter the roundabout,btohqsg
I applaud your effort to try to explain it and more.So B can exit 12 o'clock from inner lane. And C can exit 3 o'clock from outer lane.Then if bang  who's fault?,btohqsg
Got a simulation app or website in SG context to check the share of fault but forgot what it is,btohqsg
Then they shouldn't throw the law or rules up there if they knew anything about good driving,btohqsg
u talking abt the fb comments ah,btohqsg
most of them all eat shit nth btr to do one😂😂😂,btohqsg
That's cool  but it will be flawed cos it refers to the rules,btohqsg
Lol KWs..not surprised if most are not drivers,btohqsg
Ya seriously. i unfollowed sgrv for a long time. I had to take blood pressure mediciation for it.,btohqsg
Kidding but also not kidding lol.,btohqsg
all driver cfm road hog the right lane 10kmh below speed limit,btohqsg
Lol dun get yourself angry over these comments,btohqsg
"then ppl overtake on the left then ""WOI FASTER GET CAN FOOTAGE POST ONROAD.SG!!""",btohqsg
"By right C because in the highway code ""slow down when approaching a roundabout  and give way to traffic on your right.""",btohqsg
Hahaha sometimes just to get my heart pumping at the start of the day,btohqsg
idk u see ppl get injured and shit... when cyclist get into accidents and see ppl cheering even if they unfortunately pass away... still got ppl cheering,btohqsg
But again.. hard to say.. Maybe b never signal? *Shrug*,btohqsg
No  this cannot apply here. Give way to the right is to give way to those inside the roundabout  before u enter the roundbout.,btohqsg
If that applies  C must stop to let B exit? It will be mayhe.,btohqsg
Ah cos there's a ongoing flow and slowing down suddenly or brake would risk an accident,btohqsg
Yes  and its confusing. If im driving on the outer lane  i need to check whether car on my right is exiting or not  or which entrance he came in from  and make a calculated guess which exit he exiting,btohqsg
Yeah still roundabout need not have to be fast. In-fact suntec round about makes it worst cause there is even more tower pickup and drop off point turning in,btohqsg
Sg nt alot roundabout. Alot driver nt familiar on how to navigate one,btohqsg
Even this is not correct. In my opinion,btohqsg
Strangely enough  UK has tons of them and they do it quite well. Their highway code very detailed and really you have to give way to vehicles on your right one.In the end  cars  should give way to  vehicles on the right one even on round abouts.,btohqsg
Car C can go straight and bang B,btohqsg
Must give way  this is as good as a right turn,btohqsg
The whole important principle here is give way.,btohqsg
You must stop for cars joining the roundabout,btohqsg
Rather than the other way around,btohqsg
To put it simply  its organised chaos,btohqsg
Yes must give way  but before u enter roundabout,btohqsg
But i know what u mean  if C saw B coming  he should not enter and go straight,btohqsg
Or just close eyes and pray,btohqsg
roundabout is all about common sense... need to give way just give way...,btohqsg
Ok i have given it more indepth thought about this.For the 2 lane roundabout  A and B can exit at 12 o'clock because it is somewhat like a go straight lane. A must exit by 12 o'clock.And while C can enter from 9 o'clock and exit at 3 o'clock  there shouldn't be a point in time that he is beside B or collide with B  because C should wait for B to pass before entering or enter earlier before B approaches  which allows C to exit at 3 o'clock without any danger.Technically everyone one should be driving at the same low speed.Perhaps im not as good at driving as i thought i am. Now i got to eat my own words. Sorry for the long post!,btohqsg

Hiya guys has anyone used tourador tyres before haha been seeing alot of cars with the decal,btohqsg
What do u expect frm a 50-60$ tyre bro. If u use for short mileage just point a and b e everyday kind and change on regular interval i think ok lah.,btohqsg
If you value your life  dont use it.,btohqsg
Nowadays the weather is dogshit  rain a shit ton. This kinda tyres tend to aqua plane alot.,btohqsg
only use tourador if you wanna go gymkhana,btohqsg
I've seen a maserati and a mustang 2.3 with tourador tyres lol,btohqsg
that's a pretty savage way of sending your message across😳-R,btohqsg
Tyres are one of the most important things on your car. Would not recommend them. Might save you a quick buck but can cost you your life  wet grip very poor and grip in general sub par. Can be a major issue in the wet or emergency braking,btohqsg
sounds way better in an australian accent,btohqsg
But unfortunately  the blocked words on this chat won't allow you to use it,btohqsg
Must not be happy with life if we follow@Jingxunn's advice,btohqsg
aiya legit damn funny esp cos they rwd,btohqsg
spent too much paying loan for car everymonth. not much left for tyres...,btohqsg
What so bad about the tourandor tyre,btohqsg
I see a lot of ppl pasting the sticker and it does look nice,btohqsg
Your Tesla become mustang leaving car meet if you try,btohqsg
Yeah was just thinking whats the grip and all that  not tyre expert at all but seen quite a lot with them,btohqsg
Smart marketing. I think $10 off per tyre if u have the sticker. So that quite a lot of discount on a tyre that is already very affordable,btohqsg
Yeah  i mean i dont really speed or anything  so was thinking like dun rly need performance tyre like michelin/conti etc  but if tourador cant get a basic safe grip in most ppl experience then thats definitely a problem imo haha,btohqsg
Juz not many ppl it seems on mcf who speaking frm experience on tourador haha,btohqsg
Look for eco tyre. Tyres are the only thing that is btwn the car u and the road.Anything on the road  the grip of the tyre can help save ur car frm flying or skidding,btohqsg
Falken Ziex ZE310 ecorun (tried)Yokohama bluearth (yet to try)Bridgestone ecopia (current)All these are eco tyres,btohqsg
Thanks for the recommendation! Haha i was trying to look for a brand called eco tyres 😂,btohqsg
How was the falken and bridgestone so far in your opinion?,btohqsg
The marketing tactics and business strategy is great for sure,btohqsg
@Jingxunnhas used Bridgestones before and will be able to advise better,btohqsg
I personally prefer Michelins  PS4 and primacy 4,btohqsg
Although currently on p zero which are alright too,btohqsg
Falken grip actually quite good.. but damn noisy..Bridgestone so far slightly better  damn little rolling resistance  better fuel consumption  but the grip not so good during dry compared to wet roads,btohqsg
The bridgestone grip not so good during dry.. but wont like backside slide out or what during like those sharp turns into expressway rite haha,btohqsg
Always give way to vehicles coming from your right side,btohqsg
Rule #1. Know the rules but practise defensive driving in roundabouts.Rule A#2. Practise defensive driving in roundabouts. Give way where possible 😁,btohqsg
okay la tbf i only used bridgestine perf tyres before,btohqsg
RE71r  Re004  Potenza Sport and S007a. S007a is the kind of tyre that doesnt suit my driving style because when im pushing it tends to be abit unpredictable. The first i believe provide better feedback than any other tyres ive use like PS4 and PS4S mainly because bridgestone have a stup!dly stiff tyrewall. But it doesnt come with a downside of being noisier and more uncomfortable.,btohqsg
The dry and wet grip on the first 3 is also damn good haha  only downside is it wears pretty fast,btohqsg
My weekend was fun  met up with the honda boys and had a very nice dinner with my partner,btohqsg

He watch too much Valentino Rossi,btohqsg
I have a 2007 BMW 325i series3 N engine and the car won't start. All the inside lights  the radio  the headlights come on and are working except the car will not start battery in good shape  jump-start the car still failed to start ?,btohqsg
Once I push the start button without applying break to switch on the ignition it doesn't turn on too?,btohqsg
You mean engine doesn’t crank and turn on  or electricals don’t turn on too,btohqsg
Need to be a bit more specific pls sir,btohqsg
Once I try to start the dashboard lights goes off,btohqsg
Any guidance because I recently changed the footwell module,btohqsg
Sounds like your battery kicked the bucket.,btohqsg
in case you stay in the East https://bit.ly/3PuuhVl,btohqsg
@SGCM_AdminRaymond  Jack  $0.05 per referral to the link? wahahaha,btohqsg
When last changed the battery? Any accessories plugged in like chargers  air purifiers? Dashcam has parking mode? Cosmetic lights? Forget to off lights?,btohqsg
No dashcam light switched off and car on sleep mode,btohqsg
Battery voltmeter reading 12.4 currently and I always make sure the little light in the gear shift console goes out,btohqsg
So the car goes on sleeping mode. Battery is in good condition,btohqsg
Hmm then maybe starter. But volt is not a good way to measure car battery life. Should be looking for Cold Cranking Amps (CCA) this one need equipment to measure.,btohqsg
Get your next adventure-ready car at the Suzuki IMM Trusted Brand ShowcaseGood stuff  don’t say we never jio!😎👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you love Suzuki cars!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg

Sir Conti  you referring to M Performance Exhaust (MPE)?  If you are  I am not too sure about it because I don't play M cars😔-R,btohqsg
Btw those cars with pops and bangs got to be illegally modified right?,btohqsg
oh okay  cos i tot G8x MPE havnt been approved yet,btohqsg
eeee golf R and GTI i think legal,btohqsg
Some I6 and V8 from BMW come w pops,btohqsg
Yup  its legal. I know of someone who drove a legal GTI that had pops and bangs-R,btohqsg
Which authorised dealers accept self bidded coe?,btohqsg
How to test drive super car? Can just walk in n test drive?,btohqsg
ECU tune can easily do it. So honestly hard to say Illegal.,btohqsg
Try do that beside TP  see illegal or not lor,btohqsg
should be legal if from factory actually hahaha no scare,btohqsg
well  TP will stop you. drag ur car to VICOM  and than return ur car at your own cost.,btohqsg
U referring to ecu or factory car?,btohqsg
doesnt matter what car  which supercar is quiet one,btohqsg
Oooo no wonder. I never go their lengkee showroom before🤭-R,btohqsg
i will be shock if i8 has pop & bang hahahhaa,btohqsg
Wait can we even test drive supercar,btohqsg
depend you know the sale agent or not. just walk in front door  dont think they even bother,btohqsg
I dont mind nice exhaust notes but showing off the pop and bangs in the neighbourhood and witnessing an old lady shocked by the sound is a no go for me.,btohqsg
Mr Pete  you got Aventador  just drive in then can test drive,btohqsg
Honestly no go for anybody when come to neigbourhood,btohqsg
Agreed  some pops and bangs really too loud and sharp,btohqsg
Definitely! Very well said💯I share the same sentiments as you too-R,btohqsg
Example  some cars at the Dempsey meet the other day. I'm sure you heard them@skylar313,btohqsg
dempsey tp hot spot for noise complaint,btohqsg
That car I witness is louder than those BMW. Well  I assumed the volume was amplified as the sound echo thru the 10 story HDBs,btohqsg
Can play the pop and bang sound through the i8’s speakers🤣-R,btohqsg
Aren't BMW already playing engine tunes thru the speakers?Maybe next time it is a DLC with monthly subscription,btohqsg
LOL those kind cfm not legal,btohqsg
Based on price range  competition  performance numbers,btohqsg
Yuppp depends on the surroundings a lot,btohqsg
That's why a lot of people like suntec,btohqsg
Can get a nice echo of their exhaust note,btohqsg
Yea it is a 1 lane street. pops and bang before turning into Multistory CP. Actually had the urge to confront the drive.r,btohqsg
i only like those w nice burbles,btohqsg
Soundaktor is a vehicle audio system used to simulate engine noise in the cabin. incase anyone ask,btohqsg
Don't confront  later invite more trouble.Just report LTA and make their life miserable.They have to take leave to go for inspection.The workshop I frequent  has sirocco with approved exhaust also fail inspection... Then need to go appeal. Headache 😂,btohqsg
It is funny that I am saying this since some said my car isn't quiet as well. Have a nice tune to it now about some tune up and replacing the carb,btohqsg
Vintage car no catalytic converter and silencer right😂,btohqsg
No Catalytic converter.Have silencer but was a different kind of silencer,btohqsg
I believe there's only 4 of these in Singapore right?,btohqsg
I know 2 were for sale recently with the same dealer,btohqsg
And one is kept under covers by the owner in a condo carpark,btohqsg
Only from 1973 iirc seat belts are mandatory in sg.,btohqsg
But I believe you can fit in 2/3 point harnesses very easily if you wish to do so,btohqsg
It is literally sportbike muffler lei,btohqsg
go there touch it dont be shy,btohqsg
Ya la and some don’t off the engine when idling while waiting for passanger damn Noisy,btohqsg
I hate those lorries in the morning,btohqsg
Its my car now actually. Carb tuning a bit weird. Idling too high to my liking. Going back workshop.,btohqsg
Warming up their engines in the carpark,btohqsg
One wise member here said  no need to warm up engine at idling. Just start and drive car lightly on gear 1 can le. The moment engine start the engine oil will lubricate the engine from the getgo.,btohqsg
Plus Singapore weather don't need to worry about engine oil freezing too.,btohqsg
Nobody will do this for modern  cars right,btohqsg
I still see those new cars doing this random shit,btohqsg
Even my beetle I can't do this. Start car and move off slowly liao,btohqsg
There is still a slight warm up for new cars. Usually can see the RPM exceed 1k when cold start  primarily warm the cats to help emissions control and the oils. But usually this in SG less than 1 min before dropping to 700 RPMs.,btohqsg
I warm up car every morning 🙈,btohqsg
I just shift to D and go,btohqsg
Best around min. If you shift gear will skip the Warm up.,btohqsg
Tho it can also be argued without warming cats  there might be more emissions.,btohqsg
There are m3 which come with MPE with certs,btohqsg
You sure do know alot about em,btohqsg
the one w the weird angle quad exo,btohqsg
so sad i hvnt seen one w it yet,btohqsg
Or just go for the Akra!!!!,btohqsg
Mostly likely to be starter if battery still new and has more than 12v,btohqsg
Considered factory exhaust if im not wrong. Just like how audis get mtm exhaust and tune legally,btohqsg
To achieve pops and bangs not necessarily is modified exhaust. A tune can achieve those and tunes are not illegal,btohqsg
Just drive your aventador go  they sure let u test drive,btohqsg
