yeah i know what u are saying  but if i minus out the amount due on 11 Sep (as shown on SCB app)  I still owe SCB about $0.50 today.,btohqsg
Do CRMC have point on paying utility bill?,btohqsg
what is the due amount on your card statement?,btohqsg
still have  just a bit delayed,btohqsg
sometimes constipated have to have a few more days than normal,btohqsg
as in by right they have up to 14 days although previous they credited next day  now take like 4days,btohqsg
Want to check with the CPF gurus here  if I have BTO down payment soon  is it safe to just leave exactly the amount and transfer all the rest to SA?,btohqsg
Since the difference in about 1.5% p.a. only  i would advise you to keep some buffer just in case of some last minute (forgotten) deductions / fees / amounts that you could use CPF for..maybe tiles selection / door etc... or lawyer fees   amendment fees.,btohqsg
Okay  thanks! Would additional 10% of property value buffer be sufficient?,btohqsg
i don't know about %  but i think a figure of $5k buffer (husband + wife) would be sufficient.,btohqsg
Long term wise  you might want to keep more OA for the next property. Also  it's safer to leave 6 onths instalment buffer to take into scenarios eg retrenchment. So it depends on your risk appetite.,btohqsg
Right  totally forgot about the 6 months safety net too. Thanks!,btohqsg
That being said  if really kenna retrenched and you have the letter to prove it  you can approach HDB for some leniency on loan repayments (assuming you are taking HDB loan of course).errr. but not if your retrenchment letters shows a $100k payout.,btohqsg
Hi is there any point if use hsbc revolution to buy courts voucher ?,btohqsg
maybe use a locked dbs visa card  then check the mcc of the failed transaction via dbs website chatbot. Then see if the mcc is on whitelist of hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Hey guysI‚Äôm moomoo we have the option to see daily returns in a very visual and friendly way. How about tiger brokers ? Anyone knows how can I see it clearly like or close to moomoo ?,btohqsg
any idea if there is still sign up bonus on secured credit card?,btohqsg
Anyone using moneybull? Is it better then tiger ? Can you see daily return same as moomoo?,btohqsg
From UOB TMRW app  cannot see what category the credit card spend falls under?,btohqsg
Hi  I want to ask with this new BTO/HDB LHL talked about. What is the age for single to own a property? Still age 35 and above?,btohqsg
Why I DON‚ÄôT use the UOB Preferred Platinum Cardhttps://youtu.be/5GB7LFjc02I,btohqsg
Hi all just to update  UOB approved the appeal  on the basis that I do the following:- Spend an additional $500 from my UOB cards in my next spending cycle.- call in after that month to the hotline for manual crediting.The UOB One bonus interest took about a week to reflect in my account but glad it's done!,btohqsg
Good to hear that! Thanks for the updates.,btohqsg
anyone doing this paylah reward ? Only category applicable is shopping and supermarket ? also the cash back will only be credited depending on simplygo transaction? cause i want to spend 300$ with 0$ on transport spend,btohqsg
Hi... Anyone got OCBC 360 bonus interest for Aug?,btohqsg
I read the TnC of this. I felt it is such an unnecessary complicated reward that's not worth time/effort.You have to reach $300 spend on shopping and supermarket.But the cashback is based on SimplyGo transaction up to $20 per month.So basically you have to spend $300 on shopping/supermarket + SimplyGo to get up to $20.But the $300 get nothing.... and especially it's debit card.So to me it was nope,btohqsg
Thanks for the input. They didnt explicitly exclude like resturant   food place etc but also didnt mention that it is qualifying spend and also transport rebate is based on simplygo   which is mrt and bus and only via eligible card . Feels kinda scummy,btohqsg
"yah i dunno what's the rationale of this promo tbh. I would have been ok if it's like ""Spend x amount on SimplyGo to get y% cashback  capped at z"". This one is like for what  why different categories (and rather restrictive) and then the cashback is actually for another category lol",btohqsg
Uob can be quite flexible in appeals if u are a long and loyal customer.,btohqsg
any gd way to pay great eastern insurance to earn points  rebates or miles huh,btohqsg
Would like to double check for the Krisflyer UOB credit cardto qualify for welcome miles and gift of 6000 and 20000  you must spend $1000 for 2 consecutive months? if you don't spend  you get 0 miles?https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/travel/krisflyer-card.page,btohqsg
Hi..I am 44  is it too late to start investing my cpf?,btohqsg
I don't think it's too late. In fact u have a bigger cpf base at 44 to invest.,btohqsg
So is Endowus a reliable and safe platform?,btohqsg
take note the time-limited gift here is the 20k miles one  that one requires $2k in 60 days,btohqsg
This is using how much capital? The return looks decent,btohqsg
Yes  I trust it more than moomoo and tiger tbh,btohqsg
Hi me and my spouse planning to purchase hdb and I came across the owner/occupier loophole for 2nd property without absd. Thing is my spouse is a PR. Can a PR apply for sole owner while SC be the occupier during the hdb application? If so  can we apply with grant at all?,btohqsg
No. SC must be the owner n the PR must be the occupier under this scenario.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a loophole. It is an approved ownership structure.There are downsides of using this structure like only the owner income and cpf and be used.,btohqsg
New rule. Grant will still be disburse to both whether you are owner anot. It will mean your first timer grant will be consider taken.,btohqsg
OCBC Titanium card if giant city installment I will not earn the reward point right,btohqsg
If you want to avoid Absd  buy commercial and industrial properties.,btohqsg
Unlimited commercial and industrial properties. It is not tied to your residential property. ABSD is for residential properties only.,btohqsg
If my CPF investment account is inactive  will still be charged the quarterly fee just for having the account?,btohqsg
No only when there are investments held will there be the quarterly fees.,btohqsg
