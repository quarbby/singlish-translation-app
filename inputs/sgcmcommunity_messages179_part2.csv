Really curious how was the light set up. Normally once start the engine  it powers on.,btohqsg
I saw Taobao like some ambient light uses remote control,btohqsg
Maybe need that to power on ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Got chance tube blown or fuse,btohqsg
Ya possibly. But gotta find the fuse box first. Now is no idea where cos the cable will route into the car body,btohqsg
Fusebox near the OBD port at driver side.,btohqsg
could be wired to the DRL  most cars have the DRL on as long as engine is on... if wired to other electrical system may turn off when engine auto stop,btohqsg
Shall go and investigate further tmr,btohqsg
ðŸ˜œI want to change to new car,btohqsg
Previous quota 924  1165 bids. Close at $95689,btohqsg
If the trend follows w over 1000 bid  then it wil be ard 95k,btohqsg
Depends on last 10 bidders how desperate they want the car,btohqsg
I thought normally end of year have alot of sales? So expected trend should be up,btohqsg
Cat B Quota 648Open Cat 151,btohqsg
Maybe ard 120k to 130k for Cat B n Open,btohqsg
If screw up the electrical area   their warranty will void. Not as simple as people think,btohqsg
Phv companies will buy a lot,btohqsg
dont have that is the problem,btohqsg
my fren went to MG showroom he said dealer offer 150k for EV basic model,btohqsg
< 15k dep where to find,btohqsg
But won't be EV or anything fancy,btohqsg
bro its brand new  has to buy by dec,btohqsg
he said rebates will be reduced,btohqsg
Oh I read your words wrongly  I thought you asking where to find car less than 15k depres,btohqsg
MG company financial ok? I see china got one EV company bankrupt then the existing cars have problems,btohqsg
I see video that the one that is still doing well in china is BYD,btohqsg
the rest of the EV companies is not hitting sales target,btohqsg
haha bro MG is one of the best selling cars in australia,btohqsg
MG's parent company is SAIC Motor (Shanghai Automobile Industry Corporation). SAIC Motor is the 7th largest car manufacturer in the world and was the first automobile group in China with annual sales exceeding 7 million units.,btohqsg
I wld go for Atto 3,btohqsg
All these in troubles r the small manufactures,btohqsg
160k buy EV or 170k buy HRV,btohqsg
Majority here not buying new car. What prize today don't matter,btohqsg
But if its downward trend for few months  2nd hand market will follow also down,btohqsg
It's interesting to see what coe prices today,btohqsg
only for those car that are traded in,btohqsg
those cars traded in high hard to down,btohqsg
unless dealer wanna minimise losses then bring prize down,btohqsg
If the coe 100k suddenly jump down to 30k for good,btohqsg
Just like in the 2000s  where new car cheaper than 2nd hand car because of coe crash  thus dealers needed to sell to minimize loss,btohqsg
hooray after 3 drum please let the squid games begin,btohqsg
Will cat B jump back to 150k?!,btohqsg
this is simi lan lai de,btohqsg
A car dealer I spoke to is expecting cat A to drop,btohqsg
there shall be squid games  sure bounce liao for cat a,btohqsg
Still too many demand but not enough supply,btohqsg
i know its hard i pray for 70k,btohqsg
What you getting if it drop to 70k?,btohqsg
