Depre doesnt matter if you’re using it till the end anyways,btohqsg
But matter if i wanna trade in for a newer car right before my coe ends correct?,btohqsg
How much can you really get if you buy that car,btohqsg
Anyways parf cars generally more ex also,btohqsg
But car workshop alway refill 4 litres only .. so I need to buy my own engine oil to top up the 164ml ?,btohqsg
Anyone got this Kinto One member?,btohqsg
keen on the fuel credits portion  whats the catch because it seems like a very good deal,btohqsg
U take pdvl cheaper. Can use skillsfuture,btohqsg

Just asking  can we buy a COE car to transfer the COE to my current expiring car COE? Seems wasteful to scrap my car.,btohqsg
Y need to buy a coe car to transfer the coe to ur current? Anyway  don think u can do tatIf it's too wasteful  juz renew coe lo,btohqsg
Hi guys  good morning  workshop charging me $180 labour to change 4 rotor disc and brake pads. Is this reasonable?,btohqsg
Any body has review about Volvo xc40? Thank you,btohqsg
Volkswagen Singapore marks 50 years of the GolfThe firm has released a love letter to the iconic hatchback to kick of the celebrations marking its 50th anniversary!➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 React with 🔥 if you love the Golf!,btohqsg
Queue at all times of the day. Good morning everyone!,btohqsg
I feel it’s reasonable if it includes bleeding of the brake fluids cos that’s an important step. Plus I suppose u are bring your own parts to change?,btohqsg
Sell before coe up  or sell after renew.,btohqsg
I feel the basic member is sufficient  I personally don’t like the fuel credits because no credit card rewards  and the discount difference is marginal.But the Kinto lounges are good. And the free tyre patching services,btohqsg
Bleeding means clear out the brake fluid and top up new one?Yes bought own parts to change,btohqsg
Yes. That takes up a bit of time,btohqsg
My general rule of thumb is about $80 per hour of labour  but not sure if that’s really the market rate or budget around here,btohqsg
So in my theory  2 hr job   160-180 is not a lot,btohqsg
what do you want to know about it?,btohqsg
Charges me additional $60 including the oil. Think should be fine,btohqsg
Typically when u bring your own parts they charge higher for labour,btohqsg
Yah understandable. But I think we can have our own options on parts. I paid 450 for all the parts. From Japan,btohqsg
