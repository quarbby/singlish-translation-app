ST News Night: 'Pump and dump' stock-buying scams on the rise in Singaporehttps://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/st-news-night-pump-and-dump-stock-buying-scams-on-the-rise-in-singapore,btohqsg
Hoping the dividend they are giving ($0.0125) will invite a play.Results decent only. Profitable but no growth. Let‚Äôs see how they open.,btohqsg
based on comparison of 1H21 and FY20  2H20 made approx 19m and 1H21 made approx 21m  slight improvement.EBITDA of FY20 is 93m and 2H20 is almost 47m1H21 came at 54m  a significant improvementwhy the highlight and significance of EBITDA in moya result always?an online suggestion:EBITDA is used to find out the profitability of a company  while the net profit calculates the earnings per share of a company. ... Many businesses focus on measuring EBITDA because it minimizes the impact of factors outside of their scope of control and focuses on what can be controlledMoya holds service concession assets of 448m on their books which is essentially the value of the BOT business. They will be amortised over the life of the concession which are all non-cash in nature hence the significance of the EBITDA shows a clearer picture of their real earnings abilities,btohqsg
They have repaid 24m over the past 6 months.,btohqsg
their cashflow statementtheir OCF comes in 39  better than HY20interest payment saved 3m due to reduction of debt significantly. Debt is reducing well and saving on interest.Reminds of Del Monte  high debt but manageable  cash cow business improving margins over the years,btohqsg
#Moya#commentaryimpt points to note: 1st paragraph. Their new water treatment plant of 1000 lps is completed in 1H21  meaning the full contribution will be reflected in 2H212nd part in green is the key highlight. Their acquisition of Acuatico few years back has got few remaining years of concession in Jakarta and if renewed will give clear cashflow and profitability for next 20-25 years depending on the concession terms. A potential gamechanger and revaluation catalystlastly is their temporary operation of the water supply in Batam. They took over from a JV of sembcorp who was prominent in Batam from their JV with Salim via Gallant Venture. The transition has been extended to a year and i presume a confirmation of a long term concession will be awarded to Moya in time to come. Afterall  to displace Sembcorp is no mean feat,btohqsg
next part on their reliability and hence showcasing their capability to bring clean water to a massive population.Their search for opportunities.... await updates thenall in all i see a respectable set of results from Moya and as of now they are still trading below NAV.With full contribution of new plant (small one) and the Batam potential long term concession  i will assume 2H to outperform 1H but assume status quo  full year result will come in at 42m SGD net profit and market cap of Moya now stand at 306.8m  translating to a PE of 7.3,btohqsg
Nice coverage by Bro@furion07on Moya Asia.,btohqsg
US market to moon.Hope tomorrow we all Huat,btohqsg
All financial results seem promising .Hope tomorrow gap up,btohqsg
CSE global shows a break out and up of APEX channel.Results is out  profitable but nothing too spectacular IMO. Nevertheless  the dividends of $0.0125 that they are giving might lead to some play tomorrow.(Note: they have given $0.015 dividends earlier this year too  which brings their dividends for this FY to about 5% yield.)Anyways  Let‚Äôs see how it goes tomorrow and good luck holders. üôèüèª,btohqsg
