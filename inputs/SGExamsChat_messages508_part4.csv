but I'm wondering whether poly got internship also or only for certain courses,btohqsg
Both nitec n higher nitec got intern aso,btohqsg
ahh I see. normally starts which year and I'm pretty sure intern pay averages around 1k right? seen some NITEC interns getting 300-500 only and had to work past public transport closing time. Intern pay doesn't even cover transportation which is hella sad,btohqsg
Even poly intern pay isn't 1k unless u go prestigious company,btohqsg

I gt heard of law interns in firms not getting paid at all,btohqsg
companies have to acknowledge this. see so many of my intern friends get treated as FT workers.,btohqsg
The thing is intern is no diff from ft job scope.,btohqsg
But they shudnt be treated like one,btohqsg
Here am I askin for experience over money,btohqsg
only safe ways in crypto are long term holding and mining. even then it's not a small investment if you want to see good returns,btohqsg
I don't rly care abt pay,btohqsg
My first intern pay was $500+?,btohqsg
but if they treat u like..,btohqsg
And it is the outside working world,btohqsg
Can I say I intern somewhere prestige and I ask for only cert + testimonials?,btohqsg
did u manage to get it tho?,btohqsg
I wonder what kind of place,btohqsg
just hold btc and eth la.. consider SNP500 as another safe investment but not a good time now as chance of recessiob,btohqsg
uni intern shld be at least 1k,btohqsg
u can consider taking up finance course,btohqsg
uncommon to see sgreans who don't care much about money. especially in a overcompetitive job market,btohqsg
I mean I'm in IT sect,btohqsg
