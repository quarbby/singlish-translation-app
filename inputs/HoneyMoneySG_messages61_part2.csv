Guys  i need an advice as it is my first time opening a saving account.After watching Honeymoney video  i am convinced to get UOB one saving acc + UOB EVOL.But the problem is  the new signup bonus for EVOL is only entitled to first 100. Imagine spending $1000 for 2months consecutively and i am not in the first 100 to get the $500 grab vouchers.Was just wondering what is everyone's opinion. Do you just ignore the new signup bonus because the interest rate of the saving acc is good enough?,btohqsg
If use UOB Amex card to top-ups to GrabPay Mastercard  do we still entitle to 1.7%?,btohqsg
Glad u know the whole gist of their marketing campaign....U shld know the answer already....,btohqsg
Spend $1 000 on 31 aug. Spend another $1 000 on 1 sep. If UOB don't give $500 grab voucher  call police üòÇ,btohqsg
ü•≤ sad sia..i guess it all balance out.Get lousier cashback card with $300 signup bonusGood cashback card with almost no chance of getting signup bonus.But the cashback difference might be able to cover the signup bonus in 1 year - 1 and half year,btohqsg
How long does it take for a payment  with Citi Rewards cr to go through,btohqsg
My payments has been pending for so long I don't know whether I'm receiving points,btohqsg
A side topic  but i am just wondering if i should signup for 2nd credit card.Local spending: $600/month on average.Uob one + EVOLBusiness Trip: 4 times a yearTotal Business expenditure: $2.8k (Hotel Booking + Oversea spending)Leisure Trip: 1 time a yearAverage spending: $3k-$4Based on this overseas expenditure  am i better off with another credit card? Or just use EVOL is okay.,btohqsg
Are you interested in miles at all? UOB Ladys and UOB Visa Signature might be useful for all the travel expenses.To me using cashback credit card for overseas expenses doesn't quite compute as they attract foreign currency fees (3.25%),btohqsg
I think UOB Lady can be used for guys now but i will feel awkward using it üò≥But is it neccesary to get another UOB card? Since the interest from EVOL should be good enough.Was thinking of Citi Premier Miles since the miles will not expired.Krisflyer  i might find it tough to accumulate enough to redeem good stuffs within the expiry date. :(,btohqsg
Use Amaze + UOB Lady? Possible to cover your awkward ?,btohqsg
Dunno why need to be awkward.... The card hurting your masculinity or something?If all in UOB the miles are pooled. Citi premier miles definitely can't get you 6 miles per dollar.But well find a card that doesn't make you feel awkward I guess,btohqsg
Oh yeah!! I saw that combo too in the video. Thanks for reminding,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion :),btohqsg

Hi anyone can help? My mum signed up for citi credit card through singsaver and they emailed her this. The thing is when she signed up she used her singpass so technically they can see her proof of salary there right? I don't remember having to go through this last time when I signed up,btohqsg
Hi all  got an ILP running with high fees (learn about it way too late..)Account value 75k now. Surrender only get 21k. Should surrender? Got 24 more years to go,btohqsg
do u want to pay 24 more years of high fees?,btohqsg
Any reason? Out of the 75k  $32 400 was the start up bonus,btohqsg
That is why I will ask haha,btohqsg
For me it is a definite yes  whatever u lose by surrendering today will be way lesser than the 'extra' fee u pay for the next 24 years,btohqsg
If we are talking about capital loss  it‚Äôs about 25k because I did some withdrawal before,btohqsg
It is just sunk cost. Just surrender and cut loss. Btw not financial advise. I talking to myself. üòÅ,btohqsg
Oh then nvm  ignore what I said,btohqsg
look at their projections in the original doc  compare against how it has performed thus far to have a rough gauge of how reliable their projection is.if not  make your own projections.with that you can calculate the expected apy returns (with considerations to your premiums too) from now till policy matures.Compare against available options now  for me I'd just use UOB One's 5% p.a. as a quick benchmark.You can make the decision easier with the numbers laid out,btohqsg
If the returns after deducting fees are very low  idt it's worth imoIf the ILP allows fund switch  great as you may invest in better funds (greater returns)If the returns after deducting fees are still e.g. 8%/10%  you can consider keeping it,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Just wanted to ask. Does OCBC 360 account have fall below fees? Even after holding for the account for more than 1 year.,btohqsg
Not familiar with your ILP. Can‚Äôt comment much.a). Do you mean you pay $75k n the actual value left $21k if surrendered orb). you pay $46k n value left $21k  loss $25k? Orc). you have pay $75k and the value left $21k+$29k(have withdrawn)  loss $25k?,btohqsg
Visa better simply go a it updated dailye,btohqsg
What‚Äôs actual return after mature ?,btohqsg

Hi i just had this experience in July  where i did not get my UOB One bonus interest because of a refund. The spend transaction ($2000) was in June  but refund posted in July  so it offset my July spending (~$950)  resulting in a balance amount. Based on that  UOB deemed that i didnt fulfil July's $500 eligible spend. Currently waiting the appeal result,btohqsg
Compared with how much premium you've paid  if the difference is not big  then consider it.Decide based on ur needs....,btohqsg
is it the fwd one how come so long,btohqsg
