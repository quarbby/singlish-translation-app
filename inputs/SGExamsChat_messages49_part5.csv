The tablet is mightier than the pen indeed,btohqsg
when will pw results be released,btohqsg
But this year maybe exception lorh,btohqsg
I dont see why need to delay,btohqsg
They let us collect A Levels online this year,btohqsg
but no one has said anything,btohqsg
No reason why PW would be different,btohqsg
i want to see my A,btohqsg
My ABA delaying my ntu offer,btohqsg
But i more interested in NTU one,btohqsg
They prob will just release electronically,btohqsg
people on reddit said may tho,btohqsg
Why not u just ask ur pw tutor,btohqsg
Just wait for the official announcement.,btohqsg
Most likely theyll online release like they did with alevels results this year,btohqsg
they said their tutors told them,btohqsg
i don’t have any contact with her anymore,btohqsg
Didn’t know N*** was interested in the social sciences,btohqsg
Didnt even apply for FASS ?,btohqsg
Lol ask ur pw hod then,btohqsg
Im into money not into future,btohqsg
Welcome to late night sgexams talks,btohqsg
Have you gotten your NUS letter?,btohqsg
im scared to even run now,btohqsg
Everyone is legit just telling you to ask your teacher,btohqsg
Yeah but NUS already offered me course despite ABA,btohqsg
Nus hasnt even sent me an email cries,btohqsg
Theyll send u letter if u get rejexted,btohqsg
Oh yeah  but you scores better,btohqsg
I more interested into NTU one,btohqsg
There are better ways than to run,btohqsg
no im gonna run without a mask,btohqsg
i’ll see what they can do,btohqsg
Yeah you’re allowed to do that,btohqsg
Running away from your responsibilities is the best exercise,btohqsg
do i not need to breathe,btohqsg
But exercise doesnt help u lose weight as much as some other options,btohqsg
The nearest police center would do,btohqsg
it doesn’t make sense to allow the non-usage of masks during exercise though bc i still can spread the virus if i have it,btohqsg
It’s not about total stop of spread,btohqsg
But if u tell them cant go out at all,btohqsg
why are there more people outside exercising with covid,btohqsg
And if you are to go out and run  it is healthier for everyone that you run without a mask because it’s more likely that you will faint from oxygen deprivation than covid,btohqsg
i didn’t know my neighbourhood got people run other than a few marathoners but,btohqsg
Why do u go out and exercise during covid,btohqsg
It’s a calculated decision from MOH,btohqsg
with covid there’re even more people lol,btohqsg
1) All the other exercise facilities are closed so all the regulars there move to the parks2) WFH and HBL gives people more time to do PT3) Many people cannot bear to be home so long,btohqsg
& i thought there’ll be lesser people but to my horror no,btohqsg
Did u even read what I just said,btohqsg
