actually the lecturers dont need to be there if im being honest,btohqsg
so i didn't even know what was going on until i read the slides,btohqsg
we got slides..that goes through step by step on every lesson's deliverables,btohqsg
ONE OF MY LECTURERS IS LIKE THAT,btohqsg
I got one lecturer that did that,btohqsg
“go google got answers online bro”,btohqsg
Oh yea why does everyone hate lit,btohqsg
"then proceeded to boast saying ""Think about why i only work 2 days in a week""",btohqsg
And how hard is a1 for lit,btohqsg
i don't think everyone hates itjust that lots of people probably don't have interest in a subject that requires interpreting poetry,btohqsg
I'm taking pure lit rn 10/10 wouldn't do it in jc,btohqsg
the only good thing bout rp is most of the time once you find the right person...the change happens quick,btohqsg
and if you don'tcan go and commit suicide,btohqsg
my secondary school teachers actually teaches welland cares about our gradesthat's why I preferred my sec sch teachers,btohqsg
Why is she paid at this point,btohqsg
That momment you realise  alot of rp lecturers are part timers,btohqsg
Why do yall go to poly though,btohqsg
cause i rather have a diploma than end at a O levels cert,btohqsg
yeah my critical thinking lecturer did mention about the luggage bag thing,btohqsg
my parents dont even put expectation on me,btohqsg
like if the lecturer carries a luggage bag then is full timer,btohqsg
Isn't like poly lower standing than a level just pass,btohqsg
A levels cert wont bring you anywhere in most industries,btohqsg
If you finish JC and fail to get in a uni...you wasted 2 yrs,btohqsg
a level certificate can't give you a jobonly a diploma can,btohqsg
Can't imagine it sounds so impossible lol,btohqsg
the caveat here is the type of jobs...A levels cert put someone at a higher stance to get a govt job over poly diploma,btohqsg
And possible at the same time,btohqsg
the govt wants A levels peeps,btohqsg
people on reddit were saying that jc students have more priority than poly students when it comes to uni admissions,btohqsg
its very hard to work for the govt using a diploma,btohqsg
and how A level is a internationally recognized exam while poly isnt,btohqsg
yes..but if you are at the other end of the ladder  you are basically diw,btohqsg
need degree rightif you really wanted to,btohqsg
Wait but if yiu just pass a levels can go to a private uni right,btohqsg
you fail a levels also can,btohqsg
"private unis are called ""private"" for a reason",btohqsg
I can just become a lawyer after o level wow,btohqsg
i mean in your stance..it would be better to be in poly cause at least you wont be a loose goose during uni studies,btohqsg
I heard they're very expensive as well,btohqsg
private uni's teach very differently from govt uni's,btohqsg
that's what my classmate who refuses to study and got e8-f9 for most of his grades ended up goinghe said that he's going to australia for overseas study or some shit,btohqsg
Who recognises Malaysia India uni certs lol,btohqsg
"honestly the education system is not a doom or gloom...the issue is most of the students who feel that ""they will never be anything""...dont put in effort to change",btohqsg
If you are willing to change  you wont starve on the streets,btohqsg
Isnt the university of mumbai cert for cs bttr than MIT,btohqsg
I don't want to be stuck with some lazy person in jc to do pw,btohqsg
If u not in jc now,btohqsg
waitttt i heard that jc is removing pw for uni admissions requirement next yearthen the rp will drop from 90 to 70,btohqsg
Since pw wld b pass fail anyw,btohqsg
