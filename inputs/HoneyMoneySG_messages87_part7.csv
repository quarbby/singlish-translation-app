I saw from reddit that if RSP into CSPX and VWRA in IBKR  the fee will be 0.38 only. However I tried myself and I got charged 1.70 (1.85 after GST). Any gurus here know why there is different?,btohqsg

I find it strange as the 0.35 pricing is for US stock(which the screenshot u show in ur video) but LSE stock pricing should be 1.70..,btohqsg

Hello Gurus morning Kindly let me know if we add DBS live fresh credit card to apple pay and then pay in Courts physical store. Will it be consider as Contact less or Online spend?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
You need to go down to the branch to register your signature before you can make a GIRO arrangement via form.,btohqsg
I had to go hsbc branch to update my signature. And they take quite a while to register it. My personal experience was that 2weeks after I updated my signature the hsbc giro side still called me to ask me for my signature and I had yo ask them to check with the branch again.,btohqsg

Hi Guys any available guide on how to transfer shares out of IBKR to enjoy Webull transfer in Promo,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs very individual depending on your needs.Some of the factors to consider are:Annual Fee (if there‚Äôs no annual fee then why cancel? Eg- hsbc revolution)Minimum spendSpending categories - how much you spend online vs contactless vs etc.Depending on your spending habits you can decide which to keep. Personally I feel hsbc revo and uob ppv are a great combo if your total online+contactless spend <=2.1K,btohqsg
Guess so  but I do not wanna deal with orphan points just for Maybank. I use citi payall to either rewards or PremierMiles,btohqsg
Need go branch. Submitted form before to get rejected sibei waste of time,btohqsg
Yes need to go down to the branch but the process is quite fast  takes less than 20min,btohqsg

Hi all  does using PayLah on a Hawker Paynow QR enjoy $3 off on Friday?,btohqsg
Only if you can catch it,btohqsg
Do it early morning 7am sure can get,btohqsg
If using Apple Pay  can go pretty high. I‚Äôve done for over 3k before. But sometimes (not sure exactly what‚Äôs the conditions) it will still ask you for signature on the terminal after tapping your phone. But that will still count as mobile contactless (for UOB),btohqsg
HSBC EGA Giro payments - cannot GIRO to pay HSBC or other bank credit card bill right?,btohqsg
https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/s/rvzRCQyzv9The pricing seems changed but just monitor and see how is it,btohqsg
No HSBC credit card and self initiated GIRO payments.,btohqsg
Thanks‚Ä¶ then I do not really have that many GIRO payments to link to it - telco bills go my Maybank F&F  insurance and tax go cardup Utilities go POSB everyday  maybe ppl use for tax payments for 1% I guess,btohqsg
