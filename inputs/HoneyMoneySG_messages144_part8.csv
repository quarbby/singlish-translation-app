You should cross out the other one on ocbc,btohqsg

Hi guys  need advice here. This year i get my home and wedding. So we take the opportunity to earn miles with the purchases we created on those 2 milestones. We mostly used uob. So any advice on how to transfer uob Uni rewards to SIA krisflyer? Sorry if this sound like a super noob question.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if the Trust cashback card can be used to withdraw cash overseas from trust account? Does it count as cash advance?,btohqsg
Current dp seems ok to use trust cashback cc  choose saving account on ATM screen and it will take from trust saving acct.Not sure if this is intended thou.,btohqsg
Enrol in Frequent Flyer Conversion first  then go to Rewards+ in UOB app.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/miles.html?,btohqsg
Did they fix it already? The last time you could not pair the Trust Cashback card to the savings account so it'll be considered as cash advance. And the strategy was to use Trust Link card instead.,btohqsg
Still cannot link saving acct to trust cashback card. But I have seen a few dp from different people said they used trust Cashback to withdraw (select saving acct on ATM screen) and that took from their saving acct.Again  don't feel like it's intended behavior.,btohqsg
It's quite stupid if it's not connected also because it shows up under Trust account > cards on the app..,btohqsg
Anyone paired Maybank F&F with Instarem Amaze? Does it work to convert any transactions (that were not eligible spend on any of the categories) into online spend which now qualifies for the online spending category if I have selected it as 1 of the 5?,btohqsg
online category only for whitelisted mcc,btohqsg
Meaning to say if I swipe for example MCC 5462 on the Instarem Amaze (pairing it with F&F)  it will still count as MCC 5462?Sorry 1st time exploring into Instarem Amaze.,btohqsg
Or will it convert to online shopping MCC?,btohqsg
Intend to register for cmlink sim card. Anyone have referral?,btohqsg
Is 5462 whitelisted under Online shopping MCC?,btohqsg
Yes... Previously when it was still online fashion  I went to outlet mall and all offline purchases were clocked as online fashion after amaze.,btohqsg
Oh your outlet mall shopping is which MCC?,btohqsg
I can't rmb. Anyway it's one of the MCC under fashion store. Amaze doesn't convert mcc btw.,btohqsg
So is there a use to get Instarem Amaze and pair it with Maybank F&F?,btohqsg
Of course  it converts fcy to sgd so you don't need to kenna conversion charges.,btohqsg
Yes. If you haven't meet the local spend cap yet for the selected categories. Else MYR/IDR purchases will still go under the local spend cap.,btohqsg
Understand. It will just help on the conversion charges and the foreign transaction will still flow into the respective categories right?,btohqsg
So which means if I am charging MYR / IDR  instead of charging directly to F&F  I should charge it through Instarem Amaze pair with F&F  so that it will flow into the â€˜MYR & IDR Spendâ€™ category right?,btohqsg
Yes  and the usage is to convert offline to online purchases.,btohqsg
Opposite of what I meant. You should charge directly for it to be under MYR/IDR spend  but only after you reached local spend cap.,btohqsg
Okok thanks. When it converts from offline to online  it will benefit cards like CRMC or UOB KF right?,btohqsg
I read that HeyMax miles can be converted to ALL points 1:1. 2000 ALL points are worth about â‚¬40 or about $0.028 per mile.For those with Accor Plus membership  this is a huge win.,btohqsg
I recall world of hyatt pts are pretty good too,btohqsg
I got curious and just wrote to Swissotel to see if they accept ALL points for dining expenses if I donâ€™t stay.Could be a good way to spend some HeyMax miles at a good rate to bring the family to dine,btohqsg
If I apply a UOB supplementaty card for someone  will that person still be considered a first time bank customer?,btohqsg

Hi guys  I have a question.I have been buying VOO (S&P500) every month for 2 years now using the Tiger Brokers platform.I'm just wondering if there is any concern in the event that some of these platforms are liquidated and we cannot get back our funds.Do you feel it's safer to invest VOO through one of our local banks instead?,btohqsg
