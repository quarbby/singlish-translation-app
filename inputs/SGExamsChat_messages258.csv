Uk what I go back my cafe,btohqsg
I am hanging out with my friends at a diff part of sg,btohqsg
My friend he go home idk when he coming back down,btohqsg
I scared i remod sia ngl HAHA,btohqsg
If lucky maybe C+ lah i hope can get B can alr for this module,btohqsg
The rest just whack for A,btohqsg
I literally just went for treatment,btohqsg
Idk why ppl hating on pbl but the main reasons they cited were ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt concentrate‚Äù,btohqsg
When is clearly a lack of discipline,btohqsg
I think for PBL got pros and cons but yes the bad thing would be lets say udk smth  u consult prof he still nvr help much  u got the wrong concept die alr,btohqsg
I'm not gonna come back and see this grp,btohqsg
Till my mental health gets btr again,btohqsg
Tho I only went thru PBL in RP  not sure how the lessons r conducted in other polys,btohqsg
Btw how was lesson in rp like? I will reply in awhile,btohqsg
I heard it‚Äôs like class based,btohqsg
I heard there's daily RJ to do and presentation,btohqsg
Yes for other polys its like sec sch lor just that got lectures,btohqsg
everyone will be in the same class. Everyday is dedicated to 1 topic for the assigned module. eg: every Monday is Maths  Tuesday is Arts History etc.,btohqsg
the day will be split into 3 phases 1st phase the lecturer will go through the slides of what the lesson will be about and introduce the problem statement (Which you usually don't need to solve on your own)then you go for first break  45 mins - 1hr2nd phase is the part where you do some exercises related to the lesson to get a better sense at solving the problem statement. Most lessons will have you working on these in a group.You can also start working on creating the presentation slides for your solution to the day's problem statement.Then lunch break  1hr 30 mins - 2 hrs3rd phase is usually on completing your presentation slides with ur group. Usually the lecturer will be ready to help students when they have any questions  so it's very helpful to clarify on problems,btohqsg
finally each team takes turns to present their slides to the class to show what they've learnt for the lesson,btohqsg
He just let me die thr,btohqsg
which is your team's solution to the problem statement,btohqsg
but presentation is usually not scary  because it's only to ur own classmates and to ur lecturer,btohqsg
then at the end of ur presentation you entertain questions from ur classmates and lecturers,btohqsg
Oh yeah btw if just asking if u get 3.78 this sem right for example  do u have chance to get Director list,btohqsg
also people are incentivised to ask questions in order to earn their daily participation grade,btohqsg
Them go home do rj right,btohqsg
director list is usually for top 10% of the cohort,btohqsg
My friend say a lot of ppl get C grade bro,btohqsg
usually most people do RJ straight away on the spot,btohqsg
HAHA i go count lor if 1 C+ the rest i can get A,btohqsg
cus we dowan to go home and worry about it,btohqsg
reflecting on what you learnt in the lesson,btohqsg
I saw some memes abt rp. Where ppl get C grades all day ah,btohqsg
So is C grade rly that common,btohqsg
for all u know the top 10% in ur cohort could be very zai,btohqsg
HiI'm a RP studentSo  for RJ  it depends on what question the lecturer will give youSometimes lecturers will ask you about your lifeSometimes they will ask you to critique the other teams regarding the presentationSometimes they will ask you to solve a problem,btohqsg
then u wont make it to director list,btohqsg
"anyway  after everyone has presented  the lecturer will present their ""6P"" which is called the 6th presentation  since there are usually 5 groups in each class",btohqsg
they usually preface their 6P by saying that this is not the perfect answer for the problem statement  but it's a good solution for the problem,btohqsg
Ah i see so thats what 6P is,btohqsg
but usually everyone takes the 6P as the right answer,btohqsg
since it's the module chair who came up with it,btohqsg
and the module chair is gonna be the one making the exam,btohqsg
Daily grade make up how many %,btohqsg
6P will later be made downloadable for everyone in .PPT or .PDF,btohqsg
here's the best part about RP,btohqsg
which means all the 6P you've downloaded can be referred to during the examination,btohqsg
But if cannot apply concepts toh,btohqsg
and answers can be copy pasted / rephrased,btohqsg
Open bk come and kill only,btohqsg
the best part is that most of the questions test on giving correct answers,btohqsg
only a few test on applying concepts,btohqsg
Uk our open bk slides are those  thick science journal,btohqsg
so your 6P is very powerful,btohqsg
"This is for PBL lessons (Problem-Based Learning)There's another type of lesson called ""IS"" (Interactive Seminar)This lesson is quite relaxing as usually no problem statement for the students to solve. Just listen to lecturer's explanation. However  sometimes the students are required to participate for trying some questions that are inside the notes to get the grade for participating",btohqsg
Then prof throw u 100 pages and lecture notes,btohqsg
ahhh okay i still in upper sec :),btohqsg
they keep changing the weightage arnd tho,btohqsg
daily grade favours the more talkative kinda people,btohqsg
Oh yeah do yall think that lecturer's opinion abt ur sch work is vv impt,btohqsg
It dependsIf there are both MSA and ESE  daily grades is 40% and exams is 60% (where MSA is 40% and ESE is 60%)If there's only ESE or graded assignment  daily grades is 60% and ESE is 40%,btohqsg
I feel that my confidence mostly come from there cause i lack confidence sometimes ah,btohqsg
since the exam is done on ur laptop  you can compile all the 6Ps into 1 slide. When a question comes up with a certain keyword  you can ctrl+f on ur PPT and find the exact chapter talking about it and extract the correct answer,btohqsg
in the case of my diploma Game Design  we have a lot of that,btohqsg
Wah if the game is good yall can market it,btohqsg
WahGood for youI also want ehüòÇ,btohqsg
work in a team over the course for a few weeks and submit the game to LEO 2.0,btohqsg
For ppl doing ur course yall need those high end laptops right,btohqsg
then they grade based on how u apply the theory in the game and your work process,btohqsg
the games we make aren't that big to require so much processing power hahaha,btohqsg
although slow laptops will annoy u ah,btohqsg
in the case of graded assignments  yes,btohqsg
because they're the ones marking it,btohqsg
so if they think you should do something  but u nvr listen and do  then it might affect abit,btohqsg
Like for me they told me i just need to work on confidence,btohqsg
yeah if the lecturer think u bo chap in class  then they are likely to mark u down for daily grade,btohqsg
ur peers might downvote u for peer evaluation too if they dun like u,btohqsg
then u will have no problem,btohqsg
as long as you are hardworking  do ur stuff  and try to participate abit in class  u shld be fine,btohqsg
peer evaluation in my personal experience doesn't work very well,btohqsg
Being participative will give a impression to yr lecturers on how you are,btohqsg
cus my lecturers try not to be biased and base it off their own observations,btohqsg
even though our whole group downvote 1 guy for being an ass,btohqsg
he still contributed in the group activity and discussion,btohqsg
Basically the moral of the story is,btohqsg
Treat how you wanna be treated,btohqsg
Its best to have understanding grpmates!,btohqsg
Not ppl who bitch abt u when u did the most and treated them well,btohqsg
I have met ppl who are last minute who show attitude,btohqsg
like reveal their true colours at the end?,btohqsg
Okay so like for example  i was the grp leader for 1 project for example.,btohqsg
They do last min work  then over thr blame me when they dk what to do lor,btohqsg
my friend was telling me about his poly,btohqsg
Say i nvr help when i did help out,btohqsg
Then just because i go offline earlier 1 day cause i took covid swab and took meds so i was tired af.,btohqsg
They do work late at night i edit tmr also kenna scolded. They made a mass out of the work design,btohqsg
In the end A all claim credits for themselves ah,btohqsg
any nus peeps here can access NUS Exam Libraries?,btohqsg
Research or search wrong medical condition end up need to help cover their arses,btohqsg
U pin this message if u can bah hopefully someone will ans,btohqsg
So now i learnt i dn help them lor. Just do my own shit and just be with ppl who understand me ah,btohqsg
I personally never encountered anyone as bad as that  but I heard stories from friends,btohqsg
Then if u get higher gpa only u mess up 1 small issue,btohqsg
U do well get accused of cheating,btohqsg
I am just putting in work for myself now,btohqsg
I have a story about a bad lecturer in my course,btohqsg
he's very old  which is fine,btohqsg
Hopefully karma strikes back 1 day when they know abt ppl like thay,btohqsg
but the way he teaches is very outdated,btohqsg
and  he isn't updated with the new concepts of our industry,btohqsg
he was our module chair for Game Design Workshop,btohqsg
Sounds a bit like 1 of my teacher,btohqsg
most of the lessons are structured towards very outdated methodologies and concepts,btohqsg
and half the time when he's teaching  he doesn't know what he's talking about,btohqsg
and struggling to sound like he knows what he's doing,btohqsg
but that's not the bad part,btohqsg
all of it is tolerable  just annoying to deal with,btohqsg
For my FYP (stands for Final Year Project)  we're allowed to discuss and exchange the information for writing on logbook and reportHowever  only my team leader and I are doing the project seriouslyOne of my teammates went MIA until Tuesday  then realized that he only did both of them 40% done for eachAnother teammate also went MIA until Tuesday  but this more worse. Only did 10 pages of logbook and hasn't started doing the report yetIt's kinda stress because we have to show both report and logbook to our supervisor as soon as possible  but those two teammates don't do things seriously and hence we can't get the full information from themüòî,btohqsg
oh yeah and the games that he makes us reference in our assignment is from like the 60s -  early 00s,btohqsg
like if u reference mario  that's great and all,btohqsg
Oh yeah btw quick qn  some mf asking me for help but not work related. Should i just ghost?,btohqsg
I mean they would only be nice when they need shit,btohqsg
if you don't feel like it  just don't do it,btohqsg
then reply them later  sflr didn't see ur msg,btohqsg
But yes thanks for the advice.,btohqsg
during my FYP we followed this SCRUM methodology that our school taught us,btohqsg
"but the most important part were the daily ""SCRUM Meetings""",btohqsg
where we would simplify to writing on our tele group1. What I completed yesterday2. What I intend to do today3. What difficulties I'm facing and who can help me,btohqsg
cus no one wants to look bad being the only slacker on the team,btohqsg
It sounds like a rly good plan.,btohqsg
it takes only a few minutes  but it's daily,btohqsg
so no going MIA unless u inform everyone first,btohqsg
Yeah  during practical experiment and during lessonsBut then I'm not sure why they did not reply any single message to usMy team leader and I kept asking them something in Telegram group  they didn't reply back anythingüòí,btohqsg
if you know for sure they're slacking  then start sounding pagro,btohqsg
"""[name] can you reply? Do we need to ask our supervisor to help u reply?""",btohqsg
but the other case might be that they have a geniune issue that they're not too comfortable with sharing publicly atm,btohqsg
Typical grp work be like that,btohqsg
in that case  try pmming them to check if everything is fine and if there's anything u can help with,btohqsg
Do you mean like private message? I had tried sending messages to them privately  but they did not reply back tooüò≠,btohqsg
you might wanna discuss this issue with ur supervisor then,btohqsg
Haizz okayI hope they actually do something ahIf they really don't do anything  we will never get the information that we need,btohqsg
prior to going MIA  what were they like?,btohqsg
were they participating in group discussions?,btohqsg
Our practical experiments were on every WednesdayOne of them was not able to come on some of Wednesdays because he's retaking a module  which also clashed on WednesdayBut when he was able to attend the meeting for the practical experiments  he was helping us a lot  which same goes to my another teammateI had reminded both of them to actively see my team leader's and my messages in Telegram group as we would be sharing a lot of important information for us to write on our logbook and reportThey at first participated in Telegram group. However  they gradually went MIA  especially after the government announced that gathering had to be reduced to 2 people.,btohqsg
Then no more participated in group discussions,btohqsg
during peer assessment   you know what to do,btohqsg
Is peer assessment kind of peer evaluation?,btohqsg
It's alrightThank you so much guysüò≠,btohqsg
I read it as Neko Auntie  UwU,btohqsg

people 9 year old give chance laaa,btohqsg
U have to be 15 to take in Sg I think,btohqsg
dk why sg one is way harder,btohqsg
"Bell curve mah  sieve out the ""elite"" ""brainy"" people",btohqsg
oh rlly? i thought just grade boundaries,btohqsg
My friend 75 POA b3 lmaoo,btohqsg
based on grades u say between x score and y score is A  between y and z is B where x  y and z are scores to be solved for,btohqsg
"How so lmao  bell curve is ""normal distribution"" correct?",btohqsg
some people define grade boundaries with a right skewed curve,btohqsg
While grade range they get to pick no. That get A/B/C,btohqsg
I feel like grade shift more effective than bellcurve cuz the effects is not dependent on individual abililty. If u have a class full of 9000iq the bellcurve will cause some of them to fall theoretically speaking,btohqsg
if all 9000IQ exactly all will score 50% with no failures,btohqsg
Heresy to prof  must normal distribution,btohqsg
make sure people who get A vv little,btohqsg
Why do we want this tho?,btohqsg
Liddat Sg no more doctor/lawyer/software engineer liao,btohqsg

I just learn by heart wtv general info,btohqsg
If ik then ik  if idk then i choose another qn or smth,btohqsg
Chem phy math can't pick qn as much unfortunatelyüòî,btohqsg
are sg unis harder to score than overseas ones,btohqsg
Neko aunnie leaving for another day,btohqsg
Depends on where also for overseas,btohqsg
Heard it's for rich ppl  u can draw Ur own conclusions,btohqsg
They more or less hve the same structure,btohqsg
Idk eh i just know my prof did his degree thr long ago,btohqsg
But i heard of lecturers who did their degree in UWA and then masters at NTU,btohqsg
my lecturer did his masters at oxford,btohqsg
Depends on what course in what uni also,btohqsg
a lot of singaporeans studying in australia,btohqsg

This sem idk but i just gg for my final push lor,btohqsg
I hope to get 3.85 if can bah,btohqsg
But i also got other commitments qiite busy,btohqsg
Its a bit insensitive to some ppl so yeah...,btohqsg
Although yes i am always doubtful of my future ngl,btohqsg
But must try to enjoy life to the best lor,btohqsg
Do u think u would score better for jc,btohqsg
instead of the stupid gpa shit,btohqsg
If u 2-3 years in  sunk cost liao leh,btohqsg
I mean diploma at least can work lah,btohqsg
Though i think i macam no future one,btohqsg
JC imo is consistent effort plus last 6 months chiong,btohqsg
Poly also need be consistent lor,btohqsg
Poly u suffer from other people‚Äôs issues lmaoo,btohqsg
There are ppl who just flame u for ur gpa one,btohqsg
and those who prioritize part time work and CCA over project work (the ppl who don‚Äôt rlly have financial problems),btohqsg
then u have to cater to them,btohqsg
Tbh i do hope to build a super team for my projects lah,btohqsg
People skills are valuable skills learnt in poly though,btohqsg
Yeah ngl i do try to network as much as i can.,btohqsg
A S'porean boy learned trigonometry by himself at the age of 8  and managed to snag an A* for IGSCE O-Level maths when he was 9.,btohqsg
Yeah those ppl just dont care them alr,btohqsg
So when they ask me for help,btohqsg
I just take 2 days to reply 1 text,btohqsg
Unless work related then i faster lor,btohqsg
Completely not crashing in another topic,btohqsg
Personal shit i can just take 3 days or dont reply only,btohqsg
Or individual work just dont care abt them alr,btohqsg
Since u are only treat well when u are needed,btohqsg
What if is Ur crush and u simp,btohqsg
Nah thrn dont care also lor,btohqsg
Okay i reply ltr see yallz.,btohqsg
"Wait is ""simp"" allowed on sgexam chat group  alot of places cancelling this word",btohqsg
Idk but i just dont rly use it,btohqsg
But karl even if its crush. They are ungrateful ppl just ignore alr lo,btohqsg
You have btr things to do with that time yo HAHA,btohqsg
Crush is fluid and can change,btohqsg
Average hooman cannot resist power of hormones,btohqsg
Yeah ngl i suffered cause of those ppl but l was lucky to comeback ah,btohqsg
Aiya just care for urself now can alr,btohqsg
"Ye but I is heard  main thing one needs to do for poly/JC is to get into ""decent"" uni  after going through undergrad and doin well can get Masters in courses that allow u to go investment banking if u really want chase money",btohqsg
I am not too sure about this. Perhaps Someone studying in sch of business can ans u,btohqsg
But yeah I think Masters you usually need to get 2nd class honours or better.. But for PhD i think u dont need.,btohqsg
use MSc finance to get into ib is usually for people without finance/Acc/biz first degree.works in US  but not that common in SG (or at least from what I see on LinkedIn),btohqsg
over here is usually use finance degree + internships to get into ibIf u damn kiasu  can take cfa level 1 as undergrad,btohqsg
Some divisions allow direct PhD if you graduated with 2nd upper honours or higher for bachelors  then you can skip masters,btohqsg
I hope it would be on Academia soon,btohqsg
