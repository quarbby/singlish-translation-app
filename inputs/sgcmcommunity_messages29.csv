Sometimes drivers drive out from yankit road and stop right under the red traffic light that is meant for the main road drivers,btohqsg
Submit a dashcam footage to us if you have! We will take a look at it and may write an article on it🤗,btohqsg
Green light from yankit road… and stop in the yellow box under the red light on cantonment road,btohqsg
Above pic taken from google maps,btohqsg
Should be just go all the way isn't it?,btohqsg
Yes  cuz the red light is not meant for the cars turning out from yankit. It’s meant for the cars along cantonment road to stop,btohqsg
But a lot of drivers just turn out and stop suddenly,btohqsg

well if you consider owning e30 rich. ok. sell to you 100k,btohqsg

I can't afford 2 cars. too extravagant for me😂,btohqsg
you always asked me questions about mazda... lol,btohqsg
heard Mazda parts more exp than say Toyota or honda,btohqsg
600K = e30 + alfa 156 144K km 4 years,btohqsg
in my nearly 6 months of daily driving it has so far been ok. it is a december 2015 mazda 6 2.5. such a joy to drive,btohqsg
you also like driving to thailand? fun right? i drove there with another sinkie driving in his old e34,btohqsg
havnt before  want to try maybe next year,btohqsg
always wanted to drive to thailand haha,btohqsg
please use ONLY bukit kayu hitam rouyte to enter thailand. DO NOT use eastern route. your car maybe hijacked,btohqsg
before you go to thailand  remember to buy insurance at changlun. this is a border town in malaysia. you MUST have insurance otheriwe you wont be able to come back to malaysia,btohqsg
i bought a 10 day insurance costs me rm14 only.,btohqsg
once in thailand SADAO  just buy a pre paid sim to use google map. that is it.,btohqsg
thanks for the tips  really helpful!,btohqsg
Ur mazda Shd have Thailand maps right,btohqsg
we did this in 2014. without much preparation. just ensure we fueled up in malaysia. fuel is very expensive in thailand.,btohqsg
yes.  but not updated. that is like 2016 map,btohqsg
I just back from hua hin   45 baht a litre,btohqsg
DO NOT book hotels in advance. do it ony when you arrive. too many. pick and choose. drive along the streets and see what you like  locations  distance. this is what we did. best choice,btohqsg
i enjoy driving there. good roads,btohqsg
does thao ppl drive over to malaysia for cheap petrol also?,btohqsg
Not when I was living in Perlis and Kedah  now don't know,btohqsg
cause 45baht a litre for 95 is not cheap also,btohqsg
and shake the car like sinkie,btohqsg
mlysian no need convert EV . their Ron 95 only 2rm.. sg 20 years ago aso dun have this price,btohqsg
they tax free for ev right?,btohqsg
I remember late 90s cheapest petrol I pump in Sg is Arn sgd1.20 then,btohqsg
Yeah yes free 5 years. Also road tax free,btohqsg
but singapore is alos good what  we have the 45k arf rebate,btohqsg
like 9 years free roax tax,btohqsg
Yeah. They too like sinkies steal petrol. They come with containers,btohqsg
nice sia malaysia really the bea,btohqsg

You get the rebate from the offset from selling price? Or during deregister,btohqsg
the 45k deduction is given when u purchase new vehicle,btohqsg
when u buy a new car  u will see the ves rebate 25k  and EEAi 20k rebate so total is 45k rebate  off the arf taxes. so example i use an bmw 330 arf is $54640  + $15000 ves surcharge  and it will be a total $69640 arf  but if it is an ev  the arf will be $54640 - $45000 instead and it is only $9640  so u buy an ice u pay $69640 arf  but u buy ev u pay $9640  this is a huge difference espcailly if you got loan for the car,btohqsg
wont it affect the resale of it too?,btohqsg
now hard to said as every car u sell is earn money haha,btohqsg
haha thats true  only time will tell👍👍,btohqsg
u go and see all ev  the arf very low 1,btohqsg
exactly haha  the ioniq 5 arf 16k but selling for 250k😂😂,btohqsg
compare to ice counter part  alot of ppl only look at coe  but if your car is more then 70k omv  the arf is 100k liao,btohqsg
arf is higher then coe in such instant  and if your cart is like 100k omv  the arf is like 160k lol,btohqsg
even without coe our car price still highest in the world,btohqsg
😂 more like rental company whack COE. If you see many new Altis hybrid PHV on the roadRental company after 3 yr deregister car. Pro-rate COE.,btohqsg
actually I dun see a lot new cars recently. maybe my neighborhood not atas enough😂,btohqsg
For premium cars 2nd car is very worth la haha,btohqsg
Can get 740 at 22 k depreciation,btohqsg
not worth if I need throw another 30k to repair  which I think most likely will need,btohqsg
can use 3 more years only,btohqsg
Then again  at the end of the term  your arf rebate on scrap will be much higher for the ICE car right?,btohqsg
Because you get 50% of the ARF rebate on scrap,btohqsg
So if the rebates are this high for EV bringing down paper ARF value  wouldn't the 50% be much lower?,btohqsg
Not too much of a difference that way  just about when you're getting your money back,btohqsg
so afterall is a 0 sum game innit🤠🤠,btohqsg
u pay upfront less but you sell for less,btohqsg
diplomatic car so no tax or coe 😍,btohqsg
There is still a slight advantage to the EVs with the VES rebate. That's most likely the savings you get,btohqsg
But one must also consider that with the new regulations coming in 2025  government may pull EV rebates as well and bring it down to just VES,btohqsg
Already the case in America  no more additional benefits for buying EVs from brands who have sold more than 100k EVs,btohqsg
Just a small benefit on registration costs,btohqsg
So this might be a good deal right now  but once the rebates are pulled and full value ARF EVs start hitting the market. Resale value of the cars that have ARF rebates on them will really take a hit,btohqsg
u pay way lesser when buy new car  and when u sell currently the price so good haha,btohqsg
As those buying towards the end of term with 1 to 4 years left do take ARF rebate into consideration,btohqsg
and if got loan your intrest is lower also,btohqsg
Current market is not an indicator of the normal market as it is ridden by supply shortages and long delivery times and a much higher COE,btohqsg
and the arf is 505 back when scrap the more u pay the more u lose,btohqsg
the arf rebate very good to me liao,btohqsg
if car 145k become 100k only,btohqsg
so will tesla in future all add 45k?,btohqsg
this i read is still 2023,btohqsg
Agreed but all I'm saying is  if you look at the bigger picture of the whole 10 year tenure  ICE vs EV  your ARF rebates at the end will differ as well so the difference you're getting now can be pushed back to there,btohqsg
Just about when you want the rebate,btohqsg
but problem now is dealer pass u back the rebate anot haha,btohqsg
This one brand to brand 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Wearnes for example does not pass it down,btohqsg
I believe a few others pass down a significant chunk of it,btohqsg
yeah it is a very generous inititiave by goverment  but i see like i4 selling price,btohqsg
Because the paper ARF value is low,btohqsg
i see basic cost is 220k,btohqsg
But the dealer margins are high,btohqsg
selling price last i see is 320k?,btohqsg
Base 318is also at 50k ARF,btohqsg
I4 which is positioned at a higher class in the bmw lineup and is more expensive in general  paper ARF is around 30k,btohqsg
So they are using the rebate on paper,btohqsg
But added back into their margin,btohqsg
So you don't get the benefits of the rebate on purchase  nor do you get the higher ARF rebate on scrap,btohqsg
The 420i  the exact ICE counterpart of the I4 is at 60k ARF as well,btohqsg
Even though the I4 omv is 11k more than the ICE 420i,btohqsg
Just about dealers here and what they're doing  one has to really look into what they're buying,btohqsg
Most dealers will pass down at least the EEAI rebate of 20k as a discount or overtrade,btohqsg
But the 25k unlikely unless you're current car quite good then they can offer a very high overtrade,btohqsg
Tanjong Pagar car crash: The driver of the car was speeding at 148kmh on a 50kmh road and had alcohol in his system  revealed evidence given on the first day of a coroner's inquiry into the five deaths.Autopsy reports showed they all died of severe burns in the fire that engulfed the car and shophouse.https://cna.asia/3QahUOK,btohqsg
True   that why I love tesla,btohqsg
The D2C advantage really works there,btohqsg
But a dealer model is needed for some brands so manufacturers need to reshuffle their lineups and categorize into what can be sold D2C and what needs a dealer,btohqsg
"For example  in the cae with Mercedes  models like the GLS  S class  G-wagon  AMG variants have a lot of options for which a dealer and advisor is required to guide through the process and make the experience""exclusive and rewarding""",btohqsg
But regular a b c e and lower GL variants wouldn't,btohqsg
So a D2C model could be adapted there,btohqsg
Tesla D2C very easy  at max 4 cars  2 to 3 powertrain options,btohqsg
I think with time ba   tesla now is focusing on mass production,btohqsg
Alll these with help of technology is not that hard anymore,btohqsg
U see their model 3 and y good strategy mass production sales many many,btohqsg
Do so many ix3 ix1 and such kinda pointless in my opinion,btohqsg
Maybe that guy wanted buy ix3 but see ix1 cheaper go and buy ix1 then margin drop ownself caniibalize ownself,btohqsg
Not about the technology or mass production,btohqsg
More about the experience and guidance,btohqsg
When buying an S class or a Maybach or something even higher up like a Porsche  rolls  etc.,btohqsg
People want that experience of being able to individualize the car with an advisor who's with them throughout the process,btohqsg
Ya this I understand like I go branded shop,btohqsg
For cars more mass market like a 3 series or model 3,btohqsg
Can choose online or go to the Tesla store you see the small wall and you're done,btohqsg
No build updates  changing spec  delivery experience as such,btohqsg
But many buy the car for the whole experience which D2C can't offer,btohqsg
True also but some enjoy la haha   like no ppl pester u for Loan or insurance,btohqsg
Jaguar unveils restored E-type at Jubilee celebrationsTruly a stunning classic car😍👉🏻 React with 😍 if you agree the Jaguar E-type Roadster is indeed stunning!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
"And many buy the car for the experience that D2C offers  which traditional route doesn't.It's a paradigm shift.In the past  people will go to stores to look at physical objects  bargain with sales staff.. try to get freebies.. feel good about the whole experience.  The sales guy gave out ""freebies"" which are in fact paid by the buyer anyway.. so sales guy is also happy.We all know it's an illusion LOLThese middle man fees ""built into product prices and ""freebies"""" help to pay for his salary  rental for the premises  a cosy area for the customers  annual gifts/cards etc etcEven with S$10k rebate  S$20k discount.. there is still NETT profits for them. It has to be.  They are not a charity. They are a business.However  with B2C... the middle layer is cut away.Buyer buys the same part/product.. but without the need to haggle or pay for middle man fees.Sure  some still require the illusion of ""control"".But the tide is changing. Others prefer a straightforward sale without having to pay middle man fees.I believe more manufactuers will start selling direct.",btohqsg
I agree with you! All I'm saying is that many manufacturers will have to make further vertical divisions in their brand to segment the D2C section from the dealership model,btohqsg
Nod. I agree with you too!,btohqsg
and who knows.. another 5 decades.. and it will shift back to dealerships etc...,btohqsg
without middleman. Benz will be very cheap in Sg... will lose the atas feel,btohqsg
That's why some people like pain. LOL.How much is this Benz? S$150k?No.. i don't want.. i want to pay S$300k for it...Oh look.. my foot.. shoot it!Seriously? LOL,btohqsg
I recall PI sells same model cheaper (for merc),btohqsg
Even if it becomes cheaper  will still have that feel I would say,btohqsg
Because if you look at other markets and don't add in the dealer mark-ups of the current market but look at a pre covid market. Many Japanese and German brands had entry level cars priced around the same range,btohqsg
But people still run after the badge,btohqsg
I agree :)because quality will always be there...,btohqsg
I remember I check out the price of e200 in 2019... CNC got $7xk  profit from selling one e200,btohqsg
because there is quality (at least in the past) associated with the badge,btohqsg
Because there's more attached to the brand than just the price of it. For example  Ferrari has the racing heritage  although they might not have been that good for the past two years  but the heritage carries on,btohqsg
wow... i wouldn't be surprise...So would someone prefer this to B2C? really?,btohqsg
It's an image that's been built over the years,btohqsg
"It's the insecure who are after ""expensive"" stuff....The secure and those who know what they want... will look for other intangibles or useful tangibles .. rather than price.. .they look for Value.",btohqsg
$7x k can buy a honda jazz then ready😂😂,btohqsg
And that's why brands offer models to target every type of person,btohqsg
From a c160 that's a worse spec than a regular Corolla Altis to a c63,btohqsg
LOL.. can't believe they have a C160... LOL,btohqsg
But there's some on the roads,btohqsg
Really don't understand why they exist,btohqsg
someone must have woken up and decided ... enough is enough LOL,btohqsg
😂😂😂 more like c&c upselling people to ready stock c180s while downselling e class buyers to c180s as well,btohqsg
That's what they love selling  c180s and GLBs,btohqsg
IMHO  C180... 1.8T I can understand.. but any lower capacity than 1.8T.. then the car shouldn't be driven.. may be parked... but not driven LOL,btohqsg
Gone are the days where 180 meant a 1.8T,btohqsg
no way... OMG... my heart.. .my heart....,btohqsg
this is the e200 premium noe. about $$80k now over cost price,btohqsg
There was a time when.. there is no replacement for displacement...,btohqsg
The new generation that was just launched and the previous one as well,btohqsg
OMG.... cheers to those who love this sales model.. rather than a B2C model :) Cheers to you all :),btohqsg
80k over cost price.. then someone goes and bargain.. get free car perfume and dash cam... feels reallllll good LOL,btohqsg
And 20 to 30k over their car's paper+body value,btohqsg
That explain why e class depreciation is so scary,btohqsg
But e class is nothing compare to i4,btohqsg
My wife says it is not about the size it is about how u use it. I’m not sure if she is just consoling me though,btohqsg
Don't let go.... Don't let go...,btohqsg
ok but gotta say mercedes smart,btohqsg
they taking adv of those who want the brand,btohqsg
is like bmw making a 516i or smt hahaha,btohqsg
but i don’t understand why ppl want buy e180 brand newfor that price can buy used e250,btohqsg
like I said ... the 3 point star brand is more expensive than the car itself.,btohqsg
any car as long as there's a 3 point star in front can command a high premium . even if it's a lousy car,btohqsg
and it's just a taxi in parts of europe,btohqsg
516i will be damn funny.Sheer Driving Pleasure,btohqsg

BMW 216 AT/GT more siao lang 😂,btohqsg
Proton has a Evo 10 version😅,btohqsg
So far I met vezel with rs sticker more Siao Lang,btohqsg
Yes. Correct. Proton  likes Alfa a lot. Admires very much. When the selespeed button first came out  proton also copied this. Hilarious. Alfa is the first to come out with semi auto box like that used in F1. Then bmw saw this and followed with smg,btohqsg
But so far Honda take the cake,btohqsg
I notice ppl driving suv tend to be more aggressive maybe te view very high king of the road,btohqsg
But have you met the vezel urus?,btohqsg
I see nearly alll the type r are in middle lane and will signal,btohqsg
Vezel is like see how fast my car is,btohqsg
Qasqai too. 1.2 turbo.Wanna push you off the cliff😅,btohqsg
See how good I do bend,btohqsg
"That isn't actually a ""plagiarized"" design",btohqsg
Proton is a company that license designs from japanese companies usually to build their cars,btohqsg
Like they have their own vios,btohqsg
like van drivers lor they sit higher see further so they feel very confident swerve in n out,btohqsg
True also some vans with sexy rims also drive like Siao Lang,btohqsg

I'm using. If suspension healthy ok.If absorber spoil.And bouncy. Put also no use.Depend what you are looking for.The reduce of bouncy-ness is not big difference.Just that full pax loaded won't hit hump compare without it.,btohqsg
Big bore throttle body better ba😂,btohqsg
If you wanna reduce rocky boat experience when crossing hump. Or better cornering feels.Must Change absorber.,btohqsg
Is there any maintenance to the spring buffer,btohqsg
Nope.  Mine is about 4-5 yrs. Start to see 1 crack.  It's silicone.,btohqsg

Yes. More importantly is my tourists smiles at the end of my ride. That is soul food for me.,btohqsg
say real best mods are  Tires  Coils and Brakes,btohqsg
Stage 1 also make quite a big diff but u sacrifice reliability,btohqsg
Tesla itself reducing production headcount so…,btohqsg
Vtec kick in is best feeling,btohqsg
old school vtec yes  but not for i-vtec,btohqsg
The manufactures detuned for reliability  stage 1 maximise the power but wear and tear will increase,btohqsg
Overseas Stage 1 STI with reliability mods cant even last 100k km😂😂,btohqsg
Oh that's what you mean. yes  agreed!,btohqsg
Subaru boxer r not reliable even u stay stock,btohqsg
Garrett turbo kick in even better,btohqsg
boxer engine has limitations. that is why many discontinue. alfa stopped long ago,btohqsg

that is what i thought. hw hard can it be. and if i dont know i ask la,btohqsg
Just need to invest a bit of time into route planning,btohqsg
And making accounts on charging co. apps,btohqsg
If one's up for that  should be good to go,btohqsg
Plus if it's a rental co. renting out EVs  they do help you out in case you want tips on which chargers to use and route planning etc.,btohqsg
Ev is just like driving golf cart,btohqsg
Most EVs also have native nav that will point out  charging spots as well. But sometimes not reliable as they may be out of order or slower than claimed,btohqsg

tomorrow my friend gets his alfa giulia qv new,btohqsg
Again not the most accurate comparison but a decent representation of ICE vs EV and charging networks. Keep in mind Teslas north American network is very vast as compared to others,btohqsg
Got 5 sc net work already for tesla,btohqsg
Not even counting those from sp and such,btohqsg
For Singapore don't need too many locations anyway,btohqsg
1 or 2 in every region with enough stations is decent for the current Tesla population,btohqsg
Slow chargers at office carparks and chargers at condos and HDBs are more important,btohqsg
For charging at night or during work day,btohqsg
It a strategy they are building the 6th 1 with big tesla logo   it like I am dominating ev hello heheh,btohqsg

"Getting a ""cool car"" at A-class prices",btohqsg
Ya Elon is the influential lol,btohqsg
Actually don't need own SC  because third party charging infrastructure is getting really good worldwide,btohqsg
Sc is for tesla only and the eye balls plus exclusiveness is a big advantage,btohqsg
Like me go wwp I can charge at charge plus but other ev can’t charge at tesla,btohqsg
Another good experience shared  requires lots of planning to be driving EV  infrastructure is available but not completely reliable. Also spoke about how the shift in mindset needs to be brought in and the costs of it all,btohqsg
