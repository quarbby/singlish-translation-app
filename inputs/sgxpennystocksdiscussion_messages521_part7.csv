This gov very smart! Taxpayer is the risk taker and profit ownself take,btohqsg

Any new Vaccine.. sg will get first.. compare Malaysian.. what the gov done..,btohqsg
Malaysia EPF one of the worst  buy stock then lend out for ppl to short. Glove community will know what I mean.,btohqsg
You do realize these 4% and 2.5% are never guaranteed for the long term  right? Just need a parliamentary 'debate' to adjust (down),btohqsg
So if the government bet wrongly and lost  can just come up with valid reasons to reduce interest rates,btohqsg
Are you just depending this interest for the long run.. 2.5 or 4%.. still have interest.. at least gov did used the money.. vaccinations 1st delivery to SG..,btohqsg
Not putting any hope on these money... Not even sure when the musical chair will stop,btohqsg
Bonus if anything comes out of it... But not depending on any,btohqsg

Tried some Blumont $0.005 today. The pennies market has been very weak and has been resting for a bit. Seems like pennies need a new leader. Hope Blumont  will be able to lead. Pray üôèüèª.
