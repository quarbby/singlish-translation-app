read the slides figure out wtf the actually impt stuff,btohqsg
they just force people to drop,btohqsg
they make the paper incredibly hard,btohqsg
so that we have majority Us and Ss,btohqsg
so students will be demoralised to drop,btohqsg
Oh ok I heard from my ej friend that they ask all those in the bottom 20% taking 4H2 to drop one H2,btohqsg
then u will auto drop 1,btohqsg
But cuz the papers are damn difficult,btohqsg
most of the cohort would have 2 Us,btohqsg
i rmbr for chem it was like any mispelling of a word including a non-keyword would warrant the whole part getting 0,btohqsg
I guess they just very strict to scare students,btohqsg
I used the word regardless of instead of if,btohqsg
they gave my whole thing 0,btohqsg
Do any of yall know of anyone who took h2 geog and h2 history for a levels in one sitting and got both A,btohqsg
Ik one student from NY who did that,btohqsg
needed you to prove my validity,btohqsg
Only acjc and nyjc allows students to take both without any restrictions  sajc allows but MUST be GHEm,btohqsg
Ohh I thought you mean she got both A for prelims  not just she took both subs,btohqsg
In the 2022 acjc batch I know got 2 such students  but neither of them got both A,btohqsg
Closest was h2 geog A but h2 history C,btohqsg
One nus law guy got that lol,btohqsg
Wow nice  which sch was he from?,btohqsg
I thought sajc only started offering that GHEm combi more recently,btohqsg
I think History and geog got model answer can alr,btohqsg
You sure it’s not one of them is H2 and the other H1?,btohqsg
Iinw 2019 that combi wasn’t out yet,btohqsg
So if the student took both geog and history one of them must have been a h1,btohqsg
For me geog I memorise for A laso,btohqsg
Yeah both h2 knew him personally,btohqsg
Wow rly nice  I know now there’s at least one such example of taking both and getting A,btohqsg
thres so many undeserving 90RPs out thr,btohqsg
I think my group just chose a bad topic,btohqsg
That's why he got nus law n I rejected 3 times lol,btohqsg
oh   i would say there are many underserving scholars out there also,btohqsg
it becomes like so unconsequential nowadays,btohqsg
At least under the new system you would’ve gotten a perfect rp,btohqsg
That indian guy in your unit,btohqsg
I knew someone who told me,btohqsg
I deserve to be a scholar cuz im from RI,btohqsg
Now I'm in consulting arguably more fun than law lol,btohqsg
No didn’t you see what he said about him,btohqsg
Idk if pay better than law long run tho,btohqsg
cuz he was sulking that he got rejected,btohqsg
from the same scholarship as me,btohqsg
and he said i was just an ej student,btohqsg
yeah im just an ej student,btohqsg
But actl alevel I studied vv ineffiently lol,btohqsg
I rmb I did all the jc prelim paper like for 3 years or smth,btohqsg
Some ppl anyhow study or barely study do much better than those who studied way harder,btohqsg
Most RI students ik have this,btohqsg
