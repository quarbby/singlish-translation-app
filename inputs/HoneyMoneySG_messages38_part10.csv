which miles card to use is better?,btohqsg
Yup you have to redeem it 1 IP for every 1 SGD.$20 for every $2000 SGD spent  so 1%,btohqsg
Kept in nerf who knkw in future can't even use to pay bills like Telco then no use top up before the TCB amex nerf,btohqsg
Then no use topping up liao even before the 4 April date line zzzzz,btohqsg
Only foreign transactions above SGD10 is counted,btohqsg
ok means will be hard to get the instapointsüòí,btohqsg
And limited to SGD500 in FCY spend equivalent per txn. So it's crap for large FCY spend,btohqsg
Grab is not fit to appear in this channel liao everything cannot worse than cash.,btohqsg
unlike US (who needs to print money)  SG Gov will probably tap from reserve or Temasek will just buy over the bank temporary (technically bank have the money just illiquid). It's much safer in SG than US.,btohqsg
Anyone tried to top up NFP and whether this still works?,btohqsg

Sorry if this has been asked before. For HSBC EGA  does the deposit of $2k needs to be locked for the month to enjoy the additional cashback & interest? Will it count if I deposit and withdraw?Thanks!,btohqsg
Tried twice and only $128 each,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Also a good reminder that we should not leave things to last minute because  shxt happens like that,btohqsg

Good morning everyone  could you please let me know if Citibank offers any Mastercard debit cards with no fees when you open a new account and no annual fees? Thank you so much your helping :),btohqsg
These type of draw usually 90% is the lowest tier.,btohqsg
Citi Plus account? It comes with a debit card and 0.3% base interest  + 0.2% if you spend $500 a month on it,btohqsg
Hi  if I link my lady‚Äôs card (travel category) to my Instarem amaze and spend it overseas eg restaurants  do I earn the bonus points? Or have to be in dining category?,btohqsg
Hmm I think if u value a mile at 2-3 cents  and the fee is 1.5-2% it seems worth it. Anybody else has thoughts on this? I've read an article that says the cost of a mile is now more like 0.8 cents.,btohqsg

Hi@ChrisHMSG  notice there is a gap in awareness for supplementary card  considered making and episode of it? üòÉ,btohqsg
If it is that good. They will just maintain previous cash offer instead of lucky draw. It just a not so obvious reduced sign up promo.,btohqsg
Hi there  does Uob evol includes payment for healthhub?,btohqsg
my opinion  In a world of online and mobile payment wallets  I don't see the demand of supplementary cards anymore,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think u will get any points even if u choose restaurants category.,btohqsg
Yup last time supp card is for wife and kids but now CC is so accessible unlike the past.,btohqsg
Anyone happen to know what mcc code g2000 is?,btohqsg
Except some supp card with air lounge access,btohqsg
just to confirm  if i were to use instarem card overseas but underlying is say citi cash back card  i will still be subjected to instarem fx rates which i hear is very good? like using youtrip but on credit card,btohqsg
was about to say this. like the amex platinum card and i think a few other 120k cards where supp card have lounge access if not its not really needed,btohqsg
Yeah supp card still better than grab card üòÜ,btohqsg
my grab card is a toy for my daughter now,btohqsg
lock the card via app and let her throw around,btohqsg
Goes well with jipay card üòÜ,btohqsg
wa just now the dbs paylah heavy traffic cannot log in haha,btohqsg
Think they gonna get warning from mas again,btohqsg
FX rates on Instarem Amaze is about 2.5% worse than that of youtrip  but still better than that of credit cards. But good thing is still get the benefits like 4mpd or 8% rebate on the linked cards and 1% rebate equivalent on instarem points.,btohqsg
By transferring all OA to SA till FRS is achieved... Then drawing down oa to zero every month via mortgage?,btohqsg
This also means that there is zero buffer. If retrenchment comes  the account owner must be able to tank the mortgage full cash.,btohqsg
Also he cannot do rstu top up to reduce income tax,btohqsg
