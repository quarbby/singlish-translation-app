😂😂😂 my friend asked me if I want to help sit move to new campus,btohqsg
"My reply is ""only if I get paid !""",btohqsg
Nope uh so I rejected his invite 😂😂,btohqsg
Besides I bet SIT have budget to pay movers well lol,btohqsg
I mean a damn university here,btohqsg
I worked at event before 😅😅 there was a DEI conference held in sg and I was tasked to manage the event,btohqsg
Like the rate is quite decent,btohqsg
I was asked to manage the crowd control at scene and ensure the conference runs smoothly,btohqsg
is this worth it? saw an ad  registration is $28,btohqsg
i think you should check past papers,btohqsg
it's surprisingly pretty manageable  looks like O level type questions,btohqsg
a mix of chem bio and physics,btohqsg
idk if it'll be recognised like how SJBO is,btohqsg
the math section is nowhere near the imo,btohqsg
de moivre's theorem for complex numbers,btohqsg
yeah im afraid to do this and end up nobody recognise cus it's easy,btohqsg
am-gm and cs also not there,btohqsg
Not like it will be deducted,btohqsg
idw waste money LOL 28$ for useless cert,btohqsg
so better not? since the test lacking alot,btohqsg
might be good to put on tho,btohqsg
ur o level test same thing,btohqsg
I mean not like u will be on the streets or smth,btohqsg
Ahh US hosting science event sounds rather hilarious for me for all the wrong reasons,btohqsg
depends lehsome US competition can be damn hard,btohqsg
The public don't believe in sciences practically,btohqsg
Ironic for them to host such event,btohqsg
I mean if u get a good result btr then nth,btohqsg
okkk if I make it till the end can go Barcelona lmfao 🙏😨,btohqsg
nah I'm doing their science category  not interested in CS and math,btohqsg
I used to respect US as a STEM hub uh,btohqsg
I initially thought that US is a society scientifically literate enough to make decisions,btohqsg
Feel like just the media tends to exaggerate the extremes lol,btohqsg
I dw to ignite a war here but,btohqsg
Covid really must have disappointed me in how their public view sciences.... from reckless protest to lift lockdown early,btohqsg
Then their ppl also made decisions to protest against mask mandates in times of public health crisis when vaccination is on early stages ...  wow really badly damage their reputation fully,btohqsg
i mean sure but the public is separate from their academia side of things,btohqsg
I mean   sure   I use usa-made  vaccines and trust the manufacturing processes. The public behavior is beyond belief.,btohqsg
Is the new punggol coast mall 👻 or not?,btohqsg
The saddest part is sadly not JUST its public. Their government don't even believe in climate change  especially in US governments from 2016 till now.,btohqsg
not rly  punggol digital district area used to be forested terrain,btohqsg
the 👻 areas are mostly nearer to waterfront areas,btohqsg
the new SIT campus  punggol coast MRT & mall are still quite the distance away from the 👻beach area there are boards near the Police Coast Guards that dig a little deeper about the park's history,btohqsg
Is it harder to get into unis when I'm applying during my last year of ns,btohqsg
Cuz I'm guessing other people have already applied and there's lesser slots left now,btohqsg
why would there be lesser slots,btohqsg
"every year its a new batch so the slots gets ""renewed""",btohqsg
There's already people who have been accepted to next year's class right if that makes sense,btohqsg
wait sorry yeah i didnt think it through,btohqsg
well idk but there's no point in questioning it  just apply,btohqsg
