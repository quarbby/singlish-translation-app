omg it worked 😭🙏🙏 god blast u...,btohqsg
Wait.. It does show other brands?,btohqsg
but can someone seperate out what topics are in macro and micro cuz I'm extremely confused,btohqsg
hi does anyone have tips for history,btohqsg
i mean i'd say across all topics u'd prob need to study by framework tbvh,btohqsg
Essay dissection +  familiarise yourself with the basic essays. Usually the essay question are permutations of those essay qns  the scope and the focus of topic  and the phrasing is the one that throw ppl off. SBQ wise - be familiar with the key contextual knowledge  and practice more papers. Consult your teachers to check your answering techniques.,btohqsg
Essays also need practice  i would suggest practicing essay outlines while preparing for exams besides timed practice sessions.  This helps in essay dissection + clarification of thoughts process,btohqsg
memorising (that's how it works for me 🤣),btohqsg
SEQ is legit memory work and SBCS is just practice and practice and practice,btohqsg
and familiarising urself w the formats ofc,btohqsg
Yup. depends on which level you are at now  sec school or JC. The methods are roughly the same:) Memory work inevitable,btohqsg
i guess true. is just my take on this as someone who took pure history for O levels and H2 history at A levels. Now a history major also,btohqsg
hello!! may i ask what are the prospects of a history major? i did consider initially but it seems to be centered around only academia and education,btohqsg
"From NTU website on job prospects for majoring in History: ""History graduates are adept at research  analysis and writing. They can consider archival work  business  defence and intelligence research  diplomacy  education  journalism  publishing  project management  public relations and advertising  library and information operations  museum curation and management  policy-making  think-tank research  tourism  and even content development of computer games as potential future career options. """,btohqsg
In Uni  History is more than just memorizing. Is a total different ball game all together. Management of deadlines and readings to read for class is important or there goes your GPA,btohqsg
History modules are mainly assessed on your ability to write clearly and critically. Part of it would be your ability to contribute to class discussions. This can only be done if you read the assigned readings for the week.,btohqsg
The weightage of 1 essay can be as high as 50% of your grade for the module,btohqsg
how if you contrast this with polsci? why did u pick history over polsci or is it just due to sheer interest,btohqsg
3 5 pages long kinda essays? or thesis typa stuff,btohqsg
yah sia i realised the job prospects are quite similar,btohqsg
i think polsci a bit more employable tho esp in govt policy  embassy work  or like other civil service jobs,btohqsg
References and citation is necessary too. I guess so like the standards of a good argumentative and insightful essay. depending on the word count,btohqsg
and they can still take on history maj post-grad roles,btohqsg
I find history more suitable to my calling,btohqsg
ahh so its like an idiosyncratic assessment ah like a personal pref,btohqsg
even tho i do read up on political science things outside the curriculum. Planning to take political science modules as minor,btohqsg
i have nooo idea how uni essays works buct,btohqsg
its those really detailed stuff innit,btohqsg
basically we just find other essays online  translate to 2 diff languages  then translate it back to english and use it as our own :D,btohqsg
i can show a example of my recent essay i got A- for as a sample,btohqsg
yes wayyy HAHAAH copying without being flagged for plagiarism,btohqsg
should do that for my future essays,btohqsg
translate an english essay into chinese,btohqsg
oh we try to pick languages w a similar grammatical structure as EL so the grammatical cleanup afterwards is less tedious,btohqsg
like el > spanish > german > el,btohqsg
yeah you can take a look,btohqsg
this is my mid term essay for hh1004: science and tech in a historical perspective,btohqsg
and thats 50% of ur entire gpa?!,btohqsg
not 50% cos is mid term,btohqsg
not entire GPA is percentage for the grade of the module - 3Aus,btohqsg
I am taking the ICC modules and my UEs + another history module concurrently,btohqsg
yeah you dun just take one module XD This was me last year,btohqsg
so there is prescribed amount of AUs you need to clear in order to grad,btohqsg
then that amount is split btw ICCs + FCs  BDES/UEs( outside major)   MPE( major prescribed electives  modules non-core but still under history) and core modules,btohqsg
ooh u wanna do lit ah,btohqsg
idk what the heck is up with CHS,btohqsg
i wan do polsci... then i need do actual life sci mods wtf 💀💀,btohqsg
i was under the impression that chs,btohqsg
has alot of weird stuff sooo,btohqsg
AHAHA i guess there’s this nasty side of NUS,btohqsg
but i think it can be compensated with our robust and fully exploitable SU system to inflate our grades,btohqsg
and a more stable module registration system too,btohqsg
lol reminds me of NTU S/U policy and Star Wars XD,btohqsg
Star Wars is not a pleasant one  some ppl dun even get their core modules then,btohqsg
OH AND NUS pays for our overseas uni sch fees for student exchange programmes,btohqsg
NTU y’all gotta ownself pay the overseas uni as an international student i think(?),btohqsg
I am not too sure about that cos i dun plan to go overseas for exchange,btohqsg
and can apply for sponsorship for NUS too,btohqsg
either that or apply sponsorship from the partner university  which was what I did,btohqsg
that was long time ago. Not living allowance  one off payout,btohqsg
My student exchange was in Germany.German MOE side gave 5k which paid for the air ticket and student insurance with some spare  and then the partner university side sponsored my lodging.,btohqsg
wait how did u do it,btohqsg
like u email the partner uni?,btohqsg
was in the language preparation programme of NUS,btohqsg
so I took German from first semester  for 4 semesters. On the 4th semester  halfway through  they will invite applications  and once short-listed  there was an interview in German by the German lecturers,btohqsg
The German lady at the centre of the main picture was my German lecture lol,btohqsg
or get a pt job...i have lobang for one  4k a month  work remotely. interested parties can pm me  muz be above 21.and its a legit job  not use carousell scam ppl or be a sugarbaby  lazy ppl need not pm me,btohqsg
this is why we cant have good things.it is a legit role in an insurer  doing social media stuff (managing website  social media accounts  content-writing). it is sth rly suitable for students.  otot as long as u finish by dateline  no one cares u do at 2pm or 2am. work remotely.but it is ppl like u who wanna play police ...,btohqsg
wait insurer? then why do you need to know whether i give good blowjobs?,btohqsg
i dont work in that insurer. i said i got lobang,btohqsg
social media marketing need give blowjobs meh AHAHA,btohqsg
tell me how to give remote blowjobs,btohqsg
u didnt ask for a job,btohqsg
u want me ss show everyone?,btohqsg
do you kiss your mother with those lips of yours,btohqsg
aint no way u getting blowjobs with  that 41.4% hendrick's gin,btohqsg
yall might wanna do some damage control,btohqsg
tbh even if he's banned hes just gonna find another group to lurk,btohqsg
whatever makes him sleep well at night,btohqsg
funny how insurance turned into BJs and then social media,btohqsg
his pp so small might as well get insurance for it,btohqsg
gotta whip out the bbt straw for that,btohqsg
yes bossku u ownself read bro,btohqsg
i think Mr K joined the wrong gc,btohqsg
ya bro he thought this one nasi lemak,btohqsg
I also hv pt job lobang,btohqsg
hi  how long do poly and jc students study a day  respectively?,btohqsg
jc maybe ard 8h a day,btohqsg
back in my jc days about 3h/day not including lectures/tutorials,btohqsg
i study like 2-3 myself but i thot normally is 8,btohqsg
most time allocated to h2 math  least time allocated to h2 chem,btohqsg
^^ normal sch day alr so tiring,btohqsg
most of my 2-3 hours go into the tutorial,btohqsg
still didn't do well for As tho so depends on how you plan to some extent,btohqsg
hellos  shld i drop amath at this time? bc my amath is rly rly bad  been failing since sec 3 (F9 straight)  i'm starting to lose faith on myself for amath,btohqsg
I wanted lit more but they didn’t give it to meeeeee,btohqsg
no don’t drop a math is fun,btohqsg
it’s v useful if u wna take math in jc,btohqsg
I'd recommend u go for more consults or switch up your studying style,btohqsg
poly - towards the media side (planning to go NP),btohqsg
but it depends on which course u wna take too,btohqsg
but for someone who has never passed before  i see no choice but dropping,btohqsg
one of my classmates did ghat,btohqsg
gonna die for MYE n PRELIM why think o lvls,btohqsg
always gets F9 but then even when he anyhow do the paper he got C6,btohqsg
but if you take econs can exempt econs mod in uni,btohqsg
leave discord to degen on tele is it Bedok,btohqsg
just don’t drop it hahaha  just smoke through the paper for O’s if you really can’t and do your best,btohqsg
u gna scare tat boy away 😭😭,btohqsg
I’m leaving any scam group that I get added to,btohqsg
not even going to troll them any more,btohqsg
that’s why I changed it  so it doesn’t look like a scam name or anyth,btohqsg
can’t believe I got deleted because my name sounding like a scam one,btohqsg
but econs doesn’t like me back apparently,btohqsg
yea omg macro is so easy,btohqsg
no this is a graduate textbook,btohqsg
macro easy... dsge model only nia...,btohqsg
for olvl comb bio  is ecology a chapter u can score in or no,btohqsg
but it was CLT for my O’s last year,btohqsg
technically you can actually score in all the chapters though to be honest,btohqsg
ecology is more of an application qn than memorisation,btohqsg
you really have to read the question like its comprehension,btohqsg
some of it doesnt even test bio its just ur logic,btohqsg
Macro last time I like  because can anyhow write without as much technicals as micro.,btohqsg
"i was about to type ""go study leh""",btohqsg
later u fail mr tan disappointed in u,btohqsg

i think u should be more respectful,btohqsg
brother don’t say that i tell mom,btohqsg
mr tan i apologise on behalf of my sister first,btohqsg
okok mr tan i go study now 😭😭,btohqsg
I'm creating summary notes for my students 🙈,btohqsg
i just came home and im a late sleeper soooo,btohqsg

brother u the one up for adoption leh,btohqsg
sister u were the mistake eh why else would u be 9 months behind me,btohqsg
my prime is over urs hasnt,btohqsg
As for 4047 paper  i have contacted the publisher.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know how much does popular bookstore pay their part timer? I am asking for a fellow friend,btohqsg
what biz has he in a studies chat,btohqsg
poly u can not study at all if youd like and still pass,btohqsg
but if you want to do well need to study quite a bit,btohqsg
the deadlines usually motivate me so,btohqsg
i study alot less at the start,btohqsg
and ramp it up towards the end of sem b4 end sem exams,btohqsg
I prefer poly cause im in poly anyways,btohqsg
i See.. so basically you study mainly due to pressure from the deadlines and not rly self study other than watching lectures?,btohqsg
on what and how motivated u are,btohqsg
like for me since im generally lazy ish and only study to do mediocrely well,btohqsg
so i tend to study last min & do work quite close to deadline ah so my grades dun rly fuck up but im nowhere near a 4.0 student,btohqsg
but if you want to maintain anything above 3.5 you need more or less consistent revision & study esp if ur course is vv quiz and exam heavy,btohqsg
i got away with not studying alot beacuse abt 40-50% of my work is projects,btohqsg
which dun rly require studying per say,btohqsg
Its probably the usual retail rates between 7-9/hr,btohqsg
Still $7 after so many years?,btohqsg
SG is the true definition of slave labour lol.,btohqsg
Nope. Nowadays there ‘s a lot of $9-$10 per hour jobs.,btohqsg
7 is quite low  can find other jobs that pay higher,btohqsg
My friend earns $10 per hour for part time. Still think it ‘s quite low.,btohqsg
🥲everytime I go back my supervisor try to persuade me and my friend to work again,btohqsg
so I siam all the time,btohqsg
My friend works at a jap restaurant  12/hr  4 days per week,btohqsg
My driving lessons all start next month so dw to go look for job,btohqsg
Is important to have lessons consecutively in a week.,btohqsg
March hols end so fast tho,btohqsg
So long already I still see workers riding at the back of the pickup.,btohqsg
Yeah i feel that only a few companies bother to care abt the wellbeing of migrant workers,btohqsg
Therein lies alot of other factors at play than just leaving them there,btohqsg
Yeah but still kinda feel that safety is number 1 priority,btohqsg
They dont necessarily have a reason to,btohqsg
Have u seen the video where one of the migrant worker helped a lady take her airpods,btohqsg
some fnb usually pay more on weekends(+Fridays),btohqsg

I don't have habit to study after lecture or before lecture,btohqsg
But near test or exam on average will take 2 to 3 days to study,btohqsg
3 days is a better range  2 days kinda packed,btohqsg
very common to find above $10 also somehow,btohqsg
i feel last time q difficult to find pt jobs but now q common,btohqsg
Food delivery also technically above $10 per hour.,btohqsg
but it’s still quite decent tbh,btohqsg
depends on what you do also,btohqsg
some jobs pay less for the amount of work u do,btohqsg
but $6 is sufficient if all u do is to lepak,btohqsg
Would u wish that there is minimum wage,btohqsg
last time in year 2006  I count num of cars passing through a junction as part of statistics collection by LTA$10/hr,btohqsg
But then if have min wage,btohqsg
Everyone will just pay min wage,btohqsg
when counting at the expressway  it wasn't that easy,btohqsg
tbh if u shop around and is willing to travel somewhat $6 is still trash pay,btohqsg
that time i worked retail $7/hr it was trash,btohqsg
tbh idk if i shd be giving advice but generally try not to work jobs paying below $15/h cuz its rly rly not worth the time  like there are other better ways to make money,btohqsg
i worked starbucks for 7.50 an hour and that sucked hard,btohqsg
most pt jobs don't pay past 10-12 for base hourly rate thoo,btohqsg
however most of the higher paying jobs requires some form of certification thats easily obtainable in 2-3 days  like some examples include EMT  phlebotomy  lifeguard  kayak one star coach  or even music teaching/ academic tutoring,btohqsg
there are other options like event crews that pays 30-40/h that I did after O levels,btohqsg
it depends on whether they hiring + whether u can commit too,btohqsg
i worked $16/hr no contract but q long hours,btohqsg
Same but a Japanese buffet... It's scarring lol,btohqsg
i'm never drinking starbucks again 💀,btohqsg
retail and f&b really not advisable,btohqsg

hi jst crs how much do yall think a 17 yo jc student shld get for a monthly allowance ( include buying notes   transport ),btohqsg
Hmm roughly around 400 per month would be sufficient,btohqsg
I spend less than 100 per month lmao,btohqsg
My expenditure this month is alr 700+,btohqsg
Food at airport is quite ex,btohqsg
there is this 'hidden' canteen at the back for the airport  food prices there are way better,btohqsg

Scarly is deliver all the fragile things lmao,btohqsg
"later crash then say ""oops! im a capricorn so""",btohqsg
I don’t think it ‘s scam. It ‘s from FastJobs,btohqsg
The one that me and my friends do were all based on the package we deliver,btohqsg
Small parcel 1 dollar   medium were 1.50 and large were 2.50,btohqsg
Wait let me ask my friend,btohqsg
I know Pickupp is a low-ball service.,btohqsg
He found the work from fast jobs too btw,btohqsg
I do GrabExpress for part time. Not very ideal.,btohqsg
And he had to send one small parcel from sengkang atw to jurong,btohqsg
Just to earn 1.50   he quit on the spot lol,btohqsg
Sounds like Pickupp or something worse.,btohqsg
Yeah maybe is just the company he worked for ah,btohqsg
But I mean minimum 4k just for delivering is a lil sus already so...,btohqsg
Even GrabExpress pays you like $5+ for one package.,btohqsg
Just do Foodpanda if you want part time   actually good money if you are consistent ( for students),btohqsg
I saw a lot of people joining today.,btohqsg
The more you work  the higher your pay,btohqsg
The number of orders you get will dilute downwards…,btohqsg
My friend manage to earn 1k a week at one point of time ( bicycle btw ),btohqsg
I saw a lot of Foodpanda riders today.,btohqsg
