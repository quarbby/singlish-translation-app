I was thinking about that too. But will 1.3liter turbo engine enough for this heavy weight car?,btohqsg
as long as u like it  and take good care of it,btohqsg
no clue. im not a mercedes boy sadly. maybe u should test drive haha,btohqsg
or u can check the mycarforum. probably got other people opinions too,btohqsg
100 your fault if u cross into others lane can cause accidents,btohqsg
Then if you cannot pay up how?,btohqsg
Sunroof is pretty useless in SG. I cannot tahan hot,btohqsg
Like you really have no money to pay up and have to declare to court you‚Äôre bankrupt.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why police make you buy insurance. U know it‚Äôs illegal to drive without insurance. U can 100 claim but next year they can don‚Äôt insure u,btohqsg
If nobody willing to insure u. Sell car.,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre at fault and you don‚Äôt have money to pay claim. I tried finding online what to do liao,btohqsg
For a scenario like that GLA driver,btohqsg
Just ask the person to claim your insurance! I don‚Äôt understand simo pay claim? Pay excess u mean?,btohqsg
For my case  I cannot afford a claim,btohqsg
Omg how expensive? The most I saw is 2k,btohqsg
Declare bankruptcy for such matter is very silly.,btohqsg
Bankrupt liao u want to find job  buy house everything also tough,btohqsg
Got any experience when you dealt with such an accident?,btohqsg
And above 15k then can bankrupt leh,btohqsg
Not any amount can bankrupt one,btohqsg
Sorry la MG  I‚Äôm not that financially literate.,btohqsg
I just ask the person to claim my insurance if I cannot pay. I ever claim my headlamp and bumper 20k plus. Insurance full paid,btohqsg
Unless u tell me your insurance not comprehensive. Then up lorry liao,btohqsg
That means pay till I become penniless?,btohqsg
Sorry how old are u again? I think if not financially literate best is not drive. Driving is a money sucker in SG  only make you poorer that‚Äôs all.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in my mid-20s. I‚Äôm only getting license so that I could access to jobs that require that.,btohqsg
So I won‚Äôt be driving that frequently after I get my Class 3A,btohqsg
PHV has their own type of insurance if u are renting a car  they will include insurance,btohqsg
PHV drivers usually leases car and the lease package should include insurance,btohqsg
Heavy as hell. Cudnt even see road,btohqsg
How bad? Similar to the typhoon on Tuesday?,btohqsg
Still way more powerful than a jap/kor car w a 1.6l engine,btohqsg
1.3l throwing out 161bhp and 250nm torque....how not enough,btohqsg
list price 340k for xDrive20  m sport model. with some room for discount if u squeeze yr sales enough.  i think price point reasonable leh given the coe now,btohqsg
What is the hp and nm?,btohqsg
i buy for the novel new interior not for power. i drive 60kmh with seatbelt and buy with loan,btohqsg
Ahaha yeah I don‚Äôt really like the ‚Äújewel‚Äù box and v-shape door sides but I can understand the concept of creating a focus point,btohqsg
But I thought the M color only meant for X3 M50,btohqsg
totally my kind of look a d feel. hookedme immediately,btohqsg
not sure. when launch event come then go see. maybe avail on sports mode,btohqsg
Yeah that color is surely ‚ÄúM‚Äù colour,btohqsg
I got a M lite  so I know my ‚ÄúM‚Äù,btohqsg
was considering x1 m35 and this. decided to stick with zf8 and standard b48 layout,btohqsg
but based on this screenshot. the mirror not m style so we will find out again when launch event in nov or dec,btohqsg
maybe m sport trim have special this time,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt get the 1x 35m because no iconic glow üòÇ the iconic glow is a must if you getting the new generation of BMWs. It stands out at night,btohqsg
one of the reason also haha,btohqsg
guess u have the x2m35. too bad the rear headroom too low for my family. they mainly tall pple haha,btohqsg
This is the new standard Liao,btohqsg
U go check. I read a lot of reviews only x3 m50 get this interior color according to autogefuhl. But good to know if SG gets special,btohqsg
