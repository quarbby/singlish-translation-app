Nvm  I no rush  car bring service later anyway,btohqsg
Going to be tough week ahead.  Maybe this 2 days will have announcement,btohqsg
Ya  seemed like many hawkers closed ady,btohqsg
Can I ask for those mission from 4 to 9pm  the jobs only count towards those jobs I accepted after 4pm?,btohqsg
I don't seem to hit target,btohqsg
Yes  only valid for jobs accepted between 4pm-9pm,btohqsg
Job accepted from 4pm onwards and picked up by 8.59pm...,btohqsg
Nobody want to send things today or tmr ah? Cause of holiday surchage ü§£,btohqsg
Alright thanks!  Nowadays hard to achieve  fingers not fast enough,btohqsg
can achieve  u have to focus on ur orders,btohqsg
far u also bid will lose,btohqsg
so focus on ur area or move to one with more orders,btohqsg
now if near town just camp town,btohqsg
pickup time has to be 4pm to 8.59pm. you have to swipe complete for all qualifying jobs before 9pm.u can take advance job but the mission will state incomplete and they will recalculate and credit the incentives directly on Tuesday afternoon (this week maybe on Wed afternoon)if all the jobs are taken after mission start time  u have to redeem the mission once it is made available on Wednesday morning.,btohqsg
swipe waacow by big mistake!!! heng cancelled,btohqsg
back in the ‚Äúhay‚Äù days when the masters/experts r here  stacking trumps parking fee lol,btohqsg
or areas where u can park without ganna parking,btohqsg
Oh my so all de master gone le?,btohqsg
all i can say is u got to weigh ur opportunity cost‚Ä¶ getting orders for mission vs having to rush to siam parking fee and within 10-15mins grace,btohqsg
or stack 2 same pick up orders,btohqsg
cos bottom line  the fee includes parking fee,btohqsg
True but I try to avoid town if can parking is a nightmare,btohqsg
so u have to fight for other orders,btohqsg
