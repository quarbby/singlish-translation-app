eh  doesnt affect my life anyways,btohqsg
i see ppl talking bout coding,btohqsg
hah i can print hello world,btohqsg
i can use M$ excel formulas im a programming genius now!!,btohqsg
True programming chads don’t even know what is latex,btohqsg
lmao ezpz bros =sum(A1:A10) where's my nobel prize,btohqsg
u dont need python anymore for data just use excel,btohqsg
which plebs use python for data lmao,btohqsg
OMG I GOT A1 FOR EXCEL,btohqsg
Why use pd when csv will work#standard_library#csv#`from csv import reader`,btohqsg
Why use python when can use C,btohqsg
Why use C when you can use hardware directly,btohqsg

Next one someone will post the 1 0 circuits on a microscope,btohqsg
unfortunately this is just the ascii representation of the aforementioned asm code (which is not machine language yet!) converted to bytes :/,btohqsg

hello is anyone from here in nus law? I have a question to ask please!,btohqsg
Can convert all the non-movs to movs pls?,btohqsg
I got a homework from school asking me to only use MOVs in ASM to perform something/s,btohqsg
Sure just use python to replace all non mov instructions to mov,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionyo we finished all the prac,btohqsg
Does that mean you’re going to unit early,btohqsg
But HBL is probably like until circuit breaker ends,btohqsg
So wouldn’t count on it being Long,btohqsg
hearsay today new cases hitting 700+?,btohqsg
Tested yesterday   tdy announce to us zzz,btohqsg
if is mostly foreign workers then still not as bad i think,btohqsg
If not i tell u ggwp,btohqsg
If not means the cb is useless,btohqsg
Yeahh been a week and two days alr,btohqsg
The effect should start kicking in,btohqsg
Most likely they gonna extend again,btohqsg
Tbh sg slow la with the cb,btohqsg
unless people kena and infect their family also,btohqsg
But dk if sch will continue hbl,btohqsg
June exams already cancelled I thought,btohqsg
Sec sch alr no MYE le,btohqsg
Jc block test also cancelled right,btohqsg
jc july still have for now,btohqsg
but is in july tho  if extend one month then end of may only,btohqsg
Unless they wanna do online exam like uni,btohqsg
still got june hopefully can buffer,btohqsg
cannot sia my friend spin the wheel to answer mcq for uni test,btohqsg
Uni online exam is in a mess,btohqsg
Maybe got confused with the myes,btohqsg
I bet alot of ppl googled,btohqsg
my friend say got people live stream the test on discord somemore,btohqsg
JC doesn’t have any June exams either,btohqsg
if 700+ we hitting 4K cases,btohqsg
JC MYEs are technically not postponed HAHA,btohqsg
It became a 'class test' instead,btohqsg
my teachers say jc if mye cancelled then they give you the paper as practice paper,btohqsg
I doubt they could leave something as important as that to online,btohqsg
They use examplify lock down ur laptop,btohqsg
shag lah march i fail like dk what alr😂,btohqsg
They use zoom to see u lorh,btohqsg
1 laptop examplify another one to zoom,btohqsg
You are zoomed the whole exam,btohqsg
Thats what 1 of my mod is doing,btohqsg
1 laptop examplify 1 laptop zoom,btohqsg
But even zoom can’t see everything,btohqsg
tutorials i just tell my cher i using monitor so no webcam🤡,btohqsg
Just put some notes at your feet,btohqsg
Stick some notes to the screen itself,btohqsg
Then change a level to open book lorh,btohqsg
It would be so much harder,btohqsg
Open book exam dosent mean easy leh,btohqsg
They can set way harder qns,btohqsg
No more definition questions or some shit,btohqsg
A level is set years in advance,btohqsg
There isn’t one in the first place,btohqsg
Shouldnt differ too far from actual score,btohqsg
My school always give some stupid concept set,btohqsg
Its like all the definition for each chapter written down,btohqsg
But it can get messy cuz they give chapter by chapter,btohqsg
How else could they organise it,btohqsg
Since a chapter would be about 2 pages then why not just make a small booklet for it,btohqsg
Not everyone is neat enough to keep those in a file,btohqsg
I think that’s kind of a basic expectation at this point  that you care enough to organise your own materials,btohqsg
The tutors got no time to bother about that,btohqsg
Its not about bothering or not  its not a drastic change,btohqsg
Rather give a booklet once and for all rather than  giving one after another after some time,btohqsg
dont get why they give out bit by bit,btohqsg
Lmao imagine being able to afford 2 laptops,btohqsg
Well time for them to pilot it out for real if the need arises,btohqsg
or just use estimated grades.. (inflation yay!),btohqsg
i mean the UK is doing it for their a levels,btohqsg
i wonder if they r still setting out papers,btohqsg
Today's number of new cases supposedly got leaked out,btohqsg
Damn  did u change ur name,btohqsg
Who do u think u r talking to,btohqsg
wow these stickers need to be removed,btohqsg
just realise my laptop can run the games i wanna run,btohqsg
no need for new gaming laptop alr,btohqsg
"The 28-day circuit breaker ""may not be enough"" if Singaporeans continue to flout COVID-19 restrictions  minister Masagos Zulkifli says.https://cna.asia/2VCTYYS",btohqsg
Im laughing at such a ridiculous number,btohqsg
If 728 they wouldve done an address in the morning,btohqsg
but prob for additional 2 weeks,btohqsg
they would do it on fri,btohqsg
They should open all shop for a week,btohqsg
Then go back to CB again,btohqsg
I need to buy my art supplies,btohqsg
MY shipment is still stuck in japan,btohqsg
Just 1 week after 4 may,btohqsg
Then we can go back to another 1 month of cb 2.0,btohqsg
lmao i was dead the first 2-3 days,btohqsg
but now i feel more alive,btohqsg
Yes I ran out of canvases,btohqsg
Bruh my routine is do nth whole day,btohqsg
Is there a sgexams Minecraft server,btohqsg
Yeah I picked it up recently and fell in love with painting,btohqsg
@dekitacan you make a 24h Minecraft server for sgexams,btohqsg
U would have to spend a lot,btohqsg
You don’t have to do nothing,btohqsg
If u wan a high traffic one,btohqsg
But that was for the internal team right,btohqsg
U can plan something for yourself,btohqsg
I'll dedicate 1 day a week to it,btohqsg
If you keep the server up,btohqsg
Which is why I was confused when u said there’s no minecraft server,btohqsg
Prove estimator is unbiased.Find unbiased estimator of Standard Deviation.,btohqsg
if the uk and the rest of the world inflate their grades  its only sensible moe does the same if not we will lose out internationally,btohqsg
US is alr suffering from grade inflation  but yet SG isnt experiencing such an issue,btohqsg
the uk is inflating the gradrs its on the news m8,btohqsg
Wtf is 'lose out internationally' tbh,btohqsg
That will make their certs worthless tbh,btohqsg
At the end of the day,btohqsg
To the admissions officers  they will know that sg a lvls are on a totally different level from uk a lvls,btohqsg
They are just making their own national exams 'easier' to do well and thus harder for candidature differentiation,btohqsg
How different level are you really though?Note that there's a very broad spectrum of 'A-levels' in UK,btohqsg
aren't they even stricter w intl applicants though,btohqsg
There will still be a difference ba,btohqsg
Not specific to UK. Everyone is stricter with international. Same for NUS,btohqsg
because the point of their universities is to grant admission to mostly uk residents,btohqsg
Ultimately is inevitable the bulk of places are reserved for locals,btohqsg
our A levels are pegged against a certain standard of cambridge CIE. moe has the liberty to tweak the grades and bell curve to extent deemed reasonable by cambridge,btohqsg
if cambridge inflates grades  we shd too,btohqsg
Theres no bell curve  jesus lol,btohqsg
Why do still people believe in that,btohqsg
Deemed reasonable? Pretty sure SEAB can internally set any grade mapping.,btohqsg
I don't think it's a contract.,btohqsg
All marks to letters are mappings.,btohqsg
hv to.. if not cambridge will not allow moe to use their name,btohqsg
Maybe during my time 5 yrs ago yes,btohqsg
But MOE said 2 yrs ago  bell curve doesnt exist for national exams,btohqsg
And ppl still believe theres a bell curveAmen rly,btohqsg
cutoff and bell curve work similarly,btohqsg
moe can decide proportion of stidents getting A/B,btohqsg
Cut off is based off raw expectations,btohqsg
Really dunno where this info come from but ok. As far as I can say CAMB means jackshit in terms of secondary and/or post-secondary education.,btohqsg
Bell curve is relative to cohort performance,btohqsg
U realise  proportion of A/B grades are never fixed,btohqsg
There was a year %A grades for H2 chem fell by 5-6%,btohqsg
it cannot be raw expectations if papers difficulty differ between yeats,btohqsg
And as long they hit the minimum  its an A,btohqsg
If the extremes are hit  SEAB will have to internally justify it,btohqsg
That raw minimum is basically the A1-F9 and A-U grade levels,btohqsg
aren't the percentages roughly similar each year,btohqsg
Is more or less the same,btohqsg
ya thats why its by percentage,btohqsg
Not just Cambridge but the DGEs should be aware why SEAB need to look at extremes.,btohqsg
I remember there was 1 year H1 GP was 25.8% A,btohqsg
Another year it was only 20.1% A,btohqsg
So it will never be a fixed proportion,btohqsg
ya cos they change the percentage every year,btohqsg
And why would they do that,btohqsg
Or else how you do you justify the % increase in pw As from 40% in 2000s to 56% nationally in recent years?,btohqsg
The process is very simpleStudent sits for exam ——-fly over to uk ——-> UK mark ——sent back beep boop ——> SEAB sees number. Decides what to do with number,btohqsg
theres a balance between cohort performance and individual scores,btohqsg
More students simply hit the minimum raw score  and hence get the grade,btohqsg
If i follow ur logic  then we are fucked  bell curve dictates all subjects to cap at 25% As,btohqsg
moe can change the minimum raw score,btohqsg
That’s like the activation energy thing,btohqsg
I wont see 50.7% As for H2 Math  but 25% As instead,btohqsg
its not a fixed proportion goddamit,btohqsg
Well yes  there will always be a proportion of people getting A and B,btohqsg
But the existence of a bell curve doesnt justify why do different subjects have such huge contrast in %As,btohqsg
but raw expectations are not fixed ether,btohqsg
Fitting to any distribution means A% is capped assuming no need for tie-breaking policies,btohqsg
a bell curve doesnt need to have its peak in the centre,btohqsg
No one said it has to B,btohqsg
Go on  this bio nerd is listening,btohqsg
....... Do you know what you are saying?,btohqsg
im just saying that bell curve tends to fix proportion of grades awarded,btohqsg
TheSingapore Examinations and Assessment Board(Abbreviation:SEAB;Chinese: 新加坡考试与评鉴局;Malay:Lembaga Peperiksaan Singapura) is astatutory boardunder theMinistry of Education(MOE) ofSingapore.,btohqsg
but the use of a minimum raw score  like 70 for A  60 for B helps u to get the grade instead,btohqsg
This feature is not specific to 'bell curves',btohqsg
just that this minimum raw score shifts occassionally,btohqsg
yea grade boundaries kind of does that,btohqsg
On second thought it doesn’t really make sense,btohqsg
but it doesnt rly fix a proportion,btohqsg
If I take this logic I might as well say PMO decide my grade and your grade right? Cuz PM is head of PMO  and PM is head of cabinet. Cabinet make executive decision  inclusive of whether to even fund SEAB. Hence PMO decides your grade.,btohqsg
This took you very Long to type,btohqsg
I wanted to type what I meant,btohqsg
But I realised it made no sense,btohqsg
theres someone called mr ong ye kung,btohqsg
i doubt he knows how it works,btohqsg
Wikipedia:All percentages with their corresponding grades shown here are just approximate guidelines because ultimately at the end of all major examinations (Primary School Leaving Examinations or PSLE in short  GCE N  O and A Levels) the Ministry of Education  Singapore  will *Moderate* the results. Hence  an A grade for instance may no longer be at 70%. It could possibly be 68% or even 73% depending on the performance of the cohort. This is usually done to preventgrade inflation.,btohqsg
u cant give everyone A just because they all did wekk,btohqsg
Lol I think he knows  I not sure if he want to get involved though. He can since COVID-19 is like catch-all justification for any kind of action.That said I still don't think he wants to get involved with SEAB's setting of grades.,btohqsg
This is not a valid argument.,btohqsg
More like they set a shitty paper,btohqsg
but usually i see ministers as ppl just speaking publicly of what happens in a ministry  with a scholar guiding them what to say,btohqsg
ya thats why its by percentage  and their mood ofc,btohqsg
Scholar only tell you X-year Y-students did Z-paper. Psychometrically this meant ABC and so XYZ.,btohqsg
You can’t give 1 out of 2 of all H2 Maths students A just because they did well,btohqsg
mm ye  was referring to that,btohqsg
Perm Secs are not secs. They are also not PR managers.,btohqsg
a percentage cannot lead to 1 or 2 persons (thats less than 1%?!),btohqsg
since when mor says top 50 percentile can get A...,btohqsg
unless the paper was hard n everyony did well,btohqsg
Actually  a naive implementation can. Not that I know of any course (e.g. Uni) which does this.Uni-wise  once cohort size <10 or <15  all grading standard rules are dropped.,btohqsg
still its their discretion  no hard and fast rule,btohqsg
Since when did they publicly say anything explicit about national exam grading at all,btohqsg
No discretion or power is unfettered in Singapore's public service.,btohqsg
I hate A level F math,btohqsg
Cause the other 50% didn’t do well enough to meet the minimum mark,btohqsg
the minimum mark again is decided by moe and can change when exam difficulty changes,btohqsg
The term 'unfettered power' is basically a phrase by itself  though yes the meaning likely comes from that.,btohqsg
so its a balance between percentile and raw performance in essense,btohqsg
Ugh we’re here talking about structure of Govt and I’m procrastinating a paper about public administration in SG 🙃,btohqsg
simi balance? you think New Balance?It's just an excel spreadsheet. Shift numbers around only,btohqsg
If the min mark was 70 and everyone got 70  then that’s 100% distinction,btohqsg
Just praise and praise can liao ez A,btohqsg
mark breakpoints will affect grading changes due to raw performance,btohqsg
Even if not A still got B+,btohqsg
percentiles will moderate the impact of shitty cohort perfomance,btohqsg
Lol it’s not a good or bad paper it’s a nature paper,btohqsg
#conspiracytheoryif everyone got 70  set a random seed and add random truncated gaussian noise to all scores and use that as the final score so there is no 100% distinction.,btohqsg
actually cambridge also tweaks the raw score.. theres something called a mark scheme,btohqsg
Nature as in how do you characterise and understand it,btohqsg
Then the people who should get A may not get it,btohqsg
All papers that lay claim to being objective are subjective.,btohqsg
theres the percentile factor to mitigate this impact,btohqsg
Nobody is trying to be objective,btohqsg
This is in response to dunkin’s suggestion,btohqsg
Are yall that worried about grades,btohqsg
Basically the projected US unemployment rate is ~10%,btohqsg
you cant be unemployed if you are infected (unable to work) 🧐,btohqsg

We need to prepare for a hegemonic world order under CN,btohqsg
No because i cannot download it for some reason. I'll try again soon,btohqsg

How are people so confident a retard won't get a second term,btohqsg
That retard made it while Bernie didn't,btohqsg

It's been more than a week since CB,btohqsg
Not too bad right if u think abt it3 april it was 65,btohqsg
It's hosted on my server lol,btohqsg
I thought you meant roblox server/s,btohqsg
linked cases will still have cos if someone in a family gets it the others in the same household will kena also,btohqsg
I dont have really have HBL,btohqsg
i can't study at home 😭,btohqsg
The trick to HBL is to spend a few days being a degenerate couch potato neet,btohqsg
Then once you exhaust all your entertainment you'll want to do your work,btohqsg
Father John Smith has spoken wise words,btohqsg
I wonder if SG will do CN-style  1 building  1 family only 1 exit per 14 days,btohqsg
I have been exhausting it one week before HBL till now 😭😭,btohqsg
So John Smith is a couch potato now?,btohqsg
U must be 110% motivated now then,btohqsg
just oozing out of that sticker,btohqsg
Honestly a good stickerpack tho omg lol,btohqsg
That’s the same as being 110% motivated I guess,btohqsg
Wait is someone creating a skribbl room,btohqsg
Actually yes that happened to me,btohqsg
Surprised none of yall are commenting on how terribly the government has mismanaged the situation in worker's dormitories,btohqsg
Rich people got their money's worth,btohqsg
Unless you are willing to say fk you to all the people signing their pay checks,btohqsg
Then there's little point in social commentary,btohqsg
I'm trying to learn how to typeset in latex,btohqsg
stop trying to make use of this situation to learn something new,btohqsg
I'm slacking off from slacking off,btohqsg
Hahahah i just count the calories in my food,btohqsg
Then all the way to dinner,btohqsg
A lot of rice + chickpeas + vegiies and 1/3 pound cake,btohqsg
Don't give yourself more entertainment outlets,btohqsg
Now fucking drank coconut and the skin,btohqsg
Actually I wonder how much is my caloric intake now that yall are discussing that,btohqsg
I only eat 2 meals a day,btohqsg
i ate a whole bag of chips today,btohqsg
just run daily will improve one,btohqsg
now i nth to do i everyday go for run,btohqsg
covid19 just made me recently realise how inept world leaders and govt orgs can be and how they could lack more common sense than an avg person,btohqsg
spain opening up their borders  barely recovered,btohqsg
singapore only implemented cb when shit really went down,btohqsg
They know exactly what they're doing.,btohqsg
The number of infected is just a number,btohqsg
as if US gdp is gonna have an upward trend with the things they doing at this rate,btohqsg
Haha if you downplay the virus and encourage ppl to move about,btohqsg
And have a voter base that eats your words like it's some candy,btohqsg
actually  their money minded mindset is exactly why we shouldnt trust them,btohqsg
Anyway it's impossible for some countries to impose social gathering,btohqsg
imagine being so damn superficial and egoistic,btohqsg
But we kinda don't really have a choice,btohqsg
yeah lets see what happens months down the road,btohqsg
Wishing I could get fries at this hour,btohqsg
dats why must always hav food prepped at home,btohqsg
I won't be able to fry French fries at 1am in the morning,btohqsg
Without my grandma coming out to scold me  that is 😂,btohqsg
i once baked cookies at 5am,btohqsg
ok tbf i was pulling an all nighter,btohqsg
next day was project submissions and valentines day,btohqsg
This doesn't feel very healthy xd,btohqsg
Are you trying some weight loss thingy?,btohqsg
who has started grinding for O level ?,btohqsg
Unfortunately next week my Mother work at home use my PC,btohqsg
6 pts HAHAHA good one . personally   I feel that 6 points would be struggle with the bloody situation,btohqsg
i'm grinding 25 hrs per day to compensate and to get 6 points,btohqsg
Tbh 6 points is only useful for JC/Poly application beyond that useless liao,btohqsg
Yes then RI will increase COP,btohqsg
ya but if you get into sch's with lower COP  you probs have a higher chance of doing well for As due to peer pressure and possibly better teaching departments,btohqsg
Depends u know coz some people legit can’t take the stress from the competition,btohqsg
But tbh once u get into JC,btohqsg
No matter how high or Low ur COP is,btohqsg
A levels is different ball game,btohqsg
Basically once u get into JC dun keep looking back at ur Os and say could’ve done better,btohqsg
U can make ur Os results not affect ur As results by working hard for JC,btohqsg
ya so impt to get into the sch with peeps who are around your level. just enough to make you feel the pressure  but not too much,btohqsg
can la  but the environment plays a huge role imo,btohqsg
Or if u go to higher cop school you’ll feel motivated and better about yourself,btohqsg
Depends on the kind of person u r I guess,btohqsg
Just a little bit  or full water parade?,btohqsg
then you could possibly become complacent cos you're doing relatively well compared to sch  but that may be strictly so compared to the national avg,btohqsg
drink to the point of thirst,btohqsg
The lower COP school thing sometimes not tru,btohqsg
ACJC lower COP but A level results lower RP than TJC,btohqsg
Even if u exclude the IP for TJC,btohqsg
It’s 79.8 RP vs 82 RP,btohqsg
but i think the it holds true for most JCs,btohqsg
Or ACJC is the one that’s special,btohqsg
Their COP dun rly match their RP if I’m being honest,btohqsg
Some TJC are like VJ rejects,btohqsg
But still tbh TJ IP not like Super good,btohqsg
There is like one 4 H2 PCME class with like mostly scholars+IP coz like none of them take H1 mt at all then the next mostly 4 H2 PCME class only half IP and half JAE but then in the end that 2nd class did better in average RP,btohqsg
I dun even know how bad that first 4 H2 PCME class did,btohqsg
I heard like the whole class failed like one of the chem exams or some shit,btohqsg
"""Good"" is a subjective term anyways",btohqsg
Ur COP high also can come back one,btohqsg
But sometimes ppl with high cop end up doing well also cos maybe something happened during O lvls also,btohqsg
And some people with Low COP their studying styles just dun work for A levels,btohqsg
Ye As a bit more forgiving of careless mistakes,btohqsg
:( that wouldn’t help me cos I’ll first need to get rid of my conceptual weakness,btohqsg
While true  and while I recognise you did caveat “some”  I just want to say that some are just not suited for the A level system  it’s really sad seeing some of my Friend work very hard but just don’t do well because they just straight up chose the wrong route.,btohqsg
Apparently NYJC didn't do as well last year compared to two years ago,btohqsg
Grades will be more evenly distributed,btohqsg
Since flattening the curve is the in thing right now,btohqsg
Heard that yesterday got some leak for COVID or smtg?,btohqsg
ppl knew is 700+ cases alr,btohqsg
You know anywhere can get the leak document?,btohqsg
Isn’t this group supposed to be about studies and exams?,btohqsg
I got econs test tmrw ><,btohqsg
It's a general chat group lol,btohqsg
You can talk about exams if you want Xd,btohqsg
Ah I see I see haha.,btohqsg
Thanks for replying to my message ye,btohqsg
Almost everyone here ignores me :(,btohqsg
There’s a srs study questions only group,btohqsg
