Driver staying at Sixth Avenue complains about Renault Kadjar blocking the gate to the house and gets immediate backlash🫢Bro  some say even a military tank can fit through that space 😂👉🏻 React with 🤣 if you would have just honked instead of waiting for 30 minutes!➡️ Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
I driving a small suv so I sure can go in 🤭🤭 but would definitely need wide turning angle (serene sure bua either side of the car 😂😂 sorry for that). I won't horn the car but I definitely find it very rude of the Renault...its like your neighbour's visitor put his bicycle blocking half of your doorway even though you can still sideway in...,btohqsg
Some cars might still fit in if they go nose in,btohqsg
But what if the owner wants to reverse in?,btohqsg
Not about if the owner of the house can or not,btohqsg
But more of the Renault just parking in the wrong place,btohqsg
Common sense tell U u shudnt block someone's hse,btohqsg
Common sense aint so common then again,btohqsg
Etiquette seems to be lacking in our society nowadays,btohqsg
So moral of the story  if stay in landed  make sure you own a forklift,btohqsg
Yes. It’s like.. would you put your shoe cupboard partially blocking your neighbour’s door? It seems like some might think there is nothing wrong with that since… the flat owner can still squeeze out? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Your convenience may not be other people convenience. If ppl didnt see ur shoe  trip and fall  who’s fault sia,btohqsg
dont think its legal to tow other ppl car,btohqsg
Anyone know which workshop I can go to  to do this carbon fiber door handle  I need a hole for the button on the driver side,btohqsg
This carbon fiber door handle cover didn’t came with the hole button when I bought it online,btohqsg
Or should I just ownself drill a hole?,btohqsg
How to make the first hole sis?,btohqsg
Use it to break a hole,btohqsg
Or take marker and trace outline of the hole,btohqsg
Drill a hole then slowly file it to shape?,btohqsg
^ this first  then drill then slowly file it to shale yeap,btohqsg
Prepare vacuum cleaner nearby so that fine CF don’t get into cabin while drilling.,btohqsg
Or discard the taobao/Shopee purchase and go to a wrap shop to do CF handle wrap 😄😄,btohqsg
Didn’t know you roll that way.,btohqsg
More and more are coming out the closet,btohqsg
You think the government put ceramic coating on 377A?,btohqsg
They use sonax spray and seal,btohqsg
Wrap exp depending on where u go leh,btohqsg
Illegally driven VW Golf R (with multiple fines) overtakes from road shoulder and evades parking by destroying a gantry arm 😱Even the recent $450 payout from the government also cannot cover all the fines this Golf R has accumulated over a single month. 🫢👉🏻 React with 🤬 if you think this driver deserves to have his license revoked!➡️ Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
"""👉🏻 React with 🤬 if you think this driver deserves to have his license revoked!”Bot so hostile",btohqsg
Hostile emoji not hostile actions can liao,btohqsg
But this vw rlly xs. Got $$ buy car no $$ pay parking,btohqsg
Also no RT if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
LTA is just a paper tiger. This kind of thing they rlly need enforce.,btohqsg
So likely no insurance as well if his road tax has been due for a while,btohqsg
If no road tax  no insurance? He bang someone how?,btohqsg
100% loan and probably made only a few payments… plenty of such,btohqsg
But in all seriousness  they would personally be liable  and I assume it’s a civil suit  but I don’t know if it’s worth it if the value of claim is <50k,btohqsg
They have no $ to pay the damages,btohqsg
And if it’s more than 50k  seeing he’s driving an expired RT VW  most likely he doesn’t have 50k,btohqsg
Hope tp or lta ask him lim kopi,btohqsg
This statement applies to many cars...,btohqsg
As per my prev statement.. etiqutte seems to be severely lacking nowadays,btohqsg
that's a random question - J,btohqsg
W. T. F. Is a censored word lol - J,btohqsg
Yeap you can do it line that - J,btohqsg
Means you drive rolls royce? 😱,btohqsg
Private jet your weekend ride 😎,btohqsg
In the first place  he no integrity and cares for himself only,btohqsg
