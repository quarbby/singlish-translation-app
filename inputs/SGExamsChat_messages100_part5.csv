I know people who write notes for 3-5 hrs,btohqsg
Which is why hours is a silly measure of productivity,btohqsg
i realised  I have never made notes in my life,btohqsg
Notes are nice when I want to organise my knowledge,btohqsg
Get all the important formulas and shit in one place,btohqsg
The usefulness of making your own notes is dependent on individuals.,btohqsg
wait what have i made notes for,btohqsg
Thats why. Even if we give u mean hours to study after everyone has given their input. How u use those hours is on u. How much u retain is on u. How much u actually study depends on u,btohqsg
some answers are subjective  but it doesn’t mean i can’t gauge the premise of the answers so as to have a slightly vague idea lmao,btohqsg
I’ve done  15 hour days for two months,btohqsg
ah  reminds me of why i hated english and humanities,btohqsg
"At the same time  do you want us to control how you study? And you blindly following our ""orders""",btohqsg
my answers for english were always way off,btohqsg
He asking for advise only not asking us control him also,btohqsg
not exactly. i’m not very exposed to the system so i’m not sure what ‘too much’ is.,btohqsg
But I think end of the day is to find a studying method you prefer  not everyone would do notes tbh,btohqsg
I for myself  do reinforced learning ish. So something like putting answers on quizlet to memorise,btohqsg
I got tired of distilling 200 words from 15k words doc,btohqsg
Doing notes take a lot of time and effort,btohqsg
Back in secondary school  I find 1 hour of revision is too much. However  others think that it is too little.,btohqsg
How about you study until u give up and cant be productive anymore. That will be ur highest potential productivity.,btohqsg
Until u can effectively study that amount of time,btohqsg
yea I usually study until I give up,btohqsg
Ah gym  the good old gym,btohqsg
But somehow now  y effort doesn’t correlate with results much,btohqsg
And a lot of times I don’t even have control over my time and effort,btohqsg
If that doesnt work u need to ask these alr,btohqsg
What r u doing with ur HPPP,btohqsg
iirc AS levels is like the easier counterpart to the A levels,btohqsg
but its like 2 different exams,btohqsg
Effort is not the main factor,btohqsg
AS is just intermediary between nothing and A2,btohqsg
but it’s the factor i can’t control :),btohqsg
U dunno shit u ask someone who know shit to teach,btohqsg
Ah but like I'm curious what's the difference if I apply with a sg A level cert you know,btohqsg
I think unis dont take AS,btohqsg
I think in general H1s are ignored and H2s are equivalent to A Levels,btohqsg
How u long time no see,btohqsg
Wah International foundation after o level save a lot of years sia,btohqsg
Eh never seen that through my 'researching',btohqsg
Not rich enough to do that though,btohqsg
Ya I think foundation might be right for some ppl,btohqsg
But top courses don’t have foundation pipeline,btohqsg
oh my that would be REALLY REALLY helpful,btohqsg
Some have some don’t have la,btohqsg
Need a lot of money lol,btohqsg
Enter workforce at younger age seem quite cool,btohqsg
Huh where is this coming from,btohqsg
After o level can do international foundation,btohqsg
Actually is ok to be later La,btohqsg
