Yup that is why I’m talking bout mobile games,btohqsg
You know there is something a super attractive person will never get to experience?,btohqsg
It’s called the meaning of life,btohqsg
They won’t even need the meaning of life being attractive do they?,btohqsg
I'm new here and I have a question how long does it take for RP's Enrolment information to arrive?,btohqsg

Cutting incrreases pullups faster than gymming,btohqsg
idk why when people become rich...the first thing they dont go out to find is on how to get a lifetime supply of anything,btohqsg
i read somewhere that every former US president have lifetime security,btohqsg
cause i was thinking...what if you are no longer rich...at least you have a lifetime supply of something? right,btohqsg
like you are rich  buy a plane ticket...that ticket allows you to fly on any airline for the rest of your life,btohqsg
And why wld i no longer be rich,btohqsg
so even if you become poor...you still got that invaluable airline ticket,btohqsg
The amt of money used to buy the lifetime supply of smth cld be better used in times where we become poor,btohqsg
alot of reasons can result in that,btohqsg
If ur poor wld u rather a lifetime supply of plane ticketsOr money that cld be better used,btohqsg
bruh if i spin this narattive..i could say the same for branded goods,btohqsg
But no one buys a lifetime supply of branded goods,btohqsg
i mean you can buy the whole company,btohqsg
depending on how rich you are,btohqsg
but then there will be no point...,btohqsg
The point is that if u suddenly become poorA lifetime supply of smth is not as worth as the huge sum of money u paid for that,btohqsg
when i mention the airline ticket...it was like 250k,btohqsg
Uhhuh so if u suddenly poor udw 250k? GAHA gimme bro i want,btohqsg
when you think about it..before you become poor. would you not spend that 250k on something else,btohqsg
i beg to differ honestly...cause there are certain things that are definitely worth,btohqsg
I wld spend on what i want in the presentNot spend on a lifetime supple of smth,btohqsg
bruh y’all confused the fuck outta me LOL,btohqsg
i wonder if this is the entrepeneur mindset,btohqsg
btw guys..do you think h&m will close their stores very soon,btohqsg

this will be gd for the narrow streets in India,btohqsg
I mean i can buy one month of your onlyfans den cancel,btohqsg
If child labour is what it takes for me to get patagonia shirts for 15 bucks,btohqsg
It is what it is then,btohqsg
