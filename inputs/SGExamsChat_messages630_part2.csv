Is uni stress and workload arnd the same amt as JC sec sch,btohqsg
Depends on how you allocate your time  but honestly I guess I feel more free in uni than jc/sec,btohqsg
depends on what you want to score.Personally I put it this way90 rp in JC is comparable to fch in Uni,btohqsg
what helped me in uni in my first two years was I had laser focus on the work to be done  yet at the same time carve out proper time for exercise 6 days a week. It was like an extension of NS for me.Then my year 4 I slack already  because by then lazy. Because focus was lost by then and I was just thinking everyday  faster graduate go out work and earn $.,btohqsg
tho ri and hci shit it out like its nth lol,btohqsg
how was your schedule like for your first two years,btohqsg
I put it down to time management  discipline and motivation.I know I lost most of it in my year 4. But fortunately first 2 years had enough points to still get through to fch.And my fyp prof was so nice,btohqsg
each semester I took 6 modules  so it's like 24 MCs (those in NUS will know)Because I chose German as my language programme  for 2 of the days  the lessons end at 8pm.,btohqsg
Is JC life more fun than neighbourhood school,btohqsg
