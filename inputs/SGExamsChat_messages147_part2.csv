What about the other half of the time?,btohqsg
Mad respect to the dude who is willing to waste his life doing such things!,btohqsg
If you question why SGean X is doing it  the simplest answer is money.,btohqsg
that means he talking to himself all the time ah,btohqsg
The ones I get are always automated prerecorded ones,btohqsg
Why do we have foreign worker dorms  because money,btohqsg
Why are there so many foreigners when SGean can probably take the same job? Because money,btohqsg
probably using like how many phones just to make it look active,btohqsg
Why are there scam calls in Singapore? Because money,btohqsg
Yeah  when you press 3 or something they will connect you to an operator,btohqsg
bruh if he bought 1000 phone numbers just for the activity,btohqsg
O srs? Do they speak english,btohqsg
Just use a phone number generator,btohqsg
Don't know. More like mandarin only.,btohqsg
got places which customers have to pay to get a phone number idk,btohqsg
maybe its just what i saw,btohqsg
It's odd  sometimes they announce in english 'for mandarin press 3'. No option for english. Hilarious!,btohqsg
About 25% of the people on our ban list is his alt accounts,btohqsg
or some people who just come in and decides to be a rulebreaker,btohqsg
That's another 25%  and another 25% r ad spammers,btohqsg
I could be talking about a population size of 4 for all u know,btohqsg
Yeah  comparing to the Singapore Global Network (overseas singaporean) groups. A lot of lovers and bitcoin/cryptononsense or scams,btohqsg
Actually not really I guess  cuz the stuff aren't serially numberd,btohqsg
Would be interesting to model and record the random occurrences as a Poisson process,btohqsg
Then you can just estimate from there,btohqsg
Got local poly dip in media. No sci n math thinking to apply to sit sci course. Not sure if SATs will help,btohqsg
Then you will need to take SATs with maths and science subject tests to up your chance im afraid,btohqsg
3.1 media into a non-related with maths and science course will be very hard,btohqsg
Yea was thinking if I could take SATs cause a lvls seems abit tough,btohqsg
Did u go to any prep course to help u or self studied,btohqsg
yes def take SATs to give yourself a betetr chance,btohqsg
i did pretty well in my english,btohqsg
my maths.. good enough but can be better,btohqsg
i think if your O levels maths is b3 standard you should be able to do the general paper and do fin,btohqsg
hows your O levels english maths and science,btohqsg
i think for your subject test u will need get help,btohqsg
Changi Airport is like that these days,btohqsg
Think your best bet is taking SAT with Essay  and Maths+Sci subject Tests,btohqsg
cause im not sure your sci is which sci,btohqsg
you can take a look at page 19 onwards to see the subjects and what is tested,btohqsg
Combine physics chem but I would like to try bio too,btohqsg
I'm planning on doing the SATs next year,btohqsg
It can help with getting into both local and American universities,btohqsg
But yeah  you need to score much much better than what you would get in A's,btohqsg
if you have no sci exp rn i think u need 1-2 years of prep studiies,btohqsg
Yea I miss the intake this year so might apply again jus to try next year,btohqsg
Tbh  the SATs content is actually quite easy,btohqsg
I wouldn't recommend going USA anyways,btohqsg
Was hoping there could be some prep course like sch,btohqsg
I could afford that Iâ€™d think,btohqsg
