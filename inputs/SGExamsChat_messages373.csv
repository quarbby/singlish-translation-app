Also higher chance if your parents alumni,btohqsg
it's raffles but it's fucked up,btohqsg
and just going to these schools,btohqsg
and also ppl joining@chemcerafter pri sch,btohqsg
what show and what character  it looks cute,btohqsg
YOU GUYS DONT GET THE PT,btohqsg
raffles is rubbish. a piece of trash. they're js a bunch of brats. like my sister goes there now since I went. and all they do is bully the minority. the teacher didn't give the indian girl a children day present.,btohqsg
Pri sch has always been about balloting and priority that way,btohqsg
bcz I hate my pri sch,btohqsg
it's rly not as great as it sounds,btohqsg
I taught alot of indians in raffles,btohqsg
the only good raffles is the jc one,btohqsg
wait so raffles has a bad learning environment? the people there are shit?,btohqsg
do I look like I'm from rgs,btohqsg
Lol every year this kinda topic about raffles always comes up sia xD,btohqsg
LMAOOOO AND AT THAT EXACT MOMENTChin XiWAS ONLINE,btohqsg
Ya i did it that way,btohqsg
people tryna tell others why the top schools arent actually good,btohqsg
I think the oldest here is@Corporate_shillwho’s like 20+ or@kohsyanthat’s all we know about,btohqsg
not bad learning environment. but I'd say it's comparable to neighbourhood schools. the teachers there were my teachers back then.  means it's been 10 years ++ that they've been teaching. they're there just for the sake of money and earning income. I honestly don't see the effort put in my the teachers based on wtv my sister tells me. and if any raffles kids here  sorry I'm putting the school in bad light but this is my honest opinion. the teachers know we have money  hence they'll be like NAHH THEIR GOOD THEY HAVE TUITION not all teachers are like that... but srsly that's how my sister describes school to me EVERY SINGLE DAY,btohqsg
The a private tutor in the other channel,btohqsg
ntg happen  u think the poor little girl wld speak up.. she wld even feel so ashamed doing so,btohqsg
That some people are smart and good at exams,btohqsg
I'd say the teachers are not it,btohqsg
and raffles don't even got affiliation,btohqsg
There is literally a logical fallacy about this,btohqsg
so there's not much benefits if you go raffles then...,btohqsg
no I tell u the bully is damn zao gao one,btohqsg
I think she meant pri sch or smt,btohqsg
ikr i thought theyre adults already,btohqsg
In jc people just pull nasty drama stunts,btohqsg
I mean ya I wld agree every sch have bullies but like the ppl there are just bullshit,btohqsg
Why Sia. It's not secondary school 2.0,btohqsg
there r good chers and bad chers in every sch,btohqsg
which u meet depends on ur luck,btohqsg
Limited to the schools you’ve been to is what I mean. Your entire impression of what’s a good and not good sch is only as accurate as where you’ve been,btohqsg
Or should I say primary school for grown ups,btohqsg
no srsly.. you know when I go inside the sch pick my sister up I tell u 3/4 of the teachers have been there for more than 10 years.. and from my mother . Who's a teacher  it's not good progress for the student or the school,btohqsg
you're in JC  being a bully is js immature alr,btohqsg
Being bullied previously to going to RJC where people supposedly treat you better definitely influences how you think of non raffles schools,btohqsg
sorry for pulling up a debate rn,btohqsg
I js got bored of ss,btohqsg
so the bad chers r there for long,btohqsg
but I might join debate club LOL,btohqsg
and hence the sch is bad,btohqsg
I never say the sch is bad  I js say the sch doesn't need to be glorified given its name,btohqsg
HAHAHA I NEVER SAY MY SCH BAD HOR,btohqsg
but some schools have more money,btohqsg
Literally no one is trying to dispute this. It’s about providing an equal perspective. RJC is good for you but you’re biased towards raffles as a whole,btohqsg
You can be happy with your own experience,btohqsg
every sch lacks budget i swear,btohqsg
coughmy sec school a bit excess,btohqsg
Lol they afford to repaint the entire school every year and always purchase a tons of new banners every year and all and sometimes with too much budget   they treat all chers to lunch,btohqsg
HAHAHA ACSI NOT EVEN EXCESS ITS JS too much,btohqsg
I like the chem jokes tho,btohqsg
DUDE BUT EJC IS DESIGNED LIKE HEAVEN,btohqsg
Bro goes to a jc for food☠️,btohqsg
most impt part of sch is the infrastructure + ppl arnd u,btohqsg
eh btw  im curios how the sch got such high cop when they recently opened like what gives the sch high cop,btohqsg
THE BUILDING IS LIKE ECO AND GOT PARK CONNECTER UNDER,btohqsg
LMAO MY GUY I GO UR SCH FOR U,btohqsg
AND LIKE 10 times BETTER THAN LIBRARY WITH SCRENERY,btohqsg
o ya all the good schs,btohqsg
I suppose from the students that apply there  then they just take as much as the capacity allow  let's say 500 then those 500 scores become COP,btohqsg
IT WAS DAMN HOT BUT SOME ECONSTUFF MAKE IT HELLA WINDY AND COOL WITH PLANTS,btohqsg
but for jae students  what makes a student wanna go there,btohqsg
cus Joel exists and go bcz of the food,btohqsg
like first first open leh idt the sch was the curr campus,btohqsg

Omg I don’t even know u but I’m so proud of u   cupcakke is by ur side   an l1R5 of 49 to 17 is just wowwwwwww,btohqsg
It really also depends on school difficulty tbh,btohqsg
But still that much of a drop,btohqsg
And he studied for 49 days,btohqsg
The most drastic drop I heard was from my English teacher who dropped from 30+ to 9,btohqsg
Watching Indian youtuber at 3am  damn lifesaver,btohqsg
Oh aight  back to the troller mentality,btohqsg
For 49 days you mug how many hrs,btohqsg
I can't learn from my mistakes because i make no mistakes,btohqsg
You can't learn from your mistake if you are the mistake,btohqsg
Ya but the way it is carried out is...,btohqsg
Wts I can never do that sia max I can go is 6 hrs but I study consistently throughout the year,btohqsg

if im aiming to enter NUS Business School,btohqsg
should i choose the JC or Poly route?,btohqsg
doesn't matter as long as you hustle hard :),btohqsg
then i think too early to choose💀,btohqsg
ik but im having a goal in mind first,btohqsg
wait poly still can enter NUS Business right,btohqsg
But if still wan wriggle room,btohqsg
depends which major u want hor,btohqsg
business got different different type of people and styles,btohqsg
Also what u wan do with that buisness degree,btohqsg
If u wan do start up  i dont recommend business at all,btohqsg
correct actually you don't need a BBA,btohqsg
Ppl who come out of biz successful usually is management consulting or high finance,btohqsg
But the % is rly low,btohqsg
They are the snake oil salesmen of finance,btohqsg
i heard most stonk part of biz is the connections built ?,btohqsg
Biz ceiling is v high  floor also v low,btohqsg
it's ok i like having financial advisor and insurance friends because i hate touching my own money,btohqsg
don't be the guy that grad that suddenly message your friends pretending to want to reconnect,btohqsg
U hv ppl who are kids of high value clients of goldman sachs that hv internship there pre u  u also hv ppl who dk what they wan do apart frm a general idea of entrepreneurship,btohqsg
It depends on who u hang out with,btohqsg
like bitch I've never talked to you after orientation camp,btohqsg

seems like jc or sec school again,btohqsg

one of my closer friends that helped me a lot in uni,btohqsg
U either make it big or u hit a stage of contentment,btohqsg
they approach me i'm like ok la,btohqsg
Make ur first steps count imo,btohqsg
their kids are those jc students that eat hdl for lunch bro 💀,btohqsg
Fas dont take home everything they earn,btohqsg
i thought usually people quite sensitive about that,btohqsg
"Alot of their ""paycheque"" they show",btohqsg
i spent liddat once a month or sth,btohqsg
Isnt representative of what their avg earnings ah,btohqsg
Usually FAs are not the majority,btohqsg
Its just coz they are v loud coz their jobs demands them to b loud,btohqsg
But biz rly doesn't impart u with hard skills,btohqsg
U cant expect biz to make u a successful start up ceo,btohqsg
The real lucrative parts of business is only and only high finance,btohqsg
oftentimes you're better off going into something technical and using that expertise to build some business,btohqsg
anyway even if you do start a business you don’t want to be that idiot ceo that don’t know shit,btohqsg
Idm as long as i get cash to line my pockets👀,btohqsg
They will bring u onboard as ceo if u dk shit,btohqsg
If academia doesn’t work out  some kind of quantum startup isn’t off the table for me,btohqsg
cos sg is big on these things,btohqsg
I made the decision to do phd so,btohqsg
so I can teach other people how to get permanent head damage,btohqsg
if you're a masochist  you should try teaching me physics,btohqsg
If I TA you  might not have a choice,btohqsg
no extra head pain i pay you,btohqsg
It was particularly low last year,btohqsg
I think my bro might have gotten it but not sure I didn't ask,btohqsg
"Talked to my colleague about pursuing masters coz this colleague has a PhD in the field I'm interested in  her reply to me was take PhD coz ""4 years very fast one! You still young"" sorry idw head demej",btohqsg
And it's 4+2 coz I can't take PhD directly  not young already,btohqsg
what field are you interested in,btohqsg
By the time I get my PhD I would be 30s already,btohqsg
i'm doing direct PhD and gonna be 29 if i grad on time lol,btohqsg
Afaik there's no chem prof that's doing environmental so it's gonna be a bit problematic,btohqsg
But whatever I need test water see if my company wanna sponsor in the first place,btohqsg
moe may as well create their own roblox game,btohqsg
The Science Asylum is decentbut let's be real  JC and lower level physics isn't even physics  it's engineeringso the videos that the channel covers are certainly nowhere near a good chunk of JC,btohqsg
thanks for the recommendation. and it's fine  I'm 7 years past JC at this point. I just enjoy educational content that actually knows how to engage you and strip down advanced stuff.,btohqsg
Cupcakke remixes kept me sane last night,btohqsg
