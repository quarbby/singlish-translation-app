Sometimes u talk more then u will create even more issues for yourself,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the story? i only know he sot sot go open ppl door,btohqsg
He will receive more backlash lor,btohqsg
He kena stabbed on the face few days back,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the problem with the society now.,btohqsg
Must know how the society works,btohqsg
I think 2 or 3 days ago.,btohqsg
then why he post thing nia kena so much hatred,btohqsg
He‚Äôs the victim voicing out his unhappiness also let people suan & write till like he‚Äôs in the wrong,btohqsg
I believe not so simple one,btohqsg
He nvr commit crime this time. So why is he paying for all these comments?,btohqsg
Yes doesn‚Äôt mean he deserves sympathy ma,btohqsg
police no catch the person? cannot catch?,btohqsg
bo tai bo ji kena stab in the face don‚Äôt deserve sympathy?,btohqsg
Ok la whatever it is now  we just wait and observe. I am sure the truth will come out one day.,btohqsg
He‚Äôs not doing anything for sympathy in the first place,btohqsg
Attacker confirm wont btbj atatck him for nothing,btohqsg
how you know. yakult lady also bo tai bo ji kena box.,btohqsg
Hmm the incident about him opening people door  what is the outcome?,btohqsg
Whatever the reason is he‚Äôs not wrong to voice out his unhappiness,btohqsg
This kind of thing  I will just shut up and let the bullet fly abit. Cuz then all the details will come out,btohqsg
He can but will kena more backlash lor,btohqsg
Most netizens not really good of heart one.,btohqsg
They just want to see drama,btohqsg
Like we also not him or the attacker,btohqsg
That‚Äôs his problem. We cannot control other people but can control own mouth. Why join in the backlash,btohqsg
No need to poke so hard and deduce this and deduce that also,btohqsg
We just live our live can le,btohqsg
Never join in la just feel that at this moment he should shut his mouth first,btohqsg
Aiyo u all relax. I shouldn‚Äôt show u all his facebook comment,btohqsg
I still don‚Äôt get it why he must shut his mouth,btohqsg
He didn‚Äôt do anything wrong wor,btohqsg
For his best interest i feel,btohqsg
His reputation isn‚Äôt good to begin with ma,btohqsg
It's a vicious cycle. The more he talk  the more negative attention he attracts  then the more ppl will attack him  then the more he feel is unfair. Then he will start to talk again and get attacked again,btohqsg
So basically is like stay low profile first. Let the thing go on abit,btohqsg
Ppl attention span very short one,btohqsg
Actually from this he would know who he can trust. Some people just want to benefit from it but there are some who will really help him.,btohqsg
The more he says the more he will receive backlash,btohqsg
But yea lah  I agree his pov that the internet is dick,btohqsg
Ppl want to cancel and drama only mah,btohqsg
Some people just want to watch the world burn,btohqsg
You should show  here is talk share and discussion üòÅ,btohqsg
So much talk and debate....I dun even know who he is ü§£,btohqsg
No wonder u r grey‚Ä¶burn till grey or ash.,btohqsg
Yep  ppl who are also miserable in real life. Feeds on misfortunes of others.,btohqsg
This kind of mindset damn disgusting. When the attack happened he didn‚Äôt say anything  the media reported it & the comments all judging him. He‚Äôs ill leh.,btohqsg
There are ppl like that one,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like if girl kena raped then must lay low so people won‚Äôt talk abt it,btohqsg
that's how sick the internet is now,btohqsg
