Getting abit confused on this.I realise I have an existing SNACK by Income account.Will I still be eligible?I'm at step 1. But it seems like I need to link my credit for a weekly payment. Is this the correct step or m I doing something wrong here?,btohqsg
There should be a free coverage of life insurance  even if you had an account but had no existing polciies on snack,btohqsg
hi guysim currently using citi reward + amaze for daily expense  will go on a trip on CNY  thinking about getting a UOB lady for itmy concern is after the trip i will have 0 utilization of the card  which might hurt my credit score? hence trying to see if thereâ€™s any alternativealso wanna ask  my income doesnt meet the requirement for uob lady solitaire  is it still encouraged to try applying?any advice is appreciated  thanks!,btohqsg
Personally  I would not recommend to apply cards just for a single purpose such as just for a tripCancellation most likely will hurt your credit score  but maybe others can help. As  previously I cancelled one of my  long standing credit card and my credit score dropped from AA to DD.You can try to apply  it does not harm anything~,btohqsg
How can you check your credit score ?,btohqsg
iirc we can change uob ladyâ€™s category every quarter right? but that still means 1 mo without utilization  how would that affect the score?,btohqsg
Hi all  is it normal for it to not move after subscribe? In the promotion page for moomoo cash fund,btohqsg
every time you apply a credit card you can receive one free credit report,btohqsg
I applied multiple cards in 2023. Where can I get a free credit report,btohqsg
ahh i talking about card cancellationif you talking about one month with 0 utilisation is alright,btohqsg
It takes 3-4 business days for it to move after you subscribed.,btohqsg
credit bureau but iirc it is within a month from the notification where they notify you,btohqsg
Looks like I have to apply for another credit card to get a free report ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Can use UOB absolute? Seems only have visa and master options,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we work from overseas as a digital nomad  is that eligible to get Exit Permit for NSMen?,btohqsg
I missed the usd3k bonus from webull promo. Not gonna miss this one. Thanks Chris for sharing amazing promo,btohqsg
hi chris is your link working?,btohqsg

Yes  just a download link. Remember to add the code on signupCHO8137,btohqsg
will drop so much? I have useless cards that I want to cancel,btohqsg
Hey guys  I a bit confused. Is it get $400 capitaland voucher after funding 4K in a snack portfolio? Or need to buy their insurance,btohqsg
Check TNC  likely to be no rewards,btohqsg
Must hit $500 or that quarter is $0 cashback,btohqsg
even for basic things like transport?,btohqsg
is this the same promo? how come $1280 now only $400?,btohqsg
UOB One Card is a tiered based cashback card. Hit tier  then get cashback. Don't hit minimum $500 tier  don't get ANY cashback.,btohqsg
The $880 flash promo (invest $10k) ended at 11.59pm on 29th December.This is the one that many people (including myself) was scrambling for.,btohqsg
Anyone has iChange referral code to share? Chong's referral code no longer valid (I think too many people use perhaps),btohqsg
I doubt not using your card will affect credit score lol. I have 2 cards unused that I didn't cancel and my credit score is unaffected.,btohqsg
Don't need. It cost less than $10 for an ad-hoc one. Check credit bureau's website if you still qualify for a free one.,btohqsg
Why not ask your unit S1?,btohqsg
oh i blur saw sethisfy post about snack last night and today chris post is different. thanks for explain,btohqsg

Does the reward categories for Uob ladies card apply for overseas? Letâ€™s say I select dining and use the card for a restaurant overseas  would it qualify?,btohqsg
