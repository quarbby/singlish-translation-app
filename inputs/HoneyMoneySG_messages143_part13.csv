However  from the second year onwards  we'll waive the annual fee for your card if you spend more than SGD25 000 per year. You will also receive 10 000 miles (in the form of 25 000 Reward points) when you pay for your annual fee from the second year onwards. The Reward points will be credited to your account within the next 2 to 3 months after the annual fee is charged to your card. Valid till 31 December 2024.,btohqsg

Anyone have any views on the MRSS enhancements starting from 1 Jan 2025? The new enhancement states that any top which attract 1 to 1 matching will not be eligible for tax relief. Is it still worth it to top up for your love ones?,btohqsg
Have been using it to reduce my income tax  although your loves one get a higher 1 to 1 matching up to 2k per year  you are taking money out from own pocket and still paying a higher income tax. Kind of dilemma. Cause your income tax is definitely lower than the 1 to 1 matching but you are kind of locking in the money in your Parents RA,btohqsg
