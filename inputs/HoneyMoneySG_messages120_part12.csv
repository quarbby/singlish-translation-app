What is the qualifying transaction for HSBC travel one card. What is the MCC,btohqsg
Have you looked at its terms and conditions?,btohqsg
And I am too far üòÄJust message Iras and see what they will respond,btohqsg
No worry. All overpay amount will be auto transferred back to you later.,btohqsg
Hi  I have signed up HSBC T1 at the last week of June  but I didn't see annual fee charge on the short June statement. How am I going to qualify for sign up bonus requirement if I can't pay annual fee?,btohqsg
You have to wait. I got charged AF abt 90 days after card approval. Sign up bonus also came in around the same time,btohqsg
Hihi  I‚Äôm kinda confused with kris miles and heymax miles valuation  and how one can used the max miles to claim free flight. Any one able to explain thanks,btohqsg
Max miles can be transfer to airline loyalty program or if u have sufficient max miles u can claim your flight receipt with max miles by submitting the flight receipt after your travel for 1.8cent per miles.Kris miles belong to sq loyalty program and can only be redeem on sq or their partner airline in the alliance.Valuation of miles is highly up to individual perception.,btohqsg
Dont mind sharing how long it took for you to get it approved?,btohqsg
So isit worth converting the miles to Krisflyer miles or using it to claim the free flight?If I‚Äôm understanding it correctly  purchasing flight ticket on the website via heymax won‚Äôt exactly award us with the exactl heymax miles for flight redemption am I right?That means we would have to accumulate heymax miles from other spending too ?,btohqsg
Krisflyer is not yet a transfer partner of heymax.Earning enough heymax miles to claim against a paid flight would take quite substantial spending through heymax unless you are a finance creator that get miles everytime a user click the referral link.üòú,btohqsg
So why is people saying you can claim the full amount of a flight ticket for free via heymax miles?I assume I would have to accumulate my max miles via spending then claim back used it as a form of cashback to claim the full air ticket?,btohqsg
U need to accumulate full amt in term of heymax miles before u can use it to submit a claim for the flight cost with receipt at 1.8 cent per heymax miles.Dont think heymax miles can be use partially,btohqsg
Oh do you earn miles on heymax and also your usual cards?,btohqsg
Yes if u done it correctly for hey max based on their instruction. U will get card miles regardless as long as u spend,btohqsg
Yes. Use shop with max (finicky)  signup bonus (singsaver) or heymax vouchers (reliable),btohqsg
Usual credit card spends will earn ur usual cc rewards,btohqsg
Approved same day as existing customer. Received card after ~1week,btohqsg
CSO doesn't seem to have any clue. Thanks for the DP.,btohqsg
If approved on the same day as existing customer  are you able to use it through immediately without waiting for the card to arrive?,btohqsg
So how hard is it to accumulated heymax miles ?,btohqsg
It is not hard  just that u have to keep spending lol,btohqsg
From your opinion  is better to just stick to kris+ or shopback?,btohqsg
Also for places like watsons uniqlo fairprice etc  i am guessing these are on online purchases too yeah? Haha,btohqsg
I am a shopback main  heymax sub pax. Heymax is by the way for me haha.,btohqsg
Im existing hsbc customer (ega + revo). 1 week and still pending weird document request from hsbc. They asked me to submit staff pass photo. ü´†,btohqsg
Got people ask to submit employment contract also one Loh,btohqsg
Im team values. Just use whatever gives me the most. No loyalty. üòÇ,btohqsg
Did u know if the person submitted?,btohqsg
This offer ends already? Only for New or existing customer can apply?,btohqsg
But be careful don‚Äôt spread too thin and too many.Lose track and Kenna expired miles,btohqsg
Heymax seems to be online purchases only  unlike shop back where we can scan we code  so we kinda limited on what we can spend,btohqsg
Yes. U at their mercy.Wait till u open investment banking accounts and see the document requests they have. lol,btohqsg
Also for tour packages  heymax miles can‚Äôt be earned unless we travelling on our own and book our own attraction and hotels,btohqsg
They should be expanding since it is quite new like when shopback first start out. But i would think their timing is not as good as shopback when it was a time full of cheap money from angel investor then,btohqsg
Interesting..What‚Äôs make you used shopback over heymax then? From my understanding cashback on shopback is very little.,btohqsg
Let me just give 2 lol examples:1. Photo of housing with yourself inside2. Birth cert of parent,btohqsg
Not really  it come about the same as heymax miles. I just need 10 dollar cashback to cashout for shopback. U need to accumulate a substantial amt of heymax miles to make it useful claim for flight or transfer to airline partner,btohqsg
Yes you are right.  Am I right to say that after 15th July  I still can continue receive 10x points using Revo+Favepay/Shopback with the correct MCC code?,btohqsg
Do you know what‚Äôs heymax ‚Äúcashback %‚Äù like ?Shopback usually is around 1-2% with some places offering 12%,btohqsg
Hi  when i pay petrol at esso fairprice  the transaction is Esso Fairprice. May i know whether citi cashback card will reward petrol bonus cashback for this?,btohqsg
U have to compare both at same time  shopback run upsize cashback about the same time with heymax. I am using 1.8 cent per miles to compare both at the same time on merchant i use. I would not of course be so free to compare every single merchant especially those i dont use.And like what i have stated before. U will need substantial spending before u can actually get a significant amt of heymax miles to offset flight or transfer to airline to make it useful. That is alot of patience and spending unless u can get alot of referral point,btohqsg
was thinking to get uob VI... but seems citi one is so nice for existing other card holder.... does citi thankyou point pool? as i have CRMC in hand now,btohqsg
Yes this is almost the same as miles cards vs cashback cards. Miles accumulation takes a long time to see results while cashback is more immediate.,btohqsg
