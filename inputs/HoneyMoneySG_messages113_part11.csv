It is random mean luck liao,btohqsg
firstly  why is this even a consideration?secondly  if she dont withdraw  when are you expecting her to withdraw?,btohqsg
Oh.. random.. no fix cashback.. anyone try the GXS debit? Better than youtrip? I going Japan year end. Must maximunise,btohqsg
Nope. It is a random reward. I believe the rewards are rather good now because they want more people to onboard their GXS bank. Just like previously  Grab gave out many points and vouchers a few years ago  which got nerfed badly.,btohqsg
I seeâ€¦ the fx rate good?,btohqsg
They use Mastercard foreign exchange rate  same as YouTrip. The advantages over YouTrip are that you can withdraw your money from GXS to your bank via PayNow and you get a small interest of 2.38%p.a. which is credited daily. YouTrip cannot do withdrawal. I withdraw the leftover money back to my bank after my trip.,btohqsg
I only use YouTrip to top up my Suica card because YouTrip can be added to Apple wallet.,btohqsg
Youtrip gets spot or slightly better for yen.,btohqsg
In that case  is better off using GXS. And u dun need to exchange to yen in advance. And u have cashback. Youtrip no cashback right,btohqsg
I just watch chris on the 5% and the comparison uob stash account and hsbc ega.What you say is true basically you only get 3.05% on the first 100k .. hence. EGA Account much better..,btohqsg
You can use YouTrip to withdraw yen from 7-11 atms in Japan for free (Below $400SGD is free). GXS cannot withdraw yen.,btohqsg
So is GXS debit better than youtrip?,btohqsg
Just use YouTrip to withdraw yen because some places like shrines entry uses cash and GXS debit for card transaction.,btohqsg
I thought use revoult to withdrawl from oversea is better than all other travelling currency card. Withdrawl up to 350 outside spore is free,btohqsg
Noted. I go apply GXS debit.,btohqsg
Trust uses Visa rates. I'm not sure if it is better than Mastercard rates but it can be an extra option for cash withdrawal.,btohqsg
That is correct. If you searched before asking you would have found your answer.,btohqsg
depends on currency as well. for yen  visa is slightly worse,btohqsg
I found.. but cannot do it online,btohqsg
She's already 70  she don't withdraw now then when??? The 4% interest also don't go to her lol.,btohqsg
Congratulations you found your answer  then why still ask?,btohqsg
I not ask . I just share the info,btohqsg
how high the interest doesnt matter if you cant spend it,btohqsg
this doesnt seem like sharing information,btohqsg
"Now SA closes at 55  ""reserved amounts"" don't matter anymore. Depending if you want more tax relief opportunities or build up your CPF numbers faster.RSTU for more tax relief opportunitiesVCMA for faster CPF numbersRemember policy may change anytime  today is like that  next year maybe not",btohqsg
If not how you guys earn money and save,btohqsg
Saving at 70 years old? Then why you spend money and get miles? Should not spend anything,btohqsg
should consider saving face first tho,btohqsg
Bro. I mean save is for hsbc . Ega account ..,btohqsg
Bro  we talking about cpf you talk about ega?,btohqsg
It's a lucky draw concept. You spend at least S$10 or fx equivalent  they give you 1 scratch card. You can get 1 cent every time if you unlucky. Just like Gpay.,btohqsg
anyway i believe you can only drag cpf life withdrawal age till max 70  so no advice is needed. you cannot say no,btohqsg
Youtrip no have. This one at least got so I would think is better?,btohqsg
The faster you build up your CPF  the lesser your tax relief opportunities are. Not no tax relief.,btohqsg
Haha now he has resorted to liking his own messages,btohqsg
I say I like reading chris clip,btohqsg
Depends. YouTrip can lock the price by converting to yen and storing in the wallet. You get to withdraw up to S$400 fx equivalent from overseas ATM without fees as well. Basically what others have already told you.Top-up YouTrip can get cashback  if you know how.,btohqsg
What chris say is true. Basically uob stash is only 3.05.. if there is better saving account.. why not go for it,btohqsg
yes... if is not true he wont say it unlike others who dont fact check,btohqsg
I feel youtrip will come in handy for situations where you need cash  then gxs can act as your normal spending cards for places that accepts card payments,btohqsg
Bro Melvyn.Should I continue to use revoult card to withdrawl my $$ oversea ATM in vietnam,btohqsg
No  should save this money in hsbc,btohqsg
Why not use your favourite card to earn your favourite miles? Or is it your Viet gf ask you for cash?,btohqsg
I help you count. His cashback rates are 1.25%  13.4% and 7.14%,btohqsg
Lol  since it is random so it is like lucky draw loh  max is 5 dollar right,btohqsg
That's right haha. Even at maximum of $5 cashback  it ranges from 50% to even as low as 0.0001% cashback.,btohqsg
The alog should be like a pyramid whereby 50 percent is at tip and 0.001 percent is the highest lol,btohqsg
Hahaha. If they pay $5000 and get $5 maximum cashback  it's already 0.1%. Imagine getting $0.01 minimum cashback on $5000. That's 0.0002% cashback.,btohqsg
Maybe only useful for small amt between 10 to 50 in foreign currency but i still prefer known benefit over lucky draw since i know i seldom have luck de.,btohqsg
Haha only optimised at $10 purchases. Minimum of 0.1% cashback or maximum 50% cashback.,btohqsg
