Hi seeking the wisdom of everyone here. What's the best option to grow a $150k fund. I've used up moomoo  tigr and webull welcome promo. Monthly spend around $350.I'll be using the fund in 2 years for downpayment of a house. Is the best option still t-bill without forcing myself to spend $500 to qualify for the high savings interest?,btohqsg
maybe the GE SP Series 12 for 3.50% p.a. for 2 years,btohqsg
seedly made a recent post abt this. If i nvr rmbr wrongly hong leong had a 3 % 3 month 20k program,btohqsg
Ok will look into this  sounds attractive as it's capital guaranteed for 2 years Vs shorter period for t-bill. Thank you 😊,btohqsg
Just received snack $400 voucher for 4 Dec to 1 Jan challenge 🙏,btohqsg
Same. But the current challenge so little vouchers only,btohqsg
The $0.25 goes to shopback balance  not tied to the stall. Essentially you get $0.25 - $0.10 = $0.15 without visiting the stall again. You may use the balance to offset future shopback purchases or withdraw to your bank at $10 min.,btohqsg
Of course lah. Their marketing budget not infinity,btohqsg
It works well for high cashback merchants at 7% and high bill amount. Maybe you paid for your friends bill of $100 total  $7 pending cashback and shopback the merchant another $0.10  you get $6.90 net.,btohqsg
now I laugh at my friends who were skeptical,btohqsg
Don't need to laugh. Just personal choice.,btohqsg
Yeaa I withdraw right after it was invested but loss about 20$. But in returns 400$ back. Pretty worth it,btohqsg
As in u initiated withdrawal immediately after investing?,btohqsg
Interesting  I thought they would just void the initial investment  rather than settle the investment then redeem it (which explains the small slippage of $20). Thanks for the DP.,btohqsg
Anyone can confirm it is true that  the commission for recurring investment on IBRK for VWRA is no longer USD 0.38  but USD 1.70?,btohqsg

I didn’t take part in the flash deal,btohqsg
But the 400 voucher need to use one shot? Or can split up?,btohqsg
hmm  based on what i see it's stackable,btohqsg
I have a question about cancelling not cards but trading acc. If I cancel and then apply as new user will I get those promos? Anyone tried before?,btohqsg
Yes confirmed. Still cheap though when currency conversion is not charged.,btohqsg
For the funds earmarked in the uob rising dragon promo ... Does it also earn the interest in the uob one account ?  And contribute to the daily average ?Cos I don't see funds there any more...,btohqsg
You can look into AIA 3.6% instead.,btohqsg
Yes. If you read last night's discussions.,btohqsg
