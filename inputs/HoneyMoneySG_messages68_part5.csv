Uob national savings promo ending today. Any news when the next promo is coming? If so  Do I empty out my uob by today?,btohqsg
read above? yes  likely will have next promo,btohqsg
Do you know if we are able to withdraw our capital before receiving the lump sum reward?,btohqsg
When will uob start advertise their promo? On the 1st day of the period or few days before?,btohqsg
by right first day  but there was a leak of the TnC for the next promo yesterday,btohqsg
Hi guru  just to double confirm The uob national saving promo  should I register by today or tomorrow? And the despoit should be tomorrow?,btohqsg
Hi  may I ask if the HSBC revolution and UOB lady's bonus points are based on transaction date or posted date?Eg. If I spend money on 30 September and the transaction is posted on 1 October  does my spending accumulate bonus points for my September bonus cap or October bonus cap?,btohqsg
posted date. if post on 1 oct then count to Oct,btohqsg
Hi all. For uob one credit card  if the spending of $500 is under the sub card.. will it be calculated under  credit card spending bonus interest?,btohqsg
sub card spend count to main card holder uob one account and card,btohqsg
I called up to ask  yes can transfer out any amount at end of 30days  will not affect the bonus interest. I already transferred out my 50k because it is mmf rate after 30days.,btohqsg
Any other that higher than MMF rate except UOB1  OCBC360 n Choco?,btohqsg
hello  i've just emptied it  after 6pm can transfer back? üòÖ,btohqsg
Check UOB website for promo Tomorrow or next Monday n decide where n when to transfer it to.,btohqsg
I took up Tiger brokers guaranteed 6% 30 days maximum 10k. But only the interest is guaranteed  how about the capital? it will be redeemed at fund's NAV ie Fullerton SGD cash fund. New promo currently is 8%.,btohqsg
Still can transfer asap. The Final cut off time is after 9pm. I m not sure the exact timing.,btohqsg
I m not JIT person. I always give some buffers.,btohqsg
What are the cards one can use at HealthHub please? Citi rewards / SMRT ok?,btohqsg
citi rewards  citi smrt  dbs wwmc  uob evol  dbs livefresh etc.,btohqsg
You need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search using either merchant name  eg ‚Äúhealthub‚Äù or mcc code at:https://heymax.aiThe website will also propose a list of best credit cards to use  then you can check credit card TnC is it in whitelist or exclusion listGood luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Anyone knows the answer to this?,btohqsg
Hi  for the iSavvy 3.5% promotion that ends in September aka today  may I know when I can withdraw my money without jeopardising the interest earned? Thank you!,btohqsg
Anybody got their HSBC Sure Win Lucky draw for Sep?,btohqsg
Think hsbc messaging system is wonky this month. Just use the same code as last month.,btohqsg
As a general advice  it's better to wait for all the promo gifts  interests  to arrive in ur hands  a/c  before doing anything to the capital...üòä,btohqsg
why envious? Is it because can sell off at $250? Seems better value than getting the Afternoon Tea for 2 at Conrad¬†Centennial¬†Singapore?,btohqsg
Both are better than my $1.,btohqsg
I just tried  but didnt get any new spins for September,btohqsg
Those who participated in poems 5.8% on 31 August  when is the best date to withdraw? Will it be better to wait monday before 10am to reap the best return? Or even now is ok?Because i am thinking if withdraw Saturday or Sunday will lose 2 extra days of returns.,btohqsg
For the Moomoo 5.8% promo  the eligibility criteria of ‚Äúnever deposited funds before 31/8‚Äù  will it count if I ever deposited funds 2 years ago when they first started? After that I withdrew and never touched since,btohqsg
Hi is Circle life still offering $5 esim?,btohqsg
Anyways to earn higher than OA rate as fresh grad that just got a first job?,btohqsg
Yes! Transfer the OA to SA. Instant profit!,btohqsg
Actually want to meet the CPFIS eligibility quicker but only the excess amount can be invested?,btohqsg
Most people don‚Äôt use OA to invest. At most use for tbills.Most people probably use their OA to finance the purchase of the most important asset: housing.,btohqsg
For CPFIS once hit 40k in SA means can use the entire amount for investment?,btohqsg
instant lockup for 30y lol. can do but better to know your situation,btohqsg
Don't plan to get housing imma going to be mummy's boy living in parents home forever,btohqsg
Not a good idea for not buying HDB. You can treat it as an investment.,btohqsg
Whether u need your own house or not for staying in  u should always get at least one for investment purposes.,btohqsg
Studio apartment maybe but still not rich enough,btohqsg
Most Singaporean own 2 or more properties. 1 for own stay  another for investment.,btohqsg
Hi guys. If i hit 100k at my ocbc 360  which is the next best interest acc i should deposit to?,btohqsg
I would probably reconsider if I want to have so much liquid cash in the first place,btohqsg
but in this case OA must have 20k minimum right,btohqsg
UOB one is the best right now i suppose,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to have 20k min,btohqsg
ohh thanks thanks i thought needed 20k,btohqsg
