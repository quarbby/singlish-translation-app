Not 21 yet must wait bday to pass sadly. Iv been trying to find ways to reduce transportation cost.,btohqsg
Isn't public transport for students (excluding uni) cheaper than adult prices? I don't think 5% cashback is anywhere near the 50% or more discount?,btohqsg
Im getting adult prices already haha,btohqsg
Just graduated and waiting for army,btohqsg
Student cc need active student status though. Means you can't apply using 11B anyway?,btohqsg
Army guys no concession cards? Since you're mostly in camp  transport fees shld be minimal in any case... Plus eat cookhouse  wear army clothes...  You'll save quite a fair bit  imo,btohqsg
See if monthly concession cheaper once you receive the NSF concession card,btohqsg
Im in a situation where my army enlistment wont be near anytime soon. I haven't finish my med checkup despite graduating.,btohqsg
I tried and the only restriction is my age apparently,btohqsg
I guess Maybank eVibes is your best choice. 1% cashback no min spend.,btohqsg
yeah I thought so üòÖ just asking around if anyone knows any better cards for me to use,btohqsg
Secured cc maybe able to get uob evol  but ofc you must have min 10k ready to be locked in.,btohqsg
Interesting ill look it up. Thanks for the help!,btohqsg
"anyone has any experience here in terms of qualifying and receiving (or not qualifying and receiving) the sign up bonus for uob which has this ""first 200 persons"" requirement?am also wondering whether the opportunity to ""buy"" 45k miles for essentially $590 (opp cost + actual cost) is actually a good deal / something that is hard to come by ü§î",btohqsg
how do i check for breakdown of my uni$ per transaction? uob lady is showing me lump sum category bonus $ for july,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone know how the UOB one credit card cashback works? I just applied it early this year in Feb but for my July bill  it didn‚Äôt offset the cashback from the previous quarter(Apr to Jun). I have spent slightly more than $500 each month. I sent in my query via the UOB chat assist and they said they will escalate my query. Afterwards I received a sms saying ‚ÄúYour request for an adjustment to your rewards dollars/points has been approved. Thank you for banking with UOB.‚Äù.However  I have checked the statement but it didn‚Äôt reflect any cashback yet. Does anyone has any idea about this?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Wow  I just applied for CIMB Visa Signature Card  and it says this card is only eligible for Singaporeans or PR.,btohqsg
No breakdown for individual for bonus uni$,btohqsg
same as hsbc i guess? it‚Äôs based on trust then? üòÖ,btohqsg
Just curious. If I apply for a CIMB visa signature card  completely new to CIMB bank  and use it to pay my insurance premiums first time payment  I won‚Äôt qualify for the 10% rebate which is applicable for online shopping  beauty etc  but since it‚Äôs my first time and above $988  I‚Äôm still entitled to the welcome gift of say $300 bucks right?,btohqsg
Is that how that works from my understanding?,btohqsg
DBS visa debit card give you 3% cashback on transport  if you can spend $500 monthly w it and withdraw less than $400,btohqsg
iirc UOB one debit give you 10% on transport till December  can look into that also,btohqsg
I thought UOB Evol needs $600 spend for cashback?,btohqsg
Hi  just a question any idea why UOB still need 3mth payslip even after providing a $10k deposit application for secured credit card?,btohqsg
FSMOne debit card gives 1% cashback on public transport with no min spend,btohqsg
Don't have anymore. Now only taxi/Grab rides get 3%,btohqsg
I just check their website only  still have,btohqsg
He was thinking of DBS LF also... That's $600 min spend too,btohqsg
DBS LF student no min spend,btohqsg
Just checked it as well - you are correct  my bad,btohqsg
wow exactly what I need right now. Thanks a lot üòÄ,btohqsg
