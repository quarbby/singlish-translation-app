For Mayank Family and Friends  SingTel bill payment via SingTel app is eligible for 8% under ‚ÄòData communication‚Äô category?,btohqsg
since you spend so much on singtel can consider yuu,btohqsg
not really  cos current bill charging the phone installment  so will be slightly higher. back to normal will be like 100 plus per month.,btohqsg
i just saw  the yuu card need to have spend around 600 per month  no that much of expense charge to new card already.,btohqsg
if it is online or whitelisted mcc can charge to citi rewards card direct. If other offline spend more than $50 and u not spending on other 4mpd cards or value citi rewards points more than other bank miles then can use crmc.,btohqsg
normally  now i charge one credit card first  then crmc  then after max up crmc  all charge to uob priv,btohqsg
consider use ppv instead of prvi to get 4mpd instead of 1.4mpd but need $5 blocks,btohqsg
ya. i see the whilelist seem cover much on the cloth store but not the restaurant. so why i thinking to apply ppv or not.,btohqsg
ppv mobile contactless work on blacklist  anything get 4mpd so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
i just switch using debit card to credit last year oct  so at that time didnt think so much. üòÇ just apply the crmc  uob one credit and uob prvi at the same date.,btohqsg
is it difficult to get annual fee waive if i seldom swipe that credit card?,btohqsg
Thank u! Used this and it‚Äôs $0 :),btohqsg
i think another few month only apply. i scare later bank reject my application.,btohqsg
