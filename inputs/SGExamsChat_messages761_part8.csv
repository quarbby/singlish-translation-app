I mean it’s expected la if ppl don’t expect rate cuts this will increase bearish sentiment,btohqsg
I can’t see what this has to do with the stock prices,btohqsg
not a direct effect per say,btohqsg
nvm im too inexperience to know about this..all i know is that the US has been desperate to retain their proportional US dollar's value to the rest of the world and they are waging wars precisely to do that..but the US is also short sighted and fail to understand how to go about doing it right.,btohqsg
Oh ok I just couldn’t see the link to the stock market when you mentioned that,btohqsg
yea its not a direct link per say  just a critical catalyst,btohqsg
If countries stop using the USD as their reserve currency  they’re essentially screwed especially with their large foreign debt,btohqsg
yea the US knows that..so what they are trying to do now is to cause the other superpowers to devalue their currency forcefully..the Ukraine war is a example of that  but they failed to realise Russia is the largest distributor or oil  so in order for russia to retain their's currency value...all they have to do is tell countries which uses oil from them to trade only in russian rubles,btohqsg
What stocks do you hold ?,btohqsg
The US only has 2 things left before the great empire falls .1. Military supremacy2. US dollar status .Once 1 fall   the other will too   its a matter of time.,btohqsg

are signatures like usable in court? like a person claiming they didnt sign a contract or smth,btohqsg
there are handwriting experts that can analyse your signature under a microscope,btohqsg
if it ever comes to that sort of dispute,btohqsg
how much of it can be within variance tho,btohqsg
it's actually very difficult to accurately forge a signature,btohqsg
like everytime a person signs smth its gonna be slightly diff,btohqsg
