Oxley recent results was pretty good. It helped them gap up to break out of the channel. Prior to that  there was a big drop before it consolidated and built up strength towards the results. On top of that  a seemingly good property market outlook can boost this one as their property assets prices increases in value. There should be more play coming after they flush out the recent T. Can Watchlist this one.,btohqsg

A stock that came alive today on a T4Abundance international.Coincidentally closed at 2.8 cent  not that far from asiaphos 2.4 cent but worlds apart in terms of safety.Simply because asiaphos moved hence plenty chased. Abundance is pretty dormant till now. Well  a fish moved vibrantly before it died tooSearch on top for abundance for background  would not repeat again. The key point being their bond and warrants exercise is fully completed.3 controlling shareholders Sam Kok yin shi jiangang and jiang hao collectively owns 75% of the companyIf memory serves me well the company has almost 1.3b shares now. It means 25% or 325m shares are outside their hands.Their holdings have increased as SKY (nice initials) bought more warrants in open market and there are unsubscribed warrants (3m if I recall).New shares created outside their hands is in tune of 120-130m shares.From the day the warrants are converted into shares as of today  this volume has exchanged hands in market. Today is a T4 and vwap over this period is 0.027Price is at a low  a level where nobody makes money except the pioneer warrants holders whose cost is 2 cent and likely have disposed into market earning their 30-40% free money (held 4 years though)The interest expense that eat into their pnl every quarter for past 4 years will no longer exist. Refer to previous results it‚Äôs always dragged into red by non-cash interest expense due to nature of their zero coupon bond. Issue at 1.6 and redeem at 2.Equity component is beefed up from the warrants conversion.Feixiang chemicals. Owned by shi jiangang who is an IPT with abundance. Abundance is their agent to acquire chemicals for their operations. Key is the IPT figure is increasing every year.Hint: read the last page of every result statement.Compare it yearly. Or quarterly.In a way the profitability of abundance is highly dependent on feixiang business dealings. Anybody guess on what is the incentive for the 3 parties.Previous owners Charlie and Dora have been selling into every price spike and just got 50% diluted again in terms of percentage holdings. Not a concern in my opinion.Bulk of operations is in China orient salt and the factory at joo koon house their newly started printing business which is probably loss making. A good business decision will be to wholly dispose it away as it‚Äôs not core business and the depreciation expense is eating into their bottom line every quarter as well.Plenty of potential catalysts on a price surgeStatus quo: my money on abundance over likes of asiaphos cph artivision anytime.Miss the hype  sleep better at night. My choice anytime.,btohqsg
For Abundance holders  those who have and buy can pmRay of lite. We have a abundance focused group as we believe in this possible double / multi bag.,btohqsg

That explains the recent price and vol behavior,btohqsg
