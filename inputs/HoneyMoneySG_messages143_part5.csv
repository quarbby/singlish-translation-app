I called and they say it‚Äôs about ‚Äúcashback‚Äù not about ‚Äútransaction reversal‚Äù,btohqsg
Cashback on mrt mcd  sp group bill payment on my UOB  citi rewards for online shopping and general use,btohqsg
ok then the plan is fine assuming you are not going to consistently spend 1k or 2k tier each month on the additional bonus rebate merchants on uob one card.,btohqsg
I used my citi reward+amaze in Malaysia  the rate is fine. Charged SGD 16.3 for MYR 52.80,btohqsg
Hey guys  if i charge my Microsoft 365 to my Citi Rewards card  would i get 4 miles per dollar? Or i need to charge to Amaze instead? Thanks!,btohqsg
Just checking anyone here used Trust Bank card to load Touch n Go e-wallet before? I tried cannot. So would like to confirm is it my own issue haha,btohqsg
This is like a rate of 3.239,btohqsg
Hi all  i am about to start buying furniture and renovating my house  what combination would be the best to get the most miles/cashback?,btohqsg
Check in your app if your trust card is enabled for overseas/online usage?,btohqsg
Anyone can confirm if MCC for KrisShop depends on product or is it flat MCC5309,btohqsg
Thanks for asking. Both settings are on,btohqsg
I think you mean *blacklist card.,btohqsg
Hi guys if doing RSP of ETF (CSPX) - $500 SGD monthly? Any platform recommendations? IBKR or fsmone,btohqsg
That's 3/3 warnings;Kayis banned!Reasons:1: no shopee links2: no shopee links3: shoper links again,btohqsg
Sorry a dumb question guys. I am going to transfer my money from the HSBC ega account to my ocbc account for December. I should only do so tomorrow am I right? Thank you.,btohqsg
actually it depends whether better to have funds in 30 Nov and 1 Dec counted in which account. For the case of ega to ocbc I think it will be better to transfer today before 9pm.,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you have any idea which multi currency card that I can pair with uob lady to earn mileage while spending at overseas? I just note that UOB lady‚Äôs card has included Amaze Instarem in its exclusion list. Thank you üôè,btohqsg
For those who want to clear funds for December (fresh funds promo) do note to do so by today if you want December to be zero-ised. Transferring tonight after 10.30pm will be recorded under 2 Dec,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if there‚Äôs any good card to use forparking.sgapp? Is it only AMEX TCB/UOB Absolute cashback? Or have they both been nerfed?,btohqsg
UOB onePosb everydayOCBC FrankHi  do any of the above card have Cashback for simplygo without any minimum spend?,btohqsg
Any no minimum spend card recommend?I heard Maribank and Amaze+Citi rewards is good?,btohqsg
Mean Maribank is the best for no minimum spend simplygo?,btohqsg
SingTel bill payment uses AXS now?,btohqsg
Since beginning of Nov. Use website still okay,btohqsg
You can use UOB Lady‚Äôs card for no minimum spend but it‚Äôs a bit of a waste if you do that. Transportation needs to be the selected category.If you go for solitaire at least have one more category to clock the cap.Lady‚Äôs card cap is $1k  solitaire $2k. It‚Äôs 4mpd on the spend.,btohqsg
Yup I am thinking of that but seems like both has its advantages I think. As I do not spend 500 for my ocbc account so my eir is lesser. Thank you for advising.,btohqsg
then better transfer tomorrow or monday both will be dated 2 Dec,btohqsg
How much interest can I earn per year from UOB stash if I have 100 k in the account?,btohqsg
Anything more than 100 k will be 5 % ?,btohqsg
No. Above 100k is 0.05%. Read the tnc,btohqsg
Is this for the UOB Save Up Cash in Promotion?,btohqsg
hey guys  my nov CMRC statement has giro set up  i have also confirmed with cust. svc. and they confirmed it. the due date for the statement is 30 Nov  today. on 28 nov  my HSBC EGA got deducted the amount (i.e.  balance dropped  can see the successful debit transaction) but it hasn't reflected at citi's end i.e.  the due balance is still not $0. i have checked with cust. svc. again and the image is their reply. should i just go ahead and pay the due amount now? but im not very sure about the process of refunding that amount  could someone please advise? thank you!!,btohqsg
This is for UOB nation of savers promotion if it happens. I haven‚Äôt see any announcement,btohqsg
just wait for the payment to reach citibank and get updated,btohqsg
hey  thanks for your reply! just afraid to get any interest / fee charged. was this the same for your case too? i honestly think itll just go through but then not very sure thats why im asking ü•≤,btohqsg
Hi for uob save up promotion  ex: put 150k for earmark 5month  are we still eligible for monthly bonus interest?,btohqsg
note that there will not be any late fee or interest if it is payment via giro,btohqsg
Thank you. For the amount of 150k calculation  is it average daily balance or final balance?,btohqsg
Does this essentially mark your MAB as 0 for December so if the promotion comes  any funds put into it to end Dec will be considered fresh funds?,btohqsg
which 150k u referring to  the 150k to be depositing by 30 Nov or the 150k m monthly average balance for monthly bonus interest,btohqsg
yes  but there will still be base interest such that the mab will be slightly above $0,btohqsg
What is the MCC code for singtel bill? What is the best cc to use?,btohqsg
Sorry for the questions but I am new to this promo! Do correct me if im wrong  the procedure would be1) Move the required amount u want to earmark out of your UOB account (probably to another bank account) before today 10.30pm2) Wait for announcement in the promotion for Dec3) When the announcement come  fill up this formhttps://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html4. Not sure if there is a wait period after appying? Then transfer back the amount into your UOB account,btohqsg
So must use singtel app for MCC 4814 to earn the rewards by crmc +amaze?,btohqsg
singtel website not app and can use crmc without Amaze,btohqsg
1) yes2) promo announce in Jan (if any)3) 4) follow instructions in the new promo (if any),btohqsg
Anything above will slowly drop from 3% to lower and fast.,btohqsg
There may be changes to bonus awarded with recent reduction of interest rates by banks recently. So read thru the tnc carefully.,btohqsg
Ahh okie  so keep the funds under another account until the new promo is announced?,btohqsg
Wah i forget need to transfer in by 30nov  i just register  anyone know if i can just transfer by 31 dec instead?,btohqsg
