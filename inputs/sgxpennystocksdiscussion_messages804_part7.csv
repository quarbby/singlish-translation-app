It's the Vix futures ETF. You can hold ETF long term,btohqsg
Ohh this can counter can hold for long long term ar .. cos this vix is link to DJ index,btohqsg

This is another one  short term Vix futures ETF . 1x. But the description is similar,btohqsg
The Funds are benchmarked to an Index of VIX futures contracts. The Funds arenotbenchmarked to the widely referenced Cboe Volatility Index  commonly known as the “VIX.” The Funds should be expected to perform very differently from the VIX or one and one-half times (1.5x) or one-half the inverse (-0.5x) of the performance of the VIX  as applicable.ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF provides long exposure to the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index  which measures the returns of a portfolio of monthly VIX futures contracts with a weighted average of one month to expiration.,btohqsg
1.5x means they exaggerate the performance in a sense. Same as bull 3x or bear 2x etc,btohqsg
Thank bro for the great Information 🙏,btohqsg
Volatility index is known as the fear index so yes it's generally inverse to stock indices,btohqsg
But the ETF are based on the futures. Not exactly the same as based on index. Some differences will apply,btohqsg
How To Use a VIX ETF in Your Portfoliohttps://www.investopedia.com/investing/use-vix-etf-in-your-portfolio/#:~:text=The%20VIX%2C%20or%20the%20volatility hedge%20against%20future%20market%20moves.,btohqsg
Dun wanna understand.. cos more risk,btohqsg
You don't have to trade VIX ETF ma. Some use for hedge. Some use when they expect volatility. I don't touch it myself,btohqsg

💰Pika World Breakfast Update - 8 June 2023💰After a massive rally for weeks  traders took profit off the table. This sent both Nasdaq and S&P 500 down for the day. Negative sentiments surrounding central banks  such as Canada raising rates rather than pausing  hit the investors' nerves.Here's what you need to know for the day ahead in 60 seconds:https://moneynmeaning.com/2023/06/profit-taking-took-some-heat-off-the-market/Given the retreat  we hold significant indices given our positions and will be looking to offload them as we believe Nasdaq is at the overbought stretch area. While this may incur some losses if indices retreat further  it is risk management to take. So do trade safely too.We hope you have a splendid day ahead too! 🫕🌻📱🍝,btohqsg
