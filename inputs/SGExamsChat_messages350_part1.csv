Then all we can do is pray I guess,btohqsg
Should offer metrics to grade em by,btohqsg
But one thing for sure is to remain professional. Be careful in the things you do  don't AWOL  don't sit one side do nothing,btohqsg
Like number of projects done? Number of meetings attended,btohqsg
Tough coz not every 2 jobs are the same,btohqsg
Metrics usually are more general  like whether the person can do independently or need help,btohqsg
U mind sharing your internship experience with me?,btohqsg
I wanna learn more about it,btohqsg
I went for 2 internships coz polee and uni  polee one very short only since I was from old batch. Both not counted for GPA but they will indicate a letter grade.,btohqsg
For polee I was in an SME  my team all quite nice and their culture is you can do whatever you want as long as you finish the tasks that team lead issue to you. That includes sleeping and watching drama in lab lol  just be careful if got boss walk in.,btohqsg
For uni  my issue was my dept work is mostly high level  so there's not much intern-level things I could do. Mostly 2h per day I finish all my tasks already. I did ask for work but all too high level. I was not too inclined on asking other teams or dept coz I ever worked in temp job in another company where the mentor don't like her staff helping others. But in the end I got kena gl by other manager for zuobo.,btohqsg
I am interning right now at a small company,btohqsg
So I got explicit permission to go help admin and lab side  which I pretty much did all the way until my internship ended.,btohqsg
It's like when there's alot of high level stuff u can't do much if ur an intern,btohqsg
Ya exactly. Such cases you will have to cross-teams and learn other stuff.,btohqsg
Currently the company I'm working at have a batch of interns  just recently got one of them kena say for zuobo also LOL but I think she's just suay  coz her lab also like recently not much to do apparently.,btohqsg
Bobian but boss ask her go help other teams lor,btohqsg
I recently injured my knee pretty badly. My company is fortunate enuff to let me work from home haha,btohqsg
If can wfh a bit dumb if not feeling well still drag ownself to wokr,btohqsg
Hmm previous batch of intern  my lab's intern failed her internship coz it was found out that she apparently AWOL and faked her timesheet details.,btohqsg
Even at work I see everyone talk to each other through Microsoft teams,btohqsg
Same coz lazy walk here and there,btohqsg
Pure phy practical 20221st qn was on density of springMass is given 5.1gHold the spring and calculate length l andThen some other parts  formula is given and we just sub in the valuesLast part of qn 1 is describe source of error during the experimental procedure and explain how it affects the value of density of spring2nd qn was movement of a blutack with a string attached to it into a measuring cylinder filled with oil( qn instructs to pull the string such that the blu tack is just touching the oil surface and then b4 releasing it  start stopwatch and stop stopwatch once it reaches bottom) that is T+ planning qn eqn givenT= (D/r^2)(k). Student claims that eqn is...r is radius of the bluetack(one part of the qn said to find radius->1m)3rd qn is like a potentiometer/jockey qn except the long 1m wire is a resistance wire1st part was to find the V and I when L=1002nd part find its R  ohm and P  wattR=resistance  P is powerNext  When plotting table  it states need to include R  P V  I  LFor diff values of L.Next part of qn3 was asked to plot P against LThen Draw a curved best Fit LineThen draw tangent at L=60.0cm and find its gradientAfterwards was asked to describe the trend of the graph(3m)Then sources of errors when calculating G (3m)Edit: mostly should be correct  it's based on what i rmb jn so i might still miss out some litte parts xD,btohqsg
whatâ€™s the density of the spring,btohqsg
other friends got values ranging from 157 to 200+,btohqsg
How? Lol its m/v tho 5.1/v,btohqsg
Its not like they ask for kg/m^3,btohqsg
I think mine is ard the same as yours,btohqsg
I dont rmb getting such a big value,btohqsg
so they saying its density is 157000-200000+kg/m^3,btohqsg
Mi.. looking forward for ..chem n bio,btohqsg
I wan see what my students say,btohqsg
time to invent a new element,btohqsg
Does anyone know of a telegram group that mainly focuses on meeting new people and what not,btohqsg
every year's bio is so sad,btohqsg
ur probably a professional at it,btohqsg
Sometimes the essay qns r <3,btohqsg
I am studying from my chemistry pratical right noeBut then I feel I like procrastinating the whole day,btohqsg
Humans were not meant to be in a rigid environment of studying,btohqsg
But I guess over time we forced ourselves to.,btohqsg
So dun feel that bad about procrastinating.,btohqsg
For anyone feeling stress for exam or whatnot. Here:https://youtu.be/4KGKXrojQFI,btohqsg
hello i got penalised for my handwriting leh in math,btohqsg
I WROTE a but i nvr close properly then look like u,btohqsg
HUH URE IN NY BUT NO ITS EJ NOT NY LOL,btohqsg
EH OK C U AT EJ,btohqsg
Will I actually get in is another story,btohqsg
U last time in the ah,btohqsg
Ok for me ah I will be happy to get in but I also got back up options in a sense,btohqsg
Is the segregation betw JAE and IP kids bad,btohqsg
