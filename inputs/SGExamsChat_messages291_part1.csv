Hello pure/combined bio students! Your practical exams are coming real soon  so I came out with this Practical Notes for you. Hope it helps you in your revision! :),btohqsg
For bio  use ur past experience to carry out ur observations accurately. Cambridge may give ez specimen like onions and potato  but if they wan bamboozle the cohort  they can set random shitz,btohqsg
Ya really need to pass math.,btohqsg
If not can't even go poly,btohqsg
I only take E math and A math while in ITE.,btohqsg
Huh then why u take EA math In ite,btohqsg
As a private candidate you mean? or as a module in ITE,btohqsg
I was a former ITE student too. I failed my EL  only ITE accepts me,btohqsg
The reason why i in ITE. Is cos i am from NT.,btohqsg
I have a classmate from NT to NA and to sec5 then poly,btohqsg
I almost get into NA in Sec 2 once.,btohqsg
And the rest was all A.,btohqsg
hihi  I was from NT too  totally can relate,btohqsg
There is not much opportunity for us to just,btohqsg
I mean there is not much route for us.,btohqsg
The only route for us is,btohqsg
So 4 years ITE? But now you must be in poly rn no?,btohqsg
NT -> nitec -> polyOrNT -> nitec -> Hnitec -> poly,btohqsg
Life in Higher Nitec to me pointless.,btohqsg
But the gov is removing the streaming thingy in a couple of years that’s good,btohqsg
Wait how do you cope with EA math when you're in NT tho,btohqsg
