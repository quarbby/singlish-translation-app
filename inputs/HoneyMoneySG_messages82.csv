Quick question on CPF top up.If I were to do voluntary top up for sibling and in order to get tax relief  they have to be either handicap or earning less than 4k a year?,btohqsg
Hello guys  wanna check. I have signed up for the Uob Christmas promo and deposited my funds. How do I know my funds have been earmarked for the Christmas period?,btohqsg
The earmark amt will disappear from your acct but show in your available balance,btohqsg
Hello queenie  how do you see it disappear from the acct? I check my Uob app and it seems to be still there.,btohqsg
Hi  if my UOB one fund is still earmarked by UOB as of 31 Dec 2023 for NDP promo  do they look at the available balance or the total fund (including earmarked fund) if i register for Rising Dragon promo in Mar 2024? 😆,btohqsg
The current and available number will differ,btohqsg
Got it thank you! My available and current still same amount. I guess I needa call them tmr to sort it out,btohqsg
The earmark fund will be counted as day end balance as well,btohqsg
Same. CPF got smarter. Credited the interest on 31 Dec 2023,btohqsg
Hello guys  if the total mandatory contribution hit cpf annual limit  is voluntary contribution still eligible for tax relief?,btohqsg
So meaning unlike past years  this year cannot top up 3k liao?,btohqsg
Hihi i forgot to contribute to my srs account. Is it possible to contribute tomorrow and appeal to iras?,btohqsg
Always possible. Whether or not they agree is a different matter,btohqsg

Cpf for Ma just put back to $68500  diff trf to OA. What is the benefit to top $3k if above 55?,btohqsg
How do u forget to do something for 365 days and rmb about it immediately after the deadline lol,btohqsg
Can i check how to earn miles with hawker center qr code?Cause grabpay top up cannot earn any miles already right?,btohqsg
XNAP with your favourite miles card e.g. UOB Lady'shttps://youtu.be/lt5Yr4PoTZs?si=mEwTwwfJlP6qfsCL,btohqsg
CPF just transferred out the MA interest  can topup 3k to MA now,btohqsg
Those on the Webull USD$3k that has to retain funds until 1st Jan .... no point withdrawing today right? Earliest should withdraw tmr.,btohqsg
Just saw this. Thanks for sharing.So the process is:Interest credit on 31 Dec.Wait for MA interest to be credited to OA.Perform volunteering contribution to MA,btohqsg
@qqplacesfor the UOB CNY promo  understand that tomorrow top back up is ideal. But to participate  we can click to participate now and then tomorrow then credit back in right?,btohqsg
So it’s a bug in cpf side to credit the interest earlier? 😂,btohqsg
If I topup MA to BHS  and SA is already at FRS  the future MA contribution will flow to SA or OA?,btohqsg
Not a bug  it's a feature. And in 2025 will get the same question again,btohqsg
Check the following:a). What is your account closing balance as of 30 September 2023 based onPDF monthly statement. Is the amount between the day of your submission till 31 Dec  account balance amount in any day > = (balance(30 Sep) + Earmarked amount) ?b). Did you withdraw any amount from the account after you submitted your registration such that it falls below the required balance ?c). Did you transfer the money from your other UOB account into the saving account?d). Did you use the saving account participated 2023 NDP promo?,btohqsg
Happy new years everyone! Can I check if I use hsbc revol or citi rewards + instarem on grab paylater  will I get the 10x reward?,btohqsg
Your Grab pay later deduct the money from your credit card or deduct from Grab wallet?,btohqsg
SNACK got new challenge to get $238 voucher,btohqsg
Thanks  I din know can do simultaneously  so I did national day  then now planning cny,btohqsg
Grab wallet means no rewards unless you want to earn 0.3% cashback for top-up on UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX,btohqsg
Thank you for updating us 😉,btohqsg
Is it worth to topup MA for tax relief? Cos topup money cannot withdraw liao,btohqsg
Hi Mt and all experts  does this uob promo allow funds from several paynow transfers or must be one single transfer? Thanks,btohqsg
Welcome  you must be new here.You can watch Chris' playlist on CPF and retiring planning here to know more about CPF hacks and benefits:https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY9HGoedVpsM5g7LXEr860UwsrMYOAO6-&si=OmvlUuBVQ2kPqyvL,btohqsg
Hi  can I confirm if the CPF interest is computed on a monthly basis? Eg. There will no difference if I do cash top-up to my SA account on 01 Jan 2024 or 31 Jan 2024?,btohqsg
I only open the Uob account in December and have not withdrawn anything from it. I have also registered for the Christmas promo.,btohqsg
Don’t think you can  and they are going to retire the website,btohqsg
does anyone know if smart credit card + ipaymy for paying taxes would work ?,btohqsg
they take the lowest amount of the month,btohqsg
For those asking about reserved amounts on RSTU:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158140For those asking about CPF interest from MA to SA on 1 Jan:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/159204,btohqsg
Oh I didn't know evol card is basis statement month. Like that it will be so difficult to keep track.,btohqsg
Just keep a spreadsheet and track daily,btohqsg
Hi all  when will UOB One account interest come in?,btohqsg
02 of the month for me,btohqsg
@Andrewsuxy  you can share about the survey rewards but do not put your own referral code,btohqsg
May I check for this statement I saw on milelion for citi rewards:An overall cap of S$1 000 per statement month applies  shared between (1) and (2). The Citi Rewards Mastercard and Citi Rewards Visa each have their own 4 mpd cap. Any spend in excess of the cap earns 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
Means any spend in excess of $1 using my amaze card only earns me 0.4 miles?,btohqsg
Call in to UOB to change statement month to match calendar month,btohqsg
For Snack  I have top up $4000 investment fund  and started all the challenges. Do I need to hold the position till end of the challenge? The challenge days left 28 days.,btohqsg
Or any action I missed out?,btohqsg
Did you check the TnC when the earmark shall be happened?,btohqsg
yes 4mpd capped for $1k spend posted in statement month,btohqsg
Hi when using uob ladys with travel selected as category and paying flight tickets in foreign currency. Would you link with amaze and pay using amaze or use ladys card straight? From my understanding through amaze will not get the 6mpd for uob right?,btohqsg
Hi when will the webull moneybull $3000usd cash voucher be credited?,btohqsg
Or is amaze*transit for transport only?,btohqsg
My CPF Amount Reserved increased from 26xxx to 27xxx  so it is 1xxx increase; where does this number come from? My SA interest in 2023 is much higher than 1xxx  and I did not do RSTU in 2023.,btohqsg
RSTU money and the interests earned from those are supposedly ringfenced.0.04 * 26k ~= 1k which sounds about right,btohqsg
Hi  i am planning to buy an iphone. Which category of uob lady's card should i should to get the 6mpd?,btohqsg
Wah.. so which card is the best for apple store purchase?,btohqsg
oh thanks  I thought it is the whole SA amount of 4%,btohqsg
Which cards u have ? 😂,btohqsg
The amounts reserved should be RSTU + interests earned. Does the number roughly makes sense given your history of RSTU?,btohqsg
Buy from Krisshop  with travel category,btohqsg
depends on how you are getting the phone. ishopChangi or krisshop then UOB Lady's Travel. Full sticker price. Check out milelion's article,btohqsg
yes for my 26xxx amount reserved,btohqsg
I am getting directly from apple online store,btohqsg
I have uob lady's  priv miles and uob amex,btohqsg
You are right. For the December promo  the earmark only commences on 31 Jan 2024. No wonder.,btohqsg
travel.. if you buy from krisshop,btohqsg
How to know the amount of rstu and its corresponding interest that are ringfenced if I have more than $40k in SA?,btohqsg
U can try the other recommendation but I didn’t try it before.,btohqsg
this one very dangerous with people reporting it gets converted to offline transaction.safest would be Amaze+CRMC but $1k aint enough.i have no suggestion for apple online store other than SCB Manhattan for 3% cashback,btohqsg
Your earned interests from RSTU will be reserved by default.,btohqsg
Oh ok... in that case i use uob cashback since it has no cap,btohqsg
uob cashback has no cap??which one?!,btohqsg
U can go down to the physical Apple Store to split ur payments into multiple cards,btohqsg
I think he’s referring to the uob absolute Amex,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have reached basic health care sum in 2023. May I ask why does my medisave today on 1 Jan 2024 doesn't show the new basic health care sum? Haha all my medisave interest went into SA,btohqsg
As intended. You can now VCMA 3k.,btohqsg
this is the logic cos interest is credited 31 dec. as bhs only increases 1 jan  the interest goes into sa instead,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Amex 1.7% cashback.. quite low leh,btohqsg
Just check my spouse's amount reserved stays the same  in 2023 =  $64xxx and 2024 also $64xxx ($0 difference)  only 8K MA top-up and no RSTU in 2023,btohqsg
then maybe should call in and check with CPF.Alternatively theres a 1M65 chat group which has helpful admins that may know more,btohqsg
Reserved or total SA? It's 2 different things.,btohqsg
For amount in CPF SA that can be used for investment  it needs to be the excess of $40K of the SA. Does this 40K also include the reserved amount from RSTU or not?,btohqsg
Reserved amount even if more than 40K cannot be used for anything other than CPF Life.,btohqsg
Yes  this one  no change in 2023 and 2024,btohqsg
No choice.. other cards have cap,btohqsg
Hi guys  I probably may have heard or seen about this in one of Chris’s video  but just checking again.For HSBC EGA+ deposit $2000 requirement  do I also have to maintain that in that account or just have a deposit transaction statement of $2000 to qualify that requirement?My intention is to transfer out that $2000 immediately after that.,btohqsg
Then have to check with CPF already. If never increase sounds like never receive interest lol.,btohqsg
Can withdraw immediately. Once you qualify for Everyday+ rewards  you should receive an SMS from HSBC,btohqsg
there is SA interest on 31 Dec,btohqsg
HSBCSG(1/2): You've qualified for the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme! From now until 31JAN2024  enjoy 1% Cashback on your HSBC card spends and GIRO bill,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarification with example!,btohqsg
Hi when will the webull moneybull $3000usd cash voucher be credited?,btohqsg
I think I recall the tnc said by 5 Jan  according to what I noted down in my notes,btohqsg

Test with amaze to whichever portal u have first before doing the real big purchase. Recently I discovered a few mcc different from others shared and also on heymax hence test with block card is better.,btohqsg
That one Amaze + KF UOB... assuming you can clock $800 min spend on SIA/Scoot/KrisShop in membership year,btohqsg
Is there any spending cap per month for DBS one altitude card?,btohqsg
any preference  when to do SRS contribution? Like start or end of year?,btohqsg
Earlier you contribute  the earlier you can invest it. Basically time in the market.But if your cash is in a high interest bank account already  maybe it's better to contribute late as investments are not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Wouldn't buying iphone on krisshop via Kris+ be more optimal?,btohqsg
Hi  If I haven't open the uob account  can I open the account now and join this event?,btohqsg
Hi. Does this means we need to keep the increment fresh funds of $100k till 17th May 2024? And also we will be getting the $558 on 29th Feb 2024?,btohqsg
Hi Guys  quick question  I just got my UOB lady’s solitaire card and selected travel and dining. However  based on the UNI rewards  I need seem to get 15* UNI based on the category.  Do you guys know why?,btohqsg
You got the 1x  14x will be credited likely tomorrow as a lump sum,btohqsg
I see  that’s explains. Thanks a lot!!,btohqsg
Keep increment fresh funds from 31 Dec (effectively 30 Dec 10pm because of cut-off timings) till 17 May 24.,btohqsg
Doesn’t seem to indicate a max spend on it,btohqsg
dbs altitude card u mean? No limit if u referring to the 1.3mpd,btohqsg
I guess you got the answer 👍🏻,btohqsg
Guys  are you emptying your CIMB account now?,btohqsg
does the EGA 1% also apply to CPF SA topups through Giro? T&Cs only specify “giro bill payments” - hoping they’re using ‘bill’ loosely…,btohqsg
For my promo with CIMB is end of Jan why so early ? I remember first batch should only end of Jan leh,btohqsg
alamak..guys..my CIMB last day got interest $50 deposited...so last day of january i must maintain the figure inclusive of this $50?to continue enjoy bonus interest?,btohqsg
Not really sure abt how they calculate the interest. Can share pls?,btohqsg
i also..short of $1 plus.. from i counted myself..haha..3.5% of daily closing balance.. then add up,btohqsg
Hey guys  which credit card would you advise for local spend on groceries  food etc.fresh grad here  so high interest savings account isn't a big factor for me,btohqsg
Sharing: kiddy palace is mcc 5941 not 5945 as shown in heymax   friends who wish to buy there may take note.,btohqsg
Hi. Just wondering if anyone has received their US$3k reward from Webull US$100k or equivalent deposit for 2.5 months promo yet?,btohqsg
isnt that what the pic says?,btohqsg
Without an established income  you can only opt for cards with no/low income requirements.. don't really have much but once you have an established income  you can breakdown your spending and take a look at the cards that may suit your spending,btohqsg
Try applying after 3 mths payslips  UOB EVOL or other UOB CC New To Bank promo  and UOB One Account.,btohqsg
For renovation new flat  which credit card is best to apply now?,btohqsg
Anyone using circle.lifes here. Do pay bills with them earn cc points? Using amaze+crmc,btohqsg
dont think many reno firms accept credit card for payment,btohqsg
Official t&c for Webull first cash voucher date is 5 Jan 2024,btohqsg
So we don’t have to do anything just wait till 5 January 2024,btohqsg
how long will krisshop credit miles after i made purchase,btohqsg
can u check the numbers again? Seems like it's updated.,btohqsg
Trust plus ntuc sounds good if u shop at ntuc,btohqsg
Groceries if can hit the $600 min spend can think about DBS yuu if giant/cs is your thing.But do note that the 18% Cashback is valid till Feb 2024 only  dk if will extend or not.,btohqsg
Hello folks  I need some help regarding my new UOB One card. I frequently use Foodpanda to order groceries from Giant and Cold Storage. Are these purchases eligible for the 10% cashback offer?,btohqsg
How about amaze + citi rewards?,btohqsg
No  since it's charged under Foodpanda,btohqsg
Oh damn! Is there anyway to get delivery from any of them and get the UOB one card 10%cashback?,btohqsg
It should work too  but I don't think anyone would think 18% Cashback < 4mpd lol,btohqsg
Buying miles at 4.5 cents each is ridiculously expensive,btohqsg
It is but evaluating the risk of dbs discontinuing the promo (citi will at least have the 4mpd long term)Both have annual fee as well lol,btohqsg
Given the fact that DBS nerfed all AMAZE* transactions  you can't assume that Citi won't do that at all...And let's be honest  yuu card is basically useless if without these upsized cashback. They might reduce the percentage  but to completely eliminate or slash to below 5% is quite unlikely  especially when Citi Cashback Card's 8% cashback is right around the corner and you can shop in any grocers  not just Dairy Farm group.,btohqsg
Also  regarding AF... DK if you've seen Chris' video regarding AF waivers.,btohqsg
Any way to get delivery from Giant and get the UOB 10% cashback?,btohqsg
Either you travel to Giant or back in time when Giant is not on foodpanda 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
I didn't ask this  but thanks!,btohqsg
Hello  for the UOB Rising Dragon promotion-Must i fill in the registration form before i deposit  or can i just deposit money in UOB account first  and wait till end Jan to fill in the form?Reason being i emptied out my account on 30 Dec  and i have some TBills maturing soon. So i need to wait for a while before i can hit the tier for this promo.Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi all  can i check  the UOB One account credit card spending can start spending on the 1st of every calender month right? Cos the app hasnt refresh for my spending tracking,btohqsg
They stopped offering delivery and online orders the day they onboard FP,btohqsg
can spend even before that so long posted in the calendar month,btohqsg
Hi  for uob one account. I have uob lady card and also uob one card. If let's say i spend 200$ on uob one and 300$ on uob lady. Does it consider hitting the 500$ minimum spending requirements. Or i need to do it with 1 card,btohqsg
hi  for the UOB rising dragon promo  my balance for 31 dec is 0.If I sign up on 02 Jan and top up 100k on 02 Jan  is this sufficient? Or do I have to top up more to account for 01 Jan which was a PH such that ADB is >100K?,btohqsg
"Hi all  referring to this. I have put the $4k in on 31 Dec 2023. currently now still shows ""You have pending investments"" am i able to withdraw the investment given that it is already 2 Jan 2024? or would I probably need to wait till the amount has been invested in before can sell?",btohqsg
Hi all  if my statement date is 2nd of every month  when will my new statement start? On the 2nd of 3rd of every month?So for my cashback is it calculated from 2 Jan to 1 Feb or 3 Jan to 2 Feb? Thanks in advance :),btohqsg
Can do with multiple eligible uob cards like lady  evol  uoboneBut u wont meet the uobone card benefits. Why not clock that 200 to uoblady.At least  it still give you 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
Assume that $200 u charging to uobone is not your selected category for uob lady 6mpd,btohqsg
Coz the lady card i just got it. Totally forgot bout the uob one card 500$ minimum spending. Will cancel that card then. Thanks!!!,btohqsg
Make sure its $0 before 30 Dec 10pm to consider 31 Dec as $0..,btohqsg
posted transactions from 3rd Jan to 2nd Feb,btohqsg
for the promo it should suffice to top up 100k over your 31 Dec balance. Your 31 Dec balance likely have at least base interest and not $0.But to maximize the interest you need to reach $100k ADB e.g. topup 100 000/30=$3333.33 extra on 2nd Jan,btohqsg
hello  will the money set aside for the promotion still earn the 5% interest from the uob one account?,btohqsg
WRT to UOB Xmas promo  I emptied my UOB One acct on 29 Sept. Didn't realise they credited interest on 30 Sept (it was only about $4). Does that mean that I needed to keep at least $100 004 in my account till earmarked?If my account had $100k exactly on 1 Jan day end  does that mean I violated the rules and am no longer eligible? CSO no idea  I just topped up $10 just in case.,btohqsg
Is everyone withdrawing the 4k today?,btohqsg
Hi all  now that hsbc Revo has been nerfed  wad alternative cards would be best to replace? Apart from Lady’s,btohqsg
Oh it doesn’t exclude hotel and airfare?,btohqsg
Ppv gives 4mpd for contactless payments. If online airfare  can consider dbs wmcc,btohqsg
UOB PPV works based on payment mode I think. (Online and contactless),btohqsg
Oh I was looking at the whitelist but it doesn’t include airfare & hotel. So jus wanted to double check,btohqsg
Only hotels and OTA nerfed  the card is still useful and plus there’s no AF. If you need a card for your hotel bookings  add WWMC in your wallet.,btohqsg
Did a video on this recentlyhttps://youtu.be/4wUmKuriG8M?si=omQU37JnBIqKhKWl,btohqsg
Rising Dragon promo  i made a mistake. I did step 2 first( transfer 100k in). Should I transfer out then do step 1 ( participate registration) then transfer fund in again?. Will it work?,btohqsg
If I purchase something using UOB One credit card on the 31st and the credit payment only confirmed today  will the spending be counted for this month or last month?,btohqsg
Sorry you’re rightI wasn’t aware there’s a MCC white list for online txn,btohqsg
I don't think it matters. As long by 30 Dec 10pm the account is empty,btohqsg
Based on the nerfed mcc  I can still get 4mpd for airfare booked directly with SQ/scoot?,btohqsg
Yes as long as not 4722 and 7011,btohqsg
Ok then not as bad as I thought haha,btohqsg
u registered in Dec? did u have $100k in by 30 Dec?,btohqsg

hi all  i wanna open a joint account with my wife for shared stuff like groceries  etc. any good suggestions which bank & account i should open?,btohqsg
i dun think can withdraw cos haven even invested and no units to sell,btohqsg
Yes and yes. It was abt $102k on the 29/12.On 1/1 I decided to clean up a bit n just kept exactly 100k there. Then the interest occurred to me early this morning so I quickly topped up $10.But if they looked at 1/1 day end balance  it would seem I'm $4 short of the required amount.,btohqsg
should be fine since transactions on 1 Jan is dated 2 jan,btohqsg
then u need to keep a min balance of $200k in order to get the $588 bonus,btohqsg
he signed up for xmas promo and emptied on 30 Sep,btohqsg
For those going - MCC is 7399 (Amaze charges a fee for it 🥲),btohqsg
ah sorry i tot he is referring to the CNY Promo.... my bad!,btohqsg
I sure hope you're right  thanks 👍,btohqsg
I’d suggest dbs myaccount as well  which is what I personally use with my spouse. No need to think about maintaining a certain amt inside and potential fall below fee,btohqsg
just curious to ask.. when u guys deposit 100k to UOB for the Promo  what purpose code you use? Sala?,btohqsg
Ok my bad I assume you have 100k or so to put it in,btohqsg
Any code unless your salary does not go inside the account,btohqsg
Sorry I better not act smart though I don't see any issues since it is fresh funds,btohqsg
I would probably call them and ask but see if anyone here can help.,btohqsg
i use this when transferring from dbs,btohqsg
icic.. hope other gurus can enlighten also..,btohqsg
tats why asking all gurus here..,btohqsg
Call cso and ask about salary transfer ? Better don’t call. 😂,btohqsg
He wants to ask are all codes acceptable,btohqsg
"I just leave it as ""others""  will seperately use ""salary payment""  for $1600 to avoid triggering any flag",btohqsg
In a way. I don't think need to say is salary,btohqsg
do you mean initial transfer of 100k or the monthly transfer of 1.6k. if is the initial 100k then doesnt matter what the code is,btohqsg
thx for elighten.. make senses also..,btohqsg
i mean the 100k for participate the Dragon Promo.. I will leave it as Others..,btohqsg
Thanks - so the 100k to participate in the rising dragon promo dont need any code or comments right?,btohqsg
Anyone withdrawing funds today from the Webull promo ending 31 Dec? Or should we wait till cash voucher to be credited first on 5 Jan?,btohqsg

eg trading stocks / forex / crypto  but you must be willing to learn the methods and stay up late. FYI I'm not well versed in that don't ask me how to do it  but i know got people who do that,btohqsg

Best side hustle is part time jobs when you are free tbh,btohqsg
Should be tomorrow? isnt it usually 2nd working day of the following month,btohqsg
Sir  Let’s say if don’t have time to do part time jobs then working from home is the only way to earn some money right? Or is there anyways to earn money,btohqsg
Any side hustle will require a dedication of time to it,btohqsg
Just the arbitrage of time vs operating margins/profits,btohqsg
1. You trade - buy and sell  need time and capital injection 2. You do part time over weekend  hourly pay,btohqsg
3. you produce - arts and craft  food and you sell - still need time to produce  market and capital injection,btohqsg
there are side hustle jobs that you can WFH. But still need time. eg freelance writing  English tutoring  trading (as mentioned above).But if no time then suck thumb. Find a different job that allows you more time then.,btohqsg
"yup the idea of ""passive income"" only comes in if you have lots of capital to inject.",btohqsg

A lot of times the money you get is from another victim. i.e. if the victim realizes and reports the transactions  best case scenario is the money gets clawed back. Worse case you get implicated as part of the scam and kena investigation. If the police is able to prove that you were aware of the scam and trying to profit from it  you can get charged for receiving illegal proceeds.,btohqsg
If you don't have time for part time job then how you gonna hustle and work from home? Side hustle also need effort and time  almost can consider as a job. Prioritise your time  if you desperately need the money  you will sacrifice unnecessary fun and some sleep.,btohqsg
Hi  can ask for advice. I have applied uob one account online and was approved on last Wed  but till now I haven't receive the debit card to activate my account. Is this uob normal turnaround time to send the debit card? They need more than 3 working days? As I have a normal singpost delivery posted on thurs and has received on fri  thus unlikely its delayed due to delivery.,btohqsg
Saw this on the CPF site:Make your cash top-up or CPF transfer early to earn more through the power of compounding interest. If you make a top-up in January instead of December  you can earn up to 20% more interest in just 10 years on those monies.Why is it so? What is the calculation behind it? 🤔,btohqsg
Can try downloading UOB TMRW and click on login  and then set it up now. Then follow the form. I remember I can login even without any cards.,btohqsg
Oh can ah. Sure will try tks,btohqsg
They took 7 working days to deliver my card. Guess it's normal 🤷🏻,btohqsg
Need card if this is your 1st account,btohqsg
So is around 0.3273% per month?,btohqsg
Might have e-card issued though  since the banking app allows you to add to your mobile wallet directly iirc,btohqsg
Have digital card  but when I first login  I only the UOB One account. Don't have any cards.,btohqsg
Hello! Have been watching the YT vids. Decided to join the group 🤟,btohqsg
not sure if will be eligible for rewards if pull trigger and withdraw today. If keeping in until receive rewards it is till Feb. But reading TnCs by right if withdraw today should still be eligible to get. Reducing ur investment risk (ie. principal invested falling below amount put in). If anyone has called SNACK CSO and gotten update on if possible to withdraw today and still get reward pls update!,btohqsg
Hi hi 👋 will like to ask for advise ... Currently I am using a Citi cash back card and will like to upgrade to either miles or better cash back cards  what are some better plans out there for 2024 ?,btohqsg
You get a 4% (or more) head start by depositing in Jan instead of Dec  and then that additional amount will also continue to grow through compounding.,btohqsg
I didn't do any calculations but I assume if account remains at 68 500 till 30 Dec 24 before you do a top up and topping up to 71 500 on 01 Jan 24 should result in some difference in the interest.,btohqsg
I should state that 68 500 and subsequently increasing due to contributions to MA,btohqsg
Depends on spending...but Citi Cash Back (not Cash Back+) is one of the best out there. Alternative would be Maybank F&F  UOB EVOL  UOB ONE,btohqsg
Let say a min spend around 1k ?,btohqsg
generally in what categories or chapalang?,btohqsg
For now is chapalang haha 😂,btohqsg
can consider Maybank Plat Visa and try to hit the 1k tier,btohqsg
If you want miles can consider citi rewards + Amaze,btohqsg
This is my current 2024 card strategy  for referencehttps://youtu.be/T0dtcQXhDXs?si=90asotPB3LQfrPHa,btohqsg
If you spend mostly in person vs online  UOB PPV is a great 4mpd “general” card. If you spend consistently over 1k per month  then UOB VSOr get both  then use whichever card is more appropriate depending on your forecasted spending pattern for that month,btohqsg
Hi all  regarding miles transfer fee  is it charged per credit card?For example  i have 2 credit cards from the same bank. So i have to pay the miles transfer fee twice?,btohqsg
some cards have pooling some dont have  so need to read the T&C,btohqsg
Does UOB lady's card and PPV have pooling?,btohqsg
uob uni$ pool and dbs rewards points pool,btohqsg
Existing account holders only $240 if invest 4K. 😞,btohqsg
i think existing account holder..if invested $4k on 1st Jan (and activate old and new challenges) can get $400 + $240,btohqsg
Is it recommended to use UOB miles card (since there is pooling) or use CR + amaze?,btohqsg
My main is UOB Evol  then the other spendings i used on CR as of now,btohqsg
Oh means I missed the 1 Jan promo. 😭,btohqsg
Yes provided MCC tallies  will suggest using Ladies with Amaze for better FX,btohqsg
Actually this monthly promo around for the longest time. Just didn't do it until all the recent recommendation in the various channel. 🤷,btohqsg
I think I miss this snack income stuff  can any kind soul tell me what do I need to do to earn?,btohqsg
I transfer employer. How long should I wait before I apply new credit card to increase chance of approval?,btohqsg
Did syfe revise their 3 month 4% guaranteed rate? Can't seem to find it anymore,btohqsg
Seems like it. Same for Stashaway too.,btohqsg
Ya seeing the same thing now... Dropped to 3.7%,btohqsg
O well  was good while it lasted,btohqsg
Stashaway is 3.8% for 3 months,btohqsg
the 4% was a promo until Dec 30  2023 only,btohqsg
omg... yesterday still remain 4%... so fast change to 3.7,btohqsg
maybe coz it was still holiday yesterday  they haven't updated it. But i remember seeing on their website saying Dec 30 as last day for the 4% promo,btohqsg
hhmm does this mean the local banks will start to decrease their deposit interest rates too?,btohqsg
i think they still give the 4% from my end...,btohqsg
This is just another indication that interest rates as a whole are going down after the fed indicated softening of their stance recently  but of course need to be careful when making plans assuming actual rate cuts  which haven’t actually happened yet.But it cuts both ways too - lower FD rates but also lower mortgage/personal loan rates,btohqsg
I see. Any tips on where to park the money for around 2-3 years to lock in the interest rate ?,btohqsg
Theres plenty of options to park for 2-3 years  but what you gain in assurance you trade off in interest rate. Or you can get more flexibility  but also trade off interest rate,btohqsg
20% is just a rough estimate. (a) shows Jan top-ups while (b) shows Dec top-ups. End of the day calculated is 19.1% difference after 10 years.,btohqsg
Total interest for (a) is $2472.63 and (b) is $2000.35.,btohqsg
https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/18ucr9t/uob_one_bonus_interest_take_note_of_credit_card/PSA - If you get a refund on UOB One Account linked CC... your spend requirement also go up lol,btohqsg
Hahaha thought was explicitly stated in tnc that refunds will minus from spending... But going negative is insane,btohqsg
yeah thats where im kinda mindblown too cause tracker wont indicate negative value,btohqsg
Although to be fair  at least UOB isn’t clawing back the past interest if there’s a refund  this only affects the current month. And as pointed out in the comments if they didn’t deduct from the spend goal it would be a pretty big loophole.Agree that the tracker should have reflected though,btohqsg
Tks to all who replied to my uob one account and the delay in sending my debit card. I have called and verified at branch. Indeed that a card  e.g. debit card if first time opening a uob one account is needed to login to the app. If u already have a uob account and has an existing debit card  it will linked to the existing debit card after u opened a uob account. Hence no new debit card will be sent to u.,btohqsg
Any platforms you would suggest to park for 2-3 years?,btohqsg
Hi  is it possible to get the UOB Lady’s Solitaire card without hitting income requirements?,btohqsg
Yes  can apply for lady’s then upgrade,btohqsg
Does it have a certain time buffer require? Or can after one month try to upgrade?,btohqsg
Did you managed to catch the Stashaway 4% 3M deal when i shared with you?,btohqsg
I know some people tried a few days after they got their normal lady’s.,btohqsg
Today morning I see still 4%. Haha.,btohqsg
Will delete all irrelevant links posted without explanation,btohqsg
It happen to me for dec as well  i use uob chat and cso advice to spend 500 plus 500 (total 1k) for jan to appeal in feb for dec bonus interest,btohqsg
I've gotten the Salary Credit and Card Spend bonus interest but not the Bill Payment category. I assumed it was just fast transfer out and I did that more than 3 times in Dec.  Did i missed out something or I can't do fast transfer?,btohqsg
Hi  I want to open a joint account with my wife. I alr have a uob one acc but my wife doesnt. Can we open a joint uob one acc with her being the primary holder and still able to enjoy EIR 5%?,btohqsg
Yes if fulfill 100k plus credit card spending on eligible card with her as principle card holder for the credit card,btohqsg
My wife is not working. Can i credit $1.6k monthly using the SALA method and spend $500 using the debit card  still able to benefit from EIR 5%?,btohqsg
A quick Google search got me this. Check if your bill payments are via GIRO or their online banking platform (not funds transfer).,btohqsg
oh haha  ok  thanks. will try this month. thought like HSBC ega.,btohqsg
It is ok. In the competition  it might go back up. Just as it did go up to 4%. Wait and see,btohqsg
3mths at 3.8% is still good  in my opinion,btohqsg
But would this in any way violate clause 6 iii (i.e. fresh fund should not been withdrawn from an existing UOB account and redeposited from a different bank)? Not sure how they would even tell if the origin of fund if the incoming fund is from a different bank....,btohqsg
Which is why people withdraw on 30 dec which is not within the promotional period  rising dragon promo is from 1 jan to 30 mar,btohqsg
Just do before promotional period 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Dear all On the topic of topping up CPF using cash. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.Max annual CPF contribution: $37740Assuming $8000 for monthly salary and 2.5 months of AWS + Bonus2024:OW Ceiling =$6800x 12 = $81600$81600 x 0.37= $30192 CPF OW (Only $6800 is subjected to CPF)AW= $8000 x 2.5 = $20000$20000 x 0.37 = $7400 CPF AWCPF AnnualContribution =$37740 - $30192 - $7400 = $148Conclusion:We can only top up $148  to our CPF account for FY 20242025:OW Ceiling =$7200x 12 = $86400$86400x 0.37= $31968 CPF OW (Only $7200 is subjected to CPF)AW= $8000 x 2.5 = $20000$20000 x 0.37 = $7400 CPF AWCPF AnnualContribution =$37740 - $31968 - $7400 = -$1628Conclusion:Of the $7400  due to CPF annual limit  only $5772 will be subjected to CPF contribution. In this case  I cannot top up using cash.,btohqsg
I’ve already hit the CPF Full Retirement Sum of 2026https://youtu.be/VbGAB4zg0uU,btohqsg
A quick question  if I use my HSBC revolution credit card to buy airtickets from Singapore airline website  is it eligible for 10x points? I heard those transactions on travels are excluded now. Thanks,btohqsg
You are referring to VC3A? You still can do VCMA if haven't hit BHS or RSTU if haven't hit FRS.Which technically before your standard CPF contribution this month happens  you should have a little bit of space to contribute with cash.,btohqsg
Chris shared a video earlier today  you can find it by scrolling up the chat.,btohqsg
Hi  I read that voluntary contribution also limit to $37740,btohqsg
And if I know that it will hit $37740  and if I top up  what will happen to my employers contribution on the last month?,btohqsg
I see  so which mean $71500-$68500= $3000,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. So the annual limit is for normal salary contributions,btohqsg
Mandatory contributions (employee's and employer's) + VC3A (no tax relief),btohqsg
Hey guys  anyone have a electric company other than SP with good sign up deals and services to recommend?Update2 members has shared senoko referral already,btohqsg
If you top-up VC3A and hit $37740 because of mandatory contribution  your VC3A will be refunded  without interest. Meaning the money would have been better off doing nothing in SRS at 0.05% p.a. lol.,btohqsg
Hi everyone..  I need advice on BHS given 2024 is ~$71k minimum sum.If MA been voluntarily top up $8K and having fixed $556 monthly contribution. I realised I still can’t close the gap to minimum sum of BHS. Don’t mention BHS is moving target year on year . Is there anyway to close the gap in the Medisave account to hit BHS?,btohqsg
Hmm but if the fund is coming from a non-UOB bank account under a different name  it is ok to withdraw from an existing UOB account?,btohqsg
1. VCMA/VC3A without tax relief2. Children top-up your VCMA for their tax relief3. Increase salary for higher MA contribution,btohqsg
If no children your best bet is to increase salary if you don't want to contribute without tax relief,btohqsg
Why would that be so if you top up 8k every year,btohqsg
Don't need to rush to hit BHS. Everyone's speed is different. Enjoy the $8K annual tax relief along the way,btohqsg
Yeah withdrew it before promotional period  transferred to my UOB Cash Plus by accident (so had to withdraw to my DBS bank account),btohqsg
unfortunately no  BHS of cohort will only stop incrementing once u hit 55. Example this year if u are 55 yrs old  so moving on your BHS max capped at $71500,btohqsg
My runway so long ahead before I hit 55 y.o  that means cap sum by then is way higher than $71k ?,btohqsg
It's not a 'minimim sum'  BHS is the maximum that you can have in MA.,btohqsg
Theres no need to force urself to hit bhs  thats jus the amt u set aside for healthcare needs.,btohqsg
Every year just consistently do VCMA 8k during end Jan. You'll clock higher monthly interest. Eventually will hit one. Your salary won't be stagnant for next 5 years also ma. Don't need to worry.,btohqsg
U mean end of dec instead of Jan ?,btohqsg
He mean Jan so you can get full interest,btohqsg
I believe if I can fit BHS by 30 with less than $500 monthly MA contributions  you can hit faster with your over $500 monthly MA contributions.,btohqsg
Anyone? My account is still not funded till now also. 😂,btohqsg
This month  Jan 2024. If you top-up this year Dec  you will only clock interest next year Jan onwards. If you top-up this month  you will clock interest from next month onwards.,btohqsg
Mine too. Number of units invested still show zero,btohqsg
Sorry  can I confirm regarding UOB STASH ACCOUNT + Rising Dragon Savings PromoExisting: Uniplus Account ($500 balance)Plan:1) Open a new STASH ACCOUNT.2) Participate in Rising Dragon Promotion.3) Deposit $100 000 to UOB STASH ACCOUNT.4) Leave it for 4 monthsE.I.R = 4.674%p.a. (for 4 months)*STASH ACCOUNT E.I.R. = 4%*Rising Dragon Savings Promo E.I.R. = 1.674%($558 for 4 months)Thanks,btohqsg
If u read the tnc  there's a clause that says when the unit will be invested. Anyway  the condition for the reward left too much rm for interpretation  so i didnt jump in.,btohqsg
Make sure your total amount don't drop below $100 5xx... I assume your $500 under uniplus account is estimated figure..,btohqsg
Thanks.Oh  I only keep the minimum balance of $500 to avoid fall below fee  with Interest per month $0.02.Then  I won't touch both accounts for 4 months.,btohqsg
I'm assuming no other accounts right 😅 like One account or lady account,btohqsg
Ya  it doesn't seem attractive until I read about the Rising Dragon Promo,btohqsg
Ya  I only have Uniplus + Fixed deposit currently. FD doesn't matter right? Will mature in a month and plan to withdraw.,btohqsg
Yup don't matter. Tnc states current and saving accounts,btohqsg
From my understanding  there are 2 set of challenge for the rewards.First set of challenge for $400 vouchers. The challenge period ended on 01 Jan 2024. That’s if you withdraw after 01 Jan 2024  you will get the voucher.Second set of challenge for $2xx vouchers. The challenge period is till 29 Jan  and we need to hold the funds after 29 Jan in order to be eligible for the rewards ie $2xx vouchers.Let me know if I interpret it right.,btohqsg
So if we withdraw funds now  we may lose the $2xx vouchers,btohqsg

hey  thanks for your reply. yes that is what i understand as well. I did not sign up for the $2xx Jan vouchers challenge as i did my top up on 31 Dec for the $400 only. my understanding from the TnCs is that if we take out today (I would still get the $400 reward as it is fulfilled having put in investment during the challenge period  which ended on 1 Jan 2024)  only issue that i see is that there are potentially things that may be embedded/grey within certain clauses of TnC that dont allow you to withdraw now (ie. after 2nd Jan) not allowing you to get the reward. was just wondering if someone has managed to speak/contact SNACK CSO to confirm if can withdraw from the account today (for those who would prefer not to have investment risk),btohqsg
"""new Standard Chartered credit card holders only"" means those that have SCB cards before not eligible?",btohqsg
Are you gonna withdraw today? Technically I think if withdraw now will get back full 4k?,btohqsg

Hi Melvyn  you are saying that top up in Jan is much better compared to year end Dec top up. Be it for Self Top Up to Own SA or Top Up to loved ones?,btohqsg
Basically like every other savings accounts.. earlier you put  earlier the account clock interest... The difference is that interest on contributions will be clocked on the following month so it matters less which day you put in but more on which month you put in.,btohqsg

eventually you will hit the bhs. i have not done topups and am only scheduled to hit bhs when im 37. after that then the supercharge of sa will take place. even at this slower pace  still should be able to hit 1m by 55,btohqsg
but just want to get a general feel. for others that hasnt done any vcma  what age did you guys hit bhs?,btohqsg
Can consider thishttps://www.heartlandboy.com/Of course Chris yt should be the main source.,btohqsg
How will you hit BHS by 37 without top ups?,btohqsg
through employment income lo. 102k x 8% is 8160 yearly not including interest  bhs only increases ~3k yearly. slowly close the gap,btohqsg
Yea but isn’t the contribution limit 37740? So 8% = 3019? Or am I wrong? Sorry just trying to learn here,btohqsg
nono 37740 is 37% of 102k. below 35  the 37% is further broken down into 23% oa  6% sa  8% ma. so you take 8% of 102k and not 37740,btohqsg
I’m scheduled to hit at around 35 at my current rate. Didn’t do any voluntary top up but was fortunate to hit the cpf limit early on in my career,btohqsg
thats why quite important to get a good starting pay. i only managed to hit the limit at 32/33,btohqsg
Ok ok. So if I have 40k left to reach BHS  it’d take me roughly 5 years more (assuming I hit cpf limit alr and BHS amt doesn’t change) Thanks!,btohqsg
Can anyone educate me on the FD Rates  why i lock 6mth get more interest than locking up 12mth?,btohqsg
u talking about the p.a. interest rate? Cos guaranteeing interest rate over a longer period incur more risk. Should interest rates drop in future the bank cannot adjust the interest lower.,btohqsg
It doesn't matter if it doesn't exist,btohqsg

Are you asking about your 2024 VCMA limit?,btohqsg
I dun see anything wrong for you to withdraw as based on TnC  u should still eligible for the rewards,btohqsg

Question for self employed  since there is no way to supercharge ur SA. Only way is to do rstu to hit frs right?Last year I top up to hit bhs  so that interest flows into SA.

What happen if UOB suddenly revised Stash account interest rate lower eg. $100k EIR to 2.0% and I take up Rising Dragon promo  total rate will become2% + 1.674% = 3.674% right?,btohqsg
What do you mean? You already hit BHS? 71k in MA?,btohqsg
Dont kancheong and give it some days to update lah.,btohqsg
Lol never actually used this dashboard.. mine also same. I just count the contributions myself so I don't really bother about this 🙃,btohqsg
site still says No vouchers leh..🤔,btohqsg
Okk  we’re gonna top up but saw this seems not updated yet so don’t dare to top up yet  thanks,btohqsg
No rush ma. Unless your cpf contributions come in tomorrow,btohqsg
We’re stand by in for end of the month top up  will wait and see then,btohqsg
in that case other banks likely will decrease interest also,btohqsg
What is the EIR of HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 vs uob one account which one have better promotion now?,btohqsg
I am 45 self employed. When i retired at 55 the amount in my SA and OA combine if more than the FRS then what is above this FRS amt i can withdraw out as cash at 55 correct?,btohqsg
Hello  for UOB Evol  are utility bills considered an online spend or is it excluded?,btohqsg
How come mine was never added to this month’s spending? The CC spending status was changed from “pending” to “approved”,btohqsg
think the tracker need 1 or 2 days to be updated,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGin your latest video why did you only top up 3k and not 8k via VCMA to get the full annual tax relief?,btohqsg
I’ve already hit the CPF Full Retirement Sum of 2026https://youtu.be/VbGAB4zg0uU,btohqsg
can we topup MA more than 71500 cap?,btohqsg
Because 71500 (BHS 2024) - 68500 (BHS 2023) = 3000.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/159041,btohqsg
so if top up 3k on MA do you guys still top up on SA?,btohqsg
If your SA not FRS  then yes to get tax relief.,btohqsg
Any thoughts on doing VHR? Or isit better to do a topup to SA/MA since interest rate > debt accrued ?,btohqsg
just a noob qns. should i top up SA straight instead of MA?i know MA will overflow to SA eventually,btohqsg
Probably you are right  since the amount for the promo will be earmarked,btohqsg
So in Chris' case if I vcma 8k  5k will flow to OA and I would get a total of 8k of tax relief?,btohqsg
There are people who suggest top up MA first for SA shielding.,btohqsg
No. He can only VCMA 3k. He cannot RSTU as he already hit 2026 FRS.,btohqsg
Welcome  seems like you're new here. You can refer to this message for a summarised guide for CPF.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158140,btohqsg
If straight away top up S$8k to SA  the funds will be marked as reserved and not available for SA shielding. As such  top up S$8k to MA is more optimal?,btohqsg
So the moment I hit FRS and BHS  however much i top up be it via RSTU or VCMA will not get any tax relief,btohqsg
Correct. And if you haven't hit 40k for SA  you can transfer OA to SA if you have any amount exceed 20k in OA for higher interest rates. Magic number for SA is 40k.,btohqsg
careful all..CDC got scam..fake link think got ask to DL app,btohqsg
Just go through the actual website lol.https://vouchers.cdc.gov.sg/,btohqsg
but my queue number 50k plus....zzzzzZZz..haha,btohqsg
Hi  I'm keen to apply for a credit card with the earning of basic credit card eligibility. I'm a beginner and which card can I apply for?,btohqsg
what is reserved fund in my SA mean?,btohqsg
Only have 100k to move around.. still better on uob?,btohqsg
Hi   is it too late to top up for tax relief for 2024 now ?,btohqsg
No minimum spend can look at dbs altitude  citi premiermiles to understand your spend pattern forst + lounge access,btohqsg
Yeah  because only has 3k of gap to top up when at BHS,btohqsg
Reserved amounts are from RSTU. They will only be used for the formation of RA and CPF Life. The interests are also reserved.,btohqsg
Tax relief for 2024 just opened only. Are you referring to tax relief for 2023? Top-ups must be done before 31 Dec to qualify.,btohqsg
means should we avoid reserved amount as much as possible? if MA is BHS but SA not yet FRS should we squeeze VCMA when there's gap then balance RSTU at year end?,btohqsg
Hi. May I check  if I top up 3k to MA  how much tax reduction will be for 2024?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if Citi rewards + amaze can get bonus points for public transport?,btohqsg
It means you need to maintain 40k in SA no matter what you do to shield the SA near age 55. Regards to OA top up to SA  if your SA is FRS amount  you can’t do that too.,btohqsg
Tax relief for VCMA/RSTU is dollar for dollar  up to 8k for self and 8k for loved ones  or how much you top-up  whichever lower.,btohqsg
Hello  can I also check what does it mean for SA amount to be reserved/what's the implication for it?,btohqsg
Have been answered  can scroll up to find the answer.,btohqsg
anyone having problems getting bonus rewards when they paired amaze with uob ladies card as well? spent 300+ on my selected category but uob said that the system could not read the MCC because I paired the card with Amaze. They had to apply for my bonus rewards manually. Having to do this every month would be a nightmare.,btohqsg
Hi guys one very stupid and quick question.I just created a uob one savings account would wonder if the card  that  comes with the account if spend using that  counts towards the 500 spend?The Web statesUOB One Debit Visa Card  uob one Debit masters card count towards the 500 spendBut i don't know which card is  issued upon bank opening.Reason for asking is because I don't want to miss this month interest and the credit card taking forever,btohqsg
So just can't be used for other investment? Ok thank you 🙏,btohqsg
Has anyone received their WeBull promo for the first batch who signed up in oct 2023?,btohqsg
No leh  amaze dont change the mcc. It remain the same,btohqsg
yeh amaze doesn't change the MCC. but the UOB bank system cannot detect the MCC when i pair it with amaze according to the bank officer. But for Citi rewards no issue when i pair it with amaze.,btohqsg
I have been using amaze pair lady for more then 6 month now  nvr have issue with bonus point,btohqsg
All these is bonus point for my transaction in dec when i link amaze to my lady,btohqsg
Hi  I'm keen to apply for a credit card with the earning of basic credit card eligibility. I'm a beginner and which card can I apply for? I'm basically looking forward to earn miles and get access to priority pass or any lounge. Which card do you recommend getting without having a minimum spend? Because being a student with a job has nothing much to spend on. And what are the things that I have to keep up after getting credit card? As I'll be booking tickets for airtravel soon in next month  I would like to use that as the opputunity to earn miles and for free access lounge. I've have some doubt on getting credit card that suits me.,btohqsg
Just be careful that Shopback voucher MCC are mostly 7299 now,btohqsg
I think the issue is not the system cant detect the mcc but the mcc dont fall under your selected cat as u assume it would be. U can always vet check the mcc on instarem app itself for transaction that u think fall under the bonus cat.,btohqsg
If you spend thru amaze  it will reflect amaze* no?,btohqsg
Just double check the mcc for for your transaction on instarem,btohqsg
Hmm probably yes  depending on how UOB interpret 6 (iii)  has anyone been disqualified from the promo in the past for withdrawing from their other existing non-UOB accounts  despite maintaining the day end balance across all accounts throughout the promo and earmark period?,btohqsg
Yeh it's definitely correct MCC because the officer says she will reward me with the bonus UNI points. I used it fortrip.combookings  selected rewards cateogry is travel. Just that system cannot read the MCC for some reason because i used amaze (those were her words).,btohqsg
Yes nowadays all mostly is 7299  dont know what is wrong with shopback voucher payment system,btohqsg
If cant read mcc then also wont even have based reward point leh. That is very weird with what the cso told u.,btohqsg
i won't risk iti would always ensure that total balances are always Earmarked amount + total Original Balances (all accounts).,btohqsg
"Hi Guys! Wanted to ask if I choose my category as ""Dining"" on the UOB Ladies card  Would that dining apply to overseas dining as well? or would that fall under travel! Thank you!",btohqsg
I have reached FRS and BHS for 2023.Now that we are in 2024 and it’s revised amount of SA and MA.May I know the if RTSU made at the beginning of the year to 2024 FRS and BHS level will go towards tax savings.,btohqsg
Doesnt matter so long MCC in the whitelist,btohqsg
Wondering any good use cases for this 🤷🏻,btohqsg
quite no point leh  coz 5% cashback  they also give u shopee coin. Each day u can only spend 1000coins ($10)It may be worth it if u buy things from shopee very frequently 🤔,btohqsg

No min spend for these cards  max $1k for HSBC for 4mpd. Check your statements monthly and pay on time. HSBC Revo no annual fee  other cards ask for fee waiver if needed.,btohqsg
For the card with annual fee  how can I waive it off?,btohqsg
If I get a credit card  I must spend the money right? Cannot holdback and bring it on to the next month  am I right?,btohqsg
Call bank or use bank app  depending on card.,btohqsg
Think u can go to a bank branch to get one of the uob one debit card,btohqsg
The HSBC Revo card cannot be used for lounge access? And also they have changed the MCC right  so can it be used for booking air tickets because it's under travel options...,btohqsg
If no spend on a card  statement balance is 0 and no need to pay. If there is spend  statement will indicate deadline and amount to pay.,btohqsg
Hi  if a person has 500 K extra lying in the bank  may I know what's the best way to segregate it to earn the max interest ? Thank u 😀,btohqsg
So the interest won't be added right?,btohqsg
The HSBC Revo card cannot be used for lounge access? And also they have changed the MCC right  so can it be used for booking air tickets because it's under travel options...,btohqsg
this is seemingly a straightforward question  but to answer it would be actually distilling all the tips and tricks of this community and perhaps even ACCM tricks..,btohqsg
TLDR: you need to break it down into $100k sizes and do hoops and tricks to earn the max interest in each bank's high interest rate accounts,btohqsg
are dbs accounts/cards worth holding? currently im keeping 100k in uob one for p.a. interest and transferring out the extra balance into my existing dbs account  but dbs cards/rewards dont seem very competitive anymore,btohqsg
These cards not linked to bank account. Interest for unpaid balance.,btohqsg
no interest if u pay fully bill amount on the CC statement by due date,btohqsg
OK  if I didn't make any purchase of the month will there be any interest amount that I have to pay?,btohqsg
Except the miles what's the difference between citi premier miles and citi rewards mc?,btohqsg
No. If previous balances all paid.,btohqsg
Citi Premier = Citi Points (never expire)Crmc = Thank You Points (expire after 5 years of your card approval date),btohqsg
So as a beginner in credit card  which is the best credit card for accumulating miles and lounge access?,btohqsg
you can hit to those specialised cards (4mpd and 6mpd). but those cards do not have lounge access (i think). I would say crmc with amaze cause blacklist in nature.only generalised spend card (1.1mpd and above) have lounge access. personally i took citipm cause never expire and have 2 lounge visit as a starter,btohqsg
So it's between  citi premier and citi rewards right?,btohqsg
citipm = 1.2mpd (local)  2mpd (overseas)  x2 lounge access per yearcrmc = 4mpd (blacklist),btohqsg
What do you mean by blacklist?,btohqsg
So crmc can't be used for the complimentary lounge access?,btohqsg
you “don’t really need to be careful” when using crmc with amaze cause all can except the usual exclusions (insurances  utilities  fines etc).Conversely  a whitelist is something you need to be careful. Specialised Whitelist cards are HSBC Revo  UOB KFNOTE: There’s an updated list of merchants that will incur 1% additional cost (i think) when you use amaze linked to crmc.,btohqsg
CRMC doesn't come with lounge access,btohqsg
Usual exclusions and travel based MCCs...,btohqsg
Can citipm liked with instarem amaze?,btohqsg
oh yes crmc cannot use for travel MCC also. sorry about that!!!,btohqsg
Ohhh okok  so citi premier miles is the best for travelling right?,btohqsg
Yes but no bonus if local spend,btohqsg
U can jump the hoop for each bank or just simply nego a rate with your bank rm to get a privilege rate,btohqsg
So using citipm locally can't earn point?,btohqsg
The 1.2mpd not in terms of TY points.,btohqsg
What's the difference between citipm and dbs altitude card?,btohqsg
https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.htmlhi all  i emptied my uob one saving account on 31 dec so that my end day balance on 31 dec is $0  all these so that i can be eligible for the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion.i then put back in the 100k on 01 jan.however  on my uob tmrw app  it is recorded that the 100k was taken out and put back in on 02 jan.would i still be eligible for the promotion?@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
"It should note that by ""for travelling""  we refer to travel-related expenses like your hotel booking  airline booking  klook etc.",btohqsg
If you pay for a restaurant overseas as a part of your travel  that is Dining (assuming it's not in a hotel..),btohqsg
Yeah  I also meat by air ticket booking. Can used for Airbnb too?,btohqsg
should have emptied by 30 Dec 10.30pm  as after that it will be dated 2 Jan,btohqsg
Citi PM? Yeah you get 1.2mpd for that  but there are probably better cards. See what you have!,btohqsg
What's the difference between citipm and dbs altitude card?,btohqsg
Yeah  i know there even more better cards but I want a card that can be used for both miles and complimentary lounge access  so I was said that citipm is the one...,btohqsg
DBS Alt - 1.3mpd (in blocks of $5)Citi PM - 1.2mpd (blocks of $1),btohqsg
Can you breakdown into simpler terms?,btohqsg
can earn miles using 4mpd/6mpd cards  get lounge access pass using citi pm/dbs alt,btohqsg
"""If I spend $67  how much of the $67 will earn miles?""",btohqsg
oof :( how does it work? is it because 31 dec is weekend? transactions dont get updated?if i emptied on 30 dec 1030pm and only put it back in on 01 jan  it means i wont be earning interest on 30 and 31 dec?,btohqsg
dbs alt can get 1 DBS points every $1.54,btohqsg
Hmm  that's good. But the maintenance of those credit cards are difficult?,btohqsg
oo interesting information  didn't know about that,btohqsg
For UOB rising dragon promo  i transferred 1.6k on 2nd Jan  if i transfer separately another 98.4k today/tmr. I’ll still be considered eligible for 100k fresh funds right? Meaning seperate transfers. ( i know need to be incremental compared to earmarked 31st balance),btohqsg
What cards can be used for a beginner and earning miles without minimum spend for air tickets booking and hotel booking?,btohqsg
transactions on sunday/PH are dated next business day.If empty on 30 Dec before 10.30pm. 30 and 31 Dec will have $0 balance  can topup additional balance earlier in the month to get max interest for $100k monthly average balance,btohqsg
got it  everyday i learn something new... only sunday/PH transactions will be updated the next business day right?saturday transactions are updated immediately?,btohqsg
Hi  Was wondering if there’s any efficient ways to spend remaining  $1-200 for the min $500 spend for UOB ?,btohqsg

try get uni$ or rebate while meeting the spending?,btohqsg
So it seems that citipm is better?,btohqsg
Minimum spending for the interest 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Depends on which platform u looking at  else why not pick up the UOB Lady's card  categories changable once every quarter from what i understand,btohqsg
Okay  so UOB lady's card doesn't have minimum spend?,btohqsg
"Up to your personal valuation.. (or rather  what's your ""available cards"")",btohqsg
Currently I don't have any credit card,btohqsg
If I apply for a credit card with basic eligibility salary what will be the credit amount in the card?,btohqsg
"Are you looking at one for any use case (like makan  cinema  shopping etc.)   or one with specific use case (like ""travel"" which u mentioned)",btohqsg
How about for lounge access I can get citipm and for earning miles I can get citirmc,btohqsg
The one that covers all the category you've mentioned including travel bookings too to earn miles,btohqsg
If u mean Citi PremierMiles card  Citibank excludes travel related category,btohqsg
I suggest you go read up yourself on these cards and understand how the cards work  you will benefit from it.,btohqsg
Hi experts.May I check if anyone use UOB lady + amaze on Jeju air? Got 6 miles,btohqsg
Hi  questions have been answered. Can scroll up and find the answers.,btohqsg
Make sure you pay all balances on time and inFULL. No minimum amount  no late payment.,btohqsg
You need to put 100k on top of what you had on 30 Dec le.,btohqsg
Yagnaif you can't do it  then you're not a credit card person  and you should reduce your limits to just $500 just to clock the spending for UOB One account..,btohqsg
OK  but I can maintain that,btohqsg
Yes. Must keep it 100k above your end of day of 30 Dec  avoid withdrawals.,btohqsg
Anyway first time CC user credit limit won't be very high  especially if they see 30k annual income.. when I first started using CC  DBS approved me for 8k only  iirc.,btohqsg
Ohh  thank you so much for that information...,btohqsg
Citipm and citirmc  will do for me I guess... The citirmc points can be converted into miles right?,btohqsg
Where can I spend using both the credit card?,btohqsg
I don’t think this is right. All citibank cards should have the same transfer partners.,btohqsg
oh my apologies. you are right. let me  delete the text 😅,btohqsg
Hi sifus  I have UOB Visa Signature and Prvi Miles Mastercard. I wanted to ask buy package (more than $1000) in Klook but thinking which card should I use?- If I use Visa Signature and I change the currency to other than SGD in Klook  do i still get the points and is it worthy?,btohqsg

Hi. Anyone actively converting their UOB Priv Miles/UOB One Card Uni$ to Krisflyer miles?I just got started on this journey. Am looking out for guides tips. TIA!,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check for uob one account $500 spending  can insurance be included to get the bonus interest ?,btohqsg
Yes can clock for spending for UOB One account. No cannot clock as eligible spending for any UOB CC.,btohqsg
ok. so technically if i use uob ladies card together with my uob account  i can charge insurance onto that card and still get the bonus interest?Just that i wont get any miles right?,btohqsg
So I’ve been charging all my bills  spend on the UOB PRVI miles card. I want to accumulate miles to redeem flight tix (now only at a miniscule 4k UNI$).Only recently I downloaded the Kris+ app. Basically it’s a booster for your miles if you pay thru Kris+ app.was wondering if you:(1) diligently convert the Uni$ into Krisflyer miles?(2) don’t convert until it hits 10 000 blocks to make it worthwhile.I note that Krisflyer miles has like a 6 months validity from date of conversion.,btohqsg
2. Always wait till you actually need to spend the miles  or the miles are going to expire  before converting. UNI$ have 2 years validity within UOB  and then once you transfer to Krisflyer another 3 years validity. So plenty of time to accumulate for one big flight redemption and reduce the transfer fees paid,btohqsg
I convert a huge chunk (by end of 2 years) at one go to make the conversion fee worth it.KF miles have 3 years validity  not 6 months.add on: PRVI miles card is not the best card to earn miles  it’s too slow. you should look into other UOB cards to speed up the earning. I suggest Preferred platinum visa  visa signature and uob lady’s card.,btohqsg
note that if u redeem kf miles via kris+ there is 15% haircut in the miles received,btohqsg
May I know ladies card under fashion category   purchase samsung TV from shopee consider eligible purchase?,btohqsg

If you're referring to when the cashback appears in your statement then you'll see it in the end of next statement month.If you're referring to current statement month then you can use excel to calculate it.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if ShopBack paylater is considered qualifying spend for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
Generally ShopBack purchases can be considered “online” payments right? I don’t think there is anything stated with regards to the paylater option since it’s not really an instalment option offered by the bank,btohqsg
I think if im not wrong it's considered as online. But I think someone said before instead of waiting it to count down and pay outManually trigger it and it's considered online,btohqsg
"So to be extra safe to be ""online"" trigger it manually",btohqsg
Any benefit for stacking amaze with uob lady for local transaction?,btohqsg
yes.. u get to see the MCC,btohqsg
get 6mpd for uob$ merchant (will relevant mcc) instead of 5.6mpd,btohqsg
I only scared if amaze gets fraudulent transactions  uob will wash their hands off,btohqsg
I usually turn off online txn for my amaze card. Just to be safe,btohqsg
In that sense  i prefer directly dealing with banks,btohqsg
Apparently there are still some transactions that may go through even if u turn it off  what i do is point it to an empty wallet instead.,btohqsg
Absolutely pointless🗑️. UOB one credit card even if you don't buy the 500/MTH gives you 5% cashback without all the hoops of shoppee coin.,btohqsg
If not in tnc under exclusion then it will be considered as online,btohqsg
"You mean 3.33% or the ""additional cashback"" that gives 5 more %?",btohqsg
Nope 5% It's 25/500 additional.Quarterly 50 = 16.66/MTH.Total 8.33%(Only for the few specific things UOB includes),btohqsg
Honestly dk why they come up with this kind of nonsensical cards,btohqsg
Anyone withdrawing Snack after 2 Jan?,btohqsg
Do u even see the investment. Or still pending.,btohqsg
buy voucher to sell or paying insurance,btohqsg
Hi sifu 😛May I check if anyone use UOB lady + amaze on Jeju air? Got 6 miles,btohqsg
Meaning like capital land voucher or ntuc vouchers ?,btohqsg
yes   but u need to read the tnc of the uob one interest thing to see what does not qualify for the spending,btohqsg
Or link to a temporary Revolut card  then delete it in Revolut,btohqsg

Hi  can get advice pls. For the x3 giro transactions to fulfill uob one criteria. Can spotify premium pay using giro. I tried to change its payment mode but seems to find only credit/debit card   PayPal  and shopee pay?,btohqsg
If spotify premium can't pay via giro   any other giro payment suggestion pls? Beside insurance premium. Also like to check if M1 subsciption to change to giro payment mode  is it that  I would require to download the form from website  fill up and post back to m1?,btohqsg
M1-Yes  mail this GIRO form back. Url:https://www.m1.com.sg/my-account/-/media/Files/Business/My%20Account/Electronic%20Payment/giro_form,btohqsg
easier to just use salary (trf from another account to urself).then dont need to bother with the GIRO,btohqsg
hi guys i have a question for the ocbc 360 account. They say they will pay 2% for the first 75k if i credit 1.8k every month into that account  does the interest only apply for the money in the 360 account or does it play into effect as well if i have money in a frank account,btohqsg
for me personally i use privi for everyday spending generally without worrying abt any limits for bonuses locally/overseas while my lady's card takes care of all my travel bookings,btohqsg
Kind of Low rewards. But I guess it’s fuss free but u will accumulate much slower compared to optimising.,btohqsg
Where u saw tis promo? Tq,btohqsg
You can try uob PPV. Most mobile contactless spend is 4mpd (with $5 rounding). No min soend  Max cap is $1110. I consider fuss free as long as you can use mobile contactless tap.The only issue is online Mcc is limited to a few for 4 mpd  so would not recommend for online unless you know the Mcc code.,btohqsg
as i travel frequently  using the Privi+Amaze pair helped me reduce FCY fees which is my main goal i guess,btohqsg
But u also earn less mpd when u link prvi to amaze.,btohqsg
as based on $5k spending:Privi would give me 7k miles whilePPV would give me 5996 miles,btohqsg
Use UOB Ladies Card Solitaire and choose category for dining to get 6mpd and go to the restaurants in Kris+ to get the additional miles by them.,btohqsg
Why would even someone use PPV for a 5k spending  at least use VS,btohqsg
Well the right way is to spread $5k spending on:Uob ladyUob vs,btohqsg
May I know where did you get this information for DBS? Can’t seem to find it on their website.,btohqsg

If you can say what you buying / Mcc code  we can help to recommend…,btohqsg
Amaze+Citi Max $1KUOB VS min $1K max $2KBoth above for 4mpdThen the rest use UOB PRVIMILES for 2.4mpdAll the above for FCY spend.,btohqsg
if there isn't any specific category then a general spending card would be betterotherwise specialised cards like UOB Lady's are good in maximising your rewards,btohqsg
If Mcc code is eligible for uob KF 3mpd  then use amaze linked to uob KF (provided you spend $800 on scoot/sia/krisshop that year)  this 3mpd is uncapped so good for one time big purchase.,btohqsg
For dining  I will still use UOB Lady Card Solitaire for 6mpd,btohqsg
Amaze + uob krisflyer if mcc Matches the white list.Else prvi is good,btohqsg
UOB Lady's Solitaire would be the best if not UOB Lady's Platinum would be fine too,btohqsg
hello! would like to ask if anyone knows when the total earmark amount will show on the UOB online banking? I signed up for the uob christmas promo previously during the december period  but the amount is still showing $0 now  not sure if there was some issue with my registration or that it'll only be earmarked at a later date,btohqsg
True but need to rem to trsf every month. Thought giro can be setup easily online or via app?,btohqsg
you can probably do a scheduled transfer if you dont want to remember,btohqsg
does this mean that the earmarking of the amount and the cash credit will happen on the same day  in this case 31st jan? I saw this but I assumed that the earmarking begins immediately after december  but the cash credit will only come on 31st jan,btohqsg
Hi  is it me or UOB TMRW app doesn’t show pending transactions for credit cards? It seems like only the posted ones appear as compared to credit cards and apps from other banks.,btohqsg
The table does say when earmark will take place by. It’s not immediate.Earmark and cash credit happens on the same day if I didn’t remember wrongly.,btohqsg
Between 11pm to 4am pending credit card transactions won’t show up. Check after 6am.,btohqsg
oh damn. Is it actually a thing? or its unintended?,btohqsg
"Yes. ""Your withdraw request is processing"". Give them abit more time. 7 working days.",btohqsg
May I ask when u invested and when u withdrew?I thought snack invest only buys every Monday?,btohqsg
CIMB is the same. Only posted transactions can be seen.,btohqsg
Not sure. I follow this. haha,btohqsg
Yeah this was I believe 30th or 31st jan which Is Tuesday Wednesday.Would snack have already used your funds to buy the fund already?I took part on 29th jan late night and my investment is still pending.,btohqsg
Huh. You never get the fund purchased and u already withdraw the cash?,btohqsg
Approx $12.70 but may have minimum interest charge amount.,btohqsg
Yes. Got chance it failed to meet the criteria. Btw any updates on the tnc? Because this tnc somehow never update. Latest is 28th and 29th promo?,btohqsg
I remember i completed everything first. before withdraw.,btohqsg
There is another promo that ran from 1st jan till 29th jan,btohqsg
Pressing the claim reward button doesn’t mean u will surely get the rewards. U need to meet the tnc which is to invest in at least $4k of the fund but your purchase never completed….,btohqsg
I remember the statu mentioned that already purchase the fund. If withdraw get back $4 000.,btohqsg
Yes. I know. I asking about the last promo [30th and 31th Dec],btohqsg
First time use the platform. If never hit the requirement then too bad.,btohqsg
There is no 30th and 31st promo from what I know.There isDecember promo (ends 1st jan) ($4k)28-29 flash promo ($10k)January promo ($4k)So if u did 28-29 u can get both. But subject to stricter tnc of 30 days holding.,btohqsg
The 28th and 29th is the $10000 one. I guess you forget.,btohqsg
I edited my posts for clarity. See if better.,btohqsg
There is 2 4k promo one is 30th and 31th. One is 1st Jan to 29th Jan,btohqsg
No I don’t think that’s right.Because on 29th I did both the $10k and $4k challenge$10k = $880 vouchers$4k = $400 vouchers,btohqsg
This is the screenshot of challenges as at 29th 11.57pm. Look at the number of days left.,btohqsg
4th dec to 1st jan challenge  28-29 December flash promo  and 1-29 January challenge tncs respectively.,btohqsg
To clear the latest challenge how do I need to put my money inside,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158457U can follow this. Just note vouchers are lesser now. N must hold till end of promo period which is 29th jan.,btohqsg
So if I put on 28th jan does it mean I only need to hold for one day?,btohqsg
This question better ask cso.Because of possibility of free look clause being triggered.,btohqsg
Hey guys! My situation for 2023 is:1. Jan 2023 - March 2023 employed in a company  with 9k salary2. April - July — retrenched and not employed3. August - Dec — Work as contractor for US company  9k per month.I've registered as a Self Employed person. In this case  how should I declare my income tax and pay for CPF?,btohqsg
But can I made the big purchase first and then subsequently made $800 spending on SIA products  probably months later ?,btohqsg
yes in the same card membership year,btohqsg
Yes you can as long as SIA spends and that spend within card anniversary year. However  the 1.2mpd will come soon. But the remaining 1.8mpd will come 2 months after your membership anniversary.Some people don’t like it cos of this split of miles  and feels locked in if kenna annual fees.Better read to know what you are getting into:https://milelion.com/2024/01/02/krisflyer-uob-credit-card-extends-uncapped-25000-miles-sign-up-offer/,btohqsg
Omg feels like will be locked in by them for 1 year + and being made to pay annual fee right 😅,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer annual fee ain’t that bad because it comes with renewal miles.,btohqsg
Yes  if annual fee not waived then locked else lose 1.8mpd.If not   as other people mentioned  for fcy use uob Privi miles or other general spend cards for fcy  2.2-2.4mpd unlimited is easier (but kenna fcy fee).Else amaze + uob Privi Mastercards for anything that does not require authorisation hold for 1.4mpd.https://milelion.com/2023/12/30/psa-the-pitfalls-of-using-amaze-for-hotels-or-rental-cars/,btohqsg
My investment on 1st Jan just got completed. Yours probably done too,btohqsg
Please don't get into credit card debt. It's a hole worst than cigarettes. Always clear as soon possible,btohqsg
It's not on their website. Based on experience and it's similar with other banks.,btohqsg
I'm sure it's not only UOB.. DBS also hides certain transactions after 11pm,btohqsg
Should be $100 if the calculated fee is below that.,btohqsg
Did anyone sign up for ProsperUs deposit promo ($10000 for $88)? Any info on when the $88 is credited to account?,btohqsg
Sorry  regarding OCBC 360 (Salary + Save).Seems like the $100 000 will earn the highest E.I.R. but given the criteria to increase avg daily bal by $500 per month  any known workarounds?E.g. does it make sense to empty the account every 12 months  with 0 balance in the account on the 13th month and start over again from the 14th month?,btohqsg
Do a reset month  if you haven't gotten a UOB One account  you can move there for 5% EIR then move back.In fact why not just keep it at UOB One account for 5% EIR since OCBC has lower interest lol.,btohqsg
Guys   the funds in snack also completed. Can withdraw already?,btohqsg
Thanks.The main reason is I am afraid of the inconsistent monthly spending in order to hit $500 required by UOB One.,btohqsg
500 if you have monthly insurance payment should be easy to hit,btohqsg
Thanks. I will look into UOB One.,btohqsg
If you don't have consistent monthly insurance payment  alternative is buy vouchers lor.. because most insurance premiums increase when changing from annual to monthly,btohqsg
Oh  Thanks! Such as the NTUC vouchers,btohqsg
Correct. I mean day to day you should have some spending.. I'm aware that some ppl can spend only 200-300 each month  so sometimes difficult to meet the 500... If really cannot meet then use it for the reset month  spend 500 including vouchers then at least following month when back in OCBC just use the vouchers to spend instead lor..,btohqsg
Hi everyone!Anyone has experience withSCB esaver savingsaccount? Seems to have a promo of3.6% PA for up to 2mildeposits. I already have 100k with UOB for 5%. Worth it to park the rest of my money with SCB?,btohqsg
This is for the previous month one or this month challenge,btohqsg
Hey there. Can I check how and what description do you put for “transferring” as salary to UOB one?,btohqsg

Or if u know anyone that has uob usd chequing acct  u can transfer them ur usd n then they issue u the usd cheque. Uob usd to uob usd transfer is free last i’ve tried but must do at branch,btohqsg
Look like got to incur the charges,btohqsg

Quick question to my fellow members here: My mortgage is under 2 years lock in period under the fixed rate of 1.15% is ending this month and the current floating / fixed rate is quite high as compared to what I have been paying. Should I be using my CPF OA to reduce the loan quantum when I go for refinancing?,btohqsg
I have tried Revolut trust and wise. Link to alipay,btohqsg
might increase your accural interest. but then again  you have been enjoying the 1.1% savings from HDB loan..,btohqsg
Current Lock in fixed rate of 1.15% is from BOC for my private property.,btohqsg
shag. i think not much choice here.,btohqsg
Nice  mine is 1.2% and revised to 3.6% back in Oct 23. I refinanced from UOB at 3% with promo 2k+ cash + Dyson air purifier (under 900k loan),btohqsg
Sounds like a good deal mate. Not sure if banks are still offering similar rate of interest. Will check this out.,btohqsg
Can tryhttps://www.redbrick.sg/. I used them for my property loan and they were able to get some good non publicly listed rates. Saves you the hassle of reaching out to each and every bank also.,btohqsg
Agree. Their response time is also very fast,btohqsg
Actually that 2k++ cash is meant to offset the legal fees   which I paid 1.8k. So I had about $500 back,btohqsg
Bigger loan amount can nego for better rates  pay down loan after u lock in ur rates. Jus make sure u r allowed to do partial prepayment without charges/penalty,btohqsg
Fixed now around 3%  so either way it's better to reduce loan amount as much as possible,btohqsg
3x your current mortgage will impact cash flow,btohqsg
Agreed. Installment doubled up due to rate hike,btohqsg
If had to 3x your mortgage would then do CPF + shorter tenure and pay off faster,btohqsg
Hi guysI hv a questionNeed yr expertiseMy SA is 81kMy MA is 44kMy OA is 800My age is 49What is my next step?,btohqsg
By age 55  you will not be able to meet FRS and your OA will be fully transferred over to RA with your SA. Do you have any ongoing mortgage? Even if fully paid  at age65  CPF board will initiate another transfer from SA/OA to RA for you to hit FRS. You can opt for BHS with property pledge to possibly get some cash  but it would means a much lower payout from age 65.,btohqsg
I bought a hdb unit fully paid all from OA,btohqsg
hi just wanna ask if i can hold 3 credit cards with secured application,btohqsg
You can manually transfer OA to SA every month to get higher interest,btohqsg
Earn as much as you can while still having some balance to enjoy life.Can consider top up 8k / yr to cpf for tax rebate and savings depending on your tax bracket. (do this at yr end)Like SP said can pledge property for FRS.Investment actual still have 10 yrs  safer options blue chip stock  govt bonds  small amounts.,btohqsg
Yup done one that alrd eversince i bought the flat,btohqsg
As long as is from same bank. Then can share the same limit.,btohqsg
So what should i do before i reach 55 yrs old? Before RA kick in?,btohqsg
Since i dont meet FRS unless i do pledge right,btohqsg
So what can MA do before i hit 55 yrs old?,btohqsg
Pledge or use cash to top up.MA can only use to pay medical bills/ medical insurance,btohqsg
Since i can pledge i don’t think topping up more cash on MA is a gd strategy. I don’t know? Is it?,btohqsg
A lot depends on how liquid you are and what your current commitments and expenses are,btohqsg
Once you have RA after 55 you can top up directly to it. Don't need to go to MA,btohqsg
No hack. Only able to be done for UOB as that is stated on their site that they allow paynow sala  others need salary category from companies,btohqsg
Investment will have to be complete before can withdrawn. Its in their tncs from what i read. Just sharing here for everyone info,btohqsg
You should consider topping-up MA if your assessable income is above 40k since anything above 40k is taxed at least 7%.. below 40k at most 3.5% which is comparable to MA's 4.08% interest. Additionally will supercharge your SA once you hit BHS and hopefully by 55 you can hit FRS.,btohqsg
oh so the guy who withdrew may still have a hope of fulfilment since the withdrawal will be delayedHowever  another valid concern would be would free look (void contract) be triggered if withdrawn within 15 days,btohqsg
Yes. This is my concern now too. If not i would’ve took out my investment as well already. But the tncs never say anything about this. So is a grey area… can potentially take out now and still get cause not stated in tncs. But its debatable ba,btohqsg
for my $4k human  since also going for the $240 vouchers.. i would topup another $4k in mid Jan..then sell all $8k only in early Feb... confirm will get the $400 + $240 vouchers in my opinion.of course market risk is higher..,btohqsg
my another human original flash sale promo $10k have to hold 30 days anyway.. so i would also add another $4k to that in mid january... for the $240 vouchersthen sell in early feb for a total of$880$400$240vouchers,btohqsg
Question. When u withdraw   what would be the amount? Will get back full amount or lesser?,btohqsg
depends on the market price of the Asian Income Fund... nobody can predictalthough some analysis has been done that the fund trades based on BID price.. although sales charge might come into play?,btohqsg
Ya I am thinking have some kind of sale charges or any fees we may not be aware of until we withdraw,btohqsg
yeah that happened when we all played the Singlife thingy last time.but the reward is enough to cover the fund loss one la..,btohqsg
Understand that bro. Tks. And what should i do with SA before everything dumo to RA once hit 55 yrs old?,btohqsg
https://www.income.com.sg/funds/asian-income-fundDetails here. Can take a look,btohqsg
