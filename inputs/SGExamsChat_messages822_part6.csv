if u take fm u will be learning like 3 topics at once,btohqsg
Damn is h2 chem really that traumatic,btohqsg
I felt like physics was worse lmao,btohqsg
I can take 3 at once.,btohqsg
in that case then yeah fm shld be fine,btohqsg
no my chem is just ass,btohqsg
I do like math more than chem for sure,btohqsg
how much do u like maths tho,btohqsg
tbh idm chem but i dont love it,btohqsg
then again the course iw in uni need chem anyways,btohqsg
Ok i dont love chem per se,btohqsg
Its just the less evil of physics and math for me,btohqsg
bio- actl a little bit interestedchem- okay okaymath- quite interestinghist- yaygp- okay okay also i like essay and aq but abhor saqpw-yuck,btohqsg
Phy - noChem - okokMath - i didnt take A math what is thisEcons - wtf is this brain rot my hands are tiredGp - why am i always getting UPw - cry,btohqsg
Because of econs i tried learning to write with my left hand to substitute my right hand when its tired,btohqsg
Phy - honestly idk what's rlly happeningmath/fmath - no commentecons - tbh surprisingly well (prob bc H1)gp - ðŸ’€pw - ðŸ’€,btohqsg
H1 econs actually didnt click until the last month before As lol,btohqsg
After that it was easy breezy,btohqsg
i like that we dont rlly have to do essays anymore,btohqsg
combined hist in sec sch was one of the experiences of all time,btohqsg
my chem was better than physics before jc,btohqsg
I mean more of like H3 math emphasizes more of mathematical proofs,btohqsg
i think for me it's just the way i learned chem didn't translate well,btohqsg
Okay o level chem is honestly,btohqsg
You don't have to understand anything,btohqsg
i didn't take o levels but probs similar enough,btohqsg
If you take an engineering degree  more often than not H2 FM gives you a lot of headstart,btohqsg
having a base level understanding of multivariable calculus and linear algebra is great,btohqsg
they removed a bunch of stuff for the new syllabus tho,btohqsg
my tutor said it's strange they removed arc length for para curves but left in arc length for polar,btohqsg
But engineering degree don't really deal with a lot of mathematical proofs (they do discuss but not as extensive as compared to a math major content)  so you are better off spending your time preparing for your essential subjects if you are not planning to be a math major,btohqsg
the changes actually include stuff that is more applicable to engineering/applied math side,btohqsg
bc i rmb they took out conics,btohqsg
"my teacher speculate the syllabus changes is bc ppl prev said the fm syllabus was ""too broad""",btohqsg
but they include basic multivariable calculus which is not too different from single variable tbh but useful nonetheless,btohqsg
Plus H3 math you will be dealing more with combinatorics  proof techniques  number theory,btohqsg
personally the conic stuff has never been used in uni  but experience may differ,btohqsg
You don't need number theory for an engineering degree,btohqsg
While FM usually has LA  calculus  DE  multivariable calculus that will be able to give you a headstart for engineering math modules,btohqsg
it's really just applying the same calculus concepts to equations with 2 variables  but the steps don't change too much,btohqsg
"they excluded all the stuff that's more ""new""",btohqsg
Say hello to transition metals and organic chem,btohqsg
idk if i rmb clearly but i rmb one of my other teachers say she's confident she can finish multivariable calc in less than 12 hrs,btohqsg
So if you have zero interest in doing math/physics/CS (to a very little extent) in the future  then don't waste your time doing H3 math. You are better off preparing your main essential subjects,btohqsg
yes. if you alr know calculus it's actually damn fast to translate,btohqsg
But then again I'm more of org chem then inorg,btohqsg
wait i replied to the wrong message,btohqsg
Transition metal - not much of content to even formulate a complaint aboutOrganic chem - i love this  i dont have to think mathematically at all,btohqsg
For me I hate periodic the most,btohqsg
but now it's gone in its entirety,btohqsg
