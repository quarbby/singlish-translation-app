So maybe need find our own transport there if we take sq,btohqsg
anw sq used to fly a340s on the longest route in the world,btohqsg
Nvm i always tell myself there is always next time when i earn $$ to take sq if i want to spend the $,btohqsg
or just earn miles and fly for free,btohqsg
Retired liao I flew in 2018 and 2019,btohqsg
Yea it's all about giving and taking,btohqsg
For me I legit dun care about that as I care more on destination,btohqsg
You don't feel like you are receiving but eventually you will,btohqsg
Coz before working cannot spend too much (im actually v thrifty)  i know some ppl like to spend $tho idk if it is their money or their parentâ€™s,btohqsg
I wna fly on an a340 before they retire,btohqsg
I unintentionally tick that off ig.,btohqsg
now the most accessible a340 is Lufthansa,btohqsg
Wanna fly on a CRJ or an EJet,btohqsg
I will only fly ANA / SQ / Qatar / Emirates,btohqsg
I think the E190 the US carriers use,btohqsg
I heard good things about starlux,btohqsg
What route they use for that?,btohqsg
Oh so super short ones only hmm,btohqsg
But i think it should be comparable to sq,btohqsg
For scoot I oni seen their dreamliners,btohqsg
scoot has a grand total of 4 types in its fleet,btohqsg
Scoot is not worth unless it is a 1-2h flight,btohqsg
U can read all the -ve reviews,btohqsg
altho I wldve preferred A330s over 787s lol,btohqsg
787 is still nb just depends on their maintenance,btohqsg
My dad was searching the plane and plane age when deciding which flight to book,btohqsg
He wanted to avoid that problematic boeing and the 20y/o plane,btohqsg
I wan the tri engine jets as well but those are literally just with cargo airlines now,btohqsg
they had their major issues early on iirc,btohqsg
How cool would it be go fly the MD-11,btohqsg
idk how much i trust it anymore,btohqsg
If I take a Boeing will I live to tell the tale,btohqsg
uhhhhhhh wah i had a few in mind a couple of months ago but i forgot,btohqsg
wait let me see if i can dig it up,btohqsg
this was one store i had in mind,btohqsg
kinda bopes ngl  the economics just not thr,btohqsg
Try to do a catch me if you can in real life,btohqsg
someone got arrested recently for trying to impersonate a sq pilot,btohqsg
Clearly he didn't forge his pass good enough freaking amateur,btohqsg
U watched the movie Parasite before rite?Cue the forgery scene.Does Oxford have a degree in Document Forgery?,btohqsg

Loh says he is injured. I think he should rest if he is injured. we have other players,btohqsg
Go to Germany early in June to watch Euro2024 then drive to France in July for Olympics,btohqsg
And then now table tennis we dun hv a new feng tian wei,btohqsg
