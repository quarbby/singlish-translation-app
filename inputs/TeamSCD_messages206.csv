https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/trending/jocelyn-chia-malaysia-mh370-jokes-reaction-360516Jocelyn Chia backlash: Malaysian comedians weigh in on her MH370 joke,btohqsg
She feel she no wrong. That's the worst,btohqsg
No one gonna book her anymore,btohqsg
Since she in USA  most probably will be tracked down by people who want revenge,btohqsg
think she wanna be like Ronny Chieng,btohqsg
i think the joke about MH370 abit tasteless but i think everyone else still ok leh,btohqsg
uncle roger make fun of china everyone supports  but this women makes fun of Malaysia everyone gets offended.,btohqsg
its they way its being delivered,btohqsg
her's dont sound like a joke,btohqsg
I think it's just banters ba,btohqsg
But yeah  the delivery abit diff,btohqsg
but the intent still same ma,btohqsg
uncle roger now oso not funny anymore,btohqsg
i think comedians are like that  after awhile you get sick of their jokes alr,btohqsg
especially if it's the kind where you're funny cos of your alternate personality,btohqsg
once you sian of the accent and the behaviour,btohqsg
it's back to how well you can sell the joke liao,btohqsg
and they just keep doing the same thing over and over again,btohqsg
I don't follow all this youtuber,btohqsg
Only follow those who creates useful and educational content,btohqsg
They make fun of SG plan crashing,btohqsg
Still prefer Russel Peter famous stand up comedy,btohqsg
What you think of Mark Lee? I feel he arrogant,btohqsg
Dk leh  i dont really follow local talents alr,btohqsg
i have a new comedian i like,btohqsg
just sad i couldn't afford to attend his show last week.,btohqsg
We must stay firm and  show support to Malaysia by pump more Ron 97 and 100,btohqsg
Just change jb rate 340 liao,btohqsg
I change in sg also 3.39 alr,btohqsg
Tot u went in with sillycar,btohqsg
Why would i not drive sia,btohqsg
But got consider we take anthony's family vezel sit 1 car go LOL,btohqsg
i no more car go alr,btohqsg
not hot meh u no ac,btohqsg
Siao put roof down in this weather,btohqsg
ok no puiyi... Mier oso can,btohqsg
3.4 RM to 1 SGD can make you stuck in jam for almost  hours,btohqsg
Either alot of ppl take leave on Friday or Chao geng and take MC,btohqsg
Every Friday jam like that. Its hard to predict which day got jam which day don't have,btohqsg
I'm not like that leh. I very guai obe,btohqsg
When 4 rm to 1SGD. I think while singapore will go there shopping and makan,btohqsg
Our orchard road will be ghost town soon,btohqsg
Monday to Thurs on no public holiday.Tues and Wed with public holiday during Friday to sun.,btohqsg
But now sch holiday the jam will increase 5x,btohqsg
Yeah. I think the teachers are among the jammer,btohqsg
I leave house at 8am LOL,btohqsg
everyone will go there retire liao,btohqsg
Depends yo. Teachers also office workers with extra duties.,btohqsg
teacher dont have sch holiday de leh,btohqsg
ya lor... den have to plan new term,btohqsg
Don't be a teacher  be a freelance lecturer,btohqsg
just tat their work hours may be shorter den normal sch days,btohqsg
Another way to escape the jam is I parked my car near Woodlands custom then take bus in and out.,btohqsg
Faster then getting stuck there for long hours while holding my pee,btohqsg
You see car jam  cfm human also jam,btohqsg
Not clever lah. The JB custom allow Sporean to use so I try scan my passport and it works,btohqsg
But not all SG passport works with MY egate. So those suay one have to join the manual counter,btohqsg
That's why I say clever  bc not alot people know can use egate,btohqsg
Need to register and apply de,btohqsg
Of course when I drive in  I will drive as far at AEON tebrau or Eco palladium,btohqsg
Idk  you tell me? Bc as far as I know sg tourist go Malacca for the chicken rice ball and the Pasar malam during the weekend,btohqsg
"The red building idk what it called. Chinese call hong wu ""red house""",btohqsg
I dk too. I only go to ipoh and penang ofte,btohqsg
If you want to explore more can go xiao hong shu(fully Chinese) to search for more. Or can Google Malacca places,btohqsg
Trying to get familiar with MY road as I still newbie so will slowly start from JB  then kota tinggi  then mal then KL then ipoh and penang,btohqsg
Err different state got different type of drivers driving style,btohqsg
I heard penang and sg can fight,btohqsg
But msia road are actually pretty similar to sg. Only thing is know which lane is going to filter out or turning lane. That's the only difference,btohqsg
Best way to avoid jam is to not go,btohqsg
Got lost becos of their confusing lane filter and merge,btohqsg
Lol. Hard not to go leh. The RM too attractive liao. But I don't complaint when I drive there. I'm prepared for all kinds of driver,btohqsg
Haha. Unless RM is 2 to 1 SGD  my leg very itchy to go there,btohqsg
Need to know your purpose to go there. If for food or small petrol top up don't bother.,btohqsg
I go there only for 3 reason.In need of cheap petrol  that said less than half tank2nd my mother hometown I frequent there3rd is for traveling to inner state,btohqsg
i go for ramly burger 😀,btohqsg
Yeah. 1 of my reason. Lol.,btohqsg
and cheap cig  but recently just kena caught,btohqsg
Ramly burger not my priority for going to msia,btohqsg
Smoke intelligently la. Don't jsut go out take out flash the pack like no one will notice,btohqsg
Nowadays ica enforcement officer going around 3x more regular,btohqsg
Becos more catch means more revenue for the gov,btohqsg
During the 2 years covid  govt gave us how much alr.,btohqsg
but i kena ica secondary check so they more strict in checking. suey lo~,btohqsg
That's why now us their fund recovery stage,btohqsg
anyways y’all know they will mark my car a not? like next time i at custom they will check me extra hard?😂,btohqsg
i think no? got so many cars kena daily how they rmb 😂😅,btohqsg
No wonder. One trip one pack la. Scard no cigs to smoke meh?,btohqsg
Unlikely. unless ur car plate becomes famous in SG road vigilant,btohqsg
Ica is ica  tp lta is tp lta,btohqsg
but i not complaining ah  kena fine is 自找的,btohqsg
it is what it is~~ $200/pack btw if anyone curious about market rate 😂,btohqsg
Wonder how much cig cost in MY compare to Sg,btohqsg
Next time come in more than 2 packs  go declare better  pay the tax cheaper than fine,btohqsg
bro actually the cig i want sg don't have.,btohqsg
i hear say consider uncle cig then sales no good  so sg no one bring in sell?? idk,btohqsg
Yes bro. That is usually the case,btohqsg
eh cannot lei  the officer that day tell me  only can declare + pay tax and bring in cig if it's in the standard packaging,btohqsg
malaysia where to find that kind of box,btohqsg
so no choice  victim of circumstances,btohqsg
I realised the ICA didn't really do a thorough check of my car,btohqsg
Better to call ica. Bc different officer give different answer,btohqsg
Just visual inspection then let me off,btohqsg
hahhaha ya next time i try buy 1-2 then try declare. i want see the tax how much also.,btohqsg
tbh i don't mind paying sg price for that peter cig laaaaa i like it hahaha but cannot find in sg,btohqsg
If like that  then next time I just buy some items in bulk and put it in some carton that doesn't look suspicious to them,btohqsg
You have successfully attract the attention of the ica officer in undercover in this chat,btohqsg
this one is before check passport?,btohqsg
that one nothing one la they eye power do show only,btohqsg

Hi  just a quick surveyWhat petrol brand do you normally pump when u drive to 🇲🇾 and why? Is it due to price  performance or availability?Below are the few petrol company i knowShellCaltexPetronPetronasBHP,btohqsg
Petronas due to the accessibility the whole country and paywave uses,btohqsg
Any And pump the only top grade,btohqsg
Yeah. I don't know why there's still got cheapo kiah still pump subsidised petrol when any fuel grade is already so cheap,btohqsg
i only pump shell. only tried petronas once.no specific reason  maybe more used to the brand name ?,btohqsg
Actually the price all the same for all petrol stations,btohqsg
yah  malaysia all brand same price. every week update,btohqsg
For me  I have been a Caltex fan since I pump the first time. Although not easily avaliable in JB but not many cars go pump so fewer or no queue.,btohqsg
Msia caltex drink very fast. No point pump msia caltex,btohqsg
Accessibility yes. The fc for petronas OK.,btohqsg
I would say petron one better for fc,btohqsg
Petron ron 100 vs shell vpower racing. I prefer ron100,btohqsg
Smaller cc cars won't feel much,btohqsg
So Ron 97 should be good enough right?,btohqsg
Smoother drive lo if pump ron100,btohqsg
Just pump ron100 luh...wun cost more than sg,btohqsg
Btw Ron 100 not every petron have,btohqsg
Lol. Should experiment when I drive to JB next time. Today pumped at caltex in JB,btohqsg
Lolx...ron100 is good for small cc NA engine 😂,btohqsg
Saw why so few cars in caltex but more cars pump in SG caltex  that's why wana post this question in the group,btohqsg
Esso 95 good for me hahaha,btohqsg
Whole way back from KL TAS  empty bus!,btohqsg

Bus got 2 side. One for legs  one for body and head. Imagine you can stretch all the way flat to sleep,btohqsg
CTE towards SLE/TPE got TP station at amk Ave 3 exit.,btohqsg
Mine most probably 21 years old car alr. But surprisingly other brands the fc alot better than caltex msia.,btohqsg
Caltex sg I very OK with the fc. Only msia super different,btohqsg
From my experience  no difference in SG or MY caltex. But maybe its my first time pump so maybe try other brand to test their FC,btohqsg
i combed the forums they somehow agree honda they pump petron like lose fc,btohqsg
i ownself pump also lost 20% fc,btohqsg
I got bad fc no matter what I pump,btohqsg
I'm more towards 6.5 to 7.5,btohqsg
But it's just me  other friend's not so bad.,btohqsg
Have tried to find where my fc is going  change exhaust  sensors  many things  but never found it,btohqsg
