den the second is 2x i put,btohqsg
matrix need to times 5 or not?,btohqsg
does anyone have the qn paper,btohqsg
The first one u can just take,btohqsg
My stupid brain screwed the paper üò≠,btohqsg
Sorry not acute I meant obtuse,btohqsg
I used some rule but I screwed up,btohqsg
It‚Äôs an acute angle for ABD but for some reason I keep getting like 63+,btohqsg
wlao i minus so many marks alrd,btohqsg
I think i minus 6 mrks,btohqsg
Cuase i no faith in my last qn,btohqsg
gud job guys for finishing emath!!,btohqsg
How the maths paper 2 today?,btohqsg
So anyway what bearing did y‚Äôall manage to get,btohqsg
To me  it's tough but maybe to others  it's easy...,btohqsg
I got 5.5 i just take 11 dividr 2,btohqsg
ff i forgot to use interior angle,btohqsg
Compare to last year paper? How?,btohqsg
I thought only 11 divide by 2,btohqsg
Same lah my brain nvr changr much from last year,btohqsg
I just took the latest one cos I assumed the latest month should be closest to the exchange rate she‚Äôs going to exchange,btohqsg
is use slant height riteto find,btohqsg
Theres a downward trend wasnt there,btohqsg
This one is at the front page ah,btohqsg
Hmm I guess if we chose the wrong one perhaps at most minus 1,btohqsg
Or maybe they accept any month you choose as long as you justify the reason with a logical one,btohqsg
ay the paper ain't that bad tbh,btohqsg
the l is slant height rite,btohqsg
Bell curve probably 97 for a1 lol,btohqsg
pls gimme the ans sheet asap HAHAH i think i cn get close to full marks üôè,btohqsg
Cos the paper isn‚Äôt especially difficult,btohqsg
I think this year paper easier than 2018,btohqsg
my friend say matrix need to times 5 bc 1 week got 5 days? but my other friends say no need,btohqsg
coz its alr a week lr,btohqsg
The thing is for 5 days in a week,btohqsg
No it‚Äôs 1 afternoon session and 1 morning session,btohqsg
ya but thats the total for a week alr,btohqsg
hi how many min ah for the how long she took to jog,btohqsg
Ue but they totaled up liao,btohqsg
They said d matrix was 1 morning and 1 afternoon,btohqsg
52 secs or so i cant rmb,btohqsg
i think my girl is turtle alr i wrote super long sia,btohqsg
Idk i thought that was km WAH I KMS LAH,btohqsg
Eh it said nearest 10 secs,btohqsg
Yay at least one question correc ah,btohqsg
Plus minus 60-70 marks? Idk üòê,btohqsg
I dont remember my answer lol,btohqsg
what yall use for the exchange rate,btohqsg
anyone can rmb their bearing answer?,btohqsg
nah only rmb i got decimal üòÇ,btohqsg
fuck I NEVER ROUND OFF TO 10S,btohqsg
Last qn is the real world no,btohqsg
I got like 273.2 pretty sure it‚Äôs wrong tho lol,btohqsg
I sit there for 15 mins crying HAHAHA cause idk whether correct,btohqsg
I drew an extra triangle at the bottom,btohqsg
But I think I should be able to get 1 mark for method for bearing at least,btohqsg
how did yall do the graph qn part b,btohqsg
But the x degree questions so may steps,btohqsg
I got that in the end. 2x is the other one,btohqsg
den second one i put 2x,btohqsg
But I forgot times 5 for matrice,btohqsg
chop chop i oni need answer sheet for my last qns,btohqsg
Sure ok my friends say need,btohqsg
its alr said in 1weekif u times 5 its wrong alr,btohqsg
They alr state thats total for a week,btohqsg
Paper was quite easy I felt,btohqsg
same i minus so many marks alrd,btohqsg
Got a sneaky suspicion i messed up the cone,btohqsg
Percentage can leave in mixed number right,btohqsg
arent u supposed to times 5 to the sum,btohqsg
Good cos I put 21 with some mix number I forgot,btohqsg
Yea I got this it was 21.97 at first then I round up,btohqsg
But they tab for u no?,btohqsg
I need to go for ear cleansing,btohqsg
i didnt know u cld study for lc,btohqsg
But if I leave in exact with mix number should be no problem right,btohqsg
Go to YouTube and listen to Aussie accent,btohqsg
ngl the ascent and way of talking irritates me,btohqsg
Then u write down what they say,btohqsg
It's okay Singlish accent probably irritates them too,btohqsg
Cos mixed number makes it exact,btohqsg
So I round up to 22.0,btohqsg
I thought part 1c the denominator need expand since it said simplify,btohqsg
I think I got full marks except for 1e,btohqsg
Last one they asked in sgd though,btohqsg
Hmm my teacher said supposed to expand but wouldn‚Äôt penalise if don‚Äôt,btohqsg
omg are u having a stroke,btohqsg
ay guys anyone got soft copy,btohqsg
d last one didn‚Äôt they ask it for sgd,btohqsg
But if you actually got all correct then congrats,btohqsg
Then how y‚Äôall find d conversion rate,btohqsg
i think u'll get the marks,btohqsg
Cos how u know graph will follow d trend,btohqsg
And u need to be cautious,btohqsg
"i use the worse rate and say ""it's better to play safe cause the exchange rate is unpredictable """,btohqsg
i mean if it's logical i think u'll get the marks,btohqsg
but that part oni 2 marks so idt it matters much,btohqsg
how did u find median when thrs 2 years while u only go for 1,btohqsg
Probably need 95 to get A1,btohqsg
Nope do well in paper 1 means A1 already since everyone slips at it!,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the lowest bellcurve in O level,btohqsg
Haizz A2 B3 here i come fuck lah so many careless,btohqsg
Who say I use 1 year,btohqsg
moe alw say that they dh bell curve,btohqsg
If they don't say that means they don't have it simple?,btohqsg
they use diff terms to confuse us ig,btohqsg
There‚Äôs an urban legend that there was once a paper so hard that if above F9 is pass,btohqsg
Yall need to grind for lc rn,btohqsg
I thot u say no need times 5 lol,btohqsg
did y'all get 42% or smth,btohqsg
dont u have to find the radius first,btohqsg
Wat were yall last qns answer?,btohqsg
D range is from 30000 to 45000,btohqsg
Some use highest some use lowest,btohqsg
I looked at that graph and could not understand wtf im supposed to do with it,btohqsg
as long as ur explanation is logical i think they'll give the marks,btohqsg
Part e 11560 how many marks,btohqsg
3 i think cos it's percentage difference,btohqsg
percentage is 2 or 3 i think,btohqsg
Can stop pinging me pls lol,btohqsg
how many marks is the total qn matrix one?,btohqsg
Anyone got paper 2 maths in PDF format?,btohqsg
there is no ass in congruency & similarity,btohqsg
anyone else wanted a major circle properties qn ?,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall find a and b by equating right,btohqsg
this yr never ask us draw tangent,btohqsg
some scholar in my class for 14,btohqsg
For part 1e i never fatorise the numerator. Is it wrong?,btohqsg
u're supposed to factorise it then use the identity,btohqsg
How did u guys choose the exchange rate for last qn ah,btohqsg
Is it Choose the highest or lowest,btohqsg
Got another 69 on todays paper lol,btohqsg
What are the chances of getting A1,btohqsg
when you dont know any answer for a math paper just write 69 prob get correct,btohqsg
dw la its oni 2 marks,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt lose that many marks I think,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm not sure for real world question,btohqsg
What's the reason for the height not being proportional,btohqsg
just pray that u dun get any presentation marks deduction,btohqsg
Cause the height is not proportional to volume,btohqsg
Yea same but idk if enough,btohqsg
Wait do math have error carry onward?,btohqsg
Idk I had about 1 hour to check so üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes but depends on your marker,btohqsg
Same. I just kept redrawing the graph,btohqsg
but if u get the dickhead professor then rip,btohqsg
I did it in 1 shot üòÇ the harder once‚Äôs x^3 graph,btohqsg
i thought only sci got ecf,btohqsg
I plug in the values to make them as accurate as possible,btohqsg
If the congruency one i show asa then i put wrong reason got method marks?,btohqsg
Bruh if u use a French curve it‚Äôs exact,btohqsg
Probably but it depends on what u write,btohqsg
But there were 2 angles ?,btohqsg
You‚Äôll probably get like 1-2 m,btohqsg
think if u identify sas is 1 mark,btohqsg
Haizz Bruh i fucking blur go put retarded reason haizz,btohqsg
The number of movies students watch are more consistent rite,btohqsg
the spread is wider for adults,btohqsg
At least it's just 1 mark,btohqsg
wot how did u get aaa,btohqsg
Idk my brain go monkey mode,btohqsg
Can find it earlier in the chat,btohqsg
wait is 95+ considered not good,btohqsg
A lot of people gonna get 200%,btohqsg
I minus like about 5 marks across the 2 papers,btohqsg
For a1‚Äôs it‚Äôs gonna be like who gets more callus mistakes,btohqsg
Cos 1 mark holds different weight age across d two years,btohqsg
paper is indeed easier compared to past few years eh,btohqsg
Is 95% enough for A1 idk,btohqsg
95% almost certainly can get A1 one la,btohqsg
they can't increase it by so much,btohqsg
That‚Äôs probably where the moderation is,btohqsg
I lost about like 13 marks across both papers so I might drop to A2 hais,btohqsg
is 30+% enough for a pass idk,btohqsg
Anyone can show like how much,btohqsg
If emaths is easy  do u think a maths is gonna be difficult,btohqsg
u can‚Äôt be sarcastic through text..:,btohqsg
The paper 2 answer key has sued,btohqsg
The last question answer isn‚Äôt supposed to be in pounds,btohqsg
I lost like 15 marks across both papers though,btohqsg
Might have to settle without an A1,btohqsg
can i say tangent perpendicular to radius??,btohqsg
They did dat cos no matter what conversion rate d base amount stays relatively same,btohqsg
cause its about length not angle,btohqsg
Nvm at least you‚Äôll confirm get at least A2,btohqsg
1 is vert opp  other 2 is tangent from ext point,btohqsg
I just wrote tangents of the same circle,btohqsg
But need to say sas tho,btohqsg
Could be a B3 if my nightmares are true,btohqsg
if u identify sas u'll get a mark i think,btohqsg
if you actually lost only 15 A2 is most likely,btohqsg
btw A2 pool is very big,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think can but probably at most lose 1 for wrong reason,btohqsg
If u lose the bulk of ur marks in paper 2 I think u can get A2 or even A1,btohqsg
I probably lost most in paper 1,btohqsg
My paper 2 is contrary to most.. better than my paper 1,btohqsg
Like my prelims I barely passed my paper 1 but got A for paper 2,btohqsg
I think I got around 91% only so I really hope I won‚Äôt fall into the A2 pool,btohqsg
thanks üò≠ why this paper so hard,btohqsg
just pray dat u don't get some nasty ass old professor as ur marker,btohqsg
To be honest compared to other Tys papers from past years it isn‚Äôt hard,btohqsg
Pray that it‚Äôs come loving soul that‚Äôll feed you marks,btohqsg
U shld pray dat they are old tired but not mean,btohqsg
to me i found this one harder than previous papersüíÄ,btohqsg
Why u gotta put it like that,btohqsg
it's easier compared to the last few years,btohqsg
this paper u need to study and know the identities and stuff,btohqsg
Easier d paper harder d a1,btohqsg
People could have different definitions of hard so I need a yardstick if I say it‚Äôs easy it could offend ppl,btohqsg
i expected construction to come out sia,btohqsg
wait so was the paper easy or not??,btohqsg
If emaths is considered easy  amaths will probably be hard rite,btohqsg
cause cambridge made the alvls results vv good,btohqsg
theres only so many ways they can ask a qn,btohqsg
Yea I actually do better for amaths than emaths lol,btohqsg
plus yall dont have plane geometry,btohqsg
some markers stick to marking scheme fully,btohqsg
they will try to give method marks when possible,btohqsg
not as mean as sch teachers imo,btohqsg
Bro anyone notice how mt Teachers across sg are just fucking annoying,btohqsg
like no matter what sch u go someone has a bad experience with a Mt teacher,btohqsg
Science Teachers d chem one usually chill and physics is psycho,btohqsg
whats the next content paper for u guys ah,btohqsg
tmr el lc fri a math pp1 mon ss n a math,btohqsg
I could have taken trip sci but I suck at bio,btohqsg
This one not as good as pencil tutor,btohqsg
no cos u supposed to factorise out 4 fully before u cancel out,btohqsg
In case anyone wants to see the pencil tutor el ans,btohqsg
My p1 lost 5 marks p2 lost 4 marks,btohqsg
Well the chances are low now,btohqsg
I don't think it's that high haha,btohqsg
Probably 92 cant be that high,btohqsg
Minimumlly A1 is more than 90 and abv,btohqsg
I'm sure theres a limit to how high the bar is,btohqsg
No way d male geese is about flight,btohqsg
Honestly I think A1 can‚Äôt be 95 probably about 91-93,btohqsg
is this trustworthyyy does anyone know,btohqsg
Seems to be better answer than keynote learning,btohqsg
By God‚Äôs grace maybe I can get A2,btohqsg
I thot its about their size?,btohqsg
no matter how easy/hard is abt 91,btohqsg
ill be awaiting ur good news,btohqsg
nvm la  eae alr confimr liao,btohqsg
i tell u a true story,btohqsg
but he only took 4 subject,btohqsg
he didnt come for SS and Geog O level,btohqsg
And he purposely drop to CLB,btohqsg
so his cert only got 5 subject,btohqsg
yea  he legit just didnt come,btohqsg
lie to u for what hahaha,btohqsg
he already know he wants poly,btohqsg
and the poly doesnt need mother tongue or humans,btohqsg
so no point taking Geog and SS,btohqsg
so he didnt even come lmao,btohqsg
i have another friend that came,btohqsg
just to take the exam paper,btohqsg
and went out of the hall after 30minute,btohqsg
apparently if u fail it wont be recorded right?,btohqsg
he told me he submitted blnak page haha,btohqsg
But purpose and usefulness and reliability are all useful,btohqsg
but legit  u can actually pon the O levle if u want,btohqsg
he eneter his first choice Poly course,btohqsg
English Chem Phy A math Emath,btohqsg
A lot of pro people thr,btohqsg
but the thing is he only took 5 subject +CLB to get into biomed with perfect L1R4,btohqsg
My friend didn't get accepted into eae but l1r5 alrd got 7 points,btohqsg
but my other friend took all  L1R4 is only 8,btohqsg
altho both made it into Bio Med,btohqsg
but he didnt even study for ss and humans,btohqsg
his Geog and SS is F9,btohqsg
but his science is damn strong,btohqsg
he top physics once i think,btohqsg
yea  so if u want a nice cert  be like him haha,btohqsg
also  beacuse he didnt have to study for Goeg and SS,btohqsg
so he invest into his 5 subject he taking,btohqsg
but of course the downside is he alr paid for the SS/Geog O level fees haha,btohqsg
I can not take the exam and dump my file,btohqsg
and rn he living the best of his life,btohqsg
if u take private then damn expensive,btohqsg
if u take H3 u need pay   i think $1000+ for international student,btohqsg
Permanent resident need to pay a lot,btohqsg
singaporean got subsidy is 120 dollar,btohqsg
My brother retake Chinese for 50 dollar,btohqsg
