remind me of the time my fucking unit teammate become ckw and while on mc  proceeds to moonlight and do grabfood delivery without permission. then another guy just ord. so me  just one person  have to support all safti events that i had to ot on most days  with a few days stretching from early morning to late night,btohqsg
then someone saw him doing grabfood in woodlands while on mc  kenna caught. fella manages to ord in time without superiors doing anyth and partly cos the superiors are unwilling to bring it up to unit co as the superiors will ‚Äúlose face‚Äù,btohqsg
also  that guy alr has rso restriction. so u know what the fella do? every week go all the way to hospital just to rso,btohqsg
at least bmt u ckw u r not really affecting anyone. u go unit and ckw then other ppl have to do ur work,btohqsg
have to help this person cover duty also. last min suddenly say want to rso then i about to leave camp then suddenly have to cover this person‚Äôs duty,btohqsg
my unit also have but superiors dont really care. dont care until like 1/4 of ppl have more than 100 days of mc in a year lol,btohqsg
only in extreme cases like a person really rso until mc cover literally every day then they will restrict rso,btohqsg
then in my unit  i heard every few years they try to implement new rules on things like rso frequency and lateness  but a month later they will just forget that the rules ever existed  then cycle repeats. if intro new rules but never enforce then intro for fuck lol,btohqsg
yeah. idk how ppl find money to mc every day lol,btohqsg
oh. if ur family got cook just stay home and eat lo,btohqsg
there was one guy in my unit which rso every day and they waited 6 months bef issuing rso restriction,btohqsg
asa complied his mcs into a list as a proof for rso restriction  some of his mcs are literally gotten from online consultations at 3am,btohqsg
then every time go different clinic  probably to avoid raising suspicions with each clinic,btohqsg
bro probably knows all clinic locations in jurong by heart,btohqsg
meanwhile saf mo  covid period  sore throat but u got neg test? 2 day ld,btohqsg
do yall think ss or hist harder,btohqsg
i think both same same tbh,btohqsg
is social studies or history harder  o levels,btohqsg
In terms of skill wise   there's some overlaps so I find that that's when SS/hist students have an upper hand,btohqsg
I mean at first no shit you'll get confused if you're new to the subj combi,btohqsg
overtime when you get used to it  the differences stand out more and that's when u can use it to your advantage,btohqsg
it's not like that for SS/geog,btohqsg
i just wish my humans less of a gamble lmao,btohqsg
first is i can never expect if its an A1 or B4  and on top of that must see the other test do how then can know ur grade pein,btohqsg
real gamble is you go out during mc and your friend post a photo of you outside on his ig story,btohqsg
normally im quite thickskin but for my ss/hist cher more hesitent lol,btohqsg
Like don't send them shit at 2am then expect them reply,btohqsg

Idk wht the other one is called,btohqsg
Attendance not equal to u did well,btohqsg
what i heard is sasmo is catered to top 40% of national cohort,btohqsg
when he was taking O Level most people probably just stop studying after secondary school yet he still cannot make it and still dare to make this comment ü§Ø,btohqsg
Uk ejc doesn't change the aptitude test for fmath,btohqsg
People raging cuz they got 6 and never go ejc,btohqsg
ejc cop sci 6  art 7,btohqsg
Oh bruh then where u go,btohqsg
Even though they accepted another 100 more students compared to last yr,btohqsg
Ejc all the while cop q low,btohqsg
bruh cjc sci dropped to 12,btohqsg
Yeah but they accepting more students,btohqsg
last year is ejc is art 8  sci 6,btohqsg
my sec 2 classmate smart went combine sci to aim for ejc,btohqsg
Oooh that's gd to hear?¬ø Lmao,btohqsg
Like between my batch and the current j2 batch,btohqsg
You can't take FM here btw,btohqsg
how op get the data lol,btohqsg
Only other jcs allow for that,btohqsg
cant be the reddit comments right,btohqsg
TJC remains the sch with the best value add,btohqsg
Wait idg why is NYJC arts 6 or isit just all loopholers,btohqsg
i was the one who compile the table last year by literally calling every jc lol,btohqsg
One of the worst in SG,btohqsg
maybe i will do the same this year cos today i boliao also,btohqsg
I just hear they don't do well for a levels,btohqsg
I would like to check the O level score needed to enter NUS Computer Science.,btohqsg
Or they have high distinction rates cuz low student profile,btohqsg
that one based on a level rp la,btohqsg
altho i think if u go in by poly  o level a math got min grade iirc?,btohqsg
ok just checked  if go in by poly dip  min B3 for a math,btohqsg
I know a friend with a O level score of 20-38  but no Diploma or A level cert,btohqsg
She's currently in NUS Computer Science  with a GPA of more than 4.91,btohqsg
Ye I think NY had the highest distinction rate in sg for geog in 2022 but that's cuz they had like 20 students,btohqsg
what is 20-38? he took singapore o level?,btohqsg
As in her O-level score is 29  with a standard deviation of 9,btohqsg
what since when o-level score got std dev,btohqsg
Since never  but every time she tells us her score it changes,btohqsg
If she's in a bad mood it's 38  but 20 if she's happy,btohqsg
That‚Äôs strange  I thought JC intakes were supposed to fall after the 2018 intake when the mergers occured (which is also part of the reason why COPs rose significantly in 2018  and have fallen since 2018). I guess maybe after ejc moved into the new campus they found that they can accommodate more students.,btohqsg
But they took in more to kinda balance it out,btohqsg
The additional intake in one school is smaller than the cut in overall vacancies islandwide after the merger happened,btohqsg
Oh ok  the sch must be quite crowded after they let more of them in then,btohqsg
Smth smth we supposed to have similar capacity as RI and HCI,btohqsg
It‚Äôs probably just that ej‚Äôs case is an exception,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think any other schs would‚Äôve increased their intake since 2018,btohqsg
I think TJ‚Äôs intake might have shrunk because their holding site is smaller than their previous site. But their intake may increase again after they shift back to Bedok South,btohqsg
Oh yeah  tpjc campus should be smaller than former tjc since tpjc was originally built for just JC1 and 2s,btohqsg
If the intake decreased that‚Äôs likely why the COP fell by one for both streams,btohqsg
The concept of IP wasn‚Äôt around when both schools were built initially. Both schools were built as JC-only schools  just that the compound in Bedok South was bigger,btohqsg
cjc i was the last jc i expected to drop,btohqsg
Korkor i got my 4h2 bcmh,btohqsg
