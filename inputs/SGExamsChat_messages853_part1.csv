So my family is reading newspaper articles and we came across this article of someone who is 76 who fell prey to Internet love scam 😅😅😅,btohqsg
While being scam is a victim thing   I have no idea how will a 76 year old elderly to this type... the scammer claim he is a Ukrainian military service personnel and probably attracted her attention,btohqsg
She isn't mentally unsound at that point which makes me question her sanity,btohqsg
Wait I smell a rat here. I suspect AI deepfaking and translation AI was used so she gt convinced. In the future I think videos of unverified sources may not be used in court as evidence due to video being easy to manipulate.,btohqsg
