not everyone have money for ohlin or hks hipermax r,btohqsg
not all company make suspension for everything,btohqsg

In that case you're better off stock rofl,btohqsg
i rather run stock springs than run on shit uncomfortable springs that i had to spend money on,btohqsg
i chose my shitty stock springs over buying GAB springs/coils cos it’s not worth it,btohqsg
