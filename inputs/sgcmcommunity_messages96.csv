It is more fun to drive a slow car fast than a fast car fast,btohqsg
normal cars wont even make 2 laps😂😂 car will overheat before u even finish ur second push lap,btohqsg
If it’s fun to drive a slow car fast it would be even better to drive a fast car fast,btohqsg
Nope. Most people is unable to wrestle the power of fast car.,btohqsg
Most people cannot keep fast cars on the tracks when driving them to the limit,btohqsg
Then you’re adding another variable to the equation,btohqsg
With all things constant One would be inclined to believe that it’s more fun to drive a slow car fast as compared to a fast car slow.Yes agreed.,btohqsg
It is not about variableIt is the fun factor that you are contesting when claiming there is no logic in my statement. Lol,btohqsg
But if you can produce the same amount of control over a faster car  why would you have any less fun as compared to the slower car. If anything you’d get a heightened sense of speed and adrenaline which usually correlates with more fun,btohqsg
Trust me  when if you drive a CS3  able to floor without reservation would be a lot more fun than if you need to hesitate your throttle on faster car.,btohqsg
If that’s lost upon you then I suspect logic isn’t part of this conversation LOL,btohqsg
I am guilty of flooring my car and I did not have issues of getting speeding tickets when your car is simply too slow. 😂,btohqsg
Sir nice cars meant to drive slow so people get to admire longer,btohqsg
If the car too power but drive slow  gearbox wear,btohqsg
On conclusion  slow car better than fast car,btohqsg
"Yea my friend mocked me once when I rented this baby:""ARE YOU TRYING TO HYPERMILE A WRX"" 😂",btohqsg

That is true. Some halfway alr overheat,btohqsg

No affect ncd no pay anything,btohqsg
not referring to this. the distance too short  and clearly bmw at fault. dk how check blind spot,btohqsg
if i lke that kum lan  ok la. i admit,btohqsg
Actually i tot i wrong i say sorry also. But he said he bmw expensive. If 50:50 i nid pay alot. Plus he alrdy signalled so i shud give way,btohqsg
He got the 50;50 idea wrong alr,btohqsg
he was quite some distance away and i was confident thaT i will get out before he reach,btohqsg
you dunno meh if you see someone signal that is your cue to speed up and block him from entering your lane,btohqsg
Singapore driver very idiot. Even in Malaysia like to hog right lane.,btohqsg

It’lll be a true flex if he says he drove to Thailand to pump even cheaper RON95. Now take that y’all!!,btohqsg
isnt thai baht strong against sgd?,btohqsg
Yes but that’s not the point sir,btohqsg
Most importantly   did you submit insurance report?,btohqsg
No leh. Cos we drove off after that short chat,btohqsg
Nothing was damaged n we are fine,btohqsg
Whether or not he got insist on pte settlement  the most important thing is to file a report with your insurer  indicate that no one is injured  pte settlement or not  etc etc,btohqsg
Cos must guard against the rider backstab you,btohqsg
Go file now 🤭 then come back and continue grumbling 😂😂,btohqsg
You have dash cam footage? Submit also. And while the details are still fresh in your mind.,btohqsg
But choose not claiming insurance or something like that,btohqsg
Of cos. Thanks for the advise,btohqsg
Er…not exactly hit but more like a bump,btohqsg
cus i remember i saw a case similar  this drive kena hit by the cyclist from the side when he turning into a carpark  then cyclist say nothing wrong and they just drove off/cycle off. But the driver go make police report still  next day or few days ltr the cyclists wanna claim the driver insurance for medical bills/injuries sustained. but then TP investigated and say not driver fault. dk cyclist got kena from TP anot  iirc is have ah,btohqsg
But I think the driver's insurance sure affected?,btohqsg
U kena whack from the side ur ncd kena affected,btohqsg
😂😂😂 i will kpkp like no tmr,btohqsg
I believe its because if the accident wasn't reported  it's a breach of contract to the insurer  and will affect ncd,btohqsg
That's why in Serene's case she better submit report quickly,btohqsg
Else if kena the motorbike make police report then jialat,btohqsg
This one I not sure lah  but if he make police report  prolly will be smart enuf to tell his insurance,btohqsg
can I just ask if renew car insurance via sgcm  usually the benefits is what?,btohqsg
