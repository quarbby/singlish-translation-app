🎉Pika World Bite-Size Update – 17 June 2022🎉💣Sayonara Fed Rally  Jelly Bear is Here🧸Equity markets sold off firmly on Thursday as pessimism flooded the optimism we saw on Wednesday. It was primarily the fear of a recession. The key idea is that the Fed had to keep raising rates until it dampens economic demand to the extent that it calms inflation. The market is now reflecting that idea.As Uncle Powell stated that the Fed is data-dependent  more economic data is needed to monitor the pace of the weakening economic growth and the degree of inflation momentum to assess the magnitude of tightening of its monetary policy. It is a wrap-over wrap situation.With the Fed still behind the curve  the sell-off calls for a broader view of the general market sentiments. The tumble in stocks is also a result of a sharp rise in long-term bond yields that push down the forward P/E multiple of indices such as the S&P 500  which is now at around 15.9  much lower than the 22.0 level seen during the start of the year.Pika World continues to maintain a bearish stance until we see considerable dwindling pressure of inflation or more evidence of supply chain recovery.⚓️We are not “cruising”. It’s trouble time!🛳Thursday was a movie playback for cruise stocks. They crashed to their bottom price in 2020 as recession fear took over any signs of hope. A look at Carnival  Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise saw them collapse by more than 11%.Consistent with Pika World’s narrative  a reduction in discretionary spending reflects a more uncertain future that is likely to hit cruise holiday spending. Moreover  there is a sign of rising Covid-19 infection again that could deter some travellers from hopping on to a cruise.Likewise  cruise prices have seen a decline in prices in May and June  signalling that bookings are weakening  with some analysts seeing that as a trend that is more focused on the cruise industry than a more comprehensive leisure travel phenomenon. More challenges could be on the horizon if the economy does plunge into a mild recession.It’s never wise to go against the tide so that Pika World will be on the sideline. However  if the prices are delicious  a bite might be here for the craving.It is 17 June  Friday  at 9.10 am in Singapore and 9.10 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a monastic weekend!,btohqsg
