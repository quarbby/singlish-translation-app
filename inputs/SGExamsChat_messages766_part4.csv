I just want to fk off from the fire station the moment I ord,btohqsg
depends on what ur doing in uni  i advise you to do something related to your field of studies so if you want to take internships during your holidays  companies will see that you already have experience and are then more inclined to hire you,btohqsg

But how come your pes E9 status started only in 2017,btohqsg
issue is throughout my ns they never had a confirmed diagnosis like ok there's an issue but cannot pinpoint,btohqsg
I need go for cardiac scan tomorrow again,btohqsg
Like by then I thought BMT wouldnâ€™t have mattered,btohqsg
nowadays i don't do much that'll trigger it,btohqsg
but it messed up my insurance for like a few years lol,btohqsg
unconfirmed diagnosis so they temporarily down pes me then kept doing it every time my FFI failed,btohqsg

If itâ€™s a chronic issue nothing much can be done I think  hopefully they can just downpes you permanently,btohqsg
