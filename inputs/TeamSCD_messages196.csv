Some rich ppl play like that one,btohqsg
If rich wont open machine alr,btohqsg
Then slowly after they famous their price also rise,btohqsg
Boss by day  hotwheels by night,btohqsg
I dont sell at market rate,btohqsg
U see i sell is below or same as msrp,btohqsg
I just want everyone to enjoy the cars as us,btohqsg
Then just buy all until you get the behind one,btohqsg
Some of the ones behinds market rate is $12,btohqsg
Yet we still sell at $4,btohqsg
My partner got clawmachines at home for fun,btohqsg
No one win other then you,btohqsg
Nahhh we dw to scam ppl,btohqsg
Boring to just put money get car,btohqsg
I rather put $1 for chance to win car,btohqsg
Human like to play hard to get,btohqsg
No option for $5 and $10 notes,btohqsg
more like they skill issue HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
everyone knows what they getting into alr,btohqsg
when they put the coin in so is not rllt scamming,btohqsg
when they know its a gamble not only that if u dont put guarantee will win u kinda aint scamming,btohqsg
No wonder claw machine business do so big,btohqsg
yah mah but if u willing right,btohqsg
u can do hire someone in those popular places u like certain tries cfm can get prize,btohqsg
This one he need to open arcade,btohqsg
i think those is very lucrative cause u got a chance like get b4 the guranteed pull but even if u reach the number of pulls u cfm get,btohqsg
i saw at bugis street got,btohqsg
like 4 5 claw machine they there man it oso,btohqsg
This someone won't go sit at a shop,btohqsg
if u paying someone will do it one,btohqsg
Hire means machine must earn more first,btohqsg
or like idk program it for every how many tries the machine will cfm give u,btohqsg
that way oso no need hire someone,btohqsg
You put your coin in you could be 1st you could be 9th,btohqsg
plus if u willing u can go all the way so cfm still get one,btohqsg
This to find out if kena scammed,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA that one idk alrr if kenna scam gg,btohqsg
Asking a very noob question  do anyone of you heel toe on your car daily?,btohqsg
But mostly is just tap the pedal,btohqsg
But for me  the car will still jerk,btohqsg
As compared to down shifting with normal rev mafch,btohqsg
Or u only do heel toe at high speed?,btohqsg
Heel toe more of going to traffic light,btohqsg
But also depends what shoe I'm wearing,btohqsg
Some shoes just feels more difficult,btohqsg
This one just need some practice... But when lazy I just step clutch and brake. Then straight neutral,btohqsg
Also because I can step the brake harder compared to trying to heel toe,btohqsg
And from 6 to 3 it's easy  but 3 to 2 I find it very difficult to do fast,btohqsg
Isn't that called the money shift,btohqsg
You don't have to over rev to do that,btohqsg
That's me most of the time when I was younger.,btohqsg
When you brake your speed and rev drops. That's why you can change gears,btohqsg
This one is enter wrong gear,btohqsg
Yea that's hw I normally do. But I see lots of video emphasising on protecting the clutch,btohqsg
Just have fun... Clutch isn't that expensive unless your driving a conti,btohqsg
any hanni fanboys here wanna send me their collection,btohqsg
i alr got a few of my own,btohqsg
I also think so  I rather save fuel than heel toe. But sometimes  I just heel toe for fun,btohqsg
If not what's the point right,btohqsg
i wan try turn base  oso sooo,btohqsg
start a vending machine at hillion,btohqsg
Rev match lor. Heel toe is only when you need to brake and downshift tgt,btohqsg
Very out of the way for me,btohqsg
plus there got alot of kids playing pokemon tretta there,btohqsg
I no time to go down restock,btohqsg
But hillion actually sounds like a good idea,btohqsg
n i alw see ppl there,btohqsg
so u might wanna consider lah,btohqsg
So is other end of the world,btohqsg
can alw ask big boss restock for u HAHAH,btohqsg
That side of the world need to come to us,btohqsg
or that retarded uncle i tell u about yesteday,btohqsg
cfm will help u get a q one,btohqsg
i forgot to tell u right,btohqsg
bus got a left n right at the front door,btohqsg
everyone liek queue go the right door,btohqsg
so i go in by there when go no one?,btohqsg
@Bennchuaforgot to mention  your pedal position also affects. Last time I couldn't really do it on my kia.,btohqsg
haiz talk like wan fight me i talk back only no words to say to me,btohqsg
Just let him go lor if he wanna kp so much,btohqsg
My lancer  I think need to stretch a bit,btohqsg
ikr in the end oso never even fucking go up,btohqsg
My miat dunnid sia. Just roll only,btohqsg
On the kia it was the opposite of heel toe,btohqsg
It was more like my feet roll over the brake to tap the throttle,btohqsg
U see this guy  don't even need to stretch  can reach liao,btohqsg
Ya that's how I did on the kia,btohqsg
i been thinking yall talking about the tire toe...,btohqsg
i think i just stick to copying my notes,btohqsg
Wah those very hard to heel toe,btohqsg
But I need a wider shoe,btohqsg
I think just need to get used to it ba,btohqsg
If I use a narrower shoe  it doesn't tap the throttle,btohqsg
But nvm la  I find more fun doing double clutch,btohqsg
But my revs move too fast,btohqsg
On the kia it's slow super easy,btohqsg
I think this also quite dangerous  so close. Easily tap wrong pedal. Wanna brake  become accelerate,btohqsg
I change flywheel need rev 500rpm higher,btohqsg
I think I need more on the euro r,btohqsg
It happened in my early days,btohqsg
But got used to it nv alr,btohqsg
And i heeltoe everyday  be it boots  slippers  shoes,btohqsg
I wear boots daily for work,btohqsg
Mx5 your leg is like straight right,btohqsg
That time I sit the first gen one,btohqsg
The seat feeling like damn low,btohqsg
Wah u damn zai wear slipper can heeltoe,btohqsg
I tried before  but slipper kena stuck under the pedal,btohqsg
I cannot... Don't like the feeling,btohqsg
Just need to get used to it la,btohqsg
I play sim at home is barefoot,btohqsg
Driving barefoot q nice but mafan take off n on shoes,btohqsg
You use toes to force the sandals up,btohqsg
So they dont sag from ur foot to leave a gap for pedals,btohqsg
When I drive I lazy to left whole foot off the ground,btohqsg
My feet usually pivot from the floor,btohqsg
I wont lie  i cramped my toe a few times heel toeing,btohqsg
Ah ya but last time i did the slipper thing i grind the gear so much i scared² alr,btohqsg
Just drive alot and get used to it la,btohqsg
Then soon u wear army boots also can heel toe,btohqsg
Very rough leh! I always heel toe with my birkens,btohqsg
Then nothing can stop u alr,btohqsg
The kia I will for fun go from gear to neutral without clutch,btohqsg
Birkens sia... mine is standard flipflops havaianas,btohqsg
But I don't dare go in gear without clutch,btohqsg
Eh same sial! The grinding damn loud  I damn scared.,btohqsg
Ya i hear the crakcrakcrak then my heart jump,btohqsg
Dunnid to scared! I google before alr,btohqsg
"Cos i hear my friends ""money shift"" then something blow up",btohqsg
They say manual gears can grind for hours nonstop to start showing damage,btohqsg
They only spoil due to heat,btohqsg
That's next level! That time reservice  I drive in on inpro! Then SLE BKE jam for 1hr  I damn 痛苦,btohqsg
We grind abit wont damage anything,btohqsg
I wear boots everyday for work ma,btohqsg
Boots is SAF boots? Or Dr. Mart,btohqsg
I got one video sibei funny. My mother sitting in the car then i want to show off somemore then i shift up never clutch in properly then i shift back down oso never clutch in properly then i stall the car,btohqsg

I mean just keep it. Just like crude oil. Maybe in future the value go up can sell higher price,btohqsg
I'm so excited to share my new bumper:,btohqsg
Just to sidetrack abit  for engine oil  why 5W30 so popular in Singapore? All cars using it?,btohqsg
Its just the viscosity intended for our tropical climate. Overseas when they have winter and summer they change oils to match the temps. We only have 1 temp so we dont have to lol,btohqsg
because ppl tell me use 5w40,btohqsg
I use 0w20. I follow manual book,btohqsg
Depend on engine temps. In the end the quality and what temp it can take without degrading is more important,btohqsg
yesterday my friend showed me why we use thicker oil in our old car using the curry from the prata shop,btohqsg
its because when the oil is too thin  it creates gaps,btohqsg
then engines that rebuild before  or had bearings changed  the gaps are bigger and not as precise as a stock engine,btohqsg
so the thicker oil fills these gaps,btohqsg
or at least thats what i understood from the explanation,btohqsg
Yeah honda fit manual oso said 0W20 but I seen the price is more expensive than 5W30,btohqsg
If u need such viscosity it is wise to either change often or use a synthetic that doesnt degrade easily,btohqsg
Im guessing fit engine runs hot? 110 oil temps normal?,btohqsg
Not sure myself as I'm collecting my newly bought car tml,btohqsg
That's why wana get some idea which viscosity to use. Since the fit is more than 5 years  not sure should I use thicker oil like 5W30,btohqsg
for a moment i was thinking how come Master Leong was asking these,btohqsg
then now i realize its a different feller,btohqsg
Idk if u can understand Chinese,btohqsg
should have taken video when my friend use curry to explain lol,btohqsg
he take and spread it on the table  and we could see the oil split,btohqsg
Idk. How it work. But I just follow manual book haha,btohqsg
I suppose it could apply to u also just need to paste a miata,btohqsg
Wow  where to get it! Me want,btohqsg
If there is one with hashira or just shinobu  confirm buy,btohqsg
print sticker then stick on any bottle of oil,btohqsg
I tot is u correcting marc,btohqsg
Miata drivers are like that. They are toxic internally toward diff gen miata,btohqsg
NA: sure u can wink but slow AFNB: other than the turbo one  TRASHNC: BEST MIAT EVERND: lol no glove box please die,btohqsg
If need pick one..I pick please die😂😂😂,btohqsg
No use for a glove box 😂,btohqsg
My glove box a lot of stuff tho,btohqsg
Or maybe its the “if there is space it will be used” syndrome,btohqsg
If there is a pocket  its meant to be stuffed there,btohqsg
at one point i did think about having one,btohqsg
yes indeed..fun and nice to drive,btohqsg
Dun open the top at industrial areas ya😂😂😂,btohqsg
wont la.. also no chance liao,btohqsg
sad..maybe i sell audi buy picanto,btohqsg
Sell Audi buy Audi...got a nice S5 manual for sale in a popular plaform🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
wah... that 1 too outstanding liao Sir tiger..somemore 4.2M,btohqsg
Its such a reliable car tho,btohqsg
roadtax and insurance enough to kill me,btohqsg
Mine also reliable hehe haha hoho,btohqsg
Ur chassis shared with rx8 so i will agree,btohqsg
Ya i see u roadtrip to thailand HAHA,btohqsg
The NC Miata was developed when Ford owned Mazda; to trim costs  Ford dictated that the car share a platform with Mazda's larger RX-8. The NC was thus noticeably bulkier than any previous Miata  and it's now widely viewed as a departure from form.,btohqsg
NC is the biggest and widest cos of RX8,btohqsg
Which is why people hated it,btohqsg
Maybe they subscribe to Josephine’s “small space can be happy” theory,btohqsg
i do like the latest mx5,btohqsg
Roi will say u like dildo is it,btohqsg
(Yes thats what miata owners are like),btohqsg
better then a rx8 wanabe lol,btohqsg
This one got to blame ford,btohqsg
new jec’sphotos video drops tomorrow 😌,btohqsg
i think so  don't know the model numbers,btohqsg
U are part of that community but u dont think so,btohqsg
So clearly not the whole community,btohqsg
Im sure ND drivers don’t agree their taillight look like dildo,btohqsg
Fun fact  is ND owner tell me one,btohqsg
Look like a chevy to me,btohqsg
wait but it has popup headlights so i think issa miata,btohqsg
based on the ND miata  not NA,btohqsg
Aj how does that look like popups 🤣,btohqsg
lol i also dk just anyhow whack LOL,btohqsg
You come in here to promote other group?,btohqsg
Its 5pm somewhere in the world🤣,btohqsg
This feller has the right idea,btohqsg
Isnt this a rockstar? Dk whether yall joking anot HAHA,btohqsg
Ya bro the name of kit is rockstar,btohqsg
Oh i alws thought the mitsuoka rockstar was js a seperate thing,btohqsg
It's a kit car sold by mitsuoka,btohqsg
I see  alws thought it was BASED on the mx5 n not the actual mx5 utself,btohqsg
Actually i also not 100% sure how it happens.Do they buy MX5s and modify? Or they buy the platform from mazda and put bodykit on.,btohqsg
I alws thought the cars were fully developed by mitsuoka with a MX5 chassis but never knew it was just mx5 with a body kit on it,btohqsg
All mitsuoka cars are like that,btohqsg
when you look at them they didn't even try hard to hide,btohqsg
They put bodykit and interior reupholster,btohqsg
So essentially if you buy a mitsuoka  you really is paying an overpriced amount for what you get,btohqsg
Nice mini i type r 😂,btohqsg
Nicee is that fit or shuttle? From front see abit same same,btohqsg
Bought from one shift by carousell,btohqsg
