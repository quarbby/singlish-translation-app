Hi guys. What do we look for when buying a 2nd hand car if it’s heavily used or under used. 🙏🏻 hopeful for a lively discussion.,btohqsg
Can we use the mileage as a gauge  how many KM/year is considered normal usage?,btohqsg
non-PHV usually is about 10-13k km per year,btohqsg
I never do phv im running about 17k km +/- a year,btohqsg
Meaning this can be quite heavily used? it’s about 24km/year…,btohqsg
Check the seats  check the left door condition.. kick marks on the interior trims  door easier to open then the rest,btohqsg
Max Non PHV 20k a year,btohqsg
anything less than 10k is very low mileage,btohqsg
assuming milage is real (not tampered with)2 year old car at 48k km  still normal but abit on the high side,btohqsg
If the car shared across multiple users in the family expect it to go up to 30k annually,btohqsg
Buy car dont drive buy for what 😁,btohqsg
some ppl not like us hor  some rlly drive for work A to B B to A,btohqsg
Heavily used as long as well maintained its fine btw bro,btohqsg
i think i'm at about 13k per year...7month old car  8k km,btohqsg
This means one day u drive cross country to office n back liao leh,btohqsg
