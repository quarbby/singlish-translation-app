I think the only thing i can do now is wait for my 5K to arrive in HSBC ba. wa heart sink man  not knowing where the money is lolol,btohqsg
other members are very kind to teach u liao  but u really sldnt trade it until u r very sure u know what is going on. u could theoretically lose sh!t ton of money on ur short call if the prices does not go ur way.,btohqsg
OreoI had done calculation for you. It's unlimited potential loss if the price fly,btohqsg
Thanks very one for the help,btohqsg
What will be the calculations like. I have the 100 share at $1.77,btohqsg
(A) price on expiry <2.5  nothing happens  you hold on to your 100 shares and keep the premiums u had when you sold the option. (B) Price on expiry >2.5  you sell your 100 shares at $2.5 (even if actual price on expiry date is $100). You still profit but probably not happy that you could have sold it at $100 instead of $2.5,btohqsg
Thanks I see everything link up now. I see the full picture of call.,btohqsg
Hi all  any recommendations for ladies 1st timer applying CC. Either in cashback & discount or cashback & miles.,btohqsg
If you enjoy discount  get cashback. If you into travelling  then miles.,btohqsg
Gender and the credit card doesn't matter. It's your spending habits.,btohqsg
Frugal spending  cashback more suitable. Big spenders would go with miles  easier to clock.,btohqsg

Need some finance adviceThinking of transferring OA to SA to max FRS. Then my coming home loan will be 380k at 1712 monthly which is doable since my MA and SA are max and MA contribution will go to OA. Then my OA will be able to service the monthly installment.Is it advisable or i shouldnt transfer and let my OA wipe as much as possible so i dont need to loan so much,btohqsg
Applied on 28 Jan for HSBC Revo using Chris referral link on SingSaver promotion but  have not approved yet until passed Jan. Yesterday I chat using HSBC apps to cancel the application. But I saw HSBC query on my Credit Bureau report already. Not sure why it takes so long to approve. SC smart and CRMC approved on next day,btohqsg
I also applied on 28 Jan together with the SingSaver link and just received my CC 2 days ago. I just activated my CC ystd. Maybe give them a call?,btohqsg
Did you mean it was approved before 31 Jan then you received the card yesterday?,btohqsg
In my case it is not even approve until now so wouldn't eligible for SingSaver reward. Am I correct?,btohqsg
I received the approval email on 1 Feb  received CC  2 days ago,btohqsg
Not sure  I suggest you call HSBC hotline to check and ask them to expedite the approval,btohqsg

Ask yourself if $20k (10 months) is a good enough buffer should you lose your job.Also depends on how much job security you think you have.,btohqsg
