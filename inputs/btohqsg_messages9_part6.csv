Once in a while OK la  anyway you're slim  no issue,btohqsg
High calories with high sodium. Just like potato chips.,btohqsg
When turned into chips  cassava has an effortless crisp and flavor that doesn't require excessive amounts of oil  making it a healthier choice when looking to satisfy your craving for chips. ... Cassava is a rich source of carbohydrates  vitamin C  thiamine  riboflavin  and niacin.,btohqsg
The bottom line. Tapioca is high in carbs and calories  so it is not a traditionally healthful food. However  it can help a person meet the recommended daily allowance of several important nutrients. It can also be a tasty  nutritious food choice for people who need to gain weight.,btohqsg
