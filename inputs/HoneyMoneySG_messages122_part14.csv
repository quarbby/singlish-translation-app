Actually for retail . If you have ocbc rewards card. Will also give you 6 miles,btohqsg
Direct compete against uob ladies card,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt have the ocbc. but in this case  do i use the amaze or uob ladies card to spend$USD?,btohqsg
Amaze + UOB Lady's will reduce fx cost  you will still get 4mpd if MCC is correct.,btohqsg
then for Jul  still get effective max 6.67% for about $300 mobile contactless and $300 online regardless whether in sgd or foreign spend,btohqsg
6mpd only for Watson and 5311  not all retail spend.,btohqsg
Bro . Uniqolo and bata shop. Cannot get 6 miles ?,btohqsg
5311 is department store does uniqlo and bata look like that to u?,btohqsg
It's quite strange. Normally  I will pay my polyclinic bill in HUHS app a couple of days after visit using credit card since MCC 8099. This time  it automaticly deduct certain amount from my CPF MA just 2 days after the visit and still left a couple of dollars unpaid. Does anyone knows why this time happened like this? Is it going to be the same in the future  which I cannot pay full bill using credit card? Thanks.,btohqsg
You need to tell the counter staff don‚Äôt deduct from MA n you will pay via Apps.,btohqsg
Previously  I didn't tell the counter either and just paid the bill later. This time is different,btohqsg
