Ah my bad  i missed that out. Didnt really read OCBC 90n's TNC cause the card was quite lacklustre compared to the competition.,btohqsg
hsbc live+ covers only a few MCC,btohqsg
They're enough for my personal use case of bbts  foodcourts  bakeries  restaurants  uniqlo  decathalon  and other foodstalls ü§£Citi SMRT covers grab  shopback  shopee  groceries  and bus/mrt.,btohqsg

"Anyone familiar with structured deposits? Was being ""offered"" by the bank for a term of 1 year for 3.7%. What are the risks typically in comparsion with a traditional FD? Is the principal 100% guarantee when held to maturity for Structured Deposits?",btohqsg
So it would not work if it is transferred from an account with same name? Thanks :),btohqsg
Need to spend $1100 minimum/monthly and not include excluded items. And not part of ocbc 360 and uob1 saving,btohqsg
must always read the Term Sheet carefully,btohqsg
Hi  the for SCB BonusSaver account  does it have a minimum amount you need inside the card? Cause some cards have one if not will have charges. Fall below fee,btohqsg
min amount inside the account u mean?,btohqsg
like if I‚Äôm not wrong UOB card if you have less than $500 in the card  you‚Äôll be charged a fall below fee of $5 every month,btohqsg
Why will you have money in the card? Debit card deducts from your bank account  credit card has no balance in it,btohqsg
Hi expert   how is maybank family & friends card ? good ?,btohqsg
need min $3k in scb bonussaver account to avoid fall below fee  or keep $0 balance and there will not be any balance for fees to deduct also. No such thing as keep money on card.,btohqsg
Any UOB miles expert to advise which Lady's card is best? Solitaire or World Metal Card?,btohqsg
dun bother with the world metal card unless u have a lot of money to burn,btohqsg
And if you have a lot of money to burn  there are better cards to burn it with,btohqsg
I was trying to strategise to one bank for miles accumulation to optimise conversion fees. So I am applying uob prvi miles for cardup income tax  next is either ladies solitaire or metal card that works with Uob one account. Then maybe complete with Uob Krisflyer card for a uncap 3mpd option.,btohqsg
Get UOB lady sol. I don't think you can apply for metal version. That card is by invite only.,btohqsg
metal card is by invite only,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGQuick question regarding CardUpif I pay a merchant via CardUp using SCB smart credit cardWill I be eligible for scb rewards cash back ?,btohqsg
what the tnc of singssaver says? cardup is mcc 7399,btohqsg
At the end the bank need to confirm if mcc 7399 is eligible transactionSorry I applied smart credit card with Honey Money referral not singsaver,btohqsg
Had same decision - OCBC 360 worked out simpler for me  3.2-4% for easy salary+save.  Didn‚Äôt bother with CC spend for extra 0.6,btohqsg
what the tnc of the sign up promo say?,btohqsg
They neither mentioned in exclusion or inclusion mcc codeshttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/inccashback/,btohqsg

Hi would like to consult the community  for the Amex Local Activities 50% offer if I purchase overseas attractions on Klook (e.g. london attraction passes) would it still trigger the offer (although technically not local activities)? Prefer not to purchase gift card if possible as my attractions are just nice $60,btohqsg
I think its the same for all bkk atm.,btohqsg
Any recommendation which card for unlimited miles to get.krisflyer uob  citi premiermiles or uob privi visa miles or any others that idk about,btohqsg
Generally everything. As a backup card when my ppv gets maxed out,btohqsg
Id say you can look at uob offerings to avoid orphan miles. Citi premier miles is only good if you want lounge access.,btohqsg
I have citi rewards too thats why im stucked between premiermiles and uob.Krisflyer or privi visa which is more preferred?,btohqsg
I like uob krisflyer better as it offers better value overall (more choices for 3mpd). Prvi visa is only good if you want to use cardup. Btw  have u considered uob lady? It can help with expenses like dining/shopping so you wont hit ur ppv cap often.,btohqsg
Im using uob lady for travel hence i only have privi and krisflyer for comparison. Seems like privi has a minimum spending?,btohqsg
Hi miles experts. For UOB VS‚Ä¶ does $2000 UOB local spending via contactless payment qualify for 4MPD? Or local spend is capped at $1000 only? Thank you!,btohqsg
You have 2k for uob vs,btohqsg
points from citi rewards and premiermiles dun pool  so no point consider premiermiles to avoid orphan pointsyour citi rewards is mastercard or visa?,btohqsg
ok then you asking for backup when u used up Amaze+crmc and uob ppv? What u usually spend on?,btohqsg
Yes. Online  general spending and overseas spend (jb etc),btohqsg
get dbs wwmc for online  reserve ppv for offline  use amaze+crmc for overseas and offline  uob lady for travel,btohqsg
