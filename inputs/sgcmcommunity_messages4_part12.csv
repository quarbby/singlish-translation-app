@SGCM_Admincan SgCarMart do a special review of Singapore most reliable car?,btohqsg
Continental entry cars  cannot make it,btohqsg
Better to go for higher end Japanese cars,btohqsg
there are plenty of flashy japanese cars but people dont want to pay the premium prices,btohqsg
manual saves fuel. and this is fun car.,btohqsg
Yeah true enough. Japanese cars dun really have to be high end or sth. I would say go for Honda/Toyota Engine more reliable down the road. LOL,btohqsg
and you can refuel in jb,btohqsg
Jap and Korea’s spare part are cheaper indeed,btohqsg
Drove a mz3 earlier… for 5yrs   I din have any issue… when I traded in  it’s like new car,btohqsg
+1 sometimes their mid range also cmi,btohqsg
mazda 6 i am driving now,btohqsg
In SG if u really cash rich nowhere to spend then go ahead for flashy fancy cars lo. Or house. But really in SG where u can drive to msia lol. Get a reliable Engine LOl not V12 LOL,btohqsg
Price oso getting better .same with their sister Hyundai brand,btohqsg
Wah lau… their pricing put me off,btohqsg
I was planning to get a Sorento… but the pricing is <¥€~!.><*!#,btohqsg
Why Sorento when u can get Grandland? HAHA,btohqsg
Mazda is getting better somehow i guess,btohqsg
I find old cars are more reliable as it is lesser reliant on electronics.,btohqsg
And older cars are usually over-engineered.,btohqsg
That is why more jiak you,btohqsg
Engine push start buttonElectronic parking brake blar blar,btohqsg
Ok save Fuel eh? Which car most saving ?Leave EV out Too Overpriced,btohqsg
Last time use key and handbrake or footbrake better,btohqsg
Cannot lah… modern day  if I see a car that still use key  I won’t buy,btohqsg
Mini SUV is good Or Hatch,btohqsg
Sedan will def be more fuel efficient,btohqsg
Hybrid need take care of battery maintenance unless covered 10yrs warranty,btohqsg
Sedan and suv… both got their plus points,btohqsg
They expect u to go back for their svcing,btohqsg
Mini SUV is good enough Like Stonic,btohqsg
Depends on ur own needs and driving style,btohqsg
You owned both conti and jap/kor?,btohqsg
Yaris Cross maybe out  i test drove it  too small.Avante ok  I’m driving it  not the best but I can get 16km/L.hatch I think good ones not many  VW Golf seems ok.,btohqsg
I checked Nissan Svc package lol 3x serv around $1.2k for Note E power already,btohqsg
about 75% (Sembawang to Tuas about 4 times a week  and Tuas to Orchard about 2 times a week),btohqsg
75% able to get 16km/L seems good,btohqsg
EV is still in the hype! Government wanna push? Make sure all Civil Servants drive EV including all police and fire engines. If there’s no economic or scales  Getting EV is just a go Green statement. Malaysia infrastructure to charge EV is also not common  although some folks at this platform disagrees before. But driving all the way to KL or Penang  you will definitely requires charging along the way  right?,btohqsg
maybe also i light footed a bit.,btohqsg
I can get 15km/l on my mz3. Not sure about the new mild hybrid mz3… but it will definitely be better fc,btohqsg
Similar i also lol i on avg gets 15km/L on my GK3 Fit,btohqsg
Owned Renault  Volkswagen and Citroën before switching back to Toyota Hybrid,btohqsg
but ya other sedans I tried:Altis: Too old fashioned and expensive. Don’t buyCivic: The new one quite ok  only bad thing is halogen light and expensiveLexus IS: Very quiet  very good.Skoda Octavia: Feels like a Jetta  honestly nothing very nice about it.BMW 216 AT: Good handling for a mini MPV  but 12-13km/L  fuel guzzler.,btohqsg
ya good enough alr  dun need to vroom vroom in Singapore,btohqsg
Just look at the omv and spec u know how good is the car le,btohqsg
but for EVs so far I only tried Polestar 2. Really different experience and I’m very convinced that EV is the way to go.,btohqsg
Yeah. The A Class  1/2 series this kind all buy for badge only imo,btohqsg
Yeah lo plus i wish i can just change to anycar i want lol. Bo lui damn sian SG really Hais,btohqsg
I am so near to Polestar2 showroom but haven tried maybe later i should go LOL,btohqsg
I guess I will go for vezel or KIA compact SUV,btohqsg
Yes after u drive an ev u willl think ice car is so low and noisy and waste of petrol money,btohqsg
