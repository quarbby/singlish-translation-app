Shorting at this price is not the best type of play. If they spike then you short   maybe that is more ideal since this is bottomed counter.CEO sell also likely need some liquid funds to use for himself.From what I see is Not the type that planning to zero out .Some SGX counter ceo  the only liquid funds they really have might just be their shareholdings,btohqsg
Furthermore in Aug 24 they announced a big contract win.This is ongoing contract asset where they will progressively bill and deliver to the client side which will reflect in their upcoming P&L all the way to early 26 completion .Hence  these considered potential catalyst for price run.Ultimately  doesn’t mean CEO sell some stock means counter it’s gone is what am saying,btohqsg
IPS FY24 unaudited is a turn around.Their revenue increased 13.6 m with profits from previously losses in FY23Therefore  with this $12m contract announcement  can easily expect top line increment and hopefully profitable bottom line to go with.Therefore  counter looks and should be building its way back up from here 17/18,btohqsg
