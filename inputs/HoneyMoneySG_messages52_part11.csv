Hi  i am planning to buy the monthly concession pass for public transport. Can i ask which credit card offers rewards for it? I am not sure if dbs live fresh gives cashback for it,btohqsg
Probably none as it's under EZ-Link and all EZ-Link transactions are excluded from most if not all CCs.If you know how much you spend each month on public transport  you might be able to count if monthly concession is worth taking instead of the 10% cashback on DBS Live Fresh  8% UOB EVOL  etc.,btohqsg

How much I need to accumulate for miles in order to travel ?,btohqsg
Go look up like a return ticket on a trip you want exampleBiz return seoul sept is around 104k mile104k / 4 miles = $26000 total spendThen calculate your average motherly spend to see long you take to accumulate,btohqsg
4 mile per dollar earn rate ðŸ˜… it all depends on your spending rateIâ€™m average a $1000 per month so it around 2 year ? you can speed up with using Kris+   tax payemt via cardup or sign up bonus ~ so not exactly $26kOr unless you prefer to fly economy then it will be much lower the example is based on a return biz ticket,btohqsg
