Hi guys   If top up amaze wallet using mastercard got any fee?,btohqsg
One more question  if I am done with my Citi Prestige and do not wish to renew; what would be a good alternative premium general spending card? DBS Vantage?,btohqsg
Think every used car dealer is different. Shld be too expensive for car dealers. Fee 3%+,btohqsg
What do u look for in a 120k card?,btohqsg
ThankssinceI already have good high miles saving cards  I want a general spending card with no cap.(of course higher miles saving will be better),btohqsg
But u need to pay for the card though. Why not just UOB PRVI?Donâ€™t think vantage got special sign upBonus nowThink UOB VI hasStill I think if you want a general spend card  just get those without annual fee/easily waived type. No point paying for a premium card if you donâ€™t use the benefit,btohqsg
That's right maybe I should apply for amex card as I will already have other UOB cards,btohqsg
For a general miles card with no cap  uob privi is the highest with 1.4 mpd in $5 spending block,btohqsg
I wish there were mikes card fir CIMB,btohqsg
PRVI Is 1.4mpdSC I think only 1.2?PRVI need to spend in blocks of $5.But other details you can read yourself.,btohqsg
Occb travel 90n is 1.3 in 5 dollar block  but travel point earn does not expire and they have hotel partner too beside airline partner to redeem the point. No cap card too,btohqsg
Do I get any benefits if I declare myself as accredited investor? What are the products AI are commonly investing in now?,btohqsg
U get access to product that cant be offer to retail customer.,btohqsg
However always do your own research before handling money over to banker or financial adviser to invest in AI product. They earn commission definitely from sales but u bear the upside or downside of investment.AI product have higher minimum investment criteria as well between (100k to 250k) in one shot depending on type of product,btohqsg
The best advantage of AI customer is you have high net worth to do leverage with bank to do investment  this is great in low interest environment but now is on rising interest cycle  expensive to do leverage,btohqsg
Is shopback pay using scan qr code at merchant store considered online transaction? Will get points with citi rewards?,btohqsg

start by saving 10-20% for your monthly salary and not to spend unless needed,btohqsg

Yes. Beside saving and don't spent on wants.Start to learn skills that increase your income or learn investing. Learn valuation  how to read annual report  macro econ etc..... Alternatively if can learn how to trade short term.,btohqsg
Short term trade is deathly. Would not suggest on that,btohqsg
With such low income  should I even be thinking about investing?,btohqsg
Try to increase income first too.,btohqsg
First is no debt  save up emergency fund  after hit then allocate to monthly investment  their should be different fund basket to diversify risk,btohqsg

Sucess is being consistent in the result not fast and furious.,btohqsg
Buying macbook with uob one card  is there any cashback when buying online/at apple store?,btohqsg
No one can really help you  we can only advise.As per some people here suggestion.Step 1. Know you expenses. Record every crap that you spend on. How much money you have. You need to have eyes on your current situation before you fear the unknown/goals (bto/retirement),btohqsg
Use app or excel whatever. I personally use YNAB,btohqsg
- Have no more debt obligations- Have an emergency fund saved up- Have sufficient insurance coverageSeedly have a insurance Coverage Bingo you can refer on,btohqsg
If using uob one try apple store on shopee to get higher cashback,btohqsg
If u go apple store or online  u get max 3.33  if u go shopee apple store u get max 8.33 if u hit the quarterly criteria,btohqsg
