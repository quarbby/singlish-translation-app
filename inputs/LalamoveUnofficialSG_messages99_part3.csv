Theoritically you need to. It's like you do your own business. You need to.But if you don't do  dun be selected ones that IRAS find you. They can find out  but usually those investigating resources dun go to small fries like us lah. Unless they have nothing much to do  select the obvious ones lah. No job but got car etc..By the way  take note that if you declare after a certain amount  it's mandatory for you to contribute into your Medisave. They will inform you.,btohqsg
Once you got 2 order  they dun even allow yout onclick on the job to see the details.,btohqsg

Guys I recently got an order from AMK to Bedok  but that order was used by loanshark to collect money from the sender which is at AMK   when I reached there I didn't know that I was to go n collect $$ until that old poor lady told me that I was the third person come and asking for collection  I called the person who made that order and not available   but when I first called he nvr told me anything but to just go and collect and the sender will pass me  later he called me by other number which was not from Singapore and told me to collect cash from that lady if she refused  slap her or throw slippers and take video then he will paynow me  I immediately make a report to that help segment to complain but there was no human to chat and reply over that matter  frustrated   I went to make a police report  I was not compensate for the effort and lalamove ignored and nvr investigate  what advice would you give should such event happen again?,btohqsg
Dont take jobs that require u to collect cash and u will be safe,btohqsg
It doesn't indicate on apps and u can't cancel right away,btohqsg
Tell the customer to cancel on their side,btohqsg
Then just leave the job as it  next day contact cs to tell them about it so that they dont penalise u,btohqsg
Ya post be careful so we also can avoid . Now they come out many patterns,btohqsg
Walau. I Kenna reservist that day!!,btohqsg
Last year I did valentine day quite okay leh . Midnight also got order hahaha,btohqsg
Cash order... must call first. Not all cash orders are problematic  but all the funny business orders are cash orders. Scams  loansharks  etc.,btohqsg
If unable to call through... just be prepared that it might be a waste of time if still go ahead to pickup. Might be legit job of course.,btohqsg
No choice brother things will be better,btohqsg
Hi evening to allI would like to share my experience todayI took up this order and proceed to this location. Once reach 76 old upper thomson rd .Was stopped by Police officer and was informed that there is no one named as JasonPolice have been watching the unitSPF informed me to cancelled the order and also informed me to inform our Lalamove cs to take note in futureSPF has told me someone disturbing this unit ... Jason couldn‚Äôt pick my call... end up llm Cs cancelled the order,btohqsg
Food panda and grabfood too... cash orders alot of sabo ah long cases,btohqsg
Good leh. You can keep the items. If exp you huat lol,btohqsg
No items wor. U never see clearly. The pickup address is the address the ah long want the driver to go disturb.,btohqsg
Yes i agreed Sinopec is the best so far. If you have PDVL licence they will give u $3 additional discount for every $60 fuel. On top of the Lalamove 25% Discount. Then if you are using Cashback credit card you will get more benefit. (For me i using the Citibank Cashback card got 8% cashback for petrol),btohqsg
So by typing this automatically will report to admin...i seee,btohqsg
