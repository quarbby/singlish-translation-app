May i know Tengah garden bloom telegram,btohqsg
LolSome ppl think moderator  or admin got superpower.Being admin will pay you money meh.Bto group platform for free sharing.,btohqsg
Still one a while bto drama is fun to watch,btohqsg
YMr Housing Botonly in woodlands and marsiling chats?,btohqsg
You can only see common groups that both of you are in.,btohqsg
The new 2rm flexi wall isn‚Äôt structural (refer to the unit plan layout) so I‚Äôve hacked down mine. Makes the living and sleeping space somewhat more open  bigger as no walls separating. Pull down Murphy bed if don‚Äôt need the bed to be permanently at the space further maximize the usage of space,btohqsg
The floor for both living and bedroom is the same vinyl flooring so can ask contractor to use the extra flooring and seamlessly connect the floor area with the groove after the partition wall comes down,btohqsg
Depending on the unit  some with that beam on top is also non-structural  so can remove altogether for a ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù ceiling minus the partition beam,btohqsg
But this varies as some partition beam cannot be removed,btohqsg
Starting to see an increase in contractors and IDs who are frauds or just out to scam people. Hope this helps a bit! Happy CNY everyone ü•≥https://www.10studiosg.com/post/red-flags-unveiled-how-to-spot-warning-signs-in-interior-designers-contractors,btohqsg
Still trying to select our renovator...but the more we read on the renovation industries..the more difficult to choose üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone have experience in getting family member to attend the flat selection?High chance that we will be overseas during the appointment  I don't think we can change the appointment date  I assume we can still video call from overseas? How about all the other documents that require our signatures?,btohqsg
Only one applicant needs to be present for flat selection. HDB will provide a week or two to submit the signed docs,btohqsg
Ah I see  if that is the case we can sign the doc after the appointment?,btohqsg
Before better then at least the officer can advise you if there‚Äôs any mistakes,btohqsg
Under MGPS scheme  are we allowed to choose a unit from a different site A if the 2 or 3 room flat mix option is at another site B of the same project? E.g. Costa riviera 1 and 2. Or is it just able to select from site B where the flat mix is present,btohqsg
Both must be from the same project. If your parent applied for3 room  both you and your parent will select fromCosta Rivera I. If your parents applied for2 room  both you and your parents will select fromCosta Rivera II.,btohqsg
I see. Ok noted. Thank you!,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask are there any differences in terms of priority scheme between married couple & fianc√©/fianc√©e as first-timer? For context  I applied for HFE with my fianc√© last year and got married recently. The HFE will be expiring in Mar 25. Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
Not much difference if I rmb correctly  unless you have a kid or pregnant then will have more ballot chance :),btohqsg
Thanks so much for your reply! In this case  can we still apply for MCPS under the fianc√©/fianc√©e? Not sure how to go about applying under MCPS to get another ballot chance,btohqsg
It‚Äôs an option to tick during flat application if I‚Äôm not wrong.,btohqsg
Ah got it. Thank you! üòä,btohqsg
