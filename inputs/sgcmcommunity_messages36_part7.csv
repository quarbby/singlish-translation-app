Live landed v good meh lol,btohqsg
i am just putting ur question out,btohqsg
Wow Mr X where are you in now,btohqsg
haha this is just a pic,btohqsg
if u dont buy a car then how u get the car,btohqsg
assuming i have the money  i would choose R8 over I8,btohqsg
i am confused with ur stand here,btohqsg
siao ah is the only thing u are mentioning,btohqsg
Can u don‚Äôt ask ppl the obvious,btohqsg
so what condition u want to addüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
U think urself la. But ur poll is really silly,btohqsg
Who don Wan a more expensive car?,btohqsg
not everytime expensive means good leh,btohqsg
No need good wad. Don‚Äôt like it can sell then buy the 1 u like Ma,btohqsg
Ofc ppl choose the most exp wad since no conditions,btohqsg
aiyo ur question was this leh,btohqsg
and put it on a poll,btohqsg
and now u say ur own question lousy,btohqsg
none of the above ... too costly to drive... can only drive diesel like E220D,btohqsg
Ur poll must give them a limited amount of money,btohqsg
Ok la I ask for u,btohqsg
Since u cannot do a good job in poll,btohqsg
Mr Pete  dont try to always be different and refute people... botaiji call ppl brainless and all. Doesnt make you quirky or special  makes you seem like a immature 13yo boy trying to find a sense of identity.,btohqsg
Good leh but diesel cannot renew COE  i scared no resale,btohqsg
I use ur logic ask for u already,btohqsg
funny thing is R8 cheaper than I8  i have no idea what are you about,btohqsg
it is  u go look at the coe car on SGCM,btohqsg
Wah lao eh y suddenly u ask ppl to buy coe r8,btohqsg
U got new I8 to buy?,btohqsg
Pls la i8 got coe or not,btohqsg
u open factory buy for me now,btohqsg
U know how to compare or not,btohqsg
I give up on u already,btohqsg
Actually compare brand new price in 2020  R8 still more expensive,btohqsg
Wah lao eh. I also can buy brand new car then extend 10 year coe then I say it‚Äôs coe car?,btohqsg
I give up on u already really,btohqsg
once u renew the 10 years not coe car then what kind of car,btohqsg
I have no problem with you having opposing views. Look at me and Mr X  have opposing views and rationalise in a civilised manner. No personal attacks. I am no saint but i dont go round intentionally insulting and offending people. Grow up.,btohqsg
To be fair  JIng Xun did show it is possible for an i8 to be cheaper cause it was not specific enough to be comparing only 2020 onwards only. Challenging the question  thinking broader üëçüèª,btohqsg
Exactly  good point brought up Mr C.,btohqsg
Wad u talking abt? I8 is always cheaper than r8 wad,btohqsg
R8 can be cheaper la aiyo,btohqsg
I think ur math cmi bro,btohqsg
The way u compare it‚Äôs out of the world 1,btohqsg
There won‚Äôt be anyone choosing between either cars anyway LOL,btohqsg
admin u OT until so late ah  ur boss aware anot,btohqsg
I see the yall talk until so intensely over this  of course I will be looking at the chat hahaha,btohqsg
no worries  i got high tolerance for people with no self control  wont go round insulting people for no reasonüòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
Wah don‚Äôt come disiao me pls,btohqsg
