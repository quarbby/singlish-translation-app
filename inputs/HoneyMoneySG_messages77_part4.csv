alternative is go for scb bonusaver savings promo,btohqsg

Hi  I was watching the YouTube about the trust app for overseas ussage. How does its multi currency conversion work? I called the trust bank but the officer said they do not have such function. Did I misunderstand something?,btohqsg
works the same as any other banks' credit/debit card  just with 0% bank fee using visa currency converter,btohqsg
Hi experts  for Standard Chartered BonusSaver account  paying the bonus saver credit card 3 times with $50  is it considered 3 eligible bill payment?,btohqsg
think u meant u want to use Trust card to make payment overseas,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have the card yet. But I will be going to Malaysia soon. So I can only use the Trust app. What is visa currency converter? Is it inside the Trust app? The officer told me Trust app only use SGD for transaction.,btohqsg
I remember you were asking if Tiger has Fullerton SGD cash daily historical returns  yes I found them for all 3 Tiger Webull and Moomoo,btohqsg
need a credit/debit card to make payment. Think he meant if u using the Trust credit/debit card overseas  the foreign spending will be converted to SGD based on Visa conversion rate.,btohqsg
This should be the Tiger one  but the 4.3% annualised shown daily will not give the dollar daily return as they are just there to indicate relative performance. The 7day return for 10k column is the one that should be used to calculate the prorated return for your principal.,btohqsg
and that one from moomoo or webull?,btohqsg
Oh  so I misunderstood.  Because in the video  I thought I saw some currency conversion screen   I thought the trust has that function. Ok  thanks. Then I guess I will get the Touch and go e Wallet. Thank you.,btohqsg
Just to share actual DP in case people still think transfer to same name is not monitored / no rules.Hsbc will block your transfers even if to same name if u make too many transfers within same period of time.On 1st December 12.05am I started moving money out from hsbc Ega. My 8th transaction was blocked and resulted in anti Fraud team calling me at 4pm today.,btohqsg
HSBC wants to stop your money from leaving üòú,btohqsg
