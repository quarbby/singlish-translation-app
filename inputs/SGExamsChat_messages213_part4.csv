Purpose: Big familyMechanism to get there: Job and studies,btohqsg
You can always think next time,btohqsg
Thats flawed thinking in my opinion,btohqsg
"Are you going to slot children into your life when you feel the ""time is right""?",btohqsg
Before you even think of having kids,btohqsg
Then you will work and work and study till you die. When is it appropriate to start thinking?,btohqsg
This kind of logic extends that way,btohqsg
Ah  then i think what you mean to say is to achieve financial security first,btohqsg
So the aim is financial security,btohqsg
When i am about 20 plus years old,btohqsg
You'll figure it out as you get older,btohqsg
You need some sort of dream to motivate you,btohqsg
No matter how small or crazy,btohqsg
I alrd have a goal in life,btohqsg
Awesome! Then chase that goal with intensity,btohqsg
Also remember that timelines dont matter kekw u can fulfil your goal at 40 or 25 it really doesn't matter ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yeet okay back to geog. Spent enough time chitchatting for this break,btohqsg
Well dang congrats. Youâ€™re more mature than 90% of 16 year olds,btohqsg
Because most 16 year olds have no idea what to do with their lives,btohqsg
Knowing what you want to do and yet smoking drinking gaming fapping etc... thats very immature ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
B-but i have a goal ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
Iâ€™m 16... and Iâ€™ve been surrounded by them for years so Ye I daresay it is to a degree,btohqsg
I mean okaytechnically... goal-making and life goals are a tiny marker or maturity,btohqsg
However (pulls out geog knowledge)  to have an accurate indicator you need to make it as a composite index  in which it comprises of multiple factors and takes into account a wide range of variables,btohqsg
Anybody know whatâ€™s SMU game theory?,btohqsg
If you go to JC it is still possible to switch to therightpath,btohqsg
What if.. im interested in so many things,btohqsg
I used to be interested in like 10 fields... none linked,btohqsg
hiii. is it true that 4h2 is only for overseas scholarships?,btohqsg
why do I see h2 geog all over the chat,btohqsg
4H2 will look good to any scholarship,btohqsg
But of course rank point is always superior,btohqsg
im only looking at local uni so is 4h2 really necessary? im afraid that i might end up getting a B or even C for econs if i take it at h2 level,btohqsg
If u intend to apply scholarship at local uni  then 4H2 would be good  but not required,btohqsg
Rank point is always the no. 1 factor,btohqsg
For some faculties in NUS  90RP is a straight up merit scholarship,btohqsg
is 3.93 gpa gd enough to enter mit/harvard comp sci?,btohqsg
"sth that eld justify ""taking another asian""",btohqsg
even in telegram your shitty taste prevails,btohqsg
whats this convo abt 7 kids,btohqsg
People apply 4.0 all the time,btohqsg
Only if portfolio damn strong like intern at microsoft at 16 or shit,btohqsg
Actually I am kinda curious  can a 77 rp apply for scholarships?,btohqsg
If someone is 77rp I think they can try for bursary subject to their household financial situation,btohqsg
Because still need to look at the need based factor,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think any scholarship is grades blind,btohqsg
Although study awards arenâ€™t really scholarships,btohqsg
Depends on what u are keen in?,btohqsg
The only ones that are highly possible will prob be MOE/MOH Award and SAF award/study award,btohqsg
But high tier ones obviously donâ€™t,btohqsg
