Anyone who has retired  sold away your assets to buy annuity plan? What are the best ones in the market right now? Heard retirees entry age start from 40 years old and can buy maximum $2m per policy.I didn't see anyone talks about it in the chat history,btohqsg
Wow I can only say this is quite a dangerous thought....You definitely need all the insurance u can have  covering you  when you are old and most likely to fall ill.,btohqsg
the best annuity in Singapore  legit and for real  is CPF LIFE.,btohqsg
CPF LIFE can start at 40 years old? I thought 65.I am looking for annuity that starts at entry age 40 years old or younger so that can qualify for MM2H's retirement visa monthly income requirement of 40k ringgit,btohqsg
I haven't analysed MM2H requirements  but can investment income qualify?You can probably achieve the same/better results with a portfolio of SSBs + Tbills?$40k ringgit is about SGD13k which at conservative 3% p.a. would require a portfolio of about SGD5 million.,btohqsg
Please do calculations before you decide.Most term life until 100 is 5-6 times multiplier  which means you probably pay about $150-200k total of premiums and it pays out $1 million if you pass away before the cover ends.Insurance company won't lose money because it is time value of money.,btohqsg
Perhaps you can get a quote from your agent (i am not agent)  work out the IRR  and decide for yourself if it is worth it.(you will be pleasantly surprised),btohqsg
Do wait for Chris‚Äôs MM2H video  hopefully it will share this üëçüèª,btohqsg
Is he doing that? I thought he is going to do social visit pass runs?,btohqsg
If I didn‚Äôt understand wrongly  he will clarify how he is doing it,btohqsg
Can get 29.72 monthly without adding more funds?,btohqsg
Uob merchant? Not every phone contactless payment I am eligible for the 8%?,btohqsg
You need to to read the Evol TnC. I don‚Äôt think anybody in this group can tell you word by word  sentence by sentence in details on all credit card TnC.,btohqsg
"For me is my uob one is expiring in Oct 2023  I check with the cso if the card has been sent out on 22nd sep as I've seen the pending activation in my ibank for weeks but not receive the card. The cso told me the card will be sent out in 4 days.. but now I realised I can't make any online and offline payment using the card at all. When I checked with the cso now if I can't meet the min spending this mth due to unable to use the cc now  how will it affect my rebate and I was told ""the rebate will be affected if you did not meet the min spending"" ü•∏",btohqsg
It's strange.. coz for other banks  I'll receive the new card months before the old card expires and also before I activate the new card  I can still use my old card as long as it hasn't expired... but it doesn't seem to be the case for uob,btohqsg
except UOB One card  any other card give benefit pay utility?,btohqsg

Hi All  I came across these retirement plan recommended by CPF. Anyone bought it and anyone able to share like is it good to buy or DIY to robo or ETF?,btohqsg
the parts by CPF just before IN CONCLUSION actually sum it up best:As we‚Äôve already gathered  private annuity plans come with their fair share of bells and whistles (such as insurance protection  premium waivers and bonuses). However  when you compare them to our national annuity scheme  it falls short on multiple aspects  particularly on guaranteed returns and duration of payout.While private annuity plans promise enticing interest rates at first glance  the heart of the matter is that these rates are made up of both guaranteed and non-guaranteed components. If the non-guaranteed component does not perform well  you‚Äôll be left to rely on the guaranteed interest rate that is not as high as you might have thought (think around the 2% range).In addition  not all annuity plans promise a lifetime payout. Save for Aviva MyLifeIncome II and Manulife RetireReady Plus II  the other annuity plans offer a fixed term only ‚Äî which means there‚Äôs a chance of you outliving the monthly payouts A.K.A. the main reason why you‚Äôre even considering an annuity plan.Then there are CPF LIFE‚Äôs essentially risk-free returns. As a national scheme  it‚Äôs able to spread out risk across a bigger population. Similarly  you can enjoy monthly payouts for life ‚Äî even after the premiums are used up ‚Äî as a result of the accumulated interest.,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the explanation,btohqsg

Hi what‚Äôs the best miles card and cash back card to use to buy iPhone 15 on electronic store physically? Thanks.,btohqsg
I spoke to my consultant and he said that cashing out the full cash every year is better than accumulating since it‚Äôs giving very low interest. Might as well use the cash back and invest in something else for better returns,btohqsg
