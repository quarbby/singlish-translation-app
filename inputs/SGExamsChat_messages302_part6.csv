Yâ€™alls seriously over catastrophising an action without the full story on whatâ€™s going on,btohqsg
it's btr to be safe then to be sry,btohqsg
think abt the worst that can be happen first :x,btohqsg
The worst case scenario is likely very far from reality. We do not know the motive for leaving  there could be mismanagement in the workplace,btohqsg
I have some disagreement between my coworker,btohqsg
She want shorter hours while I want shorter days,btohqsg
then maybe the 2 of u js try and balance your workload among urselves?,btohqsg
How will they blacklist me tho,btohqsg
I want long hours and short days,btohqsg
While she want short hours long days,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I want leave without telling them,btohqsg
that's why everything gets messed up,btohqsg
and the issue just gets bigger and bigger like a snowball and no one can resolve it,btohqsg
Like work for the whole day then more rest days,btohqsg
While short hours like work everyday but short hours lor,btohqsg
@simpfor029I don't understand how no. of hours and days that you want cause you to leave without telling themAll you should do is put yourself in their shoes. Imagine that you're the supervisor. If your employee suddenly leave  definitely you'll feel super tired  frustrated and annoyed as you suddenly have to do your employee's tasks while you're actually quite busy with your own tasks alreadyCan you imagine how tiring it is? I can imagine how tiring it is as I had done OT for 9 days and what I had been doing was just only my tasks and I felt super tired already. If a person suddenly had left and my supervisor asked me to do that person's tasks  I could not have gone home for the past 9 days already,btohqsg
I mean they also trouble me abit,btohqsg
They left me alone on a Sunday morning,btohqsg
They think Iâ€™m a octopus who have 8 hands,btohqsg
ur whole day I assume its more than 7hrs?,btohqsg
u do know ur company can get fine if mom catch u working more than 7hrs,btohqsg
And I only started this job like on this Tuesday,btohqsg
What is the definition of young person's,btohqsg
u break it  u get fined,btohqsg
Can someone send the link for this page,btohqsg
Ok nvm I not affected haha,btohqsg
u break it  u get fined,btohqsg
and 1 blackmark on ur future carrer,btohqsg
If this happened only on this day  then it would be damn unfair if you just suddenly leaveLike if you suddenly leave  everybody will do extra work for many days until they manage to employ another person(1 day vs. many days  which one more tired?)However  if you're under 16 years old and you have been given to do long hours  by right you should complain to MOMI rather you complain to MOM about your supervisor than just MIAComplain to MOM  you won't get blacklistedSuddenly MIA without informing anybody  likely can get blacklisted,btohqsg
but why work part-time in the first place?,btohqsg
Correct me if any information that I mention is incorrectðŸ˜…,btohqsg
where do U wanna go? poly? jc? mi?,btohqsg
I just want to be a runway model,btohqsg
they will blacklist since they got ur details n they just leave it as a termination scar,btohqsg
u nvr tell ur mum ur real feeling ?,btohqsg
tell her what uw and not what she want,btohqsg
cuz u can't force someone to do smth,btohqsg
Like if you run away without informing them  they actually still have your details (cuz you're not running away with your details that you gave to them).If let say running away can cause many people to do extra work at very last minute  I think they will start blacklisting youHonestly  I don't know how the blacklist system work  but I think they can make use your information to do soThen  once you get blacklisted  you're in trouble. Even if you're able to apply a new job  you might not be able to get in. Why? Because your new job may have your information from your old job.They may interview and ask you if you get blacklisted or not.So  yeahBetter not to runaway. If runaway and hence get blacklisted  your whole life may be ruined,btohqsg
Is it got contract one? Or dh contract,btohqsg
once u do sth dumb  u be in trouble,btohqsg
Bro go and read ur contract,btohqsg
if u w to be one then dun scar ur work,btohqsg
If u mia they can ask u to pay them the amt of money for the days u mia,btohqsg
So ya u basically go bankrupt,btohqsg
lots of cons if u choose to runaway,btohqsg
Number 2 is that the agency blacklist u for eg recruitfirst will not allow u to take up any more part time job at their agency,btohqsg
which is NEVER a good option,btohqsg
YesJust write a resign letter or whatever that you can inform them that you want to leave,btohqsg
That I want a resignation form,btohqsg
And two weeks notice cos they want to give me shorter hours and longer days instead of longer hours and shorter daysWhen I just joined the job like on Tuesday,btohqsg
