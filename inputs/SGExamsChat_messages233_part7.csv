hi does anyone have 2020 H1 china studies in English A level paper because im taking A levels this year and my teacher doesnt even have the paper,btohqsg
Prior approval from John  just wanted to share about this Organisation that is looking for volunteer tutors...,btohqsg
can someone advise me on the difference between pure and combined subjects for O levels  assuming there's no restriction in taking any subject (cos private candidate).in terms of difficulty and also applying to poly (jc not a concern),btohqsg
Combined science is about 70% of pure science,btohqsg
But that’s really a small thing,btohqsg
The main thing is that combined science exams are much much easier than pure science exams,btohqsg
Eg combined Chem is 70% of pure Chem,btohqsg
Combined humans (the non SS part) is half of its pure counterpart,btohqsg
Eg combined lit would have 1 lit paper,btohqsg
I don’t know if either is generally harder though,btohqsg
i took core history back in 2015.,btohqsg
2 papers for Pure  1 paper for combined,btohqsg
if combined 2 textbooks  pure would be 4,btohqsg
but do keep in mind that this happened 6 yrs ago so it may be outdated,btohqsg
Well for sci  pure sci u learnt abit more than comb sci but I think one difference that can be seen is in the practicals as for the practicals for comb is abit easier ig cuz for chem u jus mix  heat and test for gases in the testtubes but for pure i think need use burette and other sci equipment ig,btohqsg
im aware this is not the right platform to send links like this,btohqsg
now that i think about it  its possible,btohqsg
yes. i have changed a lot since entering uni,btohqsg
Do u still look down upon ITE and poly kiddos,btohqsg
