If u think u cannot then itâ€™s hard,btohqsg
where did negative 4 come from,btohqsg
idk how to do that dude,btohqsg
so he is those type that will tell everyone he 191 one la,btohqsg
even he die also on the grave must put 191cm,btohqsg
u basically want to get rid of the highest power,btohqsg
my parents dont hv money they spend a lot on imh and braces for me already,btohqsg

idek where she get the negative 4 from,btohqsg
the negative 4 is the remainder,btohqsg
sometimes dont panic  just sit down and stare at it,btohqsg
i literallt stared at it in class for 1h,btohqsg
the -4 is cos x times -4 is -4x,btohqsg
and i couldnt understand what my friend is writing,btohqsg
you wanna get rid of the -4x,btohqsg
ik the x square + 2x one,btohqsg
but idk where she get the negative 4 from,btohqsg
its just what he wrote  he wants to get rid of the (-4x-3),btohqsg
you wanna get rid of the coefficient of the highest degree,btohqsg

get rid of the xÂ² first,btohqsg
but get rid of it already what,btohqsg
Ok forget about what ur friend put. How would u get rid of the -4x in remainder? Like what numberX(x+2) to simplify the remainder more,btohqsg
