Posted on behalf ofThePhysicsPageHi all  exam season is approaching and many of you may be struggling with subjects like physics or math. üò©Regardless of whether you are preparing for A/O/N levels  If you have homework  content  or any other questions while preparing for your exams  head over to@ThePhysicsPage_on instagram.https://www.instagram.com/thephysicspage_/The reason I created this page is to provide free help to students struggling to understand physics concepts! I also wanted to post puzzles which I found interesting so that hopefully you will start to see the fun side to physics :D Most importantly  I wanted to help students who are struggling to have someone to discuss their doubts or confusion with! (something i learnt during my time studying: no question is too dumb to be asked)Just some background: I graduated last year and took H1 GP; 4H2s (PCME); and H3 Game Theory in JC. I scored As for the subjects I took and so if you have any education related questions (e.g.  how to study for certain subjects or wanting to find out more about the subject etc.) I will really hope to be able help you out! You can drop me a DM on instagram and I will get back to you üôåüèªFor students taking H2 physics  I have a free set of summary notes which I used while in JC that I can send to you to aid your revision! Just DM me your email on instagram and I will send it to you in a pdf format. üëçüèª (those taking H1 physics are also welcomed to DM me. The only thing is that some parts of the notes may not be that relevant)Do also follow our new telegram channel to receive updates  study tips  and more!https://t.me/thephysicspage,btohqsg

Heard my tcr say many people would get Cs,btohqsg
but still good to tru to do well for prac,btohqsg

try for paper 2  will boost ur marks,btohqsg
I have students still scoring A2 despite claiming to do badly for their practicals. So it's still possible.But do bear in mind that I didn't get to see their practical answers  and bad is a relative comment.,btohqsg
ohh I see  for mine ik my graph scale is wrong because I couldn‚Äôt get the y intercept  and I also lost some marks at circuit and forgot to do the last page üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
There was also an A level chem tutor who did A level chem without practical. It was SPA as continous assessment back then  and he decided to just skip it.And he still scored As each time just to show it's possible.,btohqsg
ensure u don't make same mistake for Os,btohqsg
haha i scored A2 for Os despite doing super badly for phys prac,btohqsg
graphs always watch out for 4 points only,btohqsg
