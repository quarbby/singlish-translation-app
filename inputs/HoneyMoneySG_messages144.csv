The e-statement only give a whole summary. Just wanna know which transaction actually do give 10x and which transaction don't.,btohqsg
Not really. Have to manually keep track.,btohqsg

Yes  but the key point is which equity fund could possibly gives 91% return for 1 year period? Sounds like crypto fund rather than equity fund... Or is he referring to those leverage funds like TQQQ? That fund really 1yr return can hit 115%... But it's a gamble/speculation more than investment imo.,btohqsg
I have an NHG Bill. If I pay via HealthHub/NHG Cares app  do I clock 4mpd on DBS WWMC?,btohqsg
He means selling high volatility weekly options. But the probability of keep winning is like.......,btohqsg
yeah  that's so risky and seems too good to be true,btohqsg
I'd rather be on the safe side n err on caution,btohqsg
Thats a one way ticket to the opposite side of financial freedom lol,btohqsg
Text citi cso and they will tell you which one is not eligible,btohqsg
Hi all  newbie here asking for advice. Can i know how do i invest into S&P500? Im looking at a long term investment,btohqsg

Hi all  if I use Grab to pay dining bills  and the payment method I linked to my cc  does it consider a Grab top up or it is a eligible spending?,btohqsg
What do you mean use Grab to pay dining bills and payment method is linked to CC?,btohqsg
Pay with Grab wallet is pay with Grab wallet  pay Grab using CC is pay Grab using CC. 2 separate payment methods.,btohqsg
So Grab apps do have 20-30% discount on certain restaurants  when I click pay bill there  it would ask me to select my payment method,btohqsg
So is it as long as I don‚Äôt use my grab wallet pay then it consider directly charged to my cc  and therefore is eligible spending for the min spend?,btohqsg
Best to check with your card t&c. It's considered as Grab transaction.,btohqsg

Yes for Grab Dine Out deals  can choose credit card. If you scan Grab QR code it‚Äôs pay with wallet.,btohqsg

If discount requires Citibank or specific bank card to be used  then no.,btohqsg
If link Amaze to Mari CC  will able to get IPs?,btohqsg
Yep  thanks. I usually scan qr using grab so can only pay with wallet. If can pay using credit card  it will be something like xnap already! Something which many of us miss dearly!,btohqsg
If you have added a card already  the page should change to payment method  then you can choose something other than wallet.,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  would like to seek some advice on opening up a new savings account. I‚Äôm intending to credit my salary and place funds of $50k + getting a miles card. What would be the most ideal account to open currently? Also would it matter when I open the bank account e.g start/mid/end month to reap the benefits of the promo?,btohqsg
I'd think ocbc 360 saving acct and any miles card of your choice.,btohqsg
I tried and apparently it doesn't work for uob if payment was made for insurance via axs payment,btohqsg
Axs may be excluded all tgt,btohqsg
Hmm means I need to pay directly ?,btohqsg
Yeshttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/tnc-cts.pdf40.11 and 40.12.d for your reference,btohqsg
Yea please don't use axs if you want to qualify for any bonuses. Use your card directly to pay the insurance.,btohqsg

To enjoy the above cashback  you need to spend a minimum of S$800 based on posted transactions in a calendar month. If you spend less than S$800  a flat 0.25% cashback is awarded.,btohqsg
no 1% fee if clock below 1k in calendar month,btohqsg

yes if u have close to 600 spending on yuu merchants,btohqsg
I use dbs yuu sometime ago then cancel after one year,btohqsg
If you normally shop in yuu merchants then ok  my house area doesn't has giant  only fair price so trust card better for me,btohqsg
That sucks. Same situation was for me too and i find cs quite overpriced and giant quality isnt good enough for my groceries. Luckily my fp and gojek clock over $600 per month. Sadly it isnt over 1.2k either  so i couldnt get 2 yuu cards.,btohqsg

Group will be happy to clarify anything unclear/provide real life data points for certain use cases.,btohqsg
Some people too lazy  hard to help. Just want to be spoonfed.,btohqsg
lol  we can only at best copy what is in the TnC  the answer already so clear and specific,btohqsg
the singsaver website said 10th gen,btohqsg
"Wah really didnt expect this kind of answer üëçand its from admin.Not everyone so smart in this kind of this.Anyways everyone got different opinions.But i dont think ""kindly"" is the best to describe what has happened to me when you built the sentence like that cause you already thinking im here to be spoon fed.",btohqsg
Hi can i transfer amaze wallet $$ to bank account through Grabpay  any fees involved?,btohqsg

funny. When i clicked through till their application page  it showed 10th gen. üôÇ,btohqsg
maybe try to clarify with singsaver.@ChrisHMSGboss do you have any ideas on this?,btohqsg

Is there option to choose between this 2 option when spend in overseas?,btohqsg
"choose ""linked card"" to Amaze on instarem app",btohqsg
Thanks Trazora  any option to choose wallet?,btohqsg
Then just use alipay if u not intending to get ur wechatpay whitelisted,btohqsg
the heymax voucher is under the code 5311? btw does OCBC tell u how many points earn for that particulat transaction   and do u use the point in heymax?,btohqsg
All heymax vouchers purchase fall under MCC 5311. There's some kind of breakdown in the app under rewards  but not super clear.,btohqsg
Ya. My ocbc rewards mostly for heymax so I just agar agar. Seems no issues so far.,btohqsg
do you use the ocbc rewards for miles or cash btw? I actually stop using the card  byt i see got 9k+ OCBC$ rewards  so thinking to make it 10 000 to redeem üòÑ,btohqsg
For miles. 6mpd is 6mpd ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Time to stock up more vouchers before 6mpd ends,btohqsg
guess i will top it up  because i mainly using UOB for the pool access 1 time trf,btohqsg
You need 25k OCBC$ to transfer,btohqsg
You are missing 16k ocbc$ so about 6 400 miles. 6mpd at 1.1k cap is possible.,btohqsg
Wah means chiong $1k any good voucher to recommend lol,btohqsg
Only if u want to maximize 6mpd. If you are not canceling the card  you can slowly spend on the right category lor. Still 4mpd.,btohqsg
Hard to recommend because it depends on individual use case. If you use Amazon frequently  can buy Amazon gift cards. Foodpanda and Deliveroo gift cards are pretty useful too.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm concern about the conversion $25 right üòëüòëüòë across the various cards sigh,btohqsg
Then I'd say better spend elsewhere and let go of this card. üòÖ,btohqsg

The merchant paid was under MCC 5965 so I guess this not fall under online shopping based on TnC. So I was expecting to be within MYR spend.,btohqsg

Though for SingTel just be careful - they recently changed their payment portal on the app to AXS so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôll affect the Cashback for monthly manual payments and GIRO.,btohqsg
Actually does anyone know if SingTel GIRO payments are affected by the AXS payment portal change on the app recently hahaha,btohqsg
where to check whether singtel is under AXS?,btohqsg
Their mobile app‚Äôs payment portal is AXS - what I do is just go to their website straight to their website and pay,btohqsg
Congratulations  You have more money than you think.  Good news. üí∞üí∞üí∞.Try to check your other SRS treasure chest and see how much üí∞üí∞is inside.,btohqsg
Maybe best is not to do GIRO payments and just manually pay cause idk whether the GIRO payments are channeled to AXS‚Äôs portal tbh,btohqsg
pay from the singtel website is it?,btohqsg
Ya. If you pay through the website it won‚Äôt be an AXS payment portal,btohqsg

the website is having some error haha,btohqsg
Anyone received this? I spent but didn't get the $5. Can't find the t&c.,btohqsg
You have to read the T&Cs more carefully then... I've answered the same question recently... Its due to sequence of spendings... Foreign spending in RM as bonus categoty will only starts to clock once you hit certain criteria such as hit $800 or max out one category. Can't really rmb the exact criteria.,btohqsg
in this case this spending dun fall under any of his selected categories so if he paid in myr should fall under myr category,btohqsg
Oh ya  you are right! So after a few days or after he hits $800 spending  hopefully it will be reflected correctly?,btohqsg
If it falls under one of the cat u chosen it will go to that cat.. if its not in any cat that u pre selected   It will moved back to myr after few days from other expenses,btohqsg

Hotel mcc is a no for this combo.,btohqsg
4mpd is about6%5% so you can still get net benefits at 3.5% surcharge,btohqsg

A general feedback on dcs service. Received bill with charge for card renewal. Paid my outstanding dues and WhatsApp their number to cancel card. No response. Call their customer service. Got in third time and told them I want to cancel card. After one month  still got bill with late interest charge. So for those want to cancel dcs card  you may need to be persistent in getting them to cancel the card.,btohqsg
Persistent to cancel card... that seems so wrong.. seems they are so hard up to hang onto customers...,btohqsg

Hi everyone  am looking to get a miles card to collect some miles for my flight & hotel as I‚Äôll be travelling to a few places next year. Can anyone recommend some decent cards?I will mainly be using the card for flights/accoms/big item purchases because my daily card in sg would be UOB One. I also intend to collect some miles once I hit the $500 spending on my UOB One.Most of my spendings are from online platforms like Shopee and dining out at restaurants.Appreciate any advice please  thank you!! üôèüèº,btohqsg
Used UOB PPV and paid through Singtel website but dont have 9X bonus ü•≤,btohqsg
Is the mcc white listed for Uob ppv online payments?,btohqsg
HeyMax AI says singtel is MCC code 4814 which I can‚Äôt find any info on it under the PPV T&C  not under selected online and not under excludedAnyone managed to get 4mpd on singtel here?,btohqsg
To answer your question properly  not in white list should be your understanding. Don‚Äôt get it confused with not in exclusion.,btohqsg
Does withdrawal or TNG topup counted for the Cashback?,btohqsg
Morning all.Is my understanding rightUob ppv capped at 1.1k to get 4 miles.While the visa signature is min 1k capped at 2K?,btohqsg
hey guys  my mom is looking to buy a new fridge  $900-1200  from courts. the salesperson recommended her to sign up for DCS Courts CC to get 29.90 off (i think it's for delivery and disposal charges). she's not working so i will have to sign up for it. i checked  this card gives 2% cashback. i currently hold CRMC and UOB Lady's (undecided on cashback/miles just accumulating the points now; the not really applicable ones are OCBC Infinity  SC Smart and Trust) and card expenditure is usually < 500 a month. was thinking if this DCS card could be the best deal for this one off purchase  or there are better alternatives,btohqsg
DCS Cashback for 5% cashback with min. spend $400.,btohqsg
yeah been looking at that for awhile! i dont think DCS will have sign up promotions right? e.g.  singsaver promotions,btohqsg
what are your other cc you have? some other cc can buy courts vouchers,btohqsg
Which credit to apply now?Is the best of all,btohqsg
dont think any applies üòÇCRMC + AmazeUOB Lady's (still in quarter of Travel)Trust Cashback (still in quarter of Food)OCBC InfinitySC Smarti did some calculations i think DCS Cashback is the best and for future spendings,btohqsg
Should get a card for miles or cash back? Which is more worth it?,btohqsg
Yes. Maybe Sir Alex was invited to apply.And if it's not clear  it's a joke. It's like asking which is the best house to buy in Singapore.,btohqsg
Which one more worth depends on individual,btohqsg
Ah sorry im still recovering from last night,btohqsg
Among ur selection of cc  ya dcs could be good. However  does dcs cashback have cap?,btohqsg
So it will be capped at 1k spend.,btohqsg
issue is very few places accept diners club card,btohqsg
Bonussaver 2% only starting 1.1.2025.  what other options.  I already mad ocbc360 and uob1,btohqsg

Keep to major supermarkets  electronic stores and department stores  supermarket itself can reach $400.,btohqsg
thanks all for your replies. i think itll just be a one-off purchase as i don't really want to deal with so many cards. i see that DCS Cashback Card has no min spend too. and in the long run it's more worth compared to DCS Courts,btohqsg
is there a list for this? i remember trying to search before but forgot where it is üòÖ,btohqsg
Which is the best mile credit to take?,btohqsg
think it largely depends on your expenditure and how you'd like to break down your expenses  say if you spend more than 1k a month you could rely on a few 4 miles per $ cards. i think,btohqsg
I saw a few seem like citie miles is the best?,btohqsg
What will u recommend for someone who travels 3-4 times a year with a monthly expenses of about $700 mostly on grab  Shopee and dining?,btohqsg
Hi All  may I ask is HSBC EGA no more give 1% cashback on own HSBC credit card giro payment?,btohqsg
If mainly Grab and Shopee and you are ok with cashback  then UOB One card will the best for you.,btohqsg
Hi! Is the exchange rate decent when charging MYR to maybank fnf? Not sure if to use this or youtripThanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
standard mastercard exchange rate and 3.25% fx fees. 8% rebate definitely better than youtrip.,btohqsg
Best if you already max out local spend for selected category,btohqsg
Why not trust card? 1% cash back for existing user  1.5% for new card member ‚Ä¶ rate very similar to YouTrip,btohqsg
Because 4.75% cashback after fees is better than 1%?,btohqsg
Ok   that‚Äôs works ‚Ä¶ but usually bank exchanges rate is less ideal to start off,btohqsg
It's the same as YouTrip  add on 3.25% fee.,btohqsg
fnf using mastercard rate  trust using visa rate both quite similar,btohqsg
Ooo sorry didn‚Äôt see the FnF portion üòÖ.üôèüôè,btohqsg
I see.. thanks for the above!fnf sounds good with the 4.75% cashback in this case.But how can I get the cashback for MYR spends? If need to clockall 5categories of $312 each first?,btohqsg
Dont need but u need to clock 800 posted transaction within the month then can get 8 percent cashback for the bonus cat. Basically myr in bonus cat will go to the bonus cat first so use amaze with fnf to clock that. Clock all other myr not in bonus cat to card directly,btohqsg
Hi all  just wanted to check that for favepay. Amaze + CRMC have 4mpd?,btohqsg

Hi May I check if Scb simply cash CC pair with instarem amaze?,btohqsg

Tan tock Seng $3k bill. Which credit card got some benefit?I thought Amex cashback card can get 1.5% but heymax show nothing,btohqsg
can pair but why use scb simply cash?,btohqsg
yes can  select salary in the drop down menu of the purpose of transfer  comments to put PAYNOW SALA,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming. I need a card to pay for my 7k course fees so Scb simply cash should be able to get 1.5% off then I also need to pay hotel booking a few k. So should be able to avoid FX plus get the same 1.5% cash back.Please signup now got 380 cash I think,btohqsg
but amaze mark up 2% so u doing this at a loss,btohqsg
Really depends what you‚Äôre chasing ‚Äî miles / cashback,btohqsg
pay via health hub using cards that award for online,btohqsg
Just use TRUST cashback to pay for hotel,btohqsg
At bare minimum its still a nett gain,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing the mark up which I didn‚Äôt know,btohqsg
hi  is credit card usage limited in taipei? will be going there for a week  not sure if shld just bring youtrip and trust card or should bring cash instead,btohqsg

What choices do I have if I wanna go for the miles path?,btohqsg

hi  can ask if crmc+amaze earns 4mpd for kris+ pelago booking?read this articlehttps://milelion.com/2024/02/27/whats-the-best-card-to-use-for-kris/and it seems to say all kris+ transactions can but i thought it will follow pelago mcc which should be in crmc blacklist?,btohqsg
You have amaze so maybe test mcc when pairing w empty wallet?Pelago should be travel but not sure Kris+ change it.,btohqsg
for starters  i think you can look at the list here:https://www.singsaver.com.sg/credit-card/comparison/best-air-miles-credit-cardscan ask more questions after!CRMC + AMAZE is great for 4 miles per dollar too  as a starting. that's what i started with. it's 2.27% cashback. both miles and cashback are in terms in points,btohqsg
Based on DP  these are the 2 methods working:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/164384,btohqsg

Hi guys  need advice here. This year i get my home and wedding. So we take the opportunity to earn miles with the purchases we created on those 2 milestones. We mostly used uob.

Hi does anyone know if the Trust cashback card can be used to withdraw cash overseas from trust account? Does it count as cash advance?,btohqsg
Current dp seems ok to use trust cashback cc  choose saving account on ATM screen and it will take from trust saving acct.Not sure if this is intended thou.,btohqsg
Enrol in Frequent Flyer Conversion first  then go to Rewards+ in UOB app.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/miles.html?,btohqsg
Did they fix it already? The last time you could not pair the Trust Cashback card to the savings account so it'll be considered as cash advance. And the strategy was to use Trust Link card instead.,btohqsg
Still cannot link saving acct to trust cashback card. But I have seen a few dp from different people said they used trust Cashback to withdraw (select saving acct on ATM screen) and that took from their saving acct.Again  don't feel like it's intended behavior.,btohqsg
It's quite stupid if it's not connected also because it shows up under Trust account > cards on the app..,btohqsg
Anyone paired Maybank F&F with Instarem Amaze? Does it work to convert any transactions (that were not eligible spend on any of the categories) into online spend which now qualifies for the online spending category if I have selected it as 1 of the 5?,btohqsg
online category only for whitelisted mcc,btohqsg
Meaning to say if I swipe for example MCC 5462 on the Instarem Amaze (pairing it with F&F)  it will still count as MCC 5462?Sorry 1st time exploring into Instarem Amaze.,btohqsg
Or will it convert to online shopping MCC?,btohqsg
Intend to register for cmlink sim card. Anyone have referral?,btohqsg
Is 5462 whitelisted under Online shopping MCC?,btohqsg
Yes... Previously when it was still online fashion  I went to outlet mall and all offline purchases were clocked as online fashion after amaze.,btohqsg
Oh your outlet mall shopping is which MCC?,btohqsg
I can't rmb. Anyway it's one of the MCC under fashion store. Amaze doesn't convert mcc btw.,btohqsg
So is there a use to get Instarem Amaze and pair it with Maybank F&F?,btohqsg
Of course  it converts fcy to sgd so you don't need to kenna conversion charges.,btohqsg
Yes. If you haven't meet the local spend cap yet for the selected categories. Else MYR/IDR purchases will still go under the local spend cap.,btohqsg
Understand. It will just help on the conversion charges and the foreign transaction will still flow into the respective categories right?,btohqsg
So which means if I am charging MYR / IDR  instead of charging directly to F&F  I should charge it through Instarem Amaze pair with F&F  so that it will flow into the ‚ÄòMYR & IDR Spend‚Äô category right?,btohqsg
Yes  and the usage is to convert offline to online purchases.,btohqsg
Opposite of what I meant. You should charge directly for it to be under MYR/IDR spend  but only after you reached local spend cap.,btohqsg
Okok thanks. When it converts from offline to online  it will benefit cards like CRMC or UOB KF right?,btohqsg
I read that HeyMax miles can be converted to ALL points 1:1. 2000 ALL points are worth about ‚Ç¨40 or about $0.028 per mile.For those with Accor Plus membership  this is a huge win.,btohqsg
I recall world of hyatt pts are pretty good too,btohqsg
I got curious and just wrote to Swissotel to see if they accept ALL points for dining expenses if I don‚Äôt stay.Could be a good way to spend some HeyMax miles at a good rate to bring the family to dine,btohqsg

can I ask you how does insta points works ?,btohqsg
1. You will not hit BHS on 1 Jan because the interest will be transferred to SA/OA (depends if SA hit FRS yet). You can top up the difference (BHS 2025 minus BHS 2024).2. Monthly contribution will go to SA/OA (depends if SA hit FRS yet).,btohqsg
Should be able to get. Has the transaction posted?,btohqsg

thanks! I'll take a look at maybank :),btohqsg
Would you volunteer top up cpf or invest the money to high interest saving account ?Gonna purchase resale HDB next year 2025,btohqsg
You probably need the cash to be liquid  and you can beat 2.5% p.a. with a lot of bank accounts.,btohqsg
Just came back from my trip and saw this too in my mail box.. and then Maybank called me offering 2.88% PA.. hahhaah,btohqsg
What would be the best platform in SG to trade option ? I found Moomoo nice for intermediate/advanced Option trades but their fews are crazy high   webull on other hand   u can't trade multiple leg in option chain,btohqsg

Hi all  I am signed up Standard chartered CC on Oct 26 and I have not received the rewards $400 cash. does anyone receive the rewards? Tq,btohqsg
And will be valued 1 to 1,btohqsg
If use Amaze link to Citi rewards card will incur FX fees?,btohqsg
No FX fees but you pay a markup on the Mastercard rates  still worth it if you get 4 miles,btohqsg
I am in the same situation and have wrote to SingSaver. They are asking me to wait for 3 months. Am seeking clarification with them.,btohqsg
I got a reply. The ALL points can only be used to offset room prices and not dining in SG üòû,btohqsg
U can try writing to them,btohqsg
Hi  try to look for the samsonite luggage as a gift  which cc should I apply ?,btohqsg
Tiger 6.8% . How come never received my boosted interest on 9 Dec 2024 ??,btohqsg
If without the membership  may i know the difference?,btohqsg
Some cheaper rooms are available with membership tiers with different earn rates (bonus).It is still not a bad deal if you just sign up for ALL and convert.I got confirmation that it only works for room rates and not dining. So not so exciting now. Was thinking of the various buffets using MaxMiles at $0.028 to change for it üò£,btohqsg
You do mean the paid membership? Sorry not too familiar,btohqsg
DBS Vantage is quite a common card for CardUp and a lot of us have it and it comes with Accor Plus membership,btohqsg
Hi  I have rental payment of around 9k a month  thinking to utilise the CardUp/ipaymy/renthero  is there any card for Cashback for this amount? Or not  what is the current best miles card for now?,btohqsg
Maybe split payment? At least use maybank visa for the higher cashback? Then DBS Vantage   do the signup bonus and pay continuously. U should be able to get 2nd year free,btohqsg
1. So 2k on the Maybank visa platinum then every quarter $200 received right?2. DBS vantage as in miles? See that cashback is only 1.5%,btohqsg
Yes for both. DBS vantage for miles,btohqsg
Hi for the trust card. Which exchange rate should I be looking? The rates published on trust or visa?,btohqsg
What is the best credit card for that offers the most cash back with cardup? Looks like uob one card cash back has dropped from 5% to 3.33%,btohqsg
what do you want the CC for?,btohqsg
so you have no use for the CC?,btohqsg
Have a look at singsaver and see which banks offer luggage. On top of my head  hsbc does.,btohqsg
No specific use gg fwd after fulfilling the promo criteria,btohqsg
Is this the best travel card so far overseas?,btohqsg
ah ok  then do what Anthony is suggesting and look for any card that might not have annual fee or is known for being pretty lenient with forgiving fee,btohqsg
for convenience and some cashback (with their cashback card) with near about best exchange rates  yes. if you really care about exchange rates  you might get slightly better rates from ichange or something but not very convenient,btohqsg

Citi is annoying in this aspect. You can only choose 10 or 15 as your statement date.,btohqsg
Don't have trust. Haha. Why is trust better?,btohqsg
Not greatly impacted by MCC roulette  unlimited 1% (1.5% for new to bank until 31 Dec) cashback for all non-preferred category but eligible spends  Visa exchange rates  no FCY fees  bonus cashback rates for preferred spend with min spend.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if citi rewards cc expire and they issue a new one  do you accumulated points disappear? If not  How do I check the expiry of my points?,btohqsg

any1 got experience using the UOB Visa Signature card can recommend? thinking to get this cuz 4mpd include petrol and cap at $2k,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a good card if you can spend min 1k every statement month.,btohqsg
ok  the UNI$ will be shown like PPV?eg  if spend $10 contactless  PPV will show1) 2 UNI$2) bonus 18 UNI$or it will consolidate follow like lady card?,btohqsg
Consolidate. 1x when transaction posts  9x comes in next statement month,btohqsg
wah thanks! the downside is must minimum spend $1k  so FCY if $100 and Local $900 = not qualify! not bad just spam petrol and other stuff,btohqsg
have you tried to change and fly with the miles alreaady? is it straightforward :),btohqsg

Hi there  new here.Now to use credit card to pay insurance bills?,btohqsg
Without rewards  enroll directly with the respective company.With rewards but with fee  CardUp.,btohqsg
How does CardUp works? üòÖüòÇFee meaning?If my insurance is $5K?,btohqsg
You pay a fee to CardUp to make the payment on your behalf and earn rewards for the eligible credit card it charges to.You have only a very small selection of cards which usually gives poor rewards for insurance. CardUp bypasses that to give better rewards for a fee.,btohqsg
Thank you. Let me register and check out first. Thank you üôè,btohqsg
There's also small selection for CardUp but better than nothing ü§™,btohqsg
Mine is 28 as they cannot give last day,btohqsg
ah snap  btw  so if UOB Visa Signature is only contactless  means cannot stack with Kris+ pay ?,btohqsg
UOB VS easiest interaction to remember  is to hear beep  no beep = no contactless,btohqsg
It was some time back? I called them 5 months ago and cso said only 10th and 15th available. So mine is stuck w 5th.,btohqsg
Ya around jan 24. They also offered me 10th and 15th.I said i need adjust for payment adjustment sync with all cc. They offer closest 28th,btohqsg
Ok Â§ßÂßêÂ§ßÂì•„ÄÅ need to ask so regarding OCBC$ I check I still have 28 185 (from past accumulation)So I can get10 000 KFM for 25 000 OCBC$Seems like just need 21 815 OCBC$  to make 50 000 OCBC$ and I can max out ntuc voucher first with heymax right,btohqsg
Yes  you need to buy 1455 worth of vouchers. 6mpd ends 31 Dec.,btohqsg
can just do paywave and still get 10x points,btohqsg
Means SGD $1455  ya but limit $1000 of 6mpd then I accumulate one more month,btohqsg
Yes 1455 (only if you have both pink and blue) but OCBC rewards got cap.,btohqsg
Ocbc reward cap is 1110 spending,btohqsg
Unless the person has both pink and blue cards  don't think can hit before 31 dec. Still no rush to clock 6mpd. Worse comes to worst  it's still 4mpd. Don't have to force spend.,btohqsg
sorry ah the cap is $1000 or $1100 for the OCBC reward card..regular bonus $1110  then special bonus $1000 ya,btohqsg
Yup so need to do their own count,btohqsg
Think high chance if extend will still be for departmental store usage bah. Seem ocbc is pushing spend on reward card for those category,btohqsg
Sorry gurus  could I check if heymax state as 1.2 miles is it based on the assumption that I would not be spending 800sgd on sq flights please? I am spending on a new mobile phone with mcc 4812 based on heymax. Thank you in advance.,btohqsg

The no min comms for POEMs is only for Cash Plus accounts  no? For Cash managed accounts (which I assume srs is under)  the min fee is 25sgd or 0.28% of contract value?,btohqsg
Srs is under cash plus since it needs to be funded (with equivalent trade value in cash) before trade,btohqsg
