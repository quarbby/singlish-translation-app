Update on GKE. So Friday confirmed the bearish signal shown on Thursday. Closed down but still supported by 130 support. MACD histogram turning down. Thus 130 hard to support. In 3 days time this will face selling pressure from T+4 contra due sellers. Historical price support at 119/120. There's an uptrend trendline. So my guess is by T+4 it should hit ard 120 or uptrend trendline support which should also be around 120 area. Let's see. So if price come to trendline support is a buy. This is one way we time our entry n get the best n low risk price. If get it chances of huat is higher. If drop the risk is low. If don't get it  you don't lose anything.,btohqsg
