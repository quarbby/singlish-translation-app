I hope you guys had a good day today,btohqsg
Why does it sound like you're going to give us bad news,btohqsg
Giveaway planned for this Friday! Good news! - J,btohqsg
Does it always have to be like that,btohqsg
Is genuinely just hoping you guys had a wonderful day,btohqsg
i honestly js excited for sgcm car meet,btohqsg
I hope you had a nice day too sir,btohqsg
Oh  hope you had a great day too!!!,btohqsg
That’s the best way to end a day. Sleep early,btohqsg
Early to bed  early to rise  makes a man healthy  wealthy and wise,btohqsg
Could it be a passat wagon with a arteon front?,btohqsg
Apparently there's an actual Arteon shooting brake,btohqsg
And an Arteon R shooting brake as well,btohqsg
Are you awake early or did you join#TeamNoSleep?,btohqsg
Laughter is the best way to start the day!!!,btohqsg
Bro  did you hit your own funny bone?,btohqsg
It’s called a funny bone because the part where you hit it is called humerus,btohqsg
What did one wall say to the other?,btohqsg
I’ll meet you at the corner.,btohqsg
Cheat the system with these powerful Cat A COE cars! 😉Prior to 2013  Cat A COE did not have a power limit. These are the cars that make well over 130bhp and are still eligible for a Cat A COE.👉🏻 Comment and share with us if you know any cars that will fit into this cheat sheet as well!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
this is like a coe mini cooper s that i drove like 10 yeats ago,btohqsg
Oh nos  looks like J and R owes someone a nasi padang 🥺- E,btohqsg
Ngl  csi skills on point. HAHAHA- E,btohqsg
J only hor. I don’t make bets anyhow-R,btohqsg
I think people got this list a bit too early and now there's barely any good units of the cars on this list left,btohqsg
Twisted reveals 16 classic Defender 110s 😍Twisted Automotive has lifted the covers off 16 vehicles that have been barn stored since coming off the production line six years ago.My gosh  what absolute beauties - but only available for sale in the UK. 🥺👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you would love to own one of these classic Land Rovers!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
sadly there are only 3 of this generation without lifespan,btohqsg
So does this mean you could import it to SG?,btohqsg
I assumed it’s not rego-ed and therefore ‘new’,btohqsg
Depends if it registered as a land rover or a car under twisted automotive,btohqsg
would have to undergo homologation if its reg under twisted automotive,btohqsg
Well if it’s rolled off the factory and not registered  wouldn’t that mean it’s a new car? Just not sold. Like inventory at a dealer..,btohqsg
but you do realise they have plates right,btohqsg
Also  diesel ones might not be able to reg in SG since emission laws have changed,btohqsg
I didn’t stare at the photo long enough 🤣 was in a meeting haha,btohqsg
I would say that's a good thing,btohqsg
But you're not going to win the giveaway like this :(,btohqsg
Side profile looks like a mazda 6 wagon,btohqsg
The front end is damn good looking,btohqsg

He gets the packet of nasi padang from me then! - J,btohqsg

Please leak the planned date  thanks,btohqsg

This month’s tough but you’re tougher 🤭🤭,btohqsg
But its an open secret. Most people know already. - J,btohqsg
Oh damn im late to the party haha,btohqsg
