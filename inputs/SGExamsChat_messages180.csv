text,group
then i listen for the key things lor,btohqsg
its ok considering i fail my prelim 😂,btohqsg
my compre and compo ok my oral ok lc i die,btohqsg
my sit writing i got only 18-19 idr,btohqsg
my eiditng pull the marks up,btohqsg
they mark quite leniently for my prelim cos the cohort did badly 😂,btohqsg
Is it possible to camscan the lc recording,btohqsg
my compre results wld have been btr ah,btohqsg
Recent photograph of T1 (photograph found online),btohqsg
my cher set the prelimshe wanted to make the editing v hard but the hod say no 😂,btohqsg
The lc paper ans is online already,btohqsg
Anyone have soft copy for lc,btohqsg
How many marks did u guys get?,btohqsg
I put sacred place : ) sigh,btohqsg
Unless u wrote a scared place,btohqsg
nola i got 23 not minus 23,btohqsg
Lowkey hoping they will still tick although got place 😂,btohqsg
yes HAHA the last 2 sections killed me,btohqsg
i lost like half the mark soz,btohqsg
"oh man do u think ""Marrying only around the culture"" sounds right HAHAHA",btohqsg
My brain couldnt proccess and they were going on for the next ans,btohqsg
I hope bell curve for english goes down a lot lol,btohqsg
ikr i hope to get b4 above,btohqsg
But I thought so many people have stress here repeatedly that there is no bell curve,btohqsg
ikr they say it like so many times omg 😂,btohqsg
Do u all think cop gonna rise this year,btohqsg
I heard private tutors take O levels as private candidates thou. Then they all get A1,btohqsg
^Ya they dont affect ur chances of gettin A1/A2,btohqsg
I thot they just dont affect the placement,btohqsg
Arent they taking as private candidates,btohqsg
they don't impact cop or placement or anyth,btohqsg
But is the proportion of people taking it as private candidates for this purpose significant?If it isn't  then there is no point fussing about it,btohqsg
Is bellcurve system still gg on?,btohqsg
Even if they make 10% of the candidature  theres negligible impact,btohqsg
Okay  thank you for your opinion.Terima kasih.,btohqsg
marrying with people within the culture can?,btohqsg
because i missed that whole part and i just guessed,btohqsg
Anyone giving up on combine humans???,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask does anyone have Pure Chem practical paper?,btohqsg
I cant give up on it. I have no other humans,btohqsg
dont bother giving up on any subjects except chinese,btohqsg
yeah i took ss+geog last yr,btohqsg
like maybe memorise a few examples,btohqsg
its sooo much to memorise my brain not enough space,btohqsg
I didn't not pass any of my humans paper since sec 1 :(,btohqsg
then geog i studied quite hard,btohqsg
Ss how much must we study? How much is enough,btohqsg
Bruh what happen sia that guy,btohqsg
i got a b3 in the end,btohqsg
aiyoo but humans q impt if uw to go jc,btohqsg
iw go poly so i kinda js wanna ditch it,btohqsg
I thought ss mostly source base,btohqsg
idk sia my friend told me so,btohqsg
depends what u wanna take in jc?,btohqsg
well 1 human subject has to be counted in l1r5 thats it,btohqsg
nah jc life aint for me i in sec sch iw die alr,btohqsg
well depends how strong ur other half is,btohqsg
tourism is so much to memorise gdi,btohqsg
plate tect most impt i think,btohqsg
this one is a lil harder?,btohqsg
i think all need if uw do well sia,btohqsg
Landform is hard to memo but fun to learn,btohqsg
can ditch either weather or tourism tho,btohqsg
since u doing half the paper only,btohqsg
for me i did tourism and weather,btohqsg
but they can combine both topic into 1 qn,btohqsg
I doing weather GI for section A and then tourism for section B,btohqsg
um then study ss hard  make sure u can do ur source based qns well  anyways the content essay qn is like 8 marks only,btohqsg
Who here got a math tmr,btohqsg
i tot can choose between weather and tourism,btohqsg
Honestly I've already given up. No point feeling nervous,btohqsg
tourism GI is mor skill weather is more memorise,btohqsg
watch this guy pull off an a,btohqsg
Who is the guy that want drop a math tmr ah,btohqsg
I think it used to be called pure math,btohqsg
LMAO IM TEMPTED i just dont appear 💀,btohqsg
J mean just now one guy say want quit and stuff,btohqsg
N levels comb science  phy first or chem first?,btohqsg
How to pass a math lmao,btohqsg
no no theres nth to mem,btohqsg
Lowkey regret switching humans to a math,btohqsg
once u get the hang of the topic  keep going  youll master it,btohqsg
nope i think it's unlikely weather and tourism will combine,btohqsg
I mean I think I can pass but do well idts,btohqsg
hmm id say dont bother doing papers in the morning,btohqsg
Lmao my friend say want wake up 7 to study a math,btohqsg
i think the best u can do now is look thru worked examples,btohqsg
and like what aron said just memorise ur graphs thing LOL,btohqsg
if thats all u got then sure thing,btohqsg
idk tys ans sheet the ans sometime wrong wan,btohqsg
I mean i done 10plus paper,btohqsg
its fine its fine  just do whatever u can do now,btohqsg
So i change subject humans to a math during june 17,btohqsg
So kinda study 4month for this only,btohqsg
Why change so last min thou,btohqsg
just dont leave any qn blank can alr,btohqsg
i did for lc 😂 i tried,btohqsg
well  just do ur best for the remaining papers,btohqsg
Should i just grind until 5 am,btohqsg
Then sleep until 1 then go exam,btohqsg
theres rly rly rly no pt,btohqsg
Is this ur final year of retaking?,btohqsg
dude go sleep early  wake up early then go and read thru ur concepts,btohqsg
I tried memorise for a few months already,btohqsg
The graph can memorise really fast,btohqsg
honestly i cannot rmb what graph isit,btohqsg
ngl depends on how well uk urself ah,btohqsg
i can function ok w 2hrs of sleep but after the paper i confirm toh,btohqsg
so if ur ok w that u can pull all nighters if cannot right u better dont force,btohqsg
need to know ur own limits and sleep cycle,btohqsg
yep i did that for last year slept 1 hour haha,btohqsg
I thot emath the graphs are roughly the same,btohqsg
If u did emaths u shd know,btohqsg
Waste my youth for o level,btohqsg
mayb for exponential graphs u may wanna try understanding how it works?,btohqsg
u increase ur x value  ur y value increase more,btohqsg
my advice is watching youtube videos explaining the graphs,btohqsg
so the shape will correspond ah,btohqsg
or i see those graphs memes,btohqsg
got people do before so u can use those,btohqsg
But it's just 2 marks normally so it's ok if u dont,btohqsg
then u shld do ok la,btohqsg
Ya then part b is simultaneously,btohqsg
I think i need focus my calculus and area undergraph,btohqsg
u cant get the shape correct,btohqsg
I mean part a dk graph shape,btohqsg
Yea they wont be so unreasonable. If not just use ur wrong graph. They shd give ecf,btohqsg
how does it affect your intersection point,btohqsg
cant you just use the equations provided and solve?,btohqsg
If not skip first and if u got time just plot it slowly,btohqsg
I saying even if no graph can get behind mark wat,btohqsg
but graph is quite a small part of the exam,btohqsg
i think trigo and calc more important,btohqsg
I hope they give us what to plot..,btohqsg
How many marks does it take to get A1 for amaths?,btohqsg
go memorise ur trigo graphs esp tangent,btohqsg
i say b4 i got my linear law wrong,btohqsg
the rest im pretty sure i got it right,btohqsg
but it was a long qn,btohqsg
1 qn wrong how is that possible thou,btohqsg
or maybe some presentation marks off? or careless?,btohqsg
cuz for the most part i got it right,btohqsg
But highly unlikely will ask for transformation of tan x graph,btohqsg
I dont think linear law can push u down 3 grades lol,btohqsg
its not hard but when they start playing with the graph... i cant 😂,btohqsg
Guys for pvt candidate can wear short pants,btohqsg
i said i got A2 wym,btohqsg
Like sketch y = tan 2x - 3,btohqsg
Oh I thot u said b4,btohqsg
Just modify same like sin and cos,btohqsg
It’s the last year they can test log graphs,btohqsg
Yeah but don’t need to indicate amplitude,btohqsg
oh ya can imagine how it looks like,btohqsg
im too reliant on gc LOL,btohqsg
Oh I think they tested that for my prelims or something,btohqsg
my cher gave us that as practice tho,btohqsg
Lol 3 modulus came out for my prelim b4,btohqsg
Worse case for double just do 4 cases,btohqsg
If u don’t know how do,btohqsg
Wouldnt the modulus be the same?,btohqsg
This questions seems like sat math hmmm,btohqsg
this guy is gud in math,btohqsg
Its the same rite. Pls give me some self esteem,btohqsg
I feel like I can pass amaths now,btohqsg
Oh my god not this question  I don't want to remember smo stuffs.,btohqsg
I never saw that qn before lel or maybe I just cant rmb idk,btohqsg
I mean I had nothing to do. All the other questions idk how to do,btohqsg
Nah I memed the entire paper. I drew to scale for some questions to find the answer,btohqsg
and youre still wondering if youll pass amath?,btohqsg
U think they let me draw to scale?,btohqsg
Should've sent the digit sum question.,btohqsg
But u can do that for smo,btohqsg
Yea that's why I say even if I did smo  I may not be able to do amaths,btohqsg
How u all still rmb? I thot u didnt take the test.,btohqsg
dang u guys have crazy math knowledge,btohqsg
im satisfied knowing how to integrate by parts,btohqsg
Nah I just went for smo becus I can skip cca,btohqsg
Do any of y’all know how to study for literature??,btohqsg
I’m still unsure about how to revise,btohqsg
Wtf is an euler totient again.,btohqsg
Its probably not relevant to the qn. They never teach me that,btohqsg
bruh u learn number theory alrdy arh,btohqsg
He does olympiad so it's expected,btohqsg
What did u get for this year smo thou,btohqsg
U must really like maths to do it willingly,btohqsg
Hi how to study for ss?,btohqsg
Issue 1 study all the last time pm mp all the big guys issue 2 study the organisations and healthcare stuff issue 3 globalisation that one study economic benefits all that stuff,btohqsg
You won't know what extract you'll get,btohqsg
But u must study for SEQ ehat,btohqsg
N level come out issue 1,btohqsg
I got big feels it's either issue 2/3,btohqsg
SEQ is chapter 3 on globalisation for me previously,btohqsg
Chapter 2 key features rightIs the foreign workerHealthcareWays of diversity,btohqsg
U branch out urself and u remember everything sui sui alrdy,btohqsg
One question is pure tourism or W&C  the other is mixed so you need guess which topic this year would be the pure question if ur spotting qns,btohqsg
Anybody know how to study for literature?,btohqsg
why is everyone asking how to study a particular subject LOL,btohqsg
i remember nt studying for my lit,btohqsg
provided it closely aligns to the play or wtv ur studying,btohqsg
Then how much did you score for it??,btohqsg
Just went into the exam hall and wrote?,btohqsg
got quick tips for amath? :”,btohqsg
why tf u wanna memorise essay?,btohqsg
So just know the text very very well,btohqsg
thats gnna be the downfall for u,btohqsg
my cher would slice us if we did,btohqsg
esp for a subject like lit,btohqsg
i nvr do amath for like 2 weeks alrd   usually i do well but i scared lack of practice will make me do badly haha,btohqsg
its like tryna memorise essah going into oral,btohqsg
js see the qn and answer la,btohqsg
So to study for literature... for real just read the set text a lot?,btohqsg
i never used quotes in my essays,btohqsg
You seriously just watched the movie?,btohqsg
And read the text a bit,btohqsg
no actually i js watched pygmalion,btohqsg
Do you think that reading the text a lot makes you a master of it or something,btohqsg
felt good to be in o’s,btohqsg
js cuz u read it alot doesnt mean u’ll be good at it,btohqsg
Just dunno how to study for literature,btohqsg
wht matters is that u understand everyth,btohqsg
lmfao now? u want die isit,btohqsg
someone’s about to get a scolding from me,btohqsg
So do I just master the subject?,btohqsg
In addition to content  you also need to know answering technique,btohqsg
write a few essays about some of your points haha,btohqsg
Eg  when you read a question  what does the question require you to say?,btohqsg
theres no answering techniques to it,btohqsg
Just answer according to the question?,btohqsg
i can go into an exam writing an entirely flipped peel and figure that shit out,btohqsg
answering technique at o’s is bull,btohqsg
You just thought of all your points on the spot?,btohqsg
Based on your knowledge on the text,btohqsg
Then do I just read the text for revision?,btohqsg
Like what do I do for revision,btohqsg
You shld write about different points you have for plausible qn tgt w the evidence,btohqsg
Should i jaut study content or try do paper,btohqsg
Just dont sleep too late mane,btohqsg
Sleep is most important for the brain,btohqsg
Depends which u less confident in,btohqsg
If u know ur concepts well but suck at presentation then try do paper,btohqsg
If udk ur concepts at all then study content and look thru basic questions,btohqsg
Just revise ur old papers. If u cant think tmr  it would probably be worse,btohqsg
Its not too late we have 15 hours more,btohqsg
8 hours for sleep so 7 hours more,btohqsg
Also tmr last day w afternoon paper :(,btohqsg
I didnt know youd mention that,btohqsg
Ask all a1 students. They Always say sleep is important,btohqsg
Do u think I wont sleep lol,btohqsg
I suggest u to make some baby powder milk and drink it while hot. Really puts u to sleep fast,btohqsg
yes  there no point grinding at the night before  it wont absorb into your brain properly  u might also blank out during the exams,btohqsg
Oh just load up on caffeine before the exam,btohqsg
From experience i did that for My science papers. I slept for 3 hours. Guess what i got a d7,btohqsg
Oh yeah add chicken essence to the coffee too,btohqsg
U can still study now but sleep and make sure at least 7/8,btohqsg
Those 2 tgt are a disaster,btohqsg
i did that for ss and blanked out  i got d7 also  history barely saved me to a c6 combined humans,btohqsg
I've been doing it wrongly my entire life shit,btohqsg
Bruh i just sniff some coccaine tbh,btohqsg
But u wouldnt need to do amaths thou,btohqsg
im not taking os lol (yet),btohqsg
Wait wouldnt alkaline substances attack ur stomach or sth,btohqsg
4 to 5 hours is probably the minimum,btohqsg
Wont attack ur Immune system bcos i have a stron immune system,btohqsg
I'm sure u do john cummings,btohqsg
4/5hrs of sleep - C5 7-8hrs of sleep - B3-A1. Tested by Scientists in Zimbabwe,btohqsg
Im just reading this based on sleep studies,btohqsg
No ah I slept 4 to 5 hours for most of my prelims,btohqsg
Ive been getting abt 7 to 8 hrs of sleep but im not getting A1 for any past subjs so uh,btohqsg
1 more thing i want to make it clear.Dun memorise solution. My teacher and me had a chat about how the paper are being set these days. And we are not training u guys to be robot.We are training you guys to be a problem solver. Dun memorise. Understand the concept correctly. All the best,btohqsg
Becus I never studied early lol,btohqsg
So u dh a single one...? Wtf,btohqsg
English chinese e math a math and combine science,btohqsg
But i cant drop anymore lol,btohqsg
Thats bcos u Slept for 8hours but u thought u slept for 5hours,btohqsg
Alot people say my combin damn slack,btohqsg
Just dont take the exam thats what i call drop,btohqsg
I slept at 2 am how tf can I wake up at 6 and sleep for 8 hours lol,btohqsg
4 subjs can go ite ???,btohqsg
Guys wanna get A1 for science. Use a learning technique i used called ACTIVE RECALL,btohqsg
Hey ite is not the end. U may take a longer path but if u work hard u can succeed,btohqsg
I just memorise until I sleep,btohqsg
U can go higher nitec at ite,btohqsg
I thgt ite also needs 5 subjects,btohqsg
Do what works best for u,btohqsg
If u dont i have 7,btohqsg
Incl chinese which i took in june,btohqsg
You basically write out questions abt the topic and test yourself. Then without reading the notes go answer all and check back the notes. See where u got it wrong. Repeat this everyday or every 2 days. Its scientifically proven that Memorising or Underlining notes does not help u memorise efficiently. So use active recall for better results.,btohqsg
l1r4 still need a humanities sub anot?,btohqsg
Hmm there’s a mcq.. on the trends of bonds in halogen molecules... and trends of number of isotopes of halogens,btohqsg
oo yeah i do this too,btohqsg
I was like... they learnt about bond energy of halogens?,btohqsg
Except I cant do this everyday,btohqsg
No i thgt u alr finished tbh HAHA,btohqsg
I mean dont have to do All chapters each day. U can do maybe like 2-4 chapters? Just test urself,btohqsg
I'm honestly scared becus I'm too calm about this,btohqsg
Bruh i never really study for science recently,btohqsg
And repeat this over and over. Spaced repetitions,btohqsg
So like after a math how,btohqsg
But agn what can i do,btohqsg
I alr did all the revision i can  and amath is a very hit or miss subj ngl,btohqsg
I might do worse than my prelims for Os lol,btohqsg
Stfu i got chem and geog,btohqsg
Guys ur brains are playing around wit you,btohqsg
Today its surprising i can focus,btohqsg
Just self doubt n Stress thats causing this,btohqsg
Idk I have a poly course in mind but I havent fully decided yet. I prob going open house,btohqsg
Wont fail if u rlly put in the effort for ur exams,btohqsg
Theres no open house i thgt,btohqsg
But if have yes thats good cos i want go,btohqsg
Shld have gone at the start of the year sigh,btohqsg
Lol i know sp gonna hv webinars,btohqsg
Bruh i did alot for a math,btohqsg
Huh so I can't skip humans??,btohqsg
To be fair we didnt know there was gonna be a fucking worldwide pandemic,btohqsg
If u hv 2 that u can choose frm and use u can afford to skip 1,btohqsg
If u single humans GOOD LUCK,btohqsg
So dont be Afraid to fail man. Be confident walk in there knoeing ur gonna kill this paper and get the Grade u been Grinding for,btohqsg
But that means last written paper 29oct,btohqsg
HWPO - Hardwork Pays Off People,btohqsg
I have econs so not for me,btohqsg
If i never study confirm fail alr,btohqsg
DO YOU MIND SENDING ME THE QNS,btohqsg
Im not close to my class so i paiseh ask them,btohqsg
Nah but u did a sht ton of preparation for it. If i was u i wouldnt be too worried,btohqsg
But it's the easiest subject of mine,btohqsg
Ye cos im supp to take but i dropped at the start of the month,btohqsg
I thot econs was easy. My teacher made it sound like econs was a godsend,btohqsg
Im taking private when i took listening today one guy sit beside me,btohqsg
Huh? My school 85-90+ percent dist econs,btohqsg
He go ite then take english o level,btohqsg
My class the only econs class and not even full class,btohqsg
Econs is literally the one subject which no one need to study,btohqsg
How u dont study and do well,btohqsg
Bruh my teacher say that last year some guy never showed up for most of the lessons and got a b,btohqsg
That guy Was studying  at home,btohqsg
Good idea to study through the night or sleep?,btohqsg
o level econs got mcq right,btohqsg
Legit can guess and probably 35+/40,btohqsg
I got 19/30 apparently its bad,btohqsg
Eh if u ask me dont take it,btohqsg
Cmon Gan u worked so hard for this preparation why u doubting urself mannn,btohqsg
Unless its btr than ur other subjs it wont be as of much use to ur l1r5,btohqsg
in econs the concepts are managable  its the qns,btohqsg
Idk bro i got fucked for english and e math,btohqsg
Same here but dont let it affect other papers,btohqsg
I dont know shit abt chapter 6Aron,btohqsg
When i started learning it i just gave up on it,btohqsg
I didnt study that at all and wacked my way through my prelims,btohqsg
I forgot that it was new,btohqsg
And it landed me to a fucking 25/90,btohqsg
Which tb do you use for econs?,btohqsg
macro is more fun than micro isnt it,btohqsg
shld i study issue 3 for srq,btohqsg
my brain just finished memorising the whole issue 1,btohqsg
I only liked inflation and unemployment,btohqsg
all of them are related lol,btohqsg
i need storage for chem and geog 😭😭,btohqsg
Is it the complete econs 3rd ed,btohqsg
The concepts like here and there idl,btohqsg
But serious I thot all school econs was easy,btohqsg
Okay maybe it is and im just stupid,btohqsg
Cos my classmates got some can do well so yes easy,btohqsg
What u want know abt it,btohqsg
just remember the standard shape arh,btohqsg
J rmb the shapes for positive,btohqsg
Ya if its negative then laterally invert(?) it,btohqsg
Th other study grp was spamming,btohqsg
I dont even study my work. This is all I need,btohqsg
idk if its called topical revision,btohqsg
Omg yall 😭 i was flipping thru my notes upon seeing that i j stopped,btohqsg
tje one tht comes aog w the amath tha,btohqsg
Jessica im here to interview u on Your outstanding performance for emath paper 2. How did u manage to ull that off with such spectacular tecnique?,btohqsg
Gan Zj You my friend u are prepared for amath. You know you done Sooo sooo much to prepare for this paper tmr. So dooooont doubt urself,btohqsg
Why worry if u prepared right?,btohqsg
im not the only one in my sch._.,btohqsg
