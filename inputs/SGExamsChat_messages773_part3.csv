I don‚Äôt want to be dragged into any of this shit,btohqsg
I boycott McDonald‚Äôs not for Palestine but for my own health lol,btohqsg
Ok but tbh since I‚Äôm non Muslim  I think that guy who said that knows better not to tell me such things if not that‚Äôs rly fked up. At least in that case it was a Muslim telling a muslim,btohqsg
Na bro is just called the practice of non intervention,btohqsg
I just hope hope that none of them ever like randomly ask me in a convo ‚Äúwhose side are you on‚Äù,btohqsg
The side that benefits me the most,btohqsg
Then I suppose it‚Äôs up to them to interpret what that means? Haha,btohqsg
Let them create their own narrative by themselves,btohqsg
In your opinion do you think it‚Äôs wrong for a muslim to call out a fellow muslim that buys and uses a product from a brand that seems to ‚Äúsupport Israel‚Äù? Cos that‚Äôs what happened in my office and what I was complaining about just now,btohqsg
when their holy book mentioned israel 43 times,btohqsg
Like I think ppl sometimes just can‚Äôt mind their own business,btohqsg
Also since I‚Äôm a non muslim I‚Äôd want to hear a perspective from a muslim whether such things are acceptable cos maybe my perspective may be biased,btohqsg
they will confirm will say different story one,btohqsg
I mean if you not comfortable answering this qn is fine@urbanwhisperr,btohqsg
Look like even my parents who are like one of the more devout christians don‚Äôt keep on trying to impose their beliefs on me about supporting Israel lol,btohqsg
Nor do they ask me to boycott ‚Äúanti Israel‚Äù products,btohqsg
because they cant  its mutual and they respect your free will just like how god respects our free will,btohqsg
but there will be a consequence lah,btohqsg
Yeah  I think most church pastors do support Israel tho but it‚Äôs not like they tell their congregations they must and only support them (though I‚Äôm sure some may),btohqsg
Just give them the rope and let them create the noose to hang themselves,btohqsg
Imo they wanna push this I am like bruh I just wanna survive.. I eat McDonald's not because I want to just that I don't think,btohqsg
I think it depends on what gospel you believe in  people can believe that they don‚Äôt have to support Israel even if they believe in Jesus,btohqsg
ya  thhe ppl can still be saved luh,btohqsg
I‚Äôm by no means a devout Christian so I also better avoid commenting too much lest I say sth wrong,btohqsg
there is only one gospel what,btohqsg
There are also some churches (like mine I believe) that preach about once saved always saved  which means no matter how far you run astray from god  even if it means converting to another religion  as long as you once believed in Jesus you‚Äôre saved,btohqsg
"ya la cuz they see the words ""eternal life""",btohqsg
so oh once saved always saved,btohqsg
Ya like a lot of the text is up to interpretation,btohqsg
Also ppl will translate stuff differently,btohqsg
Power over spice is power over all,btohqsg
On a side note I hope none of my office colleagues are in this chat if not legit gg alr,btohqsg
"""it is mandatory upon every Muslim to correct a person who commits sin  and give him sincere advice""From one of the hadiths: ""Whoever of you sees wrong being committed  let him rectify it with his hand  if he is unable  then with his tongue  and if he us unable  then with his heart  and this is the weakest of faith -- or in another version: beyond this there is not a single mustard seed's weight of faith (iman).""",btohqsg
I dun like the taste of yolk,btohqsg
So i will always just leave the egg yolk outüíÄ,btohqsg
where will the egg yolks go?,btohqsg
I only eat the runny yolks,btohqsg
My parents assumed i dun eat coz it is fatty then be like ‚Äòa bit of yolk wun die one la‚Äô but it is coz i dun like,btohqsg
Gude will u eat a century egg?,btohqsg
hmm so are you telling me yt stomach is the bin?,btohqsg
Actually that is what i worry the most when comes to bbq,btohqsg
If it's chicken just overcook it,btohqsg
I rather get overcooked chicken that's dry than undercooked salmonella,btohqsg
Is buying products from an Israel origin brand considered a sin,btohqsg
did your friend burn his/her hand?,btohqsg
U mean the actual burn ones? The research is u really gotta burn them like shit and it eat that daily for it to be an issue,btohqsg
it's a very simplistic way of looking at things because few actually realise that there are Israeli brands/organisation that support Palestinians.For example there's a Zionist Israeli organisation that supports the creation of a Palestinian state... even though we typically associate Zionists with the opposite.So perhaps the solution is to look at whether the brand commits itself to a certain position/message. But in general if there is no was-was or doubt  by default it should be fine?,btohqsg
Basically not a big issue tbh just continue enjoying what u want and excerise precaution to just not eat fully burned meat.,btohqsg
go grab a half fertilised duck egg,btohqsg
Then in that case I think it was totally unnecessary for my colleague to call out his colleague for buying that product,btohqsg
