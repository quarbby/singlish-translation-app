Can just afraid remaining balance will wasted,btohqsg
Better than charge more than 2k and get 0.4mpd for that no?,btohqsg
Yes same username. Can tell by the comment style haha üòÜ. Have unique characteristics.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is there any way we can convert UOB Uni $ to krisflyer for free?,btohqsg
Unless you are uob privilege customer with the uob privilege card,btohqsg
Your uob card will have a special carving that stated privilege banking. At least 350k with uob i think,btohqsg
And when that is the case the online transaction will automatically have 0 fees is it? Or would I need to go to the bank branch?,btohqsg
There is some mention need to go branch or something or if u have uob vi card u need to convert the miles thru the vi card,btohqsg
Seems worse than normal banking üòÜ,btohqsg
I think more of like need to link one card for the free conversion for privilege banking when doing the krisflyer setup. But incase make mistake go branch let staff guide u loh,btohqsg
for chocolate finance   if i put in money on the weekend will it get the daily returns ?,btohqsg
Yes daily $2.30 if put 20K,btohqsg
"Daily ""interests"" depending on market performance",btohqsg
No point putting more than 20k,btohqsg
As others said  no point out over $20k as your daily returns may go up and down in short term. What I do is put $20k and withdraw daily. Or you can put $19.9k and withdraw after some time :),btohqsg
Hi guys  has anyone get their cash back rewards clawed back by money smart due to canceling the card before 12 mths?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know what would be the MCC if I use my card on shopback pay? Is it based on the shopback MCC or based on the MCC of each merchant? I check heymax  shopback is under 5712.,btohqsg
Shopback vouchers‚Äô mcc codes are entire beasts themselves,btohqsg
Does anyone encounter being charged overseas transaction fee using DBS card on merchants like Agoda or other travel agents despite choosing SGD as the currency when making payment?,btohqsg
You meant the 1% dynamic currency conversion fee?,btohqsg
Yeah. DBS says all banks have but it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm encountering it. Never had issues with other cards/banks when I booked on platforms like Agoda and other travel agents - what I‚Äôm being charged is the same as the invoice,btohqsg
not say no point ba   cause i just have a bit of cash lying around and i know that the choco finance is like moomoo's MMF or similar.,btohqsg
Extra cash .. I suggest you can put in esaver or bonus saver,btohqsg
Not sure if anybody else experienced the same and have any tips to avoid this if I want to continue to use dbs card?,btohqsg
This is example from uob. Agoda is known for having mixed payment gateways in Singapore and overseas. No way you can avoid this using dbs card and agoda. At least uob lady can use with amaze to avoid this.,btohqsg
Thanks bro.. I likely use your suggestion to book my next trip. Combination of Agoda and marriot bonvy hotel,btohqsg
Erm. Marriot wont give member pts if you book through agoda.,btohqsg
And amex plat charge cant be used with amaze sir,btohqsg
My hotel strategy is book 3 days for a 3.5 to 3.7** hotel through agoda. The rest book through marriot bonvy website,btohqsg
In that way save $$ also,btohqsg
Im not marriot expert. I thought need to keep staying in marriot chain to maintain status/advance to the next one?,btohqsg
Can stay more night... but you got to spend more...,btohqsg
How sneaky of Agoda. You are right - my past transactions on other cards shows Agoda sg. Maybe that‚Äôs why don‚Äôt have the conversion fee.Do you know if I use amaze with uob lady‚Äôs  can I still use the bank promo codes on these websites? Or they won‚Äôt be able to read that I‚Äôm paying with uob card?Does amaze with other cards work or only with uob lady‚Äôs?,btohqsg
u got plat charge.. for elites  few more nights no prob for you,btohqsg
How... they charge you less $$ for hotel stay ?,btohqsg
So far I know is if you book 5th night . The 5th one is free.,btohqsg
Amaze works with any master cards. Dbs excludes amaze so cant use. Most common pairing are crmc  uob lady and uob kf. Once u use amaze  cant use bank promo. However  you can use agoda + master card promo which i find sometimes cheaper.,btohqsg
u got plat charge few nights you can afford easily,btohqsg
No la ... rich won't want to siam the welcome bonus of 8k already,btohqsg
Btw  dont use amaze with crmc or uob kf with agoda. Recommend to use uob lady only if you go down this path.,btohqsg
May go negative leh you want ? lol. Excess can put in Mari invest or CIMB Fast-saver or SCB eSaver,btohqsg
Have you maxed out all the HYSA?,btohqsg
I'll take whatever this man said with a huge chunk of salt,btohqsg
Where is the wall that he wanted to build?,btohqsg
Will Mari Invest end up with less than the deposited money? I am with Maribank and thought of trying Mari Invest,btohqsg
Anything ‚Äúinvest‚Äù can go negative.Unless u see ‚Äúcapital guanrantee‚Äù in tnc,btohqsg
Does topping up cash card using nets app qualify for the $800 min spend for ocbc 365 card?,btohqsg
Not saying 0% but if you look at the fund compositions is mostly corp bond and some govt bond mostly quite big name ~,btohqsg
Is using Ezlink to pay for SGQR a way to earn some miles? Like would citi rewards or HSBC travelone give some miles?,btohqsg
Nope  u earn ezlink link app point,btohqsg
Hi all  will I be able to get miles if I use atome to pay for my Agoda booking  using the uob ladys card with travel category,btohqsg
Hello all! Which trading platform is best for buying Msia Bursa stocks? TIA!,btohqsg
hi all  if i were to do DCA weekly of $50 into S&P500 index  should i go for US or UK domicile?i read and watch that UK domicile is more for buying large amount of shares so its more worth for the fees. but i intend to do DCA only as i do not have large sum to throw in,btohqsg
dont have enough $$$ to max out any of them,btohqsg
Then why do you want to keep more than 20k in chocolate finance,btohqsg
its aspect is similar to moomoo MMF   that amount that i going to put is like ~1k? not like 50k HAHAH,btohqsg
Uuh sure I guess since it‚Äôs your money. Just thinking why will you risk your money for something against something that are guaranteed that gives more or similar interest,btohqsg
i mean if i had 150k will put in UOB one for 4% but dont have enough savings cause just started working 1 year  I also wish i can max out all HYSA ü§£,btohqsg
Can I use ipaymy to pay income tax monthly?,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt max out any of them either  but I rather put my money in ocbc or uob to slowly build it up. Albeit mmf are low to no risk  there‚Äôs still a risk. Especially you said you started working for 1 year  capital is your priorityNot a financial advise but you do you,btohqsg
For chocolate finance  if I put in $50k  does the first $20k still get 4.2%?,btohqsg
Also  the remaining $30k will be at 3.5% pa?,btohqsg
So for the $30k  what interest rate would that be?,btohqsg
Targeted at 3.5% but it varies each day ya. Can go negative.,btohqsg
yea theres still a risk if thats your concern  but 3% in UOB one vs 3.5~ in moomoo cashplus or ~3.5 in chocofinance which the underlying funds i have read the funds they are buying and the contents of those funds   which they are using a custodian account also. So the risk is also considerably low,btohqsg
For small amounts can look at roboadvisors instead since the fees will not be significant,btohqsg
More of endowus/syfe and the likesüí∞FINANCIAL APPSüí∞üîóhttps://hmsg.link/finance,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGand others wouldnt this promotion result in 6+% benefit as well assuming we put in MMF like Fullerton?,btohqsg
Deposits in UOB One is SDIC insured. Funds in MooMoo cash plus and chcofinance are considered as investment with a level of risk to be accepted. On their page  they also pointed that their investment should not be treated as deposits.,btohqsg
thanks. so if i buy VOO from Syfe brokerage  issit okay for small amount DCA?,btohqsg
Syfe trade is fine within the free trade limits,btohqsg
Don't combine stock vouchers with MMF returns (though i know what you mean),btohqsg
Hi Guys  HSBC EGA 5 eligible transaction can be all giro? No need to have any transaction through debit card?,btohqsg
Giro should work. Can also be fast transfers  cc spends too,btohqsg
now i am using heimax  Amaze and City stack for lazada and shopee purchase,btohqsg
Hi  can DBS vantage  UOB visa signature  UOB lady's or UOB preferred platinum visa earn miles when paying for SP electricity utility bills? Thank you,btohqsg
Why would you use amaze on Lazada and shopee when they're both online already? That's a waste of 1k domestic spend limit.,btohqsg
Hi. If I link my CRC to FairPrice apps and spend at kopitiam and FairPrice  will I get 4miles per dollar? Or it will need to spend through amaze,btohqsg
if u meant citi rewards card  should get 4mpd on fairprice app assuming NOT using google/apple pay in-app,btohqsg
Yes. I saved the card to FairPrice apps for payment,btohqsg
Hi all  what are your thoughts on the Astrea8 bond?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone know any place for good lobangs for CDC vouchers?,btohqsg
Actually I am not sure can setup GIRO for Citi in DBS. Manual payment is possible. I didnt see Citibank as an option when I tried this (not even HSBC or UOB for that matter).,btohqsg
If i use my UOB One account to pay for credit card bills from other banks (e.g. Maybank/HSBC)  does this count towards the minimum $500 minimum spending for UOB One?,btohqsg
Any good credit card onboarding promotions this month?,btohqsg
How to check what charges/companies fall under which expense category? I rmb there was some merchant code tool or something,btohqsg
Hello i got questions with vouchers that you can buy from heymax such as amazon  lazada  grab  gojek etc. Example if i buy $100 voucher and redeem at said platform  do i need to buy items of same value of the voucher? Or it works like a wallet/balance.,btohqsg
Depends on vouchers. Just check their tnc. For example  klook one is balance while tada one is offset the ride cose.,btohqsg
Bros. I won some money in football betting. Overall 1600... Last night and semi final. Will use the $$ to clear Amex platinum charge card annual fee,btohqsg

I spent on 8 May  got 1% CB on 3 Jun and $188 credit at end Jun.,btohqsg
thanks  wondering if heymax's amazon voucher counts as online spending?  may have screwed up,btohqsg
Not sure  but I spent on Singapore Mint online and it is counted.,btohqsg
Any bro can advise the best uob card for hospital bill?,btohqsg
I don't think any local credit cards can be use for hospital bill. Correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
none award for hospital mcc unless those which need hefty annual fees,btohqsg
Heymex suggested HSBC Advance card for 2.5% cashback. Really can trust Heymax?,btohqsg
MoneySmartSg suggested UOB One card.... err....,btohqsg
TnC of hsbc advance exclude mcc 8062 hospital,btohqsg
outdated le  refer to the card's TnC,btohqsg
I am 30k invited by GXS.,btohqsg
then can use healthhub to pay. mcc 8099 not excluded on most cards.,btohqsg
I guess no more hsbc revolution paywave and mobile payments from today onwards?,btohqsg

Different opinion I guess. HSBC Revo used to be my main card until early this year. It was good intro to mile games for me.,btohqsg
hsbc revo well and alive for me. still many uses,btohqsg
Yea I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a card that needs to be cancelled given the zero AF,btohqsg
Im cancelling in the hope that I regain New to Bank status and HSBC releases a new product even superior (very slim chance I'm aware),btohqsg
Their sub is better than keeping HSBC revo. üòÜ,btohqsg
Then you need to make sure you redeem all your points first. I don‚Äôt think there will ever be a card remotely close to revo. Seeing that they focused on t1 and now live+. Seems like they are segregating between cashback and miles card,btohqsg
Im hoping this card is still as juiced as it is now one year down the road (again I doubt it),btohqsg
now is 8%   next year is 5%Get up to 8% cashback as follows:a. 5% cashback will be awarded to eligible cardholders on eligible purchases made with dining  shopping and entertainment and / or petrol merchantsb. An additional 3% cashback will be awarded to eligible cardholders on eligible purchases made with dining  shopping and / or entertainment merchants from 21 June 2024 to 31 December 2024This is subject to meeting the minimum spend of SGD600 in eligible purchases per month  for all 3 months in any calendar quarter.,btohqsg

I received a push notification on this. I read the tnc and it saysThe 5% Cash Rebate (‚ÄúCash Rebate‚Äù) is limited to the first 1 000 Cardmembers (‚ÄúEligible Cardmembers‚Äù) whomake a spend on their DBS/POSB Credit Card(s) each month.Does this mean just one dollar spent now is count the first 1000 card members?,btohqsg
Not true u just dont get bonus 3.6 miles  still get base 0.4 miles,btohqsg
Anyone familiar with Astrea 8 bond can advise on the liquidity? Do you need to keep it until the maturity date or can sell off earlier if needed. Really appreciate your thoughts üôèüôè,btohqsg
Now that amaze can use on Apple Pay  is it recommended to pass it through kris+ ?,btohqsg
Mainly used with crmc for non travel cat. If merchant accepts Kris+  I don't see why not,btohqsg
Possible to earn bonus if  use uob lady on Lazada   shopee etc ?if can what categories should I choose ?,btohqsg
These platforms have multiple mccs so might not code as eligible mcc.Qoo10/Lazada you can choose fashion but use it in the form of voucher from heymax with mcc 5311.,btohqsg
Ya I see heymax show 5311. But if I buy electronic  the MCC won't be 5311 ?,btohqsg
buy direct from platform  nobody will know the actual coded mcc.,btohqsg
if heymax voucher is your chosen route  then ocbc rewards is a better choice.,btohqsg
Icic. So is buy voucher from heymax  to get 5311 ?,btohqsg
how often does the hsbc ega have their bonus interest promos?,btohqsg
Just like to highlight if buy with lazada voucher  the total amt eligible for discount will drop if using coupon. So better take note. Also have alot of issue when need to do refund as code use cant be reissue i think,btohqsg
every month has new promo unless they choose to stop it,btohqsg
generally how much is the interest rate excluding the everyday+ 1%,btohqsg
oh yes. 100% agree on this. only use lazada voucher if item not applicable for vouchers (apple products and infant stage 1 2 powder as example)Qoo10 is fine as its a wallet system. refunds go back to wallet(qmoney).,btohqsg
If without bonus interest promo also is 0.05%,btohqsg
Standard base interest for accounts. Got some 0.03% base interest.,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt have to do anything for the promo interest right?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG  have u already get the 8% interest for the HSBC Fullerton SGD Cash Fund after 30 days?,btohqsg

Hey  is it possible for you to ping me directly? Need to understand what you mean? Thanks,btohqsg
Sorry  read till I confused.1) Correct me if I am wrong. You all pair AMAZE with Uob Kf  due to overseas spending?Understand if via Kris+ is 3mpd.2) But how about normal spending in local?  e.g normal dinning in restaurant  shopping / furniture @ ikea/ courts.. could use paywave without AMAZE with it and earn those normal 1.2 miles right?3) if online purchase other airline ticket (e.g Non Singapore airline) / hotel booking  we still have 1.2mpd also right?,btohqsg
Hi all  DBS woman‚Äôs world is 4mpd for online purchase (max $1.5k) and 1.2mpd for overseas purchase.Do you know if I charge air tix of usd$1.5k (ard sgd 2k)  which scenario does it get me:1Ô∏è‚É£ Sgd$1.5k @ 4mpd then the rest Sgd$500 @ 1.2mpdOr2Ô∏è‚É£ Sgd$2k @ 1.2mpd (overseas spend category),btohqsg

So you going to hit your 8k spend on the Gold machine?,btohqsg
Are you going to buy high sell low?,btohqsg
1) yes lower fx when using overseas2) for local spend  can use the card for dining without amaze. Amaze pairing is only required for purchase under shopping MCCs to convert it to online.3) yes get 1.2mpd but why.,btohqsg
But the machine has been there long time.. I don't think the prices they keep adjusting every week,btohqsg

hi sorry i‚Äôm a little confused after looking at the tncs  if i currently don‚Äôt have a hsbc ega account and apply for it on 17th July  deposit $60k of fresh funds from a non-hsbc (uob etc) acc on 19th July  do i still need to make 5 posted card transactions before 31 july? i have a hsbc travelone but not the ega debit card‚Ä¶ in my case would it qualify for 4.6%? there is no other steps to fulfil right? thanks!üôèüèª,btohqsg
Still need to have 5 transactions for the extra 1%  if not you only get 3.6%.,btohqsg
so to qualify for the 4.6% as a NEW hsbc ega customer  i would need to1) deposit >$2K from a non-hsbc (uob) account to the hsbc ega account  AND2) Make 5 x $1 bank transfers (to uob) from my hsbc ega account  OR 5 x $1 pay wave transactions using travelone card .only these 2 steps right?,btohqsg
Do note if you have any existing products with HSBC like credit cards  you will need to open the account at a branch,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution card already nerd contactless. So it that case I will use amex platinum charge card . That awards 10x membership points.. but going to be hard. As gold merchants most of them is min 1x points earn..,btohqsg
Yes. Easiest is just paynow 5 times out.,btohqsg
oh i see didn‚Äôt know that! ok thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Still to use hsbc revolution to earn the qualifying 4 % plus interest,btohqsg
could be paynow 5x to the same bank (non-hsbc) account?,btohqsg
yes. i actually set recurring trx to 5x transfer 1 dollar to my dbs acct,btohqsg
Thanks!! I read tnc and was confused,btohqsg
but since now is alrdy mid july  would it be ok if i register for the hsbc ega acc now  but only deposit fresh funds & do 5 transactions on 1 aug? would that qualify for 4.6% for my month of aug? cuz the tnc writes must register between 1-31 July but didn‚Äôt state fresh funds must be deposited the month the account was registered right? as the relevant period is until 31 aug‚Ä¶. sorry for the qns am new to all these savings promo and the tnc confuses me a little  thanks!!üôèüèª,btohqsg

Depend on the item cost  iphone have different price range  maybe u like to share the exact amount to get suitable advice,btohqsg
Where do u intend to buy it from? Platform  apple store or merchant store like courts etc,btohqsg
U can request on different card if at store  2k on uob vs  1.1k on uob pvv  1k on amaze with crmc. Spilt the payment,btohqsg
Any reason die die have to buy online? The item not available in retail store?,btohqsg
If upcoming new launch u can try citismrt for cashback rebate,btohqsg
Have to time nice nice to get ntb signup if like this.,btohqsg

Hi  can I know which is a good bank to do salary credit now? I am currently with SC and the rates has been adjusted recently so it is not as favorable. Besides  I wish to stop banking with SC.,btohqsg
Is this the highest? My friend is using UOB and I have an existing account with DBS already but not OCBC / UOB. Happy to create a new account just to credit sal if need be,btohqsg
Ocbc need coroporate while uob can self transfer that why ask u to clock to ocbc if it is real salary,btohqsg
"It is real salary  not sure what you meant by self transfer. You mean anyone can credit to UOB and term it as ""SAL"" and then you get bonus as well?",btohqsg
If I have home loan with DBS and can hit 2 transaction category including credit card spend  would DBS be a better choice?,btohqsg
Can I confirm? üòÖ replacing my card so I can‚Äôt try,btohqsg
Nvr heard of Mari bank‚Ä¶ seems like from Shopee‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the reason asked whether this bank cc is it genuine real one‚Ä¶ any good? Anyone applied before?,btohqsg
Maribank has been around for so long. Of coz it‚Äôs real? How to even have a fake credit card,btohqsg
Lol people dont bother to search through history,btohqsg
Maribank saving account is a good choice to grow small amount with decent interest and with no conditions attached.,btohqsg
amaze still cannot bind with apple id for Icloud?,btohqsg
Options for 6k spend is not alot. you can calculate if the miles is worth over the cashback amt.,btohqsg
The rewards come from using the credit card which otherwise you couldnt with giro.,btohqsg
How do I do that?could you share some pointers,btohqsg
First calc value of mile/value of mile card signup rewards and compare against of cashback/cashback card signup rewards.https://youtu.be/faKTziNGHGI,btohqsg

Hi all urgently need help.Can I ask if I use Kris+ app pair with amaze + uob KF. Do I get the 3mpd for uob KF? Since it's payment via Kris+ app? Just that it's proxy via Amaze.. anyone knows?,btohqsg
Don't use amaze. Most likely won't get 3mpd cuz it is based in transaction description.,btohqsg
No. Local spending at Audiohouse.. they have this Kris+ Audiohouse 2% vouchers.. I use UOB KF buy till it declined my txn  I need to use a new card.So I'm thinking of using Amaze to circumvent it. Is it possible?,btohqsg
goes like this  does it count?,btohqsg
This case is unique as most will just use naked UOB KF. Nobody knows how UOB check in the backend. Most likely not qualified as transaction is coded as AMAZE at the beginning.,btohqsg
You gotta pray mcc is correct then you will get acceleratated 1.8mpd later on.,btohqsg
Did u lock ur UOB KF or something? Don't see why Kris+ will block UOB KF itself.,btohqsg
Due to repeated purchase of vouchers perhaps.. that's what AH says..,btohqsg
But this requires SIA group spending of $800?,btohqsg
If I don't have it? Still can get? Haha,btohqsg
"do you expect any answer other than ""no""?",btohqsg
Haha thanks for ur time~ appreciate it,btohqsg
Hi sorry if this was asked before but for amaze card combo with mcr  does payment done through tapping with Google wallet count?,btohqsg

Hi  I just received this notification. Does this mean I can use my Amaze card linked with Citi rewards on my Applepay wallet?,btohqsg

Oops. Yeah it's the amaze card. Just wondering is it strictly online or tapping is ok too. I read somewhere the mode of payment matters too,btohqsg
The amaze card you can do whatever. Tap  swipe  contactless  online etc.,btohqsg
Amaze card I always tap on it.After I cross over 160k kris miles. To me miles doesn't matter much anymore . Transport I use hsbc t travel 1 card to tap even though only 1 miles earn.,btohqsg
So you converting to team cashback? Since you say miles don't matter anymore,btohqsg
No... just not so much focus 100% anymore.  85% enough,btohqsg
Expenses will continue to use citi pay all and card up to earn miles.Esp . Insurance .Sp bills,btohqsg
15% just concentrate more on 1 miles card...Such as hsbc 1 travel and Amex platinum charge card.,btohqsg
So 100% focus on miles? ü§£ Your math ain't mathing,btohqsg

Hi Chris and any UOB credit card strategists. Good morning! I am starting to implement the UOB quad cards (Solitare for Dining+Family  Krisflyer for travel  Prvimiles for Cardup and One card for utility bills  watsons and shopee) + OCBC365 (for patrol)  to replace all my other cards. But I realise I didn't have a 4mpd card to catch all for general retail in-store shopping such as fashion  popular book store  shoes  electronics....Which of my 5 cards is best for retail in store spending? Or really must i add on the amaze+crmc strategy? I tot I can terminate my maybank Horizon  HSBC Advance and citi premiermiles Mastercard...,btohqsg
What about UOB ppv for in store transactions?,btohqsg
Only 1.4 mpd. Was hoping to optimise with 4mpd since retail spending is not small amount for example buy a facial treatment package..,btohqsg
UOB preferred platinum visa my dear,btohqsg
General retail . You can try ocbc rewards card.I use it for watson   guardian  uniqolo   bata  retail shops. 6 miles awarded until dec,btohqsg
If you can spend above 1k  then uob visa signature (min spend 1k),btohqsg
Hmm.... I go study.... but means additional card. So really my current quad card is not yet optimising...,btohqsg
Ain't you asking for a 5th card anyway?,btohqsg
But one card already has minimum spending criteria.,btohqsg
Kris flyer uob. Is a strong card for transport   travel and dining.  Will get the 3 miles. You will get it unless you can guarantee to fly Sq 800 $ in 1 year.,btohqsg
I tot I maybe missed some 4mpd feature among one of the 4 cards. Ha...,btohqsg
Can I check the maybank platinum visa quarter is counted in calender month?,btohqsg
If I am uob hod for credit card. . I will push this card to fight against amex platinum card... and ask Kris flyer whether can status match and also work together with marriott bonvy programme.,btohqsg
You only have one 4mpd card and one 3mpd cards. If you want to chase miles  better focus than spreading it between cashback and miles.,btohqsg
Or which selective category for solitare card is 4mpd for retail shopping? Then I replace Family category with it and use One card for groceries.,btohqsg
That was my aim but couldn't find a 4mpd uob card that can catch all. So end up with One card as the default catch all.,btohqsg
Does krisflyer gives 3mpd for ALL online shopping? I was hoping this could be the unlimited miles catch all card but looks like it's not...,btohqsg
Haha .. now after revolution nerf hotel mcc.. next question what card to I use for 4 miles..Guys remember to use it before 31 Dec.,btohqsg
For hotel:lady/lady solitaire (travel category)dbs wwmc for onlineuob ppv for mobile contactlessuob visa signature for local conractless (min 1k in sgd)/ overseas (min S$1k in foreIgn currency),btohqsg
"It seems you need an additional card. The UOB preferred platinum visa appears to be what you are describing in that it gives 4mpd for mobile contactless/selected online for your ""catch all"" retail spending. PPV doesn't have min spend so it is ideal for your scenario since you are already heavily in the uob ecosystem for miles pooling",btohqsg
This I different from you.Travel and online shopping I use dbs woman card.Contactless.  Citi rewards with amazeHotel. Amex platinum card or citi premier miles.,btohqsg
1 more to add. Local retail. Ocbc rewards card.,btohqsg
Ok thanks bros. I go look harder at uob preferred platinum.,btohqsg
Yes. And it‚Äôs based on posted date. So do avoid last few days of the month.,btohqsg

UOB required $100 000 as incremental fund in tnc. MAB for June I assume is 0.10. So 100 000 - 0.10 = 99999.90 =/= 100 000. Do you want to take the risk and lose the bonus for 100 000 and instead get the bonus for 50 000 cos of 0.10?,btohqsg

From the TnC  I think it'd statement month. They really die die don't want to make it clear,btohqsg

PSA: DBS card giro even if you get your giro confirmation letter  take note DBS doesn‚Äôt follow the due date like other banks. Your giro confirmation letter needs to be issued before the credit card statement date. Had mine issued 2 weeks before due date and was surprised to find it didn‚Äôt debit. Technically it would take about 10-12 weeks for DBS cc giro.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  is citi rewards card + amaze still a good combo for daily food/transport/general spend?,btohqsg
This is true. Only way to confirm giro setup for cc is cc statement for that month. If statement says will be paid by giro  you are good. If not  manual pay first.,btohqsg
Private transport yes  public transport no. Gen spend for non travel category is good üëç,btohqsg
The other banks Citi  Maybank  SCB and UOB are ok. As long as you get the giro letter a few days before due date  you‚Äôre good. Takes about 3-5 weeks for giro to complete. DBS is the only exception at over 10-12 weeks  nearly 3 months.,btohqsg

Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
I remember the offer wrote max miles though? Can someone clarify?,btohqsg
Can you link the offer? Most likely from singsaver or something,btohqsg
15k Max miles is from singsaver  while 45k miles is from standard chartered,btohqsg
I should choose the 250 pay now plus 45k miles option instead right,btohqsg
Nothing to do with backup or not. Even if you have a spare pc but installed with the crowdstrike still will kena,btohqsg
Anyone here has had issues with their singsaver reward? Mine was supposed to be fulfilled at 90-120 days. It‚Äôs now been 135 days and they‚Äôre telling me to wait until end of September. Reward was first lodged in mid March. How can one file a complaint? CSO via emails are incompetent often confusing even which reward I‚Äôm asking.,btohqsg
It was instant for me. Max 5 mins.,btohqsg
Guys anyone knows why Instarem rate is so shit  I thought it‚Äôs supposed to give 1% back on foreign cunrrency spend,btohqsg
For reference real rate is about 5.39-5.40,btohqsg
With linked credit card  5.39/5.2827 = 2.03% FX fee which is about average. Now only gives 0.5% rebate in instapoints with 2000 points redemption.,btohqsg
Ahh thanks I was shocked because the another charge on the card itself overseas gave a better Fx Rate (12 000/2227.02= 5.388) but I assume this won‚Äôt be the final fee they will add on separate Dcc charges,btohqsg
Is it UOB? After transaction turns fron pending to posted  the actual amount will be shown.,btohqsg
