Bruh my school now reach python on a website,btohqsg
I learn because I wanted to make games when I was young,btohqsg
Everybody confuse af with the flowchart,btohqsg

actually is just a worse graphing calculator,btohqsg
rand has a working financial excel sheet calculator,btohqsg
There is a website online that shows every nsf fatality since 2000s but has not been updated in a while,btohqsg
That is where I learnt of a sg pilot that was killed in the us,btohqsg
True  nah but the website showed some of the more ‚Äúheavier ones‚Äù,btohqsg
This case was mentioned in the American news,btohqsg
My bad I meant military fatality,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall know the RSN had a major fatal incident,btohqsg
Back in the early 2000s . It led to the death of 4 serving sailors and sent a ship to the scrapyard,btohqsg
The sailor of the RSN ship was found at fault,btohqsg
the captain of the RSN vessel did not follow maritime protocol for the event of two ships on a crash course with each other,btohqsg
the vessel it struck  a container vessel followed protocol and turned the right direction,btohqsg
yes..turned the wrong direction and the rear of the ship got mounted by the container ship,btohqsg
killing 4 sailors  1 of them remained missing for weeks,btohqsg
Nothing could be done  the momment the ship was towed back to singapore...It was scrapped,btohqsg
oh no girl is another character,btohqsg
from sperm to pocoyo to mr jam and now this,btohqsg
wait can work output be negative,btohqsg
my bf stole my pocoyo sticker pack,btohqsg
Rip  funny thing is I see that sticker being used in other telegrams lol,btohqsg
a lot of ppl using it,btohqsg
this the link to the new ypt group we kinda accidentally deleted it lol,btohqsg
how do i do this question,btohqsg
Guys  could you help me find raw data from supermarkets? It's for a group project for data analysis and business modelling,btohqsg
i buy 6-12 tubs of acai every time i go to a supermarket,btohqsg
In any case just go statista lol,btohqsg
p sure nofutureofryan doesnt know anything,btohqsg
if he did id be worried,btohqsg
but i know how to look,btohqsg
Can i get into uni without amath,btohqsg
but no math courses for u,btohqsg
but if u taking alr dont drop,btohqsg
its so much easier than e math tf,btohqsg
emath is out to fk u up,btohqsg
am i supposed to self learn it,btohqsg
https://www.aceninja.sg/assets/files/fairprice-consultancy-report.pdfor maybe these type of reports,btohqsg
ya depends what course also.. end of day if you‚Äôre poly  the relevant course will teach you whatever is necessary to enter Uni.. and then for jc that one idk the rest can answer for you@silentvelocitygiving me flashbacks ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
err since you alr dropped den just leave it be.. if you go poly   you‚Äôll learn whatever is  necessary for Uni  considering u meet the course prereq.. then jc self explanatory la.. some course in uni got subject prerequisite for math  iirc like h2 math must get C and above I THINK ONLY AH,btohqsg
but bro if I‚Äôm being honest  just focus on your o levels  jc or poly. That‚Äôs all that matters rn,btohqsg
don‚Äôt care if need amath   can always private candidate,btohqsg
üòÉ thats what my ft said to me when i consulted abt post sec,btohqsg
yeah.. trust me your goals will change,btohqsg
before sec 4 i say iw go poly then halfway say wan jc then halfway just sticking to poly,btohqsg
if u intend to do engineering... u can skip basic math for poly,btohqsg
so really  just focus on o levels.. uni is far far away,btohqsg
i mean she dropped alr .. not as if thinking of dropping or not,btohqsg
err different ba.. whether can grasp the differentiation and integration then will be easy,btohqsg
Or else become like me.. a2 drop to b4 because mind  blank for ALL the integration qns,btohqsg
i saw my friend do graphs for amaths,btohqsg
that shit looked like someone forgot how to draw a straight line,btohqsg
integration kinda confusing at times especially when trigo is imvolved,btohqsg
actually i cld do the trigonometry one.. just that the NORMAL integration I think I just lazy as fuck so i didn‚Äôt bother to practise..,btohqsg
wah but so fucked up to think about it.. paper 1 80% .. paper 2 idk.. but lost around 20% la..,btohqsg
so u can do trigo integration but cant do the normal oneüíÄ,btohqsg
ya bro idk my brain funny one trust,btohqsg
usually trigo one is the one out to fk ppl one haha,btohqsg
anything with trigo is fking cancer,btohqsg
HAHA i only got the hang of trigo in august?,btohqsg
tot trigo is sec 4 topic,btohqsg
i think i need to get a tutor for physics,btohqsg
what engineering course u in? always see u need do thermo,btohqsg
wah i see u study im like ‚Ä¶ i honestly got nothing to study.. just complete projects..,btohqsg
tot chem eng more physics lol,btohqsg
wow the difference between engineering and business students,btohqsg
literally this sem its like engineering math  mass energy balance and thermodynamics and organic chem,btohqsg
material engineering they ask us remember metal structure we all sian alr,btohqsg
then this other like fundamental module,btohqsg
cannot imagine learning chem again haha,btohqsg
literally 3 of my modules are math,btohqsg
standard. engineering need alot of math,btohqsg
u just flip thru ur thermofluid notes,btohqsg
cfm plus chop will see alot of differentiation and integration,btohqsg
ur workdone formula also derive from integration one,btohqsg
is like a to f to z,btohqsg
idk what shes doing then i have to figure it out myself,btohqsg
i spent the whole day doing this,btohqsg
haha poly lecturers in a nutshell,btohqsg
i only finished one questions of my tutorial,btohqsg
in exam i think 1 hour for 3 qns only,btohqsg
and the equations get fking long,btohqsg
i gonna apply for extra time again lol,btohqsg
i might spent the whole duration on one question,btohqsg
yeah i had for o levels,btohqsg
and a shit ton of other stuff,btohqsg
especially when u have to find thru ur mistake and realise u copy wrong steam table value hahaha,btohqsg
my gpa gonna drop for sure,btohqsg
i also cmi for the smu thing,btohqsg
ppl this year not even gna be my batch,btohqsg
best way to network is club ngl,btohqsg
u meet some surprisingly high fliers,btohqsg
(as well as a fuck ton of useless degens but we live and we learn huh),btohqsg
nvm u get ur degree in social justice first,btohqsg
and join the social justice league,btohqsg
idk now everyone slandering nbs on reddit,btohqsg
then the intensity drop to 3au or some,btohqsg
same like jc poly either sacrifice one year of putting up with someone‚Äôs shit   or intense pressure for 2 years,btohqsg
HAHA but ofc la.. u telling Pulau ntu no guarantee hall I kms,btohqsg
I live with ghost also nicer,btohqsg
i got the impression that it is,btohqsg
im not gg either of them so not biased,btohqsg
i mean u sch central does it rly matter,btohqsg
i would rather come home late everyday,btohqsg
‚Ä¶ kuro u do know it‚Äôs normal right..,btohqsg
JUST dont be part of the problem and help where u can,btohqsg
but for girls its a worrying statistic ig,btohqsg
i heard ntu no social life,btohqsg
not sure how true it is but it checks out logically,btohqsg
some halls not bad but others loner halls,btohqsg
then i heard ntu is more wholesome like idk fkn,btohqsg
n nus is j drink n club,btohqsg
The worst accident you will ever see that happened in singapore,btohqsg

and they even said the cohort proceeding me is scheduled to have more,btohqsg
The module chair told us...the largest reason for ppl failing modules was not turning up,btohqsg
cause in rp  you Absent for 3 lessons...module fail alr,btohqsg
then on the 6th MC..also fail module,btohqsg
what if u sick 6 times,btohqsg
its fine ive got covid ill pass to everybody????,btohqsg
wait in a lvls do yall learn some thermodynamics,btohqsg
Retail and inventory and just data to input into spteadsheet,btohqsg
yea but i think what differs in rp is you can still advance to the next yr failing 4 modules,btohqsg
as seen by those two ppl with below 1 gpa,btohqsg
i think tp minimum is 1 or smth,btohqsg
r how is everyone here your friend,btohqsg
Idk cos everyone tags you or asks to club w you lol,btohqsg
how do i stop myself from pretending to be blind and skipping all the information in course packages,btohqsg

maybe i shld just let my downpes go along as late as possible,btohqsg
cuz now i have a small chance that i go project serve,btohqsg
and if i don't get project serve  just try n get memo that im not supposed to be combat fit,btohqsg
looks like my entire life is an illusion too,btohqsg
isnt there this conspiracy theory where ppl were saying that we are living in a stimulation,btohqsg
