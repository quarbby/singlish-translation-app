And I was referred to Heart centre by polyclinic,btohqsg
then Wats the point of insurance. if everyone otang,btohqsg
Cos I need to keep petrol cost low. Not I atasüòÇ,btohqsg
Only a few dollars after subsidies and medisave,btohqsg
This is very impt. Referrals help cut costs alot,btohqsg
Just that sometimes it takes a longer time to get the appt,btohqsg
Just walk in. Don't make appt,btohqsg
No worries. These I have enough. Now main issue is income for future. Thanks alot anyways,btohqsg
For any of u who don't have shield plan. Please ensure u and ur family has one,btohqsg
And now government hospitals really v good,btohqsg
No need to go private ones honestly.,btohqsg
As in get the referral appt for the hospital from poly,btohqsg
Yes this one may have to wait. But they will assess if ur condition is urgent. If urgent its quite fast,btohqsg
Now covid is better so waiting time also shortened.,btohqsg
Yes I also thinking of that. Also have breaks in between which I need.,btohqsg
U can try fathers day wkendüòÇ,btohqsg
But after that u will see a big difference of prices for the jobsüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I guess best way to find out is to get my hands dirty,btohqsg
Actually I also like the fact that llm is more physical cos I want to slowly build up my health thru exercise,btohqsg
Another reason I stuck to sitting in coffeeshopüòÇ,btohqsg
If admin job just sit there,btohqsg
My condition won't improve in long run,btohqsg
Llm also have to sit sometimes for period of timeüòÇ,btohqsg
Ya for me most impt is flexibility. Cos of family and also if I don't feel well I can stop for a while,btohqsg
If I get a full time job which is unlikely due to my circumstances. And I mc or medical appt. Sooner or later also ganna ÁÇíÈ±øÈ±º,btohqsg
He has to take it 1 job at a time. No stacking,btohqsg
Ya I just have to take it 1 at a time. Rest in between if needed and just take whatever earnings my body can take.,btohqsg
For me now is I can work 1 to 2 hours. Then maybe have some side effect. Then need to rest for a while. Then I can do 1 to 2 hours again.,btohqsg
That's y free lance job is the only choice,btohqsg
If tell a boss I work 1 to 2 hours. Then need to break 1 hour etc. I don't think the boss will accept.,btohqsg
I shld be able to manage this. Just take breaks in between.,btohqsg
Haha if I do like that end up i will get lalamove by ambulance to hospital. Lol.,btohqsg
Pls don't do it like that nxt time. Cos when u have to rush n during peak hr with bad traffic  there's ways risk of accident,btohqsg
Unless it's really majority same resto/mall n drop offs very very close proximity,btohqsg
But that time covid time. Traffic very very smooth so can do like that,btohqsg
Ko liao. Good night guys n rest well,btohqsg
Take note Ah. Heavy stuff  if you encounter - please watch your back; do NOT bend over to lift. You might be in your late 40s or 50s  we are no spring chicken anymore to recover fast.Once injured  this possibility of LLM income will be greatly affected.,btohqsg
