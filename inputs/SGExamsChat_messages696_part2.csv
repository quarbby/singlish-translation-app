I swear bio is worst lol,btohqsg
one of the girls in my class have autism,btohqsg
bio had things similar to geog,btohqsg
then after our pw lesson today one guy in her grp deadass came up to me begging for help,btohqsg
What is up with that boy,btohqsg
About her being in his group??,btohqsg
I’m confused coz my brother said his Cher let them decide their own groups,btohqsg
Long story short but he was one of the reasons why I had very bad mental health in jh,btohqsg
Ah ic  I think can check with ST whether there will be moderation or what not,btohqsg
Like she needs a group ultimately,btohqsg
Oh he is in the same class as u now also ah,btohqsg
Btw it is possible to get the tutor to change group,btohqsg
So u can try talking to your tutor about it,btohqsg
Autistic people have very specific talents,btohqsg
"Yea...I thought he was gonna take physics cause he took ""advance"" physics in jh (is like a dhs exclusive program  basically learn more jc stuff or extra coursework) ... he took bcme...",btohqsg
I know coz someone in my class did so,btohqsg
ngl idrc if he is in my group  is just that my friend told me he did nothing when she was in his group for some extracurricular activity,btohqsg
Ah ic but under pass fail  I dun think reporting and going through the hassle will do anything tbh,btohqsg
But tbh pass fail dun really affect the grading bah,btohqsg
but to be frank right  i dont think is appropriate to ask the teacher to change  because1. is not like he is chronic freeloader or drag down the group (*cough* that 1 girl which is a story for another day)2. my problem with him is a personal problem which im not comfortable to let other people irl know  and is a bit unprofessional to like let my own feelings affect my work,btohqsg
This one should be in sge tele hall of fame,btohqsg
But pw tho pass fail  it is like working with him for the enter year until November  so if he is gonna lead to ur mental health problems  then maybe better to try switching groups,btohqsg
i will see how it goes  since there are 5 guys in my fem majority class  the teacher say the 5 guys will be evenly split and its random grouping (which i think is cap cause someone told me they sort by olvl or ip gpa  and each group have at least 1 who got A for ip english or olvl el)   theres a 20% chance i will get him in my group  if i do is time to buy 4d/j,btohqsg
Bedok's legacy has inspired future nsfs who can potentially become ckws,btohqsg
Oh wah  i dunno how my cher gave the grps coz i was absent during the day he released the groups,btohqsg
I didnt know they take into acct the english grades to be fair,btohqsg
But tbh i dun think anyone in my grp was gd at eng,btohqsg
To those who are familiar with assassin’s creed  which notable figures in Singapore’s history do you think could be assassins or Templars?,btohqsg
I give u groundsheet  count all for me,btohqsg
Neh mind  i email ur oc,btohqsg
oh i heard that from a student not a teacher so i think it may differ from school to school plus it's not 100% accurate  so do take it with grain of salt,btohqsg
The person who failed English in my class got in same grp as someone who got A1,btohqsg
I think it depends on the tutors tbh,btohqsg
But i think the person who scored A in English in my grp trf to another grp,btohqsg
So my group no more A,btohqsg
How did u do tht makeup,btohqsg
Or u randomly send pic of a stranger,btohqsg
but the makeup looks rly clean,btohqsg
How did the person who failed English get into jc,btohqsg
Oh ya forgot this option existed,btohqsg
Redo the creation of the universe,btohqsg
It’s just like mtl E8 and below,btohqsg
Oh there is such a thing??,btohqsg
Is it as long as l1r5 qualify for jc,btohqsg
Eh u dun say…if it is like that im on the spectrum too,btohqsg
Coz that was what i did too ngl,btohqsg
Ok not the social interaction part but the part about studying ridiculously hard,btohqsg
But wdym stubborn nut in academic,btohqsg
