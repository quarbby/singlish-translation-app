"Honestly even the enthusiast market is split with people that are ""lazy to daily a manual"" and all the excuse come out",btohqsg
The romance of manual was destroyed for me when i daily a pickup for work,btohqsg
Clutch and stick are the same to me,btohqsg
I also drive my company lorry sometimes,btohqsg
"car and ""heavy vehicle"" different feel",btohqsg
Just where ur biting point is,btohqsg
i drive before lorry and van  very different feel,btohqsg
everytime after i drive lorry i come back drive my car,btohqsg
cos the lorry clutch travel really very far,btohqsg
end up always a very loud thud when i just got back into my car,btohqsg
plus lorry engine also different from car engine. diesel taking forever to get to 3k rpm,btohqsg
wanted that but see only 3 cylinder,btohqsg
wah my sec sch teacher used to drive qq in manual,btohqsg
i sat his car before in sec sch,btohqsg
i only rmb i sit in my part time work boss's legacy GT,btohqsg
the first time i sat in a turbo car in sec sch,btohqsg
need ask the hk bus sister,btohqsg
imagine full load... dunno can move anot,btohqsg
must be enjoyable A to B... not until very frustrating,btohqsg
hence why we all want cvt,btohqsg
buy liao cannot poke my backside alr,btohqsg
I am sorry but i have to disagree. I pretty much daily a manual van for a good chunk and i still enjoy driving manual. Hell i have been in 8hours+ jams and i am still enjoying everytime i drive my car. Its the interaction between the driver and car. Your ability to make the car behave the way you want.If you dont appreciate manuals especially for a driver's car. I think you are better off just parking your car. Cos the most important point is driving,btohqsg
I always say this also  you buy a manual car to change gear. So jams let you change more gear.If you buy a manual but want to cruise on NSHW 6th gear all the way  buy auto suan le,btohqsg
same idea as jam = ur roadtax more worth huh,btohqsg
i stress. somemore diy headlights to blind ppl,btohqsg
Hence why i jam 6 hour from KL to SG i also nv kaopei  also nv wished i was in an auto car once,btohqsg
It's okay  i also love CVT  we same same,btohqsg
When you are on a good piece of road. Manual is what you wanna have,btohqsg
You get to have a interaction,btohqsg
rev match downshift  engine brake into the corner,btohqsg
Very happy for you! How are u going to make me park my car though.,btohqsg
manual  u know whats going on with the car cos u are in control,btohqsg
think i cannot go next to him though. tried but the engine crying alr.,btohqsg
i just hate the feeling of i press upshift  the gb take awhile to do it  or dowan to do it,btohqsg
tats cvt... doesnt listen to u one,btohqsg
ppl ask me if my car ev. cannot hear the exhaust,btohqsg
wa manual fans alot leh here,btohqsg
You will do it yourself i guess. ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
we both appreciate manual alot one  we know how fulfilling manual cars can give.,btohqsg
dun use power steering also hor. more interaction,btohqsg
I did miss that level of control when on the b roads. During the other 99.99999%  i dont need it,btohqsg
And for 50% of that proportion i prefer not to have it,btohqsg
i got thought of deleting LOL,btohqsg
but ended up i fix my PS alr,btohqsg
so suan le just leave it,btohqsg
i was contemplating  remove PS pump or fix my pump,btohqsg
Delete email and return to fax,btohqsg
Precisely. Even actually during daily driving. A manual can be more fun too. I had a auto brz and felt it was very dreary but meanwhile i really enjoy my manual 86 day to day.,btohqsg
Wah so you from auto brz to manual 86 ah,btohqsg
My mx5 is also my 2nd mx5,btohqsg
